The solution proposed by proposers is to create so called \u201ccanonical smart contract\u201d that which will be used for exchange of whitelisted assets by their \u201ccanonical\u201d version that can be used in Cardano ecosystem. Unfortunately, the term \u201ccanonical\u201d is lacking clarity, as it was not elaborated nowhere in the text, whether it is just name created by proposers, or it actually reflects attribute of these assets. For better clarity, an example could have been used, because right now it is not very clear. The simples explanation I came up with is that user can trade wrapped tokens e.g. wrapped ADA for ADA in cardano ecosystem, because having wrapped ADA in Cardano ecosystem is not making sense. The proposers also state, that the amount of tokens that can be swapped using these canonical smart contracts will be limited.

When this project first went live it was a major milestone in the community, and the team continues to deliver. However, as noted in the proposal there are still some issues with the bridge, such that assets can be fractionalized through the porting process, which limits liquidity and makes for a poor user experience. \n\nThis new smart contract will allow users to use a canonical version of assets and in so doing reduce the fractionalization issue.

Risks were also identified, namely that for this kind of smart contract, very much attention must be paid to security.

A canonical bridge is created to collect all the assets locked at other cross-chain bridges. This proposal basically meets the criteria set by the challenge:\n1. New technical implementations connecting Cardano to other blockchains and vice versa (SDKs, APIs, bridges etc)\n2. Already successful projects expanding from other chains to Cardano\n3. Expansion of Cardano-based projects into other chains\nOverall, this is a very good solution for effective asset management in Defi. Despite some of the challenges that the proposal raises, I confuse about the effectiveness of this solution.\n1. Many bridges will move into a common bridge, which means one more intermediate bridge will be added. Increase 1 level of complexity for the level of assurance, avoiding asset loss.\n2. The management of accounts will be more complicated. Just as the proposer has given an example where the user is trying to \"open\" amount X but the standard demand has only a fraction of the amount X, it will fail.\nFrom the perspective of a regular Defi user, I would evaluate this solution as a potential risk to my assets.\nFrom there, we can see that the problem of this solution still revolves around the two main issues of cross-chain bridge protocols: security and the level of security for assets locked into the protocol. However, looking at the positive side, I still think this proposal is very interesting in terms of ideas when it comes to trading safety with efficiency in capital use. Maybe this proposal will have a good impact on the easygoing Defi user community and those who have confidence in the proposal implementation team.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The details plan of the proposal is quite sketchy, with only major milestones and lack of specific timelines. There are 6 work items listed and the implementation and completion time is 3 months (refer to budget breakdown). But the timelines for each specific task are not clearly stated by the proposer. At this point, the proposer should give timelines in monthly units so that he can better assess the feasibility of the proposal.\nBudget breakdown is divided into 4 parts as follows:\na) 50% development and deployment (3 months): $45000\nb) 30-40% audit: 27000-36000$\nc) 15% project management: 13500$\nd) 5% catalyst management: $4500\nI do not accept 3 costs b, c, d and assume cost b is 30%. Cost a) then in my opinion, the proposer should list in detail what the related work will include so that the voter can see more clearly. For example:\ndevelopment and deployment: 45000\n- Proof of concept / demo MVP: 5000\n- Implementation of canonical bridge connected to validators of Milkomeda: 20000\n- Open sourcing of codebase: 5000\n- Deployment to Milkomeda C1: 10000\nThe team that implements the proposal is a very popular team in the Cardano community.

However, so that the community can follow it transparently and clearly. It is recommended to provide a way to track such as checking at which source? maybe the community is quite familiar with Dcspark's github but within the scope of a proposal, the community still needs the relevant information outlined in the proposal. In addition, it is recommended to add specific timelines to create initiative for those performing audit activities.\nAccording to the proposal, the project will be successful when the correct deployment of the canonical bridge and the usage of at least one protocol in Milkomeda and one in Cardano for at least one of the major assets (like USDC) in the first month after deployment.

I can say the issue mentioned in this proposal is real. Moreover, no better challenge to address this issue other than Cross-Chain Collaboration! When doing a swap, I noticed that my transaction caused bigger price movement or higher slippage sometimes but sometimes not. And upon using different bridge, I found the price difference of the asset among bridges is quite significant, sometimes can be more than 1%. Yes, it is an arbitrage opportunity but is not ideal for normal users who wants a CEX-like user experience (UX) or newcomers/guest from other chains accustomed to the better UX in their home chain. To me, conclusively this proposal is a solid 5 due to its alignment with the challenge where it is submitted and the overall benefit of better performance of and experience in Cardano thus leading wider adoption and higher level of utilization.

I noticed that they are becoming more expert in inter-blockchain bridges solutions and currently this is their niche now. For voters who are new in Cardano, dcSpark consists of OG Cardano builders like Seba, Nic, and Rob who used to work for Emurgo, one of the founding entities of Cardano alongside Input Output Global (IOG) and Cardano Foundation. To check their track record, you can go to their website www.dcSpark.io and from there you can check and verify their track records and what they have been doing either in Github, Twitter, or LinkedIn. Product portfolio of the dcSpark includes Milkomeda itself as the first bridge solution from Cardano and Flint wallet, multi-chain focused, Web3 wallet. In addition to products and dApps, the founders are also active contributors in general Cardano community, be it through education contents and the development of tools and infrastructures necessary for the advancement Cardano ecosystem such as Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIP).\n\nRegarding the budget, I have calculated the hourly rates of each function by breaking down the badge and assuming 13-14 working weeks with conservative 40-hour working hours each week. The results are USD 43 for two developers, USD 26 for a project manager, USD 26 for each of two security auditors, and USD 8.5 for the general and administrative Catalyst management. I must say the rate is fair and comparable to other proposals submitted in Catalyst during this Fund 9. The proposer also stated that the team most likely do not need further or additional funding to deliver this solution for now. However, an improvement such as adding DAO feature to govern and curate the asset whitelist per bridge can be proposed and implemented in the future Catalyst funds. Plans with key milestones are also presented though it can be refined further relative to other similar proposals in Catalyst. For further understanding on technical aspects such as solution architecture and design implementation, the proposer has given a link to a Google doc detailing information above.\n\nLastly, I think the proposer should inform and educate that inter-blockchain bridge is inherently a quite risky infrastructure since many hacks happened at this point of failure so far. One of the most recent and significant accident happened is Horizon bridge exploit in Harmony One blockchain costing USD 100 million. Although for now, the proposer had addressed and explained that the security risk in the proposal implementation itself is minimal and they are trying to prevent and mitigate it with high-assurance and quality coding practice and contracting more than one high-quality security auditors to double check the works.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer mentioned that the development and deployment of the proposed solution to asset fractionalization will be delivered in 3 months which is fair and honestly quite fast for me and I will take that as a win for the Cardano community.

Proposer also mentioned that at least one protocol in Milkomeda and one in Cardano using the bridge for at least one major asset e.g. USDC in the first month after deployment. I think this metric is fair since USDC itself is already an asset of significant market value as the only fiat stablecoin that can be used in Cardano without using centralized exchange (CEX).\n\nI believe dcSpark can also mention utilizing their social media such as Twitter, Medium, and Discord for regular updates to interested audience.
