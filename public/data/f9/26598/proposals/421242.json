Support our research work in Fund 9 as in Fund 6, 7 and 8. Comparative cross chain research is lacking.", "f6_no_assessments": 4, "f6_rating": 4.5, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1392, "q0": "Yes this proposal effectively addresses the challenge by exploring alignment between blockchain grant/funding programs (like Catalyst) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As the SDGs are blockchain agnostic and apply more broadly than tech, there is likely a significant opportunity to link our efforts on Cardano to other chains seeking to address these same global goals. \n\nThe team clearly has thought their proposal through and does an excellent job framing their exploratory research, not necessarily as a ground breaking advances, but instead a check on where we are at and how we are doing. The more we can identify our common missions across chains will certainly help reduce the silos we often find ourselves in. \n\nOne thing that I think could make the project even stronger would be to submit the final reports and findings to the UN itself. Perhaps there could be a way to link the community's efforts to the broader UN network. While not necessary for the proposal itself, there is likely much good that could come from expanding our reach into these well established entities. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nThe team behind this project is made up of a group of strong community leaders from a variety of different projects. Each project listed has an excellent track record of delivering value to the Cardano community while being leaders and driving change. For these reasons, I am totally confident in the team's ability to succeed. \n\nAnother strong feature of this proposal is that they have a very clear plan and path to execute it. The proposal consists of some basic research that assess the scope and depth of alignment between funded Catalyst proposals and the SDGs. Since they have been funded previously for this work and this project is a mere continuation into F9, there is also a strong likelihood of success. \n\nOn a different note, and not something to mark down for, but I would have liked to see some of the questions that will be included in the survey to proposers. As is currently the case, the SDG section of the proposal template is a nice addition but it is too broad. Often teams simply list the SDGs they are targeting but offer no evidence of how their project specifically would reach it. Perhaps providing a better explanation of what is included and how this section could be filled out, could also be a lesson learned from the research. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal. \n\nOne thing that inspires confidence in the ability to audit the proposal is that all the findings will be open source and freely available on the team's website. This means that voters and community members both in and out of Cardano will be able to follow up on how the team is doing, and by extension how Cardano is doing to meet the SDGs. This type of approach is welcome in Cardano and will be the end goal for most projects, and the protocol as a whole. By committing to this approach now, the team is portraying their commitment to this objective. \n\nAs mentioned above, the team has an excellent track record of being funded and delivering on their items. They have a very useful and engaging website that will be used to track all of their indicators. One thing that could be strengthened here is more granularity around which chains they plan to work with. While they list \"other chains\" several times more specifics would help demystify this section. However, they do list gitcoin as their first volley so perhaps this is enough. \n\nOverall, this is an excellent proposal and I wish the team best of luck in the voting stage.

But why? Why do we want to connect SDGs with UN framework? (with respect to the challenge setting). This is not very clear, and if so, it is not emphasized and from my perspective, the proposal lacks clarity. Nonetheless, the proposal aims to perform an analysis of all funded proposals at the end of F9, and deliver PPT + article where the results of this analysis will be displayed. I believe, that it will include some charts showing how many proposals are solving SDGs and which SDG in particular, and as I came to understanding, it will be an information source for public or stakeholders. I must say, that I am not really sure how is this aligned with the cross-chain collaboration \u2013 yes, it can possibly attract new people who are very initiative when talking about SDGs, but other than that, I see it more as a research, and I did not find any supporting information, how this will create new, or enhance current cross-chain partnerships directly. In the proposal, it is also stated that the team is currently exploring a possibility to perform the same comparative analysis within Gitcoin grants or that possible collaboration is in play with other researchers from another chain, but even if performed, there is no supporting information what impact it will bring on Cardano, with respect to the challenge goal. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The roadmap is from September \u2013 December, and the first three months are focused on revision of all funded F9 proposals, and then during November/December to summarize results in public database, prepare the paper PPT and share the results in different media. The requested budget is 13k USD, but expected workload (time spent) is not disclosed. It is not clear how much time is expected for anything through paper to ppt, project management or data collection. I think it is important to state, that they are asking 4,5k for F9 research and another 4,5k for another chain/s comparative analysis, but another chain analysis is not discussed in more details. It is not clear whether they will perform it after F9, or simultaneously, or what chains are in play. The team is composed of four people, with their bio provided and linked in profiles. Based on this information, I believe that the team has the required skills for performing such analysis and present their results. Star down, because we do not know the time donation (how much time it takes to perform it) + budget is containing items that are not described in the roadmap.

Nevertheless, the results of the analyses will be published on public channels, which we can verify at the very end of the roadmap. Also, the proposer state that the success of the proposal is to have qualitative and quantitative analyses of F9 + another chain, but since there is no plan to perform the analysis of the another chain, we can not really keep the track with it.

This project helps the ecosystem grow in the NGO and similar organizations' space. Plus, it shows the value and impact of our projects in real life and advocates for the importance of crypto indirectly.  As mentioned, the project has a global impact since its analysis is done under the UN sustainable development goals and its ability to scale is paramount to its ability to create a larger framework of analysis where multiple chains and organizations are involved which is what this proposal is about.

Furthermore, The people behind the project are experts in their fields and have a long resume to speak for them. The budget presented by the team is as organized and as detailed as always. The team also proposes a timeframe including a structured roadmap that sets expectations and goals to be achieved. The only risk mentioned is currency volatility which will affect the funding.

The detailed budget presented also shows the team's exact spending which shows their transparency. The delivery date is not mentioned explicitly since it highly depends on the analysis being done. The team also sets some goals to be achieved from this research like the comparison to other chain and further collaboration with similar organization for better insights into the community.

It greatly addresses the challenge as it is oriented in a cross-chain collaboration with projects like Cardano4Climate, Blockchain4Good Collective, Sustainable ADA and many more, some even based on the Project Catalyst concept (Catalyst School) and i think that this team has a lot to offer on this field, the cross-chain communication.

It is also quite reasonable and does not exceed any limits given the fact that the team members of this proposal have been funded many times before and could have asked more, given they are trusted and experienced professionals.
