The aim of this proposal is to create such organism \u2013 different HUBs collaborating, while spreading the vision of Cardano. The reason why it is not currently a \u201cthing\u201d, the proposer state that there are differences between communities that are limiting these collaboration to emerge itself. The idea is to start with 5 community hubs, while these will be operating autonomously. These 5 hubs will be hosted in Argentina, Bogota, Caracas, USA and Chile. From these 5 founding HUBs, it is expected that they will grow on a local scale, as well as maintaining cooperation between each other. The proposal is requesting funds to launch these 5 HUBs and provide them resources they need. This solution is not technical, but rather focusing on human cooperation, forming the community and creating the communication channel. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap is set to 4 months, where only a high level points are stated \u2013 1. Month Hub organizing and promotion, 2-3month \u2013 1st event held, 4 month \u2013 2nd event held. The reason why there are no details, is because each HUB will work autonomously and the proposer will just set it up. Regarding the budget, the requested amount is 30 250 USD, where 10k is for 5 x HUB referents compensation, 17,5k is for even costs/hub x 2 events, and the remaining amount is for emergencies, or unexpected costs. Regarding the team, currently there are 8 team members, most of them I am familiar as cardano community active members, and linked in profiles are also provided. To consider their skill and experience, since the solution is not requiring any hard skill, I am confident that they can deliver the product. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The problem (lack of cooperation and communication between communities) and solution (to create autonomous hubs) is logical and reasonable. The metrics which proposer decided to track regarding the progress are events organized, social media engagements, gitbook for tracking community activities, funds management (transactions to be public), and to have a coordinated meeting to report on the progress. KPIs to be tracked are the number of discord members, HUB members, atendess to event and Latam TH, also youtube engagement. The proposal is also containing a specific figures, which they will try to reach, e.g. 600 discord members or 1 000 twitter followers. It is unclear to me whether these numbers are the total number on these platforms, or additional newcomers as a result of this proposal. But overall, the proposal can be tracked. What I am missing, since we are talking about cross-chain collaboration, how would be able to track, whether this proposal contributed to the challenge goal, and actually how many different blockchain members end up cooperating as a result of the proposal.

However, rather than competing with these other blockchains, the proposers are taking a collaborative approach and identifying ways to work together, breaking down silos in this region. \n\nAnother very strong impact indicator of this proposal is the ability for the LATAM community to meet and participate in their own languages. This is important as currently most things are in English and this makes them inaccessible to many locals who have not had the opportunity to learn English. Regardless of which chain they use, these communities should be welcomed and encouraged to participate in their language of choice to make Cardano truly global. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented, it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nFirst off, the track record of the LATAM Town Hall group speaks for itself. The team members represent key players in this community who have been supporting Cardano and community development since the early days of the protocol, and very actively in Catalyst. There is no doubt in my mind that they would deliver an exemplary product through this proposal as well. \n\nSecond, the plan (to host 2 events across the 5 LATAM/USA Region over 4 months) is very reasonable has already been shown to be successful. They already have the Buenos Aires hub up and running with great success. Extrapolating their experience to a broader and more diverse group of regions/areas will likely be a simple process with a lot of the hard challenges already worked out . \n\nLastly, given the potential impact of this proposal on the LATAM community the budget is very modest. Paying a minimal amount to the organizers of each hub, the majority of the budget will go into the events themselves. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. \n\nAnytime a project decides to be open source by default, the community can have confidence that the team is open to public feedback and scrutiny. The use of github allows any community member to go in and check the quality of the work, and track whether the team is achieving what they set out to. \n\nHowever, the team doesn't stop there. They provide an excellent breakdown of their KPIs and success measures, which are perfectly aligned whereby the KPIs will actually be used to determine whether the success measures were met; something that does not occur across many proposals. \n\nThe reason why I am not giving 5/5 here is due to the lack of details around the events themselves. I realize that the budget will be spent according to each of the event's needs but providing some guidance on what the expected expenditures are would be helpful. Will you provide invoices and/or receipts for services rendered? Will you use the swarm treasury to manage these funds? A bit more detail here would get that extra star, but overall excellent work and I look forward to the result of this proposal should it be funded.

The idea is to create some Hubs so that members from Latin America can interact and collaborate with projects in a more organic way, the LATAM group informs that it has done this same idea with some groups and some projects, and it has worked very well. The need to build bridges between different communities is argued. In theory everything is great, but in addition to the lack of specificity about the contents that will be raised here, two other questions came to me: 1) the proposal would fit much better in the hubs challenge, it is not emphasized here how the project would specifically contribute to attracts new blockchains to work together with Cardano; 2) the proponents speak of Latin America, but one of the hubs would be in the United States and none are based in Brazil. This seems a little confusing to me.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Unfortunately the script is very poor in detail. We don't know much about what would happen each month, the information is only quoted in an extremely short way, not explained properly. It would be necessary for us to know how the hubs would organize themselves, what would happen in the face-to-face meetings, etc. The asking money is also explained in a very basic way, why would each event cost 1750 dollars? How would that money be distributed? The team is presented a little unbalanced, we know a lot more about some professionals than others. For example, Alex attaches a short bio, but Juan does not, just his linkedin profile. It would be important to have approximately the same amount of information about each. I would also like a better definition of the roles that each one would play in achieving this project.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The auditability of progress is great.

Regarding success, most of the suggested data is numerical (\u201cHub groups of at least 400 people + At least 200 participants in Hub events + At least 80 participants in LATAM Townhall\u201d, etc). It would be more appropriate if we also knew qualitative information, such as how these hubs would have fostered the emergence of projects between Cardano and other blockchains.
