This is exactly in line with the challenge and is an excellent approach. \n\nA strong selling feature of this approach is that it focuses on what brings us together as chains, rather than what divides us. This is important given all the insanity that is in the crypto space. This approach would definitely go far to reduce the maximalism of the different chains and potentially inspire many different groups to work together. \n\nAnother strong feature about this proposal is that it can be easily replicated. If successful, the team would be able to continue to explore a variety of chains at once, or inspire their community to reach out on their own. This could further drive the impact and deliver real value for Cardano. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nFirst off, Innovatio is already well established in the Cardano community and has received several rounds of funding. I really appreciated that not only did they link to the proposals that were funded, they also showed the percentages of how much was completed. The workload appears completely reasonable to add on to their existing projects. \n\nSecond, Mauro and Juan Pablo are active community members and participate many different fora to share their thoughts, which are insightful and provide a unique perspective. It is certain that should they be funded again that they will continue to lead their larger teams to success. \n\nLastly, the budget appears to be off in that they decided to increase the community leader's labour and content redaction for four months but have them listed at three months. At first this threw me off and I was going to mark it down but it is likely a simple mistake. I'd maybe just encourage the proposers to do a final scrub by a couple different sets of eyes to catch these mistakes.

While they do an excellent job of clearly articulating their KPIs in a measurable way (# of members, # of publications...) they don't set themselves any real thresholds to reach. To me this is a bit of a let down because it will be impossible for the community to know if the project succeeded and when. \n\nI appreciate the team wants to see the expansion of knowledge, projects, and synergies across these other blockchain communities and Cardano, but what does success look like? While they envision multiple members of the aforementioned blockchains exchanging knowledge, thoughts, views, philosophies, etc, what do the exchanges include? Is a conversation enough? Is 3 collabs enough? This type of information is necessary for auditing whether the project was a success or not. \n\nOverall excellent proposal and I look forward to the results, however, just shy of 5s across the board due to the lack of measurable success indicators.

Solidity developers and entrepreneurs are not attracted to Cardano smart contract technology. That was the problem the team identified that needed to be solved. And they have a specific solution that is to inform, and even train entrepreneurs and developers to know more about Cardano, I'm sure this adds value to the Cardano ecosystem and can scale to address future challenges. More than that, it benefits many other blockchains as well (as long as that blockchain is capable of partnering with the Cardano blockchain). The essence of the proposal is to seek to promote cooperation and interoperability among the major blockchains in the ecosystem. I understand the team is trying to link people who use programming languages \u200b\u200bother than Haskell/Plutus who know Cardano, who knows Haskell/Plutus. I can see this proposal as a bridge between the \"Solidity\" team and the \"Haskell\" team, bringing people who didn't know Cardano before to now to know about Cardano. That is a prerequisite for cross-chain cooperation. Therefore, I appreciate the impact of this proposal. I am very interested in this proposal because of the possibilities it can bring. I vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the detailed budget breakdown, the budget listed by the team consists of different items that are relevant to the goal but appear to be poorly presented. On what basis can the team explain on what basis the team claims that the cost of items is that much? Team members are all experienced people working with Catalyst from Fund 3, who know programming languages, and blockchain. This is quite favorable for the team's credibility and the feasibility of the proposal. I did open the file the team cited to see more of the team members' identities, but when I opened it I saw nothing but three lines of text (not in English). Hopefully, the team will review to see if there is any confusion here or not? This leaves me a little disappointed in the transparency and feasibility of the proposal. I would like to ask further that in addition to waiting for funding from the Catalyst Fund, is the team funded from other sources of organizations? If Catalyst has not yet been funded in Fund 9, will the team continue to implement the proposal? I ask this question because I want to further verify the feasibility of the proposal through the budget.\nAbout the plan and how to do it: Relatively clear in a certain order. This is understandable because the team is a collection of people who have experience in organizing the implementation and especially when the proposed implementation has been approved in Fund 6 and several other times.\nIn terms of resources needed for implementation, I temporarily divided it into two main resources, which are financial resources (mentioned in the above budget) and necessary human resources for implementation. offer. With the current people, I believe the feasibility of the proposal will be successfully implemented. However, there is a detail shared by the team that some members are also working on another proposal parallel to this proposal at Fund 9. I would like to ask if this affects the quality of work in this proposal. Is it reduced due to scattered human resources? According to my contribution, the team was able to further demonstrate to the community that even though members are implementing another proposal, human resources are still 100% guaranteed for the successful implementation of this proposal. It is a great way to create more trust in the community and increase the feasibility of the proposal.\nIn terms of technical aspects applied in the proposal. I understand that introducing Haskell to the Solidity community is not an easy job. It requires a high level of technical knowledge, even knowing both Solidity and Haskell programming languages. I can trust this in the team because the team has members with full technical knowledge, even though they know both programming languages \u200b\u200blike I just mentioned. In addition to other skills related to communication and training, I believe that the team will do very well when implementing the technical and technological aspects of the proposed implementation.\nThe team correctly stated that the risk factor here is that the cryptocurrency market is going down, leading to a decrease in the community's interest in the cryptocurrency and blockchain market. The team made a strong effort to identify solutions to address the risk challenge. I would like to comment on another possible risk which is Ada slippage, this is what some teams have encountered in Fund 7 and Fund 8 when Ada lost value compared to before. resulting in a decrease in the project funding budget. Therefore, I advise the team to carefully consider the problem of Ada's price slippage to have the requirements and balance the budget accordingly, to avoid a budget shortage that makes it difficult to make suggestions. If the team needs more funding, come up with a verifiable plan.\nJust now are my opinions on the feasibility of the proposal, hope the team will consider and consider my questions and comments as a positive contribution to the proposal to be more and more perfect. . I agree with the feasibility, but advise the team to seriously review the issues I have raised. I vote 4 stars.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I agree with the way the team presents the roadmap and the milestones (the team has attached specific months of the year to the goals to be accomplished). That is the milestone, the roadmap that every community wants to evaluate because it is convenient for them to evaluate and verify. I see not many proposals to do this, thereby demonstrating the thoroughness of the team's roadmap. This has made it easy for the community to determine the transparency and auditability of the proposal. The professionalism of the team is also reflected in the very orderly work order. The proposal is well written and organized, has clear intentions, and good methodology.\nIt's a pity that I didn't see the KPI, we all know KPI plays an important role in the audit. I advise the team to add KPIs as soon as possible to improve transparency and auditability. In return, key metrics have been stated with the following criteria: Number of members, number of publications, number of participants, etc... The team can further perfect key metrics when attaching numbers to it. specific - to me, it's great to conduct an audit.\nThe team defined proposal success as expanding reach, expanding knowledge of projects, building bridges, etc... I agree with that definition of success.\nThe problems in the whole proposal were clearly and easily described by the team, along with the appropriate solution.
