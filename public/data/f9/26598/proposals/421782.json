In terms of budget, they provided detail break down starting from community management until the community event cost. The proposal also included the timeline/key milestones. Nevertheless, the team could improve it by providing more detail target for each month instead of every quarter (for example, in August instead of Q3/Q4).

The Treasury Guild also provided transparency of the usage of the fund via GitBook, so the community could check where the fund actually used if needed. It goes without saying that a good project needs a good metrics to be measured with. This proposal from Catalyst Swarm still lacks key metrics that is measurable to be compared with. Adding key metric such as how many collaborations project that will come out from this proposal will greatly help community to audit the proposal in the end, instead of only saying that the success for this project would be a well-established and growing collaboration between the Cardano & SingularityNET communities.

By building connections between the very active Cardano Catalyst community and the up and coming SNet community, this proposal has the potential to break down existing silos and allow teams to maximize their potential. \n\nAs an active member of Swarm and Singularity Net communities, I have witnessed this relationship develop organically. By formalizing and standardizing engagement, funded through Catalyst, more community members will be invited and have the opportunity to participate, while being rewarded in both ADA and AGIX (SNet's token). \n\nIf funded, there is no doubt in my mind that this proposal will have an excellent impact overall.
