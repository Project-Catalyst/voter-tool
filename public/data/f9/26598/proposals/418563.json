I realize that the team split the proposals to mitigate the risk of not getting funding but it feels very last minute and rushed. \n\nBesides developing one module that will cover \"ocean faring technlologies on Cardano\" I fail to see how the other module fits in with the cross chain collaboration. \n\nAs mentioned in their other submission: I think that this proposal is more suited to the DAO challenge given it's primary focus on setting up structures for individuals to work together in a decentralized way, rather than necessarily addressing cross chain collaboration. Even in light of this, I still think the proposal has the potential to successfully impact the Cardano community, with the potential of bringing in other chains. I just can't give full marks as the fit is more tangential than direct.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nThe proposal and plan is comprehensive and the team explains essentially every single aspect of their intentions and expectations. While maybe a bit long for the average person, reading through the proposal makes it painstakingly clear that the team is prepared and equipped to deliver. I would encourage the team though to perhaps consider the readability of the proposal in future rounds. As mentioned in the previous section, I also strongly advise against copying and pasting verbatim. \n\nThe breakdown of deliverable, specific activities, expected outcomes, and the groups/individuals for each of the components in the plan really removes any guess work that readers would need to do. The team clearly has a broad overall vision and outlines their path for how they will achieve it. Given the work outlined, the budget feels very fair. It is obvious that they are already doing a lot of the work and that the requested funds will be spent on progressing their efforts even further. \n\nThe reason why I am taking of a mark here is the team has simply duplicated the same budget for marketing but it is unclear why they would need marketing in both proposals when it would be conducted through the same channels, and likely the same people. Would it not be just as easy to add one more module to existing promotions or does it really require another full budget? I am skeptical here given the duplication and the lack of strong justification for needing it a second time. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Again, given as there is almost no difference between this proposal and the other one submitted, particularly as it relates to the auditing component, I will provide the same score and rationale. \n\nYes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. As I've stated in other assessments, any project that commits to being open source by default can give the community assurances that they will have the opportunity to provide input and feedback to the proposers, should they chose to. This aligns with the broad goal of Cardano, and the Cardano Community, which is to be a major open source project. \n\nThe team also already has a variety of products and tools that the community can engage with and help guide the process overall. Since the plan and budget are so detailed there is no need to guess how the funds will be spent and what the community can expect for them. The granularity of each section and budget item gives ample confidence in the ability to track the project's success. \n\nOne thing that may be challenging for the team is to report on all of the measures and indicators listed, however, given the size of their team this may ne a non issue. I did find it a bit difficult to not get overwhelmed by all of the different auditability components so would encourage the team to be a bit more succinct with their writing. However, all the information is there and so no points removed. \n\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2233", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 4, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4319, "q0": "This proposal fits well in the challenge, has a huge positive potential impact on the whole community, and is designed to scale in case of need.\n\nThis proposal fits well in the challenge, as it aims to increase interoperability, communication and coordination between chains by means of publishing curated documentation and research.\n\nThe proposal leverages collective intelligence for providing relevant and updated technical cross-chain information, resulting in spreading knowledge, improving the quality of projects, lowering barriers, and increasing the outreach of Cardano and Catalyst.

Other technologies in the DAO space. To address the issue of detailed, up-to-date information on cross-chain solutions, DAO-enabled tools, and other hard-to-reach technologies. The opportunity to learn from others and collaborate never materializes. Proposed impact on the challenge posed. I think the proposal was detailed and richly described. The proposed group is a decentralized global organization (LFF), building technologies, enabling collective intelligence. Recommended to be experienced in: Littlefish Vault. Cross-chain technology is being built to create a multi-chain future. Builders must know what is happening in the space, seeking the cooperation necessary to make the future a reality. What is needed is a gateway to in-depth and up-to-date information. The team has a holistic vision, and is building on its knowledge, and is primarily active in the DAO-enabled tool space. Additionally, the team will share its findings from Ocean Map during community meetings and in other Catalyst communities. It is very positive that the author of the proposal proposed the measures right from the impact analysis of the proposal. It proves that the author has precise goals, knows what he will do, how to achieve the ultimate goal of project success. Given the team's capabilities, the proposed team also recognizes possible risks. At the same time, there are specific and positive solutions to reduce risks when the proposal is implemented.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the plan of the proposal, the author provides us with background information to evaluate this section. The first is about the roadmap; the group stated that the original document could be any study, report or study that the group, conducted at the LFF. Curated resources are articles, videos, research, reports, etc. made by others, classified and listed on the basis of the group's knowledge. The proposed team outlined a plan for September, December and February. Milestones are established across the activity sections. The team also provides a timetable, specific and coherent with each work to be done, which is analyzed and explained in depth such as: Module 1: Ocenfaring Technology; Module 2: The Ocean Map; Module 3: Marketing. In the densely presented sections, the work to be done, time, space, milestones and delivery quantities... We have the information we need about the proposal's plan, to measure it. It is very possible to measure the viability of the project. Next is the budget. The proposal requires a budget of $40,800. Less than 10% of total challenge budget. In my opinion, the value requested is quite reasonable given the complexity and time of the project. The team explained in great detail about each budget range in the project: Module budget; LFF Action Fund; Administrator and other jobs. At the same time, the team provided a budget table with budgets broken down, and allocated to each very specific job, estimated hourly, per job. The budget is explained deeply and transparently, increasing the sustainability of the project. Finally, about the team of team members. We are told this proposal is run by LFF's THC team. THC: expert googlers, tech experts and quick learners. We know the members are all people with the right skills and experience to do the work on the project. At the same time, the author also provides many text presentations about each member, and attaches the link of the members, so that we know more about the history and experience of the members that the proposal presented. . In general, the plan of the proposal is very good, the budget is transparent and the members are skilled and experienced, increasing the feasibility of the proposal. Proposal is highly feasible.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Incredibly, the testability of the project is very good. The team cares a lot about this part of the proposal. The team was informative and very well explained. The team will update the main Obsidian progress, sharing the learning with the Catalyst community. We can see the progress of the project in the Miro tool: it is very interesting, allowing the integration, of a variety, of linked assets, videos, spreadsheets, images, artboards and text\u2026.Discord : Users can communicate by voice calls, video calls, text messages, media and files in private chats or as part of a community. This is a good place for us to find updates and daily activities. That means we can track in many ways how the project's phases will develop, and we know what value it will bring to the community. Since we are provided with a lot of information, I believe that information is complete and satisfactory has been established. I think, if funded, the proposal will be audited from the very beginning. And the final product is what is expected, the success of this project: building applications that the community loves; A strong community of creators and builders; Littlefish Vault is the knowledge hub for decentralized organizations in Cardano Space; A technologically competent organization: LFF. Besides that. Recommend well planned. Detailed step-by-step roadmaps and easily audited budgets, experienced team members and specialized skills, power the project's sustainable success.

In today\u2019s world, the mechanisms we use to earn income are outdated and suboptimal. They limit autonomy within the workspace and represent a costly trade-off between financial stability and personal growth aspirations. Well, littlefish wants to start afresh with a model that stimulates individual leadership and initiative, asynchronous work, voluntary participation and a constantly evolving landscape. \n\nLittlefish have chosen the distributed ledger technology to set up camp because it can boost ideas like anything we have seen before, and they have chosen Cardano in particular due to its research focused ethos and the fact that Catalyst was the spark behind the idea rolling down the hill. As a personal note, I add that Cardano was an excellent choice also due to low transaction fees, best suited for such a project, but more details on this in the following section. \n\nTo fully understand their value proposition you have to visit their website and read the white paper. They have a fresh style, they keep all the information simple, easy to understand and it is complemented by very informative charts and diagrams. This assessment cannot really do justice to all their ideas, but here is the nutshell: the functioning model is built around the user (little fish) who is part of a wider entity (the colony). Littlefish are of course economic actors wishing to maximize their utility, while the colonies are created around a common goal / idea / task / cause / etc. The littlefish performs actions, and these actions are treated as an economic goods, thus carrying value and can be exchanged, or rather sold by the little fish. Another key feature of the model is a revenue sharing mechanism between the fish and the colony, complemented by a reward aging characteristic to incentivise fresh action over inactivity.   \n\nWhy are littlefish asking for funding? Because they want to document, curate and maintain an up to date database with information relevant to cross chain technologies. Remember, the aim of the challenge here is to create connections between blockchain communities and to foster collaboration, and in order to do that you need information, which is very powerful, and this is exactly what this proposal aims to deliver. This research, if performed effectively, can foster greater collaboration down the road when community members take notice of such a database and use it to identify tools, resources and possible partners for cross chain collaborations. So I believe we have a good fit with the challenge here. \n\nEverything within this proposal is a testament to the team\u2019s rigorous process, no-nonsense approach of explaining their thinking and of course. Moreover, if Catalyst would ever implement a sixth star, littlefish would be a prime candidate to receive one. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Let\u2019s talk about the team first of all (all of them Turkey-based, extensive systems administration expertise). You can search through the Fund 9 proposals high and low, it\u2019s unlikely to find a better example of how a team presentation should look like. Each main team member presents him/herself in a few paragraphs, and it is all complemented by Linkedin profiles. Each member's presentation ends with highlighting the actual modules on which each member will focus, thus making the reader\u2019s job effortless when trying to make connections throughout the text. I am extremely impressed by their meticulous approach. \n\nFor this proposal, their deliverables are split into two modules. In module 1 the team promises a deep dive into technologies that enable cross chain implementations: state of the tech, levels of innovation, smart contract, security, privacy. The work will include own research as well as categorizing, curating or tagging existing work. Module 2 would focus on general technologies through a similar lens: state of the technologies, level of innovation, security, privacy, but generally looking in other directions than pure blockchain tech. There is also a general Module 3, but its purpose is for marketing / communication only, so it\u2019s not actually a core activity, but rather general to the littlefish DAO activities.   \n\nEach of the two modules briefly touched upon in the previous section are presented in great detail, and we can immediately realize what kind of activities will be taking place, as well as complementing the description with an estimation of the hours involved. Going further into the details, for each module we know the relevant stakeholders, the primary working group, the estimated duration and necessary hours. And if this wasn\u2019t already enough, the entire proposal is sprinkled with useful links where you go very deep down the rabbit hole into, for instance, past payment sheets for existing members, external case studies relevant to what you are reading or simply a beautiful post-it board to see the broad picture of how a certain module is intended to work. \n\nThis is also one of the very few projects that do take seriously the task of going through a risk assessment, and actually identifying, documenting, finding ways to mitigate and properly disclosing some of the risks that could affect the project. Again, just to offer a flavor of what is presented, the team discloses in great detail the financial risk stemming from the fact that a significant portion of the team is based in Turkey, currently experiencing hyperinflation, and the mitigating actions to lower the future impact of the situation. \n\nThe budget is built on very solid principles, however it works a little differently compared to traditional projects. We start with the key information that the budget is built around the base hourly rate of 50 USD, deemed by the proposers sufficient to sustain a living wage in most places around the world, thus offering financial stability to full timers. Each module has its own separate personnel budget and there is also an extra caption for each module, similar to an overhead, as a percentage of personnel costs. A part of it is to be spent at the discretion of the module team while the rest is pooled to cover common good expenses (videoconferencing tools for example). On top of all this lies an action fund (25% of the total) acting as a buffer mechanism to ensure short term sustainability and allow for estimation errors or even to fund additional modules if deemed necessary. \n\nIn conclusion, we have a solid plan, a good team and a very logical budget, hence excellent feasibility overall for the proposal. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Littlefish is built around openness, so ensuring full auditability of its activities comes rather naturally. The team publishes major updates on Obsidian (an online knowledge base solution), while their Miro boards are open to the community. The team uses Discord for daily activities as well as to \u201cshout\u201d when actions are done, in a similar way as to how Deworks / Discord works for Catalyst Swarm and bounties. The team will also use google analytics to track the overall success of the DAO (number of visitors, average time spent, etc.).  \n\nLittlefish also offers very logical solutions for tracking the proposal\u2019s specific modules. Generally, the team will maintain open source repositories (not really the case for these modules) and share updates with the community on their communication channels. For this proposal, tracking progress is rather easy: documentation, documentation and more curations, which will all be uploaded onto their online knowledge base. Overall we have a very solid way of tracking the performance of the proposal, if implemented. \n\nLittlefish is a beautiful experiment and it will be extremely easy for the Cardano community to follow its development.

The author also raises the risk of marketing if the spread of marketing activities is not widely distributed, the information that the team proposes will make the information of the activities not widely spread. it will be slow and ineffective in attracting the public.

They are also developing the team at Love House, and an LFF working group in charge of marketing and community building. and cohesion is mainly because of the thoroughness of the proposed team I believe this project will be successful if funded.
