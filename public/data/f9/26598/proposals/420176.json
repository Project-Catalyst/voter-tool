This section of the proposal doesn\u2019t list out all the potential benefits of this proposal in written form but there is a lot of listed impacts in the short video attached. There are lots of indicated benefits like expanding market share, risk distribution, better/cheaper performance, convenience for collectors, and capability for collection migration. These are all attractive impacts, in theory. I think this proposal could secure much more positive reaction from voters with tangibility added by quantification. I would\u2019ve liked to see some citations of how much NFT volume is traded within the marketplaces of the chains that this bridge is connected to, to demonstrate what kind of exposure Cardano gains by approving this proposal. Some additional and more direct tangibility could be added by citing data on how many transactions are facilitated on this platform on 30 day and all time number timeframes. I think this added information would secure a significantly more positive voter response. I wasn\u2019t able to find any information on these platform-specific numbers but I was able to find nearly 40k Twitter followers for this platform\u2019s official page, so there is some demonstrable well-established awareness of this platform. Beyond impact quantification, I think there\u2019s some additional consideration that ought to be made for risk mitigation. I\u2019ve worked with a few DeFi NFT collections on utility development and I\u2019ve also stayed well connected to some utility-based NFT developers and most of these utilities are on-chain based utilities that wouldn\u2019t be able to function on other blockchains. In the event that other NFT bridges pop up, there\u2019s a risk of NFTs losing their utility entirely if it jumps different blockchains multiple times to the point where the trail back to the original is lost. I think this problem could be addressed with potential solutions about metadata information or collaboration with other NFT bridge, which I would like to see further elaboration on IF this issue is on the team\u2019s radar. This could pose a long-term threat to the platform if the future of NFTs is rooted in utility, rather than collectibles. This might not be a huge issue for NFTs that are purely collectibles in nature but there\u2019s plenty of circumstances where NFTs have utility added to them well AFTER the initial launch. Since there is a relatively widespread vision for the proliferation of NFTs and their utility, I would like to see this proposal address more about long-term sustainability of this platform. Additionally, there is another potential risk of this platform being used as a tool to create counterfeit NFTs by masking the authenticity with bridged meta data. Since this platform is already well-established and connected to 16 blockchains now, I expect they already have answers to these questions that are just not answered here. Lastly, I think this proposal could add more reputability among Cardano voters if they disclosed that there is an existing partnership (I use that term loosely)  with Pavia (who is prepared to utilize this bridge). These concerns are not imminent threats and are more likely solved by taking these steps to connect first, so I rank this section positively because of the strong/innovative alignment with Cardano\u2019s efforts for interoperability. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Integrations are vastly easier to react positively to because they usually have preexisting infrastructure, as this one does. I rank this section a 5 for thoroughly demonstrable capability and well-established interoperable infrastructure. I have some relatively minor qualms with some details of the proposal, like the difficulty of verifying core team professional experience with the given links/resources. Even on their website, you can find a LONG list of contributing team members with full names and pictures but no LinkedIn profiles to be found anywhere. This issue is pretty well mitigated with the capability demonstrated by the well-established bridging solution that currently exists but it is a factor that could secure greater positive voter reaction. The roadmap and budget sections are a little bit clunky in terms of organization but is plenty functional for what these sections are supposed to do. The roadmap does a great job at outlining all the actionable steps, timelines, and action categories to show expected completion in 4.5 months. In this outline, it doesn\u2019t translate all that well to determine efficiency in spending by providing allocated hours of labor and hourly rates. Based on my estimations, the spending is pretty reasonable for most industry standard rates for blockchain development IF there are 3-4 people working full time hours ($22,222k/mo = $5.55k-7.4k/person). Plus, the overall cost outweighs the potential benefits, in my opinion. I rank positively here because I think there\u2019s no major concerns for feasibility and only a few minor criticisms for how information is laid out. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For providing a definition of success that only encompasses completion/functionality as its standard, I rank this section a 2. I think this is where the proposal falls short in demonstrating to voters that the expected outcome of this proposal is worth the requested $100k. While there isn\u2019t an expectation of this proposal having ZERO impact, the proposal does not objectively define/demonstrate a quantifiable outcome that can be properly evaluated against the risks/costs. There are a lot of potential KPIs that voters would expect to see here, such as number of NFTs bridged out of Cardano, number of NFTs bridged into Cardano, number of connected wallets, website traffic, social media traffic and any other metrics that might measure this investment having a worthwhile ROI for the Cardano ecosystem. A higher level proposal would provide identified KPIs with target metrics to quantify/specify the proposers expectation/definition of success. Also, the SDG ratings are a little bit of a stretch.

This objective aligns exactly with the proposal by reducing the silos between chains. \n\nSince NFTs play such a major role in most ecosystems, it is likely a good starting point to begin bringing down the silos and also reducing the maximalism between chains. This may be important on a broader scale as artists looking to get into NFTs may not need to be exact on which chain they choose to launch on but identify which suits their needs best while still having access to all the others. \n\nThe \"iron curtain\" language feels a little dramatic but the point is taken :) ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nWhat gives confidence to the team being able to deliver is that they already have delivered NFT bridges to seven other chains and will now be integrating Cardano.

This helps bolster their reputation by being able to see exactly what has been completed to date. \n\nThe plan is laid out well and indicates the team's knowledge on the steps required and the amount of time each would take. I would have liked if they provided more details of how they reached their final budget numbers. At the current rate they are paying $33k/1.5 months but that feels like an exorbitant amount without any real breakdown. \nI am not saying this amount is unfair, just that to ask for such a chunk there should be an hourly rate and expected amount of time required. \n\nOne last thing I think could be better explained in the plan is how they will market/promote their product. Yes they go to crypto meet ups but perhaps using more traditional marketing could make this information known to the broader NFT community given its potential impact.

As Cardano seeks to become a global open source project, those teams who start this way are likely better off. This also means that the community is able to track and follow along with the development as it happens. \n\nI think the team could have done a bit better of a job explaining their KPIs. It is good that they will be testing their code to cover 85% of the on-chain functionality, there is no real explanation as to why 85%. Moreover, that's the only indicator they have. There is no real other indication of how the team would be reporting their milestones to the community. \n\nTheir success measure is simple (transferring NFTs to and from Cardano to the other chains) but again I think some scope here would be helpful. Is there a target amount of NFTs you'd like to have traded to be a success? If it happens only once, is that a success? More detail here would help get that last star. Overall good work.

However, the identity disclosure via social networks seems to be unclear because the team only gives the Github link, in some member profiles there is no photo of that member. This leads to the feasibility of the proposal not being 100% approved by the community, where there is still doubt about its veracity. My advice to the team is to try to add a social network link (Linked, Facebook, etc\u2026) to make all the members of the team public. Because thanks to the full complement, the community has a lot of advantages in looking up the members' identities and verifying the feasibility of the proposal. The team has listed the number of members, which is not always the case (this is worth noting). Team members I understand are key members, the team may also include other collaborators who have not been identified.\nThe budget breakdown seems to be having issues as it doesn't show the breakdown by items. The community when looking at it will find it very difficult to understand. It does not show the amount to be spent, very vague and sketchy. This makes me and the community even more doubtful about the feasibility of the proposal. As a PA, I advise the team to show in detail, clearly the required budget for each small job so that the community can look at it and have more confidence in the feasibility of the proposal. I have a question for the team: If it hasn't been funded by Catalyst in Fund 9, will the team continue to work on this proposal? What other funding does the team have to be able to implement this proposal (from contacting support from other organizations)? I ask this question because I want to demonstrate clear feasibility for the budget (the team claims to have received 13 blockchain grants).\nRegarding the plan and implementation method, it has been stated but not clear and sketchy (only a few lines). I continue to comment on this, is that the team should review it carefully to write the plan and how to implement it in a much more complete way. This is also one of the important factors in clearly defining the feasibility of the proposal.\nRegarding the necessary resources for implementation, I temporarily divided them into two main resources: financial resources (mentioned in the above budget) and human resources. Given the current (unidentified) people, I doubt the proposed implementation will be successful. However, the team shared that there were no members who were working on another proposal parallel to this proposal at Fund 9. It got me thinking that if the proposal was implemented, the team would spend 100 % of human resources to perform right? Perhaps the team should have more confirmation about the implementation resources to create more trust from the community, thereby increasing the feasibility of the proposal.\nIn terms of technique, technology and language used when implementing the proposal. It is a collection of high-tech technologies: Blockchain, Front-end, Fullstack, smart contracts, etc\u2026 They are implemented by experienced teams in the market (current team members are present). now). That is the basis for me to believe that the team will be able to do when implementing the technical aspect of the proposal implementation.\nThe team is also quite clear about the risks that may be encountered when implementing this proposal: Lack of information to propagate this project to the community so that they know more about the existing tools to help solve the problem NFT to and from Cardano - the team came with a satisfactory solution. I add one more risk: It's Ada's slippage - which will affect the budget to implement the proposal. We know that the digital currency market is in a downtrend, the digital currency is moving in a downward direction - causing Ada to lose value when the Catalyst fund is allocated to the team. At that time, the team will face the problem of a lack of budget to implement the proposal. Therefore, my advice is that the team consider the detailed budget related to Ada's slippage to make the budget request accordingly.\nJust now are my positive comments and advice. I hope the team can consider completing the missing things (member identity, budget, plan, human resources) so that the proposal will soon gain the community's trust in its integrity. Feasibility. I disagree about the feasibility of the proposal. I vote 2 stars.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I see the team has given the milestones but it is presented carelessly, somewhat sketchy, and confusing. The milestones are not tied to a timeline (specific months of the year) so that the community can see the roadmap more clearly. What makes it difficult for the community to assess the progress of the work, it is difficult to demonstrate the transparency and auditability of the proposal. I think the team should show more interest in the proposal milestone roadmap (both content and presentation). My specific advice is that the team can present the work done at each milestone in more detail so that it is easier for the community to understand - especially for newcomers in the community - they can read and Understand what the team needs to do at milestones easily. With content and presentation, I was a bit disappointed.\nWhy doesn't the team present key metrics and key metrics? I think the team knows the role of KPIs and key metrics in the audit. This omission makes it more difficult for the community to evaluate and audit when KPIs and key metrics are not visible. KPIs and key metrics play an important role in proving the transparency and auditability of the proposal. So my sincere advice to the team is to quickly add KPIs and key metrics. Then this proposal will have much higher transparency and auditability.\nOn the other hand, the team stated what success is: NFT successfully transfers to Cardano from other bridge chains and back using the bridge's UI/utilities and JavaScript libraries. I agree with this definition of success, which is quite simple but clearly articulates the purpose of the proposal. I feel that more effort is needed by the team to improve on the shortcomings I mentioned above if the proposal is to be auditable.\nHere are some of my positive comments to build more transparency and auditability of the proposal. Regarding the auditability of the proposal, I disagree.
