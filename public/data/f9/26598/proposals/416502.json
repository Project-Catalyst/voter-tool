It's also great they showed honesty in regards to their little experience with EVM or DKG. The one issue of this honesty is it present a bit of a hole in the proposal in regards to potential for successful implementation. \n\nThe risks section brings up two major issues in regards to whether it will be feasible or not on Cardano with IOGs EVM side chain and that Origintrail will then need to give it support. Unfortunately these big issues don't have strong mitigation strategies. It would have been great to seem more information on the Origintrail support process and how Cardano EVM side chain compatibility could be ensured. \n\nIn the detailed budget section the proposer mentions using the money to hire someone or bribe Origintrail. This creates a lack of confidence in the potential for successful use of funds. \n\nOverall there isn't an exact plan beyond getting $5k and then using it to get someone else to implement OriginTrail on Cardano.

Instead it is a bounty for anyone who is ready to implement the connection between Cardano and OriginTrail. These two are both important rails of the future and they should be connected. For that reason, I fully agree this should get done. Unfortunately the proposer has not made the proposal quite complete enough to be given five stars.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph and their consensus layer are in fact two different entities, first a semantic chain and the second a multi-chain functioning on Ethereum, Polygon and now also as a Parachain on Polkadot.

If I have understood correctly, going forward, all other chains (like Cardano) can connect with that parachain. Point being, perhaps the connection via the EVM sidechain is not even needed.\n\nThe proposer sees the importance of connecting Cardano with OriginTrail but doesn\u2019t have time or capacity to do it on his own.

However, it does not become apparent what the impact may be.\nDespite build breaks, 16 open pull requests, and 45 open issues, v6/develop branch of the network node of OriginTrail, ot-node, has not received an update in two months at the time of this review. The major question is how a DKG backend on Cardano would address the challenge questions - this proposal makes no attempt in answering the question. The claim that because Ethereum, Gnosis (never heard of them), and Polkadot (its support is actually still in development according to the linked website) are supported, Cardano needs to be supported as well is not explained.\n\nInteroperability is easy to understand as falling in the realm of this challenge, but overall, I see serious issues in the proposal as it does not answer most of the questions related to impact sufficiently.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer himself will not work on the implementation of this proposal. Unless OriginTail has a working solution already and the timing works out that Martin \u201cbribes\u201d them just prior to the release announcement, I do not see how it is feasible to \u201chire someone\u201d for $5k to complete this in October.\nThe provided references are useless as we do not know who would be hired to do the job. Even just from the perspective of a Plutus Pioneer from the first cohort and someone who works with Plutus regularly, I can assure you that you will not find someone who can lift this project sufficiently for $5k - not if you contract someone. People who really know graphs are few. This is not just a simple copy and paste Solidity type of gig either. If the proposer had the skills (his LinkedIn and website don\u2019t indicate this) to do it himself and take a huge paycut, maybe that would be feasible. A third party dependency is also problematic. Looking for IO to have products production ready is a strategy that is almost guaranteed to fail. Many Catalyst proposers have been burned by taking communicated wishes and deadlines by C.H. as guarantees that the product is shipped by that date. As we know, that is often not the case.\nBut because this section is essentially a huge question mark and the proposer himself does not know if it\u2019s feasible and lacks a detailed plan, I give this section the lowest rating.\n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "It can be reasonably assumed that \u201copen source contribution\u201d would mean that the community could track progress of inputs on Github.

The intentions of this proposal directly increase interoperability and enhance the multi-chain future which Cardano strives to become a fundamental part of. The DKG would enable Cardano to coordinate and collaborate with other chains and build a strong and solid basis for further integration between Cardano and other blockchains in the future.\nThis proposal aligns very well with the campaign brief of the \u201cCross-chain collaboration\u201d challenge as mentioned above.
