If the technical characteristics make it difficult for people to imagine fully understanding blockchain, this project will be a means of conveying messages to the community through short films. However, what I evaluate here is the inappropriateness of the proposal. The proposal has not yet shown any contribution to the system. What are the elements of the proposal to develop more than the Cardano ecosystem? Besides, the proposal is beyond the criteria set by the challenge \"Cross-chain cooperation\", which has not been emphasized related to the impact of the proposal such as towards cross-chain collaboration yet, innovation, and interoperability. The proposal is not suitable for this \"Cross-chain cooperation\" challenge. suggested to the proponent that challenges should be found that better fit these ideas. Also add elements that are more relevant to the Cardano ecosystem such as movie content about Charles Hoskinson, about interviews with IOG members about the process of building protocol mechanisms for the system.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Here, the proposal specifically tells us about each kind of work that needs to be done to be able to produce an episode, very fully and detailed.\nAbout the budget: the proposal is asking for a budget of $330,000, which is over 10% of the total budget. I think this budget cost is not reasonable compared to the value of the product that this proposal brings. Besides, the large budget will make it difficult for the proposal to reach consensus to be approved by the community. Therefore, I have a suggestion with the proposal that you should recalculate the cost or find more external funding to ensure the target of the challenge \"Cross-chain cooperation\"\nAbout the members of the team: the proposal outlines a few names that will take on what roles in the project. However, I have opened all the attachments but still can't find any details about the evidence for each member's experiences here. Therefore, I suggest that you add links to profile pages like LinkedIn to increase the persuasion to the community, and the community can easily check.\nIn addition, I also expect the proposal can provide more about the implementation roadmap so that the feasibility of the proposal can be fully assessed.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal provides clear milestones to measure progress, we have information on how many episodes will on-air here and at what time.

Let\u2019s dive in. \n\nStarting with the problem identification, the proposer informs us that there is a lack of content creation and documentation regarding the crypto community. I find that rather hard to believe, given the very low barriers to entry nowadays into any kind of video production, where all you need is a handheld camera (or even a smartphone) to start producing your own content and posting it immediately on social media platforms, video streaming websites or anything else in between. So I tend to slightly disagree with the statement, or at least propose a different framing - perhaps we are lacking quality content, well researched and edited? This I might agree with. \n\nIn any case, the value proposition we are offered is that United media wishes to start onto this quest with \u201cgoing out into the field to find builders of the blockchain\u201d \u2026 but then we are not told exactly what happens after these builders are found. We have to scroll through the entire proposal to find out that the goal is to have 30 episodes, but it is not clear if we are talking about podcasts, or documentaries, or what shape these episodes will take. \n\nLet\u2019s take a step back and realize we are within the cross-chain collaboration challenge, whose aim is to foster collaboration between teams, identification of other blockchains to work with, and generally increase cross-chain activity. I have searched high and low within the proposal to find any meaningful connection to this topic, and there simply isn\u2019t one. I don\u2019t believe that simply creating media content will contribute to this goal.\n\nTo turn this value proposition into an excellent one I would have expected: \n\n- episodes focused on putting together relevant teams that can click together, perhaps \u201cbattles\u201d between each blockchain\u2019s main builders, explaining the advantages of working on their respective chains\n- making a pledge to go out and look for cross chain success stories and turn them into catchy documentaries\n- generally content for which participants have to interact and hopefully bond during this time.\n\nLacking any focus of this tailor-made content specific for fostering cross chain collaboration, I am not convinced of the good fit between the proposal and the challenge, hence only three stars I deem as appropriate.   ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team presentation is rather unimpressive, although the name of the proposal suggests otherwise. We are only being informed of Glen, the producer and director of the project, and his partner Giovanni who would oversee casting and logistics. They also have prepared two hosts of the show, called AI Love Tru and Im Rello. For an excellent proposal I would have expected to see a very comprehensive track record for every member of the team: past productions from Glen, the producer, a few social media links, to be able to judge his \u201ctraction\u201d within the media sector and also convince of the quality of past productions. As well, I would have loved to see links to past shows hosted by our two potential hosts, but we don\u2019t have any of that sadly. \n\nBudgetwise, the team is asking for funding for a six months period. The entire budget construction is not very convincing, and there are many unclear aspects about it. Let\u2019s show a few examples (but there are many more in the proposal!) . For the five person team, they budget 750 USD per week, meaning 3k USD per month, but we are not being told how many hours per week each member is supposed to be working. Will it be a full time job or just two hours per day? We don\u2019t know and it\u2019s thus impossible to assess the feasibility of the numbers. Additionally, we are being proposed a general admin budget that includes food, gas, water bottles, parking tolls, etc. I am sorry to say that this kind of bulk budgeting, and including costs which have little to do with the project itself, is rather disrespectful for the general ADA holder, and I have a strong feeling that the community will not be receiving a good value for money here. \n\nTimewise, the proposers expect to launch one episode a day, and schedule shoots with blockchain businesses, with several teams of shooters (how do you achieve that with only five persons on the payroll?). They will be supposed to \u201crun around the city, state, and country\u201d but we are not being told not even which state the team is based in. California of course would be the intuitive answer, but how do we know the team is not based in Nebraska? We are not being told. \n\nGiven the unimpressive team description, the weak budget construction and the rather unfeasible plan and value proposition, I have to limit the assessment to three stars again.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "During the second phase of the project the team intends to increase their media machine and heavily promote their content (which we now find out will include documentaries, educational pieces, biographies and some entertainment pieces). They are also proposing a United Media channel en Ether Stream platform as a way of reaching out to the wider community - free content of course. The team also talks now about the ability to purchase NFTs (which are however not part of the detailed plan) which of course is a good think that can attract more users. Overall it will definitely be possible for the Cardano community to follow the developments of this proposal if implemented, but it would have been nice to think about a few performance indicators to really measure success: number of unique viewers, analysis of the most viewed content, perhaps allowing interactions with and accepting feedback from the general Cardano community. So overall we have a fair, but not excellent, case for auditability, so four stars are appropriate.

The proposal also clearly defines the audience that the team will reach and accompany. The highlight is probably that United Media is established and widely known and has experience in Blockchain since 2021. However, with the difficulties raised by the team, I am concerned about scalability. Around the world, this will probably take a long time. Even so, I feel this project deserves funding.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "United Media can be called stable in terms of organization. However, it would be better if I knew how you divide the departments and the roles of each department. Through that, I will better understand the different departments. The part of the personnel cost you give, because at the moment I find this cost relatively high, accounting for nearly 30% of the price, the team considers hiring freelancers to use staff more reasonably. You have two hosts - A.I. You Tru and Im_Rello official. This will cost extra for insurance and benefits, while you can hire freelance M.C.s for each show, thus also helping the programs produced by the company to be more innovative through the leadership of many M.C.s.Also, in terms of equipment costs, the team considers renting equipment that is not used often.\nThe goal of releasing 30 episodes per month in theaters I find feasible because your group has a lot of experience in this.\nIn addition to a few points related to costs that make me bewildered, the rest see the possibility of success of this project. The programs and series on the Ether Stream decentralized platform that the team produces are enriching.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "United Media's goal of having 30 episodes in theaters every month is obvious and specific. However, I think you need to measure the effectiveness of the episodes, such as views, To share the information about how the team will spend when it gets the 330,000 funds is detailed, and if better, the team can update the weekly/monthly spending report for the community to know.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3004", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10565, "q0": "In my opinion, \u201cUnited Media Blockchain Community\u201d is a very good idea and has met the challenge of \u201cCross-Chain Collaboration\u201d. This proposal has pointed to a problem that is quite a concern by the community, that is: \"The problem that United Media is here to fix is the lack of production, content creation, and documenting the crypto community. Bringing the point of view of those who are working on the blockchain\". This proposal is aimed at a target audience of businesses who want to do business using cryptocurrencies. When those businesses are in need, the United Media team is here to help with media production, content creation, logo creation, and digital marketing so that those businesses have the direction and platform to work to continue to develop further after that. I know that, if you want to do business in any field, you need to learn a lot, and have good knowledge and skills to be able to operate a business well. That preparation includes both physical facilities and orientations, strategies, and branding. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is still a fairly new concept to many people and places. Therefore, if there is no specific plan and no help and support from specialized units, it will face many difficulties and very high risks. Therefore, the United Media team is always ready to support, providing the best content about blockchain is a great and necessary thing for businesses and for those who are new to the community. The solution proposed by the proponent I found identified most of the problems of the challenge. By showing the benefits, the group's willingness to support the community has shown the impact of the issue and the proponent's argument is also reasonable. They describe the solution in detail, and clearly, and the topics to be covered are relatively complete. To successfully implement the project, they have anticipated the risks. There are 6 risks listed: Not enough people coming forth, Not enough staff for the workload, Running out of gas, Running out of energy to operate the equipment, and Not having a place to operate the business from. Each risk has solutions to overcome. However, there is a risk here if the first one is Not enough people coming forth. In my personal opinion, the group should have large-scale communication articles to be known by the community, such as publicizing information about major partners who have collaborated with the group to improve the quality of life, and reputation, or have an after-sales policy for customers, a consulting program and customer care after each cooperation. That will help the group get loyal customers and from there, through these loyal customers, they will introduce more new potential customers and partners to the group.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This proposal has broken down the work and tasks that need to be done including: reviewing and adding enough devices to operate continuously for a year, scheduling spins with businesses and blockchain actors in the community, the work of editors, making brochures, creating logos, printing business cards, etc. These jobs are presented in very detail and specific, full of steps to complete a project. However, in my personal opinion, it would be better if the proposer had a more detailed schedule by giving a specific timeline. When to start deploying, how long does each task last, that timeline can be months, weeks, or even days? Thereby, everyone can easily control the progress and ensure more efficient work, avoiding the long delay of a job that affects the next stages and affects the overall results of the entire project judgment. Regarding the budget, the proponent presented how to allocate and use those budgets in a very detailed and specific, clear way, including employee payroll, operating costs of Gas, food, parking, tolls, rent, internet, insurance, etc. There is a point in the budget where the payroll is being divided equally among each employee. However, in my personal opinion, this salary should be divided according to the proportion of contributions as well as work experience. Paying based on individual performance encourages creativity and everyone's contribution to the overall outcome. In addition, if possible, the proponent should deduct a small part of the budget to make a reward fund or apply for additional funding to give to really excellent individuals and groups with many contributions. Regarding the participating members, the proponent also provided relatively complete information about their full names and position. However, this section should be supplemented with information about qualifications, work experience, and suitability for this particular job.
