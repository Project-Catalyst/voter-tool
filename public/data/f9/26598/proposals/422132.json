However, a blockchain has a lot of data to explore. Even well-known Cardano data discovery sources are unlikely to collect enough data or create the best experience for all users. From here we can see that creating a blockchain explorer is not a simple job and many blockchains are many times more complicated. A simpler way to choose is to explore only the most basic data and so the website will act as an advertising source for communities from different blockchains to know each other. According to the plan and solution proposed by the proposal, the value of Cardano achieved from the Xscan.io platform is on par with other blockchains such as Bsc, Solana, ETH... but Cardano's outstanding value cannot be clearly seen. or community achieved if the proposal is funded. According to my suggestion, it is recommended to build the project's multichain explorer in the direction of prioritizing convenience for the Cardano community, there are more Cardano explorer functions integrated in the website than other blockchains.\nThe proposer also needs to have a solution on the strategy of promoting the website to different blockchain communities for more people to know. This is not mentioned in the proposal.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team that implemented the proposal included the unmarshal.io team and some members of Konmalab. The team members' information can be verified through the linkedin sources that listed in the proposal, the team's abiliity can also be verified through checking the content in the 2 websites unmarshal.io and xscan.io. Besides, some members of Konmalab have experience in Haskell, Plutus can advise the team in implementing data collection from Cardano.\nThe plan to implement the proposal proposed by the proposer is about 4-5 months if calculated based on the milestones in the details plan. I assess this plan to be viable based on what the proposal's team had built on the unmarshal team's website. Having more technical advice from Konmalab members will help limit the risks of Caradno's lack of technical knowledge. It is worth noting here that in the proposal, proposer mentioned that the proposal's team is also involved in the implementation of other proposals. However, the proposer has not had an explanation and provide proof that the team can arrange personnel or calculate a plan to implement many proposals at the same time? The information about the proposals present with the proposed team has also not been released, which will make it difficult for the community to assess the feasibility of the proposal's implementation plan. If only checking about the Konmalab team, in this fund 9, Konmalab submitted more than 10 proposals and each proposal is a combination with other teams. Therefore, I suggest the proponent to clarify this issue.\nThe proposed budget is declared as $120,000, but the total budget based on the budget breakdown is $100,000, which is probably a mistake on the part of the proposer. The details of the budget breakdown are based on the exact workloads of the detail plan. However, I tried to perform the math and found that the costs were unreasonable and lacked basis, for example:\nMilestone 2 \u2014 Decoding Data\nEstimated Duration - 36 days\nNumber of resources - 2\nApproximate Estimated Cost - $25,000\nThe cost involves decoding of the indexed On Chain data, setting up databases , setting up live sync of data from Cardano chain.\nIf we consider \"number of resources\" to mean that 2 participants will do the work, then doing the division will give the cost for 1 person/1 day: 25000/2/36 = 347,222$, this odd number makes me wonder about the basis. the proposed labor calculation facility. I suggest the proponent to just add 1 line about the labor cost per day.\nIn my opinion,The feasibility of the proposal is high if I remove the shortcomings that I mentioned above.  The most impressive point for me is that the project's website is already working and will only need to be integrated with Cardano explorer if the proposal is submitted. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Some key metrics mentioned by the proposer are:\nThe number of users visiting the Cardano Section\nNumber of new users logged in after the integration\nNumber of previous users who were using XScan , and now have begun using the Cardano Section.\nI agree with these metrics, but the proposal doesn't provide a way or a source to check the progress. If I check in the xscan.io website, I have not seen anything that is considered evidence to be able to track the numbers in an open and transparent way. My suggestion is that the proposer should create additional functions that display user parameters in the web interface. Monthly reports will provided to the community.\nBesides, the proposal is only limited to creating communities, creating interactions between users of chains. Therefore, proposal should give KPIs about specific numbers will be achieved.\nHow successful the project will look that is difficult to assess because there is no KPI to refer to, and the website of the project has not shown how many users are available to the project? In case the project succeeds in the future, I rate the multi-chain explorer project as a good community hub to introduce blockchains to each other.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2394", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1399, "q0": "Yes, this proposal effectively addresses the challenge by adding Cardano to the existing unmarshal.io website, which is a multi-chain blockchain explorer. \n\nThe proposal does a good job at outlining the problem of crypto users often being spread across many chains yet have no efficient way to review all of their holdings/txs across these diverse ecosystems. By adding Cardano to their already existing platform, the community will benefit from being able to explore their holdings with other supported chains. \n\nThe more opportunities that Cardano has to be integrated along with other chains is likely to drive it's impact. Currently we are chided by many in the blockchain space as being a ghost-chain, and worse, however, showing our assets and products on the same platform as others may help to dispel some of these myths. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the experience and plan presented, it is somewhat likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nWhat bodes strongly for this proposal is that they already have the unmarshal.io platform that has many of the major chains already included. What the team intends to do is integrate Cardano into this platform. However, as the proposers admit they need to learn the nuances of Cardano's code before they can integrate it in. I think they could have provided a bit better explanation as to why they feel up to the challenge and how they plan to overcome it. \n\nTo that end, the plan is a little sparse in detail for the amount of money being requested. The activities could be better explained with some information about what is necessary to complete them. If you have done this as you onboarded other chains to the platform, one might expect you to have more granularity in the steps/timeframes required. The blanket statements and amounts are fine but leave something to be desired. \n\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. \n\nThe main thing that the proposers will be measuring is the increase in new Cardano users on their website. This is a good end goal and will help determine whether the overall project was successful. This simple measure will also be easy for the community to determine whether or not it achieved what it set out to do. \n\nWhat could be better developed in this section are some measures/KPIs for the actual integration of Cardano. How will you audit whether the work you are doing in the build is successful? What opportunities exist for community input? Since the majority of the funds requested are for building the solution, why are there not measurements for this? \n\nLastly, I would encourage the proposers to provide more tangible success measurements, while they state that success is, \"when the word about this partnership is spread across widely and we get featured on Cardano's on successful completion and when we onboard more end users and DAPPS on to our ecosystem after Cardano Integration\", there are no thresholds to know what actually would determine success. What does \"spread widely\" look like for you? 2 users? 10? These are the types of benchmarks we are missing. \n\nOverall, a strong proposal, just some tweaks and additional clarity should be provided for full marks.

If rewriting, perhaps the author would choose to align their problem towards the challenge rather than the benefits to Cardano precisely.\n\nThere is undoubtedly a clear positive impact that the project will have on the Cardano ecosystem, and is \"multi-chain\" minded. If the proposal is ever re-imagined, perhaps a collaboration/integration with a current Cardano blockchain explorer would be a fit?\n\nThe KPIs do match the challenge. The goal is essentially a space that many can use from various blockchains to gather whatever blockchain data they need at the time.\n\nThere are many ways for the plan to scale, though the team seems focused entirely on the task at hand, which seems reasonable for the commitment.\n\nIn Impact there is a concerning statement about Cardano being \"built a little differently from the other EVM-based chains.\" This statement is profoundly concerning. The blockchains are different in significant ways beginning with the eUTXO model as compared to EVM. Voter beware, or a harmless remark made carelessly?

The proposal does ask for it, but voters need more.  \n\n*The budget calls for $100,000\u2013\u2013though the ask at the beginning of the proposal is $120,000.

Instead, they will likely hold and trade different coins on different chains. No universal explorer exists to trace such transactions, including those involving Cardano. Everyone would welcome a cross-chain explorer, and Cardano users have expressed worries about its absence. Our problem is addressed by the author. They already have a functional explorer at https://xscan.io, which has many other coins, including Ethereum, integrated at the moment. They now wish to add support for Cardano. Funding such a proposal will undoubtedly attract a lot of attention to Cardano and the items the chain has to offer for users of this tool. This may also attract a lot of fresh traffic from the other chains and lead to cross-chain cooperation. The Unmarshall team has previously added value to other networks, thus there is a very good likelihood that they will do the same for Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has put out a thorough strategy of how they want to accomplish this, and the milestones appear achievable. The amount of study and work previously completed by the team demonstrates their enthusiasm and commitment to making this idea a success.

The budget breakdown is tightly related to the team's phase-by-phase strategy, which helps readers comprehend the rationale for the significant funding required and gives the budget every appearance of viability. Additionally, the team has demonstrated that they have the knowledge and expertise necessary to launch this project, especially in light of their prior success with other chains. Additionally, the team's brief introduction gives the public a chance to assess their backgrounds and level of experience. Additionally, the team's affiliation with Konma Labs, which has demonstrated its reliability in numerous prior rounds, enhances its credibility and dependability.

Additionally, the author's intent is clearly upgraded by the success definition from what will be measured when projects are finished. The integration with Cardano could become beneficial both for the explorer and our chain. However, the author could had provided us with some ways to regularly monitor the progress of the application during the development phase, may be that could make the auditing a much easier and profuse activity.
