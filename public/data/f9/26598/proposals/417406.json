This will drive the impact as it takes an inclusive approach, thereby allowing people to participate in more than one manner (English only). One could also assume that as the educational materials become more available, additional communities and groups are likely to form, as has happened elsewhere, aligned with different forms of culture and tradition. \n\nThe team does a really good job at parsing out the different aspects of their project and explaining their need and expected impact. This implies that the team is very knowledgeable about what gaps exist and how their solution is designed to meet them. Also, by providing a holistic view of their project they relay to voters that this is more than a one time deliverable but instead is the start of a longer term vision for the MENA region. \n\nThe reason why I have marked off one point here is that there could be a bit better description of how Cardano fits into their solution. Would there be any particular focus on Cardano in the materials?  The focus on blockchain writ-large is good for the challenge but I would have liked to see at least a couple bullets on why you are choosing to launch this project through Cardano and not another chain. I can think of many reasons why you'd want to do so but this shouldn't be left to voters to guess. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nFirst off, the team provides an abundance of information, resources, and documentation of their project. From the website, to the whitepaper, to the plan, each component is clear, articulate, and targeted to the specific issue. This team has done a fair amount of work already to get their products to this point and gives confidence that this is a project that will succeed if funded. \n\nSecond, the plan is well laid out. The team has it's vision well articulated and does a great job of providing in supplementary details so each component is fully realized.  Each of these components are also aligned with what appears to be a reasonable timeframe, costing, and deliverable. The focus on the lexicon, educational materials, and outreach/collaborations makes it easy to identify what the team hopes to achieve at each step.\n\nThird, I like that the project divides the efforts into a not-for-profit arm, and a for-profit arm. This will allow the team to support a broad array of potential collaborations where some are paid and others are pro bono. Again, this shows me the level of thought and foresight put into the project as their goal is to fund the NFP efforts through those that are FP. It is important to note here, that the for profit component of the proposal is not being funded through this request but will be assumed by the team once they are up and running. \n\nLastly, I appreciate the team has provided their gitbooks and CVs to inform the community of their skills. Upon further review it appears the team is certainly up for the task. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. \n\nAs mentioned above, the team does an excellent job of outlining the specific components of their proposal and providing clear deliverables, timeframes, and expected outcomes at each stage. This type of approach makes it very clear for community members to be able to see whether each stage was completed. \n\nAlso, given that the website and some of the educational material are already provided, the community can already assess whether the team has delivered/is able to deliver, on the components they note in the proposal. This implies they have nothing to hide and encourage feedback from the community. \n\nParticipating in different conferences and with key players in their region will also create its own feedback loop into their process whereby those collaborators will give real time updates on whether or not what has been completed to date is appropriate, where it could be adapted, and then learning through implementing. \n\nExcellent work and best of luck in the voting. \n\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2233", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4369, "q0": "Through the team's presentation, I found that the proposal to solve the goal set out in Challenge is collaboration. The problem that exists at MENA is the High Potential/Low Adoption paradox related to blockchain. In an area of \u200b\u200babout 575 million people, blockchain seems to be quite developed but has stalled in people's lives. So I see that if this problem is solved, the value of the Cardano blockchain will increase significantly in MENA, and people will know more about its real benefits than before - they just know but don't understand the price. The real value that blockchain brings to society. Thereby adding value to the Cardano ecosystem. If the proposal is implemented well and rarely put into practice, it can be scaled up later and solve many challenges. Because we all realize how big the role blockchain plays in this day and age, especially the Cardano blockchain, is how big the African features are. I realized that, if the team knows how to exploit well the paradox that exists in MENA, it will solve many important existing problems of MENA society in particular and the whole of Africa in general. The problems that can be solved are economics (improvement of people's living standards), culture, material and immaterial values, medical equipment, agriculture, and industry, respectively. decided by the Cardano blockchain in a decentralized way. Thus, the impact of this proposal is undeniable. I strongly agree - vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I see the team has new members with full experience in financial, media, research and academic backgrounds, blockchain, etc... This is very important, it increases the feasibility of the proposal and increases the community's trust in the team. Documents and websites about Taxir are also fully presented by the team. Regarding the disclosure of the identities of the team members, some members have expressed this through the team's website. I am quite satisfied with this. However, if possible, the team can present the identity of the members via the links of social networks (Linkedin, Facebook, etc...). From there, there are more grounds to further affirm the prestige of the team to the community and create conditions for the community to look up the identity of the members in the most convenient way.\nThe budget analysis to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal was presented by the team in a separate file, I found this presentation quite interesting. Although it takes a lot of work to access files, I still see the budget divided by sections and reasonable with the goal. I would like to ask a question to clarify the feasibility of the budget, which is: If Catalyst has not been funded, will the team continue to implement the proposal as originally planned? Does the team have any other funding sources to secure the implementation of this proposal? (those are funding sources that can come from funding by other organizations)\nThe plan given by the team is quite detailed including list A and list B, I know the team will try to complete all the tasks on list A and part of the work on list B. This demonstrates a strong effort in dealing with the tasks set out according to the plan. I find the planning and execution unique, I have never seen a presentation like this. This also confirms the team's interest in the proposal.\nRegarding the resources needed for implementation, I still temporarily exclude two main categories: Financial resources and Human resources. With financial resources, the team is still waiting for funding from Catalyst, and in terms of human resources, the team is full of members with expertise and rich experience to implement the proposal. . However, what members of the support team do I need to know more about? How many members are on the support team? I want to know because it increases the feasibility of the proposal and increases the credibility of the team. In the proposal, the team stated that there are no members participating and other proposals in this Fund 9. This makes me more confident in the feasibility of the proposal, believing that the team will focus all its human resources to implement this proposal well.\nTechnically and technologically, I know the team applied Cardano's blockchain technology when implementing this proposal (forming a 3-entity business structure, developing public projects and communication standards). communication is studied in the enterprise, so the team has applied the most advanced technology to solve the problem, and it also proves the feasibility of the proposal. Communication, propaganda, and promotion of the company's products and collaboration, these skills are best met because the team has members with high expertise in the field of communication.\nIn terms of methods and risks related to the implementation, the team has fully stated the risks associated with the necessary solutions. However, I would like to suggest two possible risks that are Ada's slippage in the cryptocurrency market (currently downtrend). This can cause the team to fall short of budget and hinder the implementation of the proposal. One more risk is that the team should think about the legal when applying the proposal in practice (local government regulations are different from each other). I think the team has people who are good at expertise: blockchain, crypto prices in the market, and regulation to have a solution to prevent these 2 risks. However, I still want the team to carefully study the two risks that I just mentioned. All my questions and opinions are to give positive feedback to improve the feasibility of the proposal.\nIn summary, I agree with the feasibility of the proposal, but I still recommend the team disclose their identity more specifically in the way I mentioned above to gain the full trust of the community. I vote 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "To demonstrate the transparency of the proposal, the team has outlined the roadmap and milestones within two months in the attached file. This I find completely reasonable and convenient for the community to evaluate the transparency and auditability of the proposal, even with a novel but still professional presentation of a team of many people. seasoned members. I'm excited to see what the team that defines success looks like (combination of profit and non-profit, growing into the leading blockchain research team at MENA). Even so, I find it a pity that there are no KPIs and key metrics. Surely the team knows the importance of these two metrics in the audit. Therefore, my advice is that the team should note the addition of these two indicators (KPI & key metrics) as soon as possible so that the community can have more confidence in the transparency and auditability of the proposal. For the rest, the problem throughout the proposal was clearly described by the team and clearly stated the appropriate solutions to overcome. Because the proposal lacks KPIs and key metrics, I am quite confused, both agreeing and disagreeing about the auditability of this proposal.

However, with the issue you raised, blockchain adoption and use cases have stagnated, both quantitatively and qualitatively. MENA has exhibited what might be the slowest adoption rate globally in terms of usage scale, and this poor adoption is largely focused on overturning CEX and NFT, disregarding blockchain technology in the region as a get-rich-quick scheme, I think it will take a long time to implement and change the minds of people in the MENA area. It will take a lot of effort.\nThere is no doubt that the proposal has been the subject of hours of design and ideation.

The proposal addresses everything required in the challenge guide to ascertain new connections through cultural inclusivity, with cross-chain collaborations. Using educational research and localized hub resources, the project\u2019s planned initiatives to curtail operational/cultural barriers and increase blockchain adoption in the Middle East and North Africa can increase cardano\u2019s chances as the entry point into sustainable blockchain ecosystems. Through the advent of the blockchain technologies and the heights of decentralized systems, various developing countries in the middle east and Africa can have access to digital currencies designed to fight against inflation. Thus the Taxir/Tafkir motive to provide resources in digestible language dialects for the MENA community as well as issuing paid assistance to others on project scalability in the Middle Eastern and North African region can solidify their role as a trustworthy educational resource into these ready markets. The team\u2019s inclusion of the whole scope of the project (including non-funding areas) will provide voters with a broader understanding on what this community driven project has to offer in blockchain communities.

The team is fully capable of carrying out the activities within the project based on their long years of combined experiences and the accomplished network pool in collaboration with the initiative. Also, the team\u2019s inclusion in cross-regional events in the MENA region does spread its seeds for future successful partnerships and onboarding. Based on the magnitude of the project, the team mentions its budget breakdown for phase one operations for a year covering administrative costs and other listed inventories. It includes a detailed outline of activities leading to growth and advancement. However, information given in the proposal states varying risks that can be met; language complexities, governance interference and travel constraints. This raises the question of how resilient their collaborative efforts break these cultural barriers. Although I would have liked to see more on cardano-MENA partnerships, I am certain a high achievement rate would organically cosign MENA/Cardano focused initiatives.
