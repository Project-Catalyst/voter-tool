The proposer intends to organize a blockchain-related challenge at the Climathon event in Geneva. However, the proposal fails to define how it specifically intends to foster collaboration with other chains or even which chains it intends to coordinate with. some kind of partnership or even a roadmap to create a partnership with other chains which are interested in the topic of climate action (which there are plenty out there) would align this proposal with the objectives of the challenge.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team has the relevant skills and experience to organize such a program. Although they have not written enough information about the team's skills/experiences, it can be found on the website of the event's main organizer (Impact hub). From the website and information available elsewhere online it is evident that the organization has a long-standing experience in organizing similar programs. The event has been implemented before and is already planned well and will be carried out in November, so the implementation of the event is almost certain. Even though the budget may seem small, when considering that the majority of the event's planning/organization is carried out by Impact Hub, some of the budgeted items seem confusing. For instance, the budget allocated for recruitment and communication seem excessive for a program that intends to have an estimated 10 participants. more details on items of relatively larger allocation will go a long way in getting a more positive assesment.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As the event is already in the organization process, the timeline and roadmap of the program are clear and reasonable. The event's organization has several well-established channels of communication and is more than adequate to update the community on the implementation of the program.

Instead, teams may have no incentive to work together and collaborate across chains as they will be competing in the hackathon, which might pit them against each other, including their respective chains. \n\nOne thing I would encourage the proposers to do is to engage members of the community who are already directly working on blockchain and climate solutions, such as Cardano4Climate. As a well established group in the community C4C could potentially help navigate this space and provide a group of willing participants to engage and identify solutions. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Given the experience and plan presented it is somewhat likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nThe team plans to \"lobby\" the climatathon 2022 event in order to include a blockchain specific challenge. What is not abundantly clear through the proposal is the likelihood that such an challenge would be researched, developed, promoted, and adopted with enough time to spare before the event itself. Given that the team doesn't appear to have the expertise in house (at least not from the information provided). To this end, I think the team could have explained their expertise in working with blockchains. \n\nThe budget also leaves a bit to be desired with not a lot of details on how the money will be spent for each activity. It is not that a line by line description is needed but rather there are some clear activities at each stage listed. Regardless, the budget is very modest and likely is low-risk to the community.

This is easy for the community to confirm. \n\nThe KPIs and other success measures are well laid out and mostly focus on the attendance and success of the challenge itself, including the amount of participants, number of solutions developed, and number of people reached through outreach. I think picking two innovative solutions is a good threshold and realistic. \n\nThe one reason why I feel I can't give full marks here is that there is a significant risk that the end goal would not be implemented due to the research not being adequate, disinterest from the organizers, or myriad other reasons. Given that the project could not take off in the first place, there is little way for the community to whether there would be anything to audit at all. \n\nRegardless, kudos to the team for a great idea.

We understand we should have been more clear about how we see our proposal addressing the challenge. By bringing a blockchain-related challenge to Climathon we will raise awareness on Cardano, Catalyst and other chains among participants (students, researchers, employees of Geneva-based NGOs and IOs) and encourage them to learn about their use for Climate. We are already in contact with Climate Neutral Cardano and Cardano Foundation to involve them as speakers, experts and presenting their use cases (e.g. Veratree) "}, {"id": 1761, "q0": "The problem statement does not identify a problem, such as this: \"The advancement of tackling issues related to climate change with people from various communities is lacking.\" or something similar. The statement given is, itself, a solutions statement. Though the problem it appears to solve (and this is where the issue is, we can only guess at what the real problem is, if rewriting, please define it as such), which is written in quotes above, seems to fit in line nicely with the Challenge.\n\nThis creative way of pulling together communities is an excellent value-add for Cardano. Further, it isn't so much focused on financial growth as a central theme but rather a more profound concern that most of humanity shares: Climate change. And as it relates to this Challenge: How can we collaborate cross-chain to impact climate change in measurable ways? \n\nA potentially weak mitigation tactic solves the risk of finding new participants. A more concrete tactic could look like this: \"we will reach out to unpaid people who might help us, we hope...\" These rationales support the 4 star score", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This is a well-detailed plan for a proposal such as this. The details are offered in a fully dated roadmap and a list of main deliverables and outputs. Voters can be fully aware of where the project plans to be at any given time and what actionable tasks they will be taking. As someone who's sat on several planning committees for such events (though non-blockchain related in my own experiences), the timetable for such an event does appear reasonable.\n\nThe budget is clear, though not broken down sufficiently. Voters, and the Catalyst community at large, deserve our best attempts at transparency. Hourly/daily/per project rates should all be included. Further, areas such as \"communication\" and \"recruitment\" deserve to have full explanations in dollar terms. If rewriting, please focus on adding several more details to the otherwise decent budget. Adding a 5%-10% contingency budget is standard; please add if rewriting.\n\nThe skills of both team members are offered. It is clear that, in total, between them both, they have the necessary skills to carry out the plan written in this proposal. They are a large part of the team, and we all benefit from more participation directly with Catalyst. An organizer of Climathon Geneva and a research assistant from IHG for startups are the right people for the work.

Participants will benefit from their time spent working with participants in these conversations. \n\nThe metrics include doing make sense for determining some amount of success. However, the proposer would also benefit from tracking other outcomes. One might be tracking the number of participant-created Catalyst proposals inspired by the gathering, another the number of participants' opinions in a brief survey.\n\nThere is no mechanism at present for the community to track success.

Idea makes a lot of sense as this topic is has been growing in imporance more and more needs to a multidisciplinary approach to be solved. The use of blockchain can help this in many fronts, but first, awareness need to be raised both about blockchain and about climate change. This is a good opportunity not only for raising this awareness but also for having possible concrete solutions as an output.

It could though, explain with more details on how proposers intends to engage the parties and different teams, form different chains, to participate in it. it could have more details on how the follow up with winning teams will be done afterwards.
