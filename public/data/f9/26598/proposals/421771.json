Having something that is live and functional is very encouraging for the perspective of a succesful proposal. The one question I have is around the implemntation of the Cardano blockchain. It is currently not possible to trade ADA through the WhaleHaven OTC DEX and all interactions are through EVM based single and multi-sig wallets. Integration of Cardano with smart contracts seems as though it may be more work then the $10k this proposal is seeking. \n\nOverall the WhaleHaven product does seem like it would provide a lot of value to Cardano if it successfully implements ADA. This would mean the Cardano community has a OTC DEX that can effectively transact between a variety of blockchains. \n\nThe risk section of this proposal doesn't really dive into any issues this proposal may face. It details the advanced tech the project uses in marketing speak but doesn't describe potential risks such as buggy smart contracts and lack of usage. The risk section does bring up that this proposal will be harder to implement if an alternative proposal is declined. This makes me a bit concerned and with a lack of documentation on how this risk could be mitigated I can't be confident that this proposal will be successful as a stand alone. \n\nThe team seems to be competent and capable of completing the projects deliverables. They have completed a working product and have years of experience to back it up.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposed solution portion of this proposal is a bit lacking. It describes the current iteration of WhaleHaven but doesn't describe the user journey coming from the Cardano side of things. The sentence \"Funds always stay on the chain\" is also a bit confusing as its impossible for a crypto asset like Bitcoin or ADA to no longer be on a blockchain. \n\nThe detailed budget section could use a bit more information. The detailed plan suggests a 3.5 month timeline but the budget is perscribed for 1 month of work for 3 developers. It is possible each developer is working for ~1 month but this is not described in the proposal and therefore should not be considered. \n\nOverall the proposal seems compelling and I would love to see WhaleHaven implement Cardano but there is too little detail to feel confident.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2070", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 2, "ng": 13, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 514, "q0": "While this proposal will not do much for tribalism or maximalism, it is attempting to provide the community with a way to swap large holdings from other network to Cardano at low costs.

In this section, I\u2019m usually looking for impacts that are quantifiable to give voters a sense of tangiblity for the impacts of approving the proposal. This proposal does not provide tangibility but I will gladly do the work for them for providing such a low-cost/risk proposal. The only information I could find is the 8.3k Twitter followers on their social media page, which may not seem substantial but it\u2019s certainly enough to be considered well-established. Since it\u2019s all decentralized and anonymous, there\u2019s no way of knowing how many of these followers are whales but OTC cross-chain services is definitely something that would appeal most to whales. The way I see it, this proposal creates another access point for interoperable exchange. As someone that works with many DeFi developers in the Cardano ecosystem, I\u2019ve learned about some widespread difficulties that the Cardano ecosystem has encountered in the process of building interoperable protocols. This is not to say that progress is not well underway but rather to show the value of a preestablished infrastructure that facilitates interoperable trade between the biggest chains in the ecosystem. Additionally, a potential secondary impact that might not be considered here is the networking opportunities that presents itself through this proposal. In my work of communicating with different projects from other ecosystems (more on the networking/partnership side of things), I\u2019ve found that these interoperable partnerships are HUGE Catalysts to fostering new connections with other projects from separate chains. With the indicated intent to integrate more Cardano Native Tokens in the future, I expect the impacts of this proposal to extend beyond just another access point. This scores some major points for Fund 9 in particular, that aims to focus on interoperability and cross-chain integration. For a much lower than average asking price, I think this access point is worth it.

However, there is clear demonstrability in the capability of this team, given that they already have a fully functioning cross-chain DEX and a relatively substantial awareness of it. However, I think voters would appreciate the addition of LinkedIn profiles to verify experience and secure a more confidently positive reaction. As far as the roadmap goes, I think there\u2019s a perfectly acceptable step-by-step plan here that shows voters how long it would take to complete this integration and the timeline appears both reasonable and fast. The budget, however, doesn\u2019t really provide a whole lot of substance to demonstrate efficiency in spending. But in the end, the requested funds is so extraordinarily cheap that the cost of labor couldn\u2019t possibly be inefficient in the amount of time it will take to build this integration out.

The identification of product completion is always a simple one, so I appreciate that this proposal adds a little substance to it with some expectations for communications, social media engagement, awareness, and performance as it benefits the Cardano ecosystem. Where this section really wins some points from me is the commitment to quantified target metrics for the performance of these integrations, which is what links directly to the potential impacts of the proposal. The targets are also relatively substantial both in terms of targeting $1 million volume and the amount of transactions reaching 1000 per week. I would\u2019ve assumed something noticeably lower, so I gain a lot of optimism about this proposal that they set the expectations that high. The only criticism I could offer is the addition of progressively increasing projections on those target metrics to show a more acute sense of performance over a given period of time.
