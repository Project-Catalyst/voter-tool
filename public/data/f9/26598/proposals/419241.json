Given the statement this info could help corroborate the claim.\n\nThe plan is predominantly focused on encouraging more users to use their bridge solution but there isn't really a description about what activities they will conduct to do this. What is required to increase the number of users on your bridge? What activities will you undertake for the marketing and promotion, and where will you do it? Given that you are asking for $10k for both development and outreach, how do you foresee spending this money, and on what exactly? \n\nMoreover, you list your TGE and airdrops but it's not well described in the plan. What will the TGE do for the bridge if it is already up and running? What will you be airdropping?
