Mind you, even the Plutus and EVM implementation should be usable outside of Ethereum in EVM-supported chains like Avalanche, Moonbeam or Acala, for instance.\n\nConsequently, I fully agree that this proposal can have a significant impact in making Cardano interoperable with other chains.

They have an amazing capacity of explaining somewhat technical solutions in layman terms.\n\nIt is possible, however, that their proposed solution doesn't work. Right now their understanding of atomic cross-chain swaps between Plutus and EVM-supported chains is based on existing research but no one has tried this in practice. It could fail. That\u2019s why they are only aiming for a proof of concept with a small budget of $25,000. It\u2019s a small price to pay for this experiment because the potential upside is immense.

This solution would make wrapped tokens redundant and would make swapping assets way easier. The solution itself will be a combination of signatures and timelocks \u2013 what does it mean? It means that if someone would like to trade e.g. ETH for ADA, and such order is placed on each of chains (e.g. ETH sell for ADA on ETH chain). Once such order is created, the creator will become market maker \u2013 thus, the order will be there unless someone matches the offer exactly. Once that happens, assets are locked on each trading side, then confirmation of this lock will happen inside the protocol and traders will be asked for signing.
