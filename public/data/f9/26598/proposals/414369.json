They also wisely added a section to remind us that despite the security of Ouroborus, we participate in the Cardano ecosystem via apps, personal devices, browsers and machines that all have well known vulnerabilities and highly organized threat vectors.\n\nThe solution itself, an OSS CIT platform called OpenCIT, built on a data model called STIX2.1, which itself was standardized by OASIS, is the gold standard for an OSS CIT, and STIX is probably the most developed CIT protocol in the world.  \n\nImportantly, a huge part of the delivery for this security module, is to get it adopted by the communities that can use it.  This isn't a 3rd party security provider, it is open source community tooling to be picked up where and as needed, and as such, it needs an educational component.  They intend to provide this through a professionally produced video as well as a training module for the tool (and I highly recommend anyone interested in training documentation to click through the links in the proposal to the sample module. \n Pretty cool.) \n\nHowever, I must make a note here.  Before I do, let me state that I am not downgrading this assessment based on the point I am about to make, for I feel that it is impossible to separate the actual risk from the potential here.  But I have to say something about an issue that may affect the actual scalability of this platform going forward.  Not all opensource standards share the same outlooks.  The OASIS standard I would describe as a painfully drawn out war of attrition in terms of truly open standards that support FOSS and stand up to corporate interests in the space.  Unlike W3C, which recently overruled Microsoft and google in an important recommendation for DID standards that put community firmly in the driver's seat, OASIS has a history of catering to these corporate members, especially in the form of protecting patents and license fees, and in some ways encouraging some of the predation that goes on in the OSS ecosystem (such as modeling gratuitous price tags for ostensibly opensource governance frameworks, the kinds of frameworks users of this tool may find themselves in need of).  While it is getting better (OSS is an unstoppable idea in some ways, thus the attrition), and STIX is a solid standard for interoperability (right now), I felt it is worth noting, as some voters may feel that this will have an effect on the scalability and interoperability of this toolset in the future.  \n\nAs it relates to this proposal, I don't believe it should be considered unusual that such a proposal would come from the direction of OASIS:  this type of security requires an elevated sense of risk, and large amounts of capital usually draws such concerns, so the fact that CIT is more robust in a corporate ecosystem just makes sense.  Given that the concerns raised by the proposer are highly valid and relevant, and the tooling is a known solution used by many, I believe this proposal to merit the full 5 stars (but with an asterisk.)", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team clearly knows what they are doing.  While they have provided standard bios and links, what really stands out is the thoroughness of their descriptions of the architecture, and especially the detailed GANNTs where you can see each development sprint broken down by the day (for a total of 110 project days over an expected 3 month timeline).  The phase breakdown gives us four phases and the GANNTs show us how the phases overlap, and it is worth noting that I found no egregious oversight in the overlap:  documentation and filmwork ran parallel, development had a couple of stops and starts, but no conflicts.  All in all a well ordered framework to complete the work within.\n\nI really appreciated that they included a note about their contributions to CRI in the US, which turns out trainees for these cyber security protocols, which points to high suitability of this team for the task at hand, which is to onboard a \"community\" to an ethos of threat detection and mitigation.  Beyond just how to use the tool, there is a need for a broader understanding of just what is happening when a security threat is beginning to take shape, and as it iterates.  Knowing where you are is often a factor of knowing where the threat is in its evolution, so training and educating others about how to think about this issue is as critical as tool proficiency.\n\nLikewise, the budget is complete, and divided up roughly by phase.  Given correlation to the phases as described on the GANNT charts, the prices all seem reasonable, and are broken up just enough to reach that conclusion, with the training documentation making up most of phase 3 and the video and documentation closeouts making up phase 4.  In my opinion, for what is being delivered, this actually seems to be a hyper-competitive proposal.\n\nBecause it seems like a good deal, and because the team has thoroughly sourced and described their approach in a reasonable way, I believe they are a strong 5 stars for Feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team lists out metrics for measuring impact, specifically the number of community members onboarded through one means or another, from using the various documentations that they will create, or via the training module.  They didn't think to include their forked OpenCIT repo here, which would be a great source of valid progress updates via commits and issues, and later, via pull requests as the repo gets adopted in the community.\n\nThough there is a heavy component of \"socialization\" of the deliverables (getting the community onboarded), there was less discussion of how they would reach them, however the included web portal (which they describe as \"preliminary\" but which I would describe as rudimentarily comprehensive...I couldn't find a broken link, and everything I followed was a useful resource, including a programmer's guide which I downloaded for myself) is attractive and could function well as a hub for dispensing the deliverables and aggregating the community effort.  As an aside I would like to see the formation of a working group in the community if this were to be funded, as I think that would be a great way to interface and integrate this effort to projects that might use it.\n\nBecause their vision of project is so clear (deliver the TIP and develop the community understanding of it) and mapped so well to the timeline, and because they have provided concrete ways of assessing whether the project is on track I think this proposal merits a full 5 Stars.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 5, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Great insights on the challenge of working with an international standards body (i.e., OASIS)."}, {"id": 10126, "q0": "First of all, I have a comment that you have made a proposal that is right with the topic.
