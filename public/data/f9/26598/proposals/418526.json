It's not a cross-chain collaboration insofar as there is no interoperability improvement here.\n\nScalability: The product should be reasonably scalable to store any kind of password or passphrase as needed.\n\nSustainability Plan: The proposer has committed to multi-year maintenance of the product in addition to the development process, but it's unclear if there is any revenue generation or any income that would make this \"sustainable\" beyond that timeline.\n\nJustification: I generally agree with the proposal's problem/solution match, but maintain a neutral position because I believe this proposal is located in the wrong challenge.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Team Skill Relevance: The proposer mentions he has 25+ years experience in software development, which is reasonably appropriate for such a simple app.\n\nTeam Appropriateness: The proposer mentions they have the right \"team\" in mind for this proposal, but only ever profiles himself, and mentions an Authenly team who will do beta testing for him.  It should be assumed this person is working alone.\n\nBudget Outline/Reasonableness: I believe the budget as an hourly rate of ~$50/hour is resonable, however from my experience managing product development I think that 99 hours is a lot of time to complete this project.\n\nImplementation Plan: The plan for completion and delivery of this project is clear and well laid out.\n\nResource Plan: The resource plan mainly consists of Catalyst funding and the proposers own personal efforts.  But it seems to be sufficient according to the solution described here.\n\nRisk Mitigation: The proposer has evaluated that most of the real technical work has already been completed and there are limited technical risks remaining.\n\nJustification: I generally agree with the feasibility as presented here, but not strongly due to the fact that my evaluation of the proposal's technical complexity is low, funding request is quite generous, and author mentions that much of the work is completed already.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Clear Roadmap/Milestones: A clear roadmap and milestones are presented, although there is not a lot of information on testing and delivery, including limited risk evaluation of what can go wrong during that process.\n\nDefined Metrics/KPIs: The KPIs for success on this proposal are clear...

It looks like we share different views as to where this project should be funded from (if it gets enough successful backing). I truly believe that it has its place in \"Cross Chain Collaboration\" since it will provide a solution which is de-facto \"Cross Chain\". As you mention, it does not provide chain interoperability, but it fits very much this fund's requirement of \"Catalyst-created solutions adopted by other chains and communities\" in the sense that when developed thanks to catalyst funding, it will be available to ALL \"other chains and communities\". \n\nRegarding your comment about revenue generation: this is NOT a commercial product. I am basically committing to develop the product for the community (in exchange of funding), and I do not intend to sell or license the app. The infra cost for supporting the app will be minimal, and I am sure that if the app helps x100,000 users to secure their seed phrases, 3 years time is ample time to allow the community to find ways to support those very low costs beyond my personal commitment.\n\nRegarding your other comments that the funding request is \"generous\" and that my \"past work quality/capability\" cannot be reviewed, I find them misplaced, but I do not think it is the place to argue here. I will only (re)state that: (i) I have given enough justifications for a very detailed costing in my proposal (by the way, I do not see the incentive for me to give away all my work and proprietary coding of the past years for free as you seem to suggest) ; and (ii) there is proof of existing commercial app (iOS / Android) which anyone can download to check the quality of work. \n\nI agree with your last comment that the \"sustainability for the product may extend beyond the contribution lifespan of the initiator\". Somehow, it is the whole point of this proposal: to transform a proprietary \"web 2\" solution into a community backed and open-source \"web 3\" solution, which will live beyond my initial contribution, for the benefit of the community.\n\nThank you again for your feedback and the time you spent to review my proposal."}, {"id": 1372, "q0": "Yes, this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. \n\nWe have all been through it, the fear of losing your seed phrase and in so doing, access to your entire wallet, all your coins, all your NFTs gone. This factor alone is likely to deter (or at least not appeal) to a broad range of individuals for myriad reasons. What Eric and his team suggest is to develop an application (actually upgrade and improve upon an existing app bringing it into web3) to allow users to enter their seed phrase and encrypt it offline without fear of it being hacked. \n\nThis proposal is exciting because it could be applied to any single chain, however, since it would be on Cardano originally, it could also inform other crypto users about our ecosystem. This type of innovation is not about maximalism or wen moon but focuses on moving the yardsticks. It also speaks to why we are here in the first place: to make a global network and financial operating system where everyone is welcome to participate. Smart and easy applications that build trust, like this one, are how we'll get there.

This type of mentality will not survive web3 where individuals will want to have control over their information and data, not \"trust\" a non-accountable third party. \n\nIt is obvious from the proposal that the team has a good understanding of each of the necessary components to be completed. The level of detail in what activities will be completed, at what time frame, and for what cost really take the guessing out of what the community can expect. To me it shows an immense amount of forethought and deliberation. It is maybe the best I've seen yet. Excellent work.

This is true to the Cardano spirit and can inspire confidence that there will be ample opportunity for the community to test and examine the code. This approach will allow the team to only need to solve each problem once, with the help of the community. \n\nThe use of tutorials and animated videos to help explain the issues and support users is also a great idea to explain the process and progress to the community. Users will be able to use the instructions provided to interact with the app and in doing so give valuable feedback on the effectiveness of the tutorials. \n\nBest of luck in the voting round.

You have identified the problem to solve how to keep seed phrases (about crypto wallet security) safe - directly related to your crypto assets. This proposal is built on the Cardano blockchain so it directly adds value to the Cardano ecosystem. If it is successfully applied in practice, the contribution to the Cardano ecosystem is not small. I understand that in the face of many e-wallets that cannot guarantee security (maybe due to subjective reasons of users or objective reasons), this proposal is of great importance to all users. use a cryptocurrency wallet. Therefore, the potential for development as well as the scale of development to solve its future challenges is very large. In other words, it is possible to completely expand the scale of this proposal in the future. I am very interested in your suggestion. I see the potential of the proposal as a premise for continuing to build a community to drive the adoption of the Cardano blockchain around the world. I cannot deny the powerful impact of this proposal. I strongly agree.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "You have 25 years of experience in software development and 3 years involved in cyber and crypto projects. This experience is very valuable, it is one of the bases for our community to believe in the feasibility of the proposal. Especially when you have been funded by Catalyst to implement other proposals at Fund 7 and Fund 8. Regarding the issue of publicity on social networks, you have provided your link on Linkedin. If possible, you can provide some other information about the team members, to give the community more confidence in the team and also a way to increase the feasibility of the proposal. That is my opinion.\nRegarding the budget, you have broken down the budget attached to the work items. I find it reasonable to present it so that the community finds it easy to understand, clear, and easy to audit. Data such as 99 days of work execution time, required work items, and USD57,200 requested for funding have been combined to make it reasonable and consistent with reality. . Through the presentation of the budget, I can see that you are carrying out the work in a very serious and professional spirit. I just have a question, if you have not been funded by Catalyst at Fund 9, will you continue to implement the proposed proposal? Do you have any other backup budget, other than the one waiting from Catalyst?\nRegarding the necessary resources to implement, in addition to the financial resources as I mentioned above, there are also human resources (human resources), etc... I understand the core human resources to implement this proposal. you are an important person in the development of software and cryptocurrencies, but I still want you to prove more clearly that the team can fully meet the needs of human resources to implement this proposal smoothly. What I mean is that you can add the names of the members who propose to increase the trust of the community. I see one thing, you mentioned in the proposal that you and the members make another proposal in parallel with this proposal at Fund 9, does that affect the quality of the work of this proposal? are not? How do you better demonstrate that you and your team can execute this proposal well while still working on other proposals in parallel? That is a reference question that I want to send to the team.\nOn the technical side, I totally agree that you intend to create open-source codes, biometric scanning, user interface design, etc... That session is the work required to create the app. specific tools. With your 25 years of experience in software development, I fully trust you on the team that can handle technology-related issues well so that the application can run well on the device platforms. different mobile devices. However, I still want to emphasize that this application must focus on thorough security, security is extremely necessary to protect each individual's assets, especially in the digital technology environment. Many hackers can steal assets through a few operations on the computer without being revealed. Do you intend this proposal to make the application built on a micro-centralized platform? I think you should consider this because in the future the Cardano blockchain will be a great environment for Decentralized applications to develop.\nFor the rest, I agree with the challenge and risks associated with the implementation you stated (\"security and privacy\" challenge - one of the major challenges of the crypto community that needs to be addressed. as I said above). It is a way to confirm the real effectiveness of the proposal when applied in practice. Another risk that I would like to add is ADA slippage during the implementation of the proposal. I think the team should add this issue to the proposal and consider adjusting the funding request accordingly.\nJust now are my positive comments on the feasibility of the proposal. I recognize this proposal as highly feasible and very practical in life. I would like you to consider my positive comments to improve the proposal. I strongly agree with the feasibility of the proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap and milestones of the proposal are built by you in great detail, it is highly convincing because it is also mixed with technical elements. This speaks to the very high professionalism of you and your team. The only suggestion I have is that if possible, attach milestone roadmaps to specific months in a year. To follow this timeframe, the community can track and evaluate the proposal quickly and smoothly. I think this increases the transparency and control of the proposal. You also provide a key performance indicator (KPI) related to the percentage of the population covered by the photo mobile network, which is essential for today's technology applications. I hope if there are key metrics that appear in the proposal, that would be great. You can consider my comments to help increase the auditability and transparency of the proposal. I am also convinced by the definition of success of this project, when you give a specific number of 400 users at first, then move on to the wider application in practice. In short, the proposal has a fairly high level of transparency and auditability - it has the same good quality as a clear, easy-to-understand description of the problem and a stated solution.

I will try to answer most of your questions:\n\nIn Impact, you wrote \" it is possible to completely expand the scale of this proposal in the future\". You may have ideas that go beyond my initial scope, I would welcome a discussion.\n\nRegarding \"other team members\": \n\n - the tutorials will be developed by Tiffany. You can find more detailed information about her here since she has applied for a tiny grant also in fund 9 for providing Catalyst with \"winner logos and marketing materials\" : https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/421675 - Tiffany has developed visuals, logos, marketing materials, sketch videos and more, for me in the past 7 years. Some were made for large companies (like ScottishPower), some for Tech companies, some for startups or non-profit organisations.  You can also have a look at other sketch videos here: https://cartoonite.com/samples  (although there are many more).\n\n - the tests: I cannot name testers because they may change by the time I get to the need of testing. I have a rota of \"IT student placement\" who would be assigned to this job. However, please note that I will rely on community testing when reaching first alpha or beta stage.\n\n - as you have understood, most (if not all!) of the coding will be done by myself. I was also the one (with the help of Tiffany here above) who developed 100% of the current Authenly app, so I know exactly what to do to develop this web3 solution.\n\nYour question: \n- \"if you have not been funded by Catalyst at Fund 9, will you continue to implement the proposed proposal\" => The answer is NO. If unsuccessful, I may submit the project again in Fund10. I will only work on it as a priority if I can somehow get some funding for it.\n\n- \"Do you have any other backup budget, other than the one waiting from Catalyst\"  => Right now, I do not have any backup budget. If I do not get funded this round, it will postpone the project for a next funding opportunity.\n\nRegarding my ability to cope with two parallel projects (if both are funded), I think that I have given some good rationale and details of work schedule for both projects. If I were to work full time of this \"One Crypto Pass\" project, I would probably deliver (the code / app, not the tutorials) within at most 10 weeks. I have instead given ample time (around 30 weeks) to allow for managing the projects in parallel. My credibility on delivery is very important to me. I am taking commitments in front of the community, and I intend to deliver on my commitments. This is why I am not committing to \"stupid or unrealistic\" deadlines, but I made sure that I WILL deliver what I promise to deliver. Note that if this project is funded but my other fund9 proposal is not funded, I will probably NOT accelerate the development of this project, and I will keep it on the same \"very safe\" delivery timeline.\n\nI am not sure I understand well your question about \"micro-centralized platform\". Basically, I will try to put all / most of the code in the app itself, and use some built-in security features of the mobile device. The \"only\" sensitive data to secure is the user \"one crypto pass\" (the main seed phrase). All the rest will be off line, off device, and encrypted. Maybe we can discuss more details about this solution later.\n\nRe \"ADA slippage\", yes I recognize this, but I have assumed it as my risk. The 6 working days of \"dev risk mitigation\" also indirectly provide cover for this. Worst case, it is me who will get paid less... I can live with this risk. Also, although I have come to the Cardano community recently (Q4 2021), I am now here for the long term (not looking for a quick buck!).\n\nThank you again for the time you spent reviewing this proposal.

The impact of the project is huge as it can be used on any Cardano user, even on other blockchains too.

Although I will do my best to market the product, it will NOT be a commercial product. Beyond the ADA fees I would receive (from funding) and the recognition from the community, I will not gain any additional \"monetary reward\" for the app. So at some point in the future, it will have to be pushed by the community, not \"just me\". This is where my \"commitments\" are more difficult to \"guarantee\".

The QR code contains the seed phrase that no one can decipher. Guaranteed safety, security. Proposals impact challenges and are described in detail. When opening a crypto account, self-sovereign and having your own 15-word seed phrase, there is a risk of anyone seeing and possibly accessing your wallet and emptying it. The proponent has a working prototype, which is already available as an app on the AppStore. As for Cardano wallet keys, it would be interesting to give those Cardano users the ability to view their wallet balance, if there are 4 Cardano accounts there will be a secure storage for 4 private keys, but also can see the consolidated balance of 4 wallets, which is a great convenience for the Cardano user community.

In addition, to increase the profile of Cardano compared to all other blockchains, the author will create introductory videos about the application, explainer videos based on Cardano.

So you are NOT at risk of anyone stealing a password.\n\nQ: \"if I lose my phone, does this mean I can lose all the keys to my wallets?\" - No, you do not loose your keys to your wallets, since they are NOT on internet, and NOT on your device. They are only encrypted on a piece of paper when you created them.

I have taken sufficient leeway to allow for a \"safe delivery\" of the project.\n\nRe testing: part of the test are automated (postman test, see section \"setup phase -  build scripts, ongoing postman tests\"), so they will not require extra headcount. It is also hoped that the community will adopt the app and provide beta testing, in addition of the 6 days of test that we have allowed internally (not a huge workload, less than 50 hours) \n\nRe number of videos, it will be reviewed a bit later, but I will make sure to include all essential ones. The most important ones will be the onboarding / explanation videos which will get first priority.\n\nThank you again for your feedback, review, and support."}], "solution": "I have designed a solution to allow self-custodian wallet owners keep their seed phrase safe, off internet, not in plain sight, but still accessible at will via a simple QR code scan.", "experience": "I have been developing software for 25+ years, and have been involved in cyber and crypto projects for over 3 years now. I have already developed by myself a (web2) prototype showing that what I intend to deliver is feasible. I have the right team to build on this prototype."}
