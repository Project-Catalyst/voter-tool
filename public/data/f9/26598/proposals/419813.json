The purpose of this ticker is to focus on timeline regarding to the Catalyst, and provides updates about phases \u2013 proposal submission, assessing, voting etc.  I agree that it will serve as an easy entry point for anyone interested. The only suggestion I am having is to always keep relevant hasthtags in posts e.g. Cardano/blockchain/cryptocurrency \u2013 just to attract even those who are not already knowing what project catalyst is (based on inspection of one tweet provided as an example, where only \u201cprojectcatalyst\u201d was added). This could potentially increase the desired impact for crosschain collaboration, serve also for onboarding, and increase the audience in general. I am taking one star down, because the impact will be primarily on newcomers (veterans=more than 2 funds, are already used for TH + telegram announcements) therefore the target group will be narrowed a bit. Overall I like the idea, I am just not convinced that it will be causing as much impact on Cardano, and that somehow many cross chain collaborations will emerge. I think its primary goal would be to keep newcomers up to date + onboard those who are wandering twitter hashtags with interest in cryptocurrencies.

The proposer outlined topics that will be tweeted, and these follow the fund phases + some updates or relevant tricks will be posted as needed e.g. save all three assessments one by one (useful advice for newcomers, for sure). The requested budget is 850 USD, for 4 months, with hourly rate of 25/USD. Right now, I find it reasonable and justified enough, for the future, it would be nice to track the number of followers or interactions to actually assess whether this service is needed and is growing on popularity. \u2013 I am reacting for the possibility to ask funding for another fund.

I think the proposer did not get completely the meaning of cross chain collaboration. \nMoreover, the proposer states that there will be a decreasing of the FOMO related to following the official channel.

The initial idea/product itself has very limited impact towards creating cross-chain collaborations. With the reasoning as following ; (1) it currently largely only shares info on Project Catalyst based activities, this I categorize as not effective, for to be involved in Project Catalyst one would need a series of onboarding learning through direct involvement or a series of documentations. Which IOG/CF (pardon my lapse in memory on whom) has already provided. It is a detailed onboarding document, which perhaps is more effective. Hence, the proposer would benefit if the Tweets had some relevance with this onboarding document. (2) approaching other chains, based on my experience is best done when there are similarities between one-chain or another. Not specifically to be technical but conceptually would also do. For instance ; the content of the Tweet can compare the process of how different chains validate their nodes, where Harmony does X and Cardano does Y. These similarities can then start bridging questions. These questions would most likely lead to asking more about Cardano. As is, the Tweets takes time for non-Cardano people to understand and is a bit redundant in terms of does it provide any unique and interesting news/updates on Cardano to the Cardano community itself.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Based on amount itself, I would gladly take a blind eye.

(2) $50/2 (two) hours/week to study and compile data to become Tweets is an acceptable amount. But since the deliverables is a Twitter account, as a social media manager, which you are partially attempting to do, you need to provide the number of tweets you will submit. If $200 only gets us 1 (one) tweet that would not be cost-effective for the Cardano community. I could go even deeper but the most crucial element that needed to be address is what specifically are the number of tweets you plan to do. This comment continues into the Auditability section", "q1r": 4, "q2": "When it comes to creating a Twitter account and managing it, the most key deliverables will be as following (1) quantity of tweets and (2) quality of those tweets.

While quality is a bit harder to judge for it involves the following ; (1) copywriting, (2) use of visual media, (3) time of tweet, (4) use of hashtag, (5) use of metadata and etc. All of these are usually provided in a social media calendar, which you unfortunately did not provide. I absolutely have no issue with someone attempting to become a social media manager but it would have been beneficial if you were to first look up things such as ; (a) How to become an influencer?, (b) How to create an impactful Twitter account? and etc. You did though provide timelines but it is very simplistic, social media calendar is a daily base project. Each day you either prepare the content for the next day or for the next week. The next day perhaps you prepare the graphics. The next day you inform the time you will tweet, the topic and etc. It is to be honest, super extensive. You might want to counter by, I am only just starting.

The difference between Catalyst Ticket compared to other media sites is that the information will be summarized in a concise, easy-to-understand, beautifully presented way. A channel to update information and Catalyst news is a place where communication for the community with Catalyst is very necessary, but it is not a cross-chain, bridge technology product to connect other blockchains with Cardano Blockchain. However, since this is a channel of communication and sharing of Catalyst information and news, it will contribute to the realization of the ultimate goal of this Challenge which is \u201c Let\u2019s create an enriching, open and safe environment, where people from different communities can find common ground and share knowledge, resources, skills, ideas, and visions with one another\". Therefore, it can be said that this idea is relatively consistent with the overall goal of the Challenge. In terms of impact, Catalyst Ticket's current followers are only about 196 people.
