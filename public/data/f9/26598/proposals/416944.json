Gameplay will be similar to off-chain games like Hearthstone and Magic: The Gathering.\u201d The objective would be to encourage exchanges between players from different chains, promoting exchanges of experiences and the popularization of Cardano. It is positive that the proponent includes a short video that demonstrates a match, so that we can understand more about what this game would look like in practice. It is also very positive that the proponent already has such well-defined benefits and results; In addition to the primary outcome of creating an NFT game that interacts with multiple blockchains, players communicate via social media to discuss the game itself. In this sense, it would be interesting if, in addition to the game itself, a Discord channel was also created especially to talk about it, if this discussion was somehow fostered, encouraged. It is known that tournaments would be streamed from Twich, in order to further engage the gaming community. I believe that the only thing that could be better defined here would be how the members of the other blockchanis would be attracted to this game, how can it stand out from so many other similar projects (card games using NFTs)? What would be the strategy to attract players? It would be interesting if this could be explained better. Another positive is that the target audience is very well defined (\"NFT Artists and Developers - We will establish working groups with NFT projects on various blockchains to integrate their NFTs into the shared gaming experience\" + \"NFT Owners - The game will provide a shared gaming experience where NFT owners of multiple blockchains can create cards from their NFTs, play in single and multiplayer games and tournaments, and form new communities around cross-chain and interoperability\u201d). So the only open question here, as I see it, is really how such players would be attracted. Other than that, I believe that the project fulfills well what the challenge seeks, especially the subtopics of projects and dApps from other chains implemented in Cardano; growth in on-chain activity due to new cross-chain implementations; number of proposals including participants from other blockchain communities and finally the number of technical implementations connecting Cardano to other blockchains. Therefore, I will give a score of 4 for the impact, if the doubts raised here were clarified, I believe that the impact deserved a maximum score.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal's script is not adequate, as it is very superficial. The ideal would be for the timeline to be divided into months, and for each of them to have their activities very well explained/detailed. For example, in the first two months, the project\u2019s focus would be to promote integration between Cardano and Solana blockchains. How would 5 Solana projects be integrated, what would these projects be, how would they be selected and how would members of the Solana community be attracted to our blockchain, what would be the advantages presented to them? The same would happen in months 3 and 4, but with the focus on Ethereum. How can we make the members of one of the best consolidated blockchains in the cryptographic market understand about Cardano and its many advantages? In months 5 and 6, the public launch would take place and the cross cross chain tournaments would be established, so it is deduced that the final product would already be fully developed, but it is not clear through which phases this Dapp would pass to be considered ready. It would be necessary for this entire path to be unraveled and extensively detailed, so that we have a solid understanding of the whole. Talking about the costs, they could also be better explained. The total (37k) is broken down into a few parts, some of which are more detailed (like: $10,500 (Game design/coding \u2013 140 hours @ $75/hr), $4,200 (Encoding/backend/server \u2013 70 hours @ $60/hr) and $10,000 Art (10x $1,000 flat fee per NFT project, involve original artists when possible, in-house when not). Others, however, needed further explanation. We don't know the hourly rate of web developers, nor what the \u201ccommunity building\u201d would be and why would it cost 5000 dollars; nor do we have solid information on how the marketing would be done, how the project would be promoted and why it would cost 3300 dollars? Talking about the team, this is the most appropriate part of the feasibility topic, because we are very well introduced to each member involved. We know their names, professional backgrounds and how they relate to Cardano (no one is an expert per se, but certainly are enthusiastic people smated with our blockchain and from what I understand have recently become active members of our community. Therefore, I believe that the topic has positive sides, in fact, but it also needs more details, especially in relation to the script.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Speaking of auditability, unfortunately the proponent does not provide us with precise ways to follow the projects that would be developed until the final product (the NFT game). In fact, all it gives us is a series of goals in relation to partial results, such as number of blockchains integrated in the game, number of NFT project collaborations, number of users, tournaments and so on. In fact, all these metrics are important to realize the results that would be little by little being achieved, the small successes. But how can we control the work of the team in relation to the development of this technology. The products and the processes behind them are different things, and both of those things need to be audited, but it's only focused on the products here. So, to solve this, the first thing that needs to be done in my opinion is to provide a more detailed roadmap, which informs us precisely about the work routines of the professionals involved. Then, at each passing X of time, the project leader would have to meet with the team in order to understand how their daily work has been developing, if everything that was planned was being fulfilled, what would be behind the results. partials presented here. And then it would be necessary for the entire Cardano community to be aware of this situation (I suggest they establish some official means of communication with our community, be it discord, town hall, telegram, etc.). Speaking finally of success, it is well defined as \u201ca playable game that new players + there will be an active player community, with NFT projects being used from at least 3 blockchains, and the project will be \u201ccompleted\u201d after the completion of a cross-chain tournament. (However, development will continue beyond this point and will seek to integrate more nft networks and projects in the future).\u201d We know what the desired scenario looks like in general, but in a way this can become more palpable for Cardano, that is, how can we be sure that this project contributed to popularizing our blockchain, how can we prove the effects of all this for our ecosystem ? In my view, the most direct way for us to do this would be through understanding how these players coming from other blockchains would be relating to Cardano. Would they have been involved with other projects on our blockchain, be it games or Dapps in general? They became active members of our community, how can this all be perceived? It would be necessary for a survey to be established, raising qualitative and quantitative data that demonstrate the effects of the game on our ecosystem. Having said that, I think auditability has its positive points, but it is still not adequate, requiring improvements in the various points discussed here.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 8, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 6103, "q0": "The team proposes to create a cross-chain game using NFTs from multiple blockchains as tokens in the gameplay experience. The gameplay will be similar to off-chain games like Hearthstone and Magic: The Gathering. To address the problem of \"on-chain\" games that lack interoperability and limit players to using a single blockchain. The cross-chain card game is called \"NFT Fighters\", and is a 2-player card game that allows players to use NFTs from multiple NFT projects within the game. The intended audience is NFT holders and game players from Cardano and other blockchains. The project will promote communication and collaboration between Cardano and other blockchains. Results will be communicated through press, posts, on social media and the game's website, Twitter, Discord and Youtube. The tournaments will be streamed on Twitch. Proposed impact on the challenge posed. Here the team is aiming to fund game development projects using Blockchain and the various tools that the Cardano ecosystem provides. It is undeniably a relevant and profitable game technology industry in today's tech sector. The idea here is that players can create products in the NFT format, minted on the Blockchain. This helps Cardano's game expand and makes more people aware of NFT and especially Blockchain. Besides, the author of the proposal also recognizes the possible risks. At the same time, there are solutions to minimize risks when the proposal is implemented.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "We have the information we need about the proposal's plan to measure project viability.

However, the activities listed, we do not know the exact time, the project will be implemented at what time. (will be implemented when funded, what month of the year and during the year?). From what I understand, the roadmap of work to be done in the project presented by the team is from January to June. But, the first 6 months of the year have passed. So when is the roadmap given when the project will be implemented and completed? Next is the budget. The suggested budget requirement is $37,000. Takes less than 10% of the total challenge value and is reasonably explained. In my opinion, the requested value is quite reasonable given the complexity of the proposal. The team provided a very detailed budget sheet. The budget allocated for each job is very specific, estimated by the hour, each job needs to be done to complete the project. Finally, about the team of team members. Group presentations are best presented here. We know the members are all people with the right skills and experience to do the work on the project. Also, the author provides written representations of each member and attaches a link to tell us more about the history and experiences of the members the proposal presents.

I\u2019m quite delighted to know that this game will be based on the well-known hit from Blizzard Entertainment, Hearthstone, which has enchanted thousands and thousands of players worldwide, and It\u2019s true of what the proposer describes of the current situation of on-chained games not having interoperability and limited to one single particular blockchain. Therefore, \u201cNFT Fighters\u201d should be able to tackle the requirements of this Challenge. \nThe target audience that the project aims towards is relevant, perhaps this project could hold the potential to appeal to the NFT-holding gamers who seek to have an intellectually stimulating time or just an enjoyable experience, and not only gamers and NFTs owners are allowed to join in the fun, but NFTs artists and developers can also take advantage of the main functionality of the game to fuse their own NFTs into the mix. The desirable outcome also aligns well with the objectives of the Challenge, which are to promote association and cooperation between Cardano and other blockchains by utilizing NFTs made from various blockchains, and forge new adoptions of players and users via creating a joined community where communications, interactions and discussions are made amongst players and future tournaments streamed on Twitch. Furthermore, It is commendable for the team to publicly display their successes through different social media platforms such as Twitter, Discord and Youtube. The proposal has also listed out 3 possible obstacles standing in the way of delivering the project, all of which come with respective viable resolutions, though I would want them to be slightly more detailed.\nStill, I believe that this section of the proposal is still missing some key points in order to make it extra convincing. Firstly, It still lacks the content regarding major components of the game that gamers and those interested in the project would love to know more of, such as gameplay mechanics, game lore, setting(s) and different modes that the game features. I understand that NFT Fighters is based on Hearthstone and Magic: The Gathering, two quite popular games, but still, there are some people who have no knowledge of them, so adding said details would be highly helpful. And I believe the game could use some innovative and outstanding elements regarding gameplay to make it distinguish from those 2 games above, so that when players get to enjoy the game, they could still see the difference of NFT Fighters from others with similar game mechanics. Secondly, this proposal still needs the presence of key metrics or KPIs and some enclosed estimated figures to conceptualize a possible successful future of the project. Therefore, I suggest that the proposer supplement those two key sets of information for maximum persuasiveness.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "As for the roadmap and milestones provided in this section, the team sticks closely to the concept introduced in the Impact section, which is to integrate 2 current major blockchains in the cryptocurrency world, Solana and Ethereum, into the game, and carefully release 2 beta tests for each blockchain to ensure proper functionalities. Only then would the team launch the public version of the game and start hosting Cross-Chain tournaments. Following that process, I have every right to hope for a positive outcome for the project, though, personally, I wish to see more information relating to what goes down during each phase of formation in order to have a more comprehensive look.\nThe individuals involved in this project all come with proper introductions, including their respective positions, duties, relevant expertise and past experiences, and especially their personal drive to join this project. The Lead Developer also has an affiliated LinkedIn profile to offer a deeper look, though the remaining 2 do not. I still wonder whether the team should enlist more hands on deck from the community or not, especially at least one specializing in Cardano its functionalities and resources, since to me this is a quite ambitious project and they expect to deliver the game in 6 months. Still, I have faith that with dedication and passion, they can still manage to pull it off. I\u2019m not entirely sure if the requested budget is reasonable since I have no experience or expertise in the field of blockchain development, but from what is on display so far in this section, I believe that the budget should be sufficient and justifiable.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "For this section, the team has outlined some key metrics to measure their desired success and expected goals to gain in the foreseeable future, though they have only focused on the initial success and vaguely described the sustainable objectives to steady themselves in the long run. I believe the proposal has lacked methods to track their progress, therefore, I would advise the proposers to utilize powerful tracking tools such as JIRA or GitHub, or have a dedicated website where news, updates and changes to the project can be posted and available to all parties, both internal and external. \nSuccess for this project, undoubtedly, would be a fully functional game that appeals to a mass number of users and upcoming goals to expand the game (though insufficiently detailed, as I have stated above). However, there is one considerably crucial detail that the proposal has failed to include, which is the exact benefits and profits that the Cardano blockchain can expect to reap from this project.

If you check their video from YouTube link they provided, they claim that that is a video of a prototype. The video just shows a gameplay, which is not that bad but kind of a repetitive idea, and shows no proof for the prototype. It might very well be just a video project. Making other blockchain communities interact with each other and Cardano community is a good idea. As a gamer myself, implementing this through gaming really got my attention. However, as I read the proposal my attention faded away. \n\nI want to talk about some of negative aspects of the proposal. It mentions, implementing other blockchain technologies and making users engage but does not talk about how it will make it happen. Yes the ideas is good but just an idea is never enough. They mention using some platforms, Twitter, Discord and Twitch. They did not give any links to their accounts; which either means they do not take this seriously enough to open these accounts beforehand or they do not take this seriously enough give these links. Either way it is not a good look. I would also expect them to show some things that they are making with other NFT communities. Giving a few examples here would solidify the idea but again they failed to do so or showing the results. \n\nThe proposal has some strong parts as well. Especially under the risks section. As I was reading the script I thought that how they will measure and assign some value for each NFT. For example, let\u2019s say I want to make my NFT into a card in the game, but I would not want it to be some card with lower statistics. Mentioning fair balance is a positive for me.\n\nOne more thing before I end this part; their YouTube video description says \u201cIf you're interested in helping to support NFT Fighters, vote in Project Catalyst Fund 7 (January 20 - February 3, 2022).\u201d. Were they planning to write this proposal and failed to do so or is this a repeat proposal I do not know. But still, small details like these matter the most in my opinion. Only positive aspect for me is the idea.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "It felt like they mixed together the roadmap, milestones and timeline. They have all of that but it lacks detail. They will do the Cardano-Solana integration within the first 2 months, but how? This intagration cannot simply be given like this. This is a vary complicated idea to be given even without a sentence. Same thing can be said about other steps as well. \n\nIn the budget part they gave some workhours but I did not understand how they did determine these. There will be 140 hours for game design and coding; without explanation I do not trust this hours and budget. Or for the marketing. They asked for $3,300, why they need or how they will spend it there is no explanation.\n\nAlthough team members did not submit anything about them except their own words, other than Lead Dev John, they seem to have experience but with this poor planning I cannot say this project is feasible.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Progress measurements are a bit arbitrary also, just like the budget planning. Still at least they have put some quantitative values for their progress. Getting 500 users is a good way to measure their success. At the end of everything if they can give the community a playable game it will mean that they became successful but with this poor planning it is very hard for them to reach that stage.

The impact is clearly demonstrated: through this game, users will interact with the Cardano community and learn more about it, raising awareness about this blockchain. A secondary impact that is mentioned is a newfound cross-chain community which helps to drive the blockchain community forward once properly implemented. Several other problems are tackled through this project: tribalism, interoperability and coordination across chains. By bonding gamers from different chains, more exposure will be given to the blockchain community as a whole rather than through the fame of one distinct chain. The proposer will work on other NFT projects to integrate this into the game as an incentive to NFT owners out there to join the game. The risks identified are equality between gamers from different chains, between different NFT owners and the possible hostility of NFT project communities. As these are already identified, the proposer will make adjustments to the game to assure fairness between gamers and all are motivated to win; they will seek to collaborate with open-minded NFT communities. However, the most major concern that has not been mentioned by the proposer is the risk of not being able to attract gamers in the first place. To fully address this, the proposer should analyze the cross-chain game markets to identify some possible competitors and then draw a comparison board to show the strengths of the proposal\u2019s card game in attracting gamers.
