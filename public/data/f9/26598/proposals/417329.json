What the team had to say about this latter point was particularly interesting, in that they found zero resistance from these traditional artists towards migrating work to Cardano, they simply didn't know that it was an option.  This critical issue, that artists eager to approach the space lack education on their options, and how the options they do have interrelate, is the problem this proposal seeks to address.\n\nThe events are currently targeted as one day events at 14 total venues in Europe over the course of 12 months, with some of those presumably taking place at their \"home base\" in Barcelona.  They also suggest that due to the learning experience from the prototype that they envision some of these events (again, I am going to assume this iteration takes place at their own venue) will actually be developed into events that take place over more than a day, and could stretch over a week or so to allow space for what I feel are the critical components of the proposal, which is the hands on and 1-to-1 exposure to the educational resources they will create.  Further, they envision the creation of a \"playbook\" which is at the root of the scalability of this project:  documentation, which includes how-tos, tutorials and reference will be the key to adoption of this methodology (and I would personally like to see them explicitly opensource this playbook.  This isn't something I would mark the proposal down for, but I think it would improve it even more.)\n\nAlignment with the challenge setting, through their approach of blockchain generally, Cardano specifically threads the needle between supporting other chains and experiences while presenting the best of Cardano.  The most relevant statement I saw to the issue of cross-chain interoperability, was a principle they formulated as the artists and builders facing the same fundamental problems, and the pursuit of collaboration across all ecosystems being a way to find key answers that help everyone.  This kind of multi-chain thinking is the underpinning of the challenge setting.\n\nBecause of this multi-chain alignment, as well as the ability to scale it to wider and wider application, I believe that this project can deliver real-world impact to users of Cardano, and I give it a full 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is well known via hosted podcasts and community involvement from the earliest days of Cardano.  They helpfully also included plenty of contact information and professional details, and the website was also a trove of information to follow up on the general ArtSuite philosophy and methodology.\n\nBut where the team's work really shines is that they tested this concept before presenting it to Catalyst.  While there wasn't a detailed deep dive on the KPIs of the prototype (such as number of participants, number of attendees, etc.) there was plenty of details for how they believe the data they collected will inform the iteration and development of the events as they move forward.  In particular, it seems like they are zeroed in on the cost of the events themselves, which is 80% of the funding request, which is a huge vote of confidence for their budget numbers.  In addition, it is clear that they developed the general KPIs based on this prototype, and the Risk Mitigation section actually has a pretty good description of their process and helped me appreciate how they are approaching this as an iterative endeavor.\n\nThere was a slight lack of clarity regarding the issue of sustainability, in the form of the events being able to become self-financing, but I don't believe it warrants being marked down, as it isn't critical to the delivery of this proposal, more the long term impact.  I would have liked to have seen a more specific vision of how these events reach that stage, and a clarification of when they envision that happening (by the end of the 12 mos or after the first 4 events?)\n\nBecause the team has demonstrated work done and a solid approach to an emergent process, and because they have included excellent details on their roadmap and budget, I believe that a full 5 stars are warranted.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The plans to lean into their existing social media and web presence for transparency and availability, which should work well based on the amount of exposure they appear to have in those areas.  The KPIs they have listed are vetted from their prototype event, and while I would have liked to see a comparison of the prototype to the expected metrics to be obtained (in order to get a sense of what kind of growth rates and long term impact was possible here) for the delivery of this proposal, the included KPIs should be adequate to measure progress.\n\nWhile the majority of their success criteria are kind of abstract (opening up a world of opportunity, facilitating a digital art revolution) and hard to pin down, their first criteria is also the best for thinking about the deliverables here: \"create a structure for a self sustaining model of cross chain event that can be replicated and adapted all around the world\".  As the 12 months of this timeline pass, the events act as learning opportunities to continue to dial in the playbook.  It is worth noting, then, that they neglected to include the delivery of the playbook (and perhaps more importantly the iterated development of the playbook) as a critical KPI in the auditing section.  Because this info is presented elsewhere I don't believe this deserves a markdown, but as advice going forward, this playbook will be a key part of the accountability and auditability of this project, as it captures the real time learning from holding the events.  The proposers are encouraged to avoid considering it \"done\" and to lean into it as the basis of the auditing protocol, with their identified metrics being the \"validation\" of the quality of the deliverable, rather than the deliverable themselves.\n\nDespite the need to reorganize some pieces of information in the proposal itself, I do believe that the combination of live events, documentation of those events, and the retrospective in the form of the playbook, along with the general availability and transparency of the team merit full marks for auditability:  5 stars.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 4, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3462, "q0": "the idea of briging together art in real life (in a gallery format) and Cardano seems great and impactful in a sense to drive Cardano adoption. Proposers is suggesting to do so in partnerships with NFT artists that operate in other blockchain in order leverage from a two-way perspective both Cardano and these other blockchains, each one contributing to another. At the same time, these NFT artists can potentially migrate to Cardano as they see its benefit. In this way, proposal addresses the challenge very well (one example provided in the challenge is \"Common research, education, outreach and innovation projects with other chains and communities\" which clearly fits this one). Proposal also is well articulated and show its value proposition in a clear way and solution will be delivered in several languagues (maybe it could be mentioned which ones). A prototype event was already held (video is provided) and seemed to have been a success. With this project, tools to replicate it in all over the world will be ellaborated and shared in the community and other events will be made. The only thing that could be added to make proposal richer is an advertsing strategy to share the playbook. A communication well made among Cardano community and artists on what will be developed here would help to accelrate the process.\nTaking it all into account, I totally agree that this proposal addresses the challenges and has a high impact potential. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There's a sensible roadmap in place with general activities and a long term vision in its end. A step-by-step on how to organize these events is also provided. What could be added here as activties is the marketing part, when the people to attend would be reached and engaged. Budget breakdown is well done, considers 14 events in one year,which is a reasonable number, and matches project scope and roadmap. Here the advertsement budget is considered.\nRegarding the team, there are 6 people already committed with diverse experiences in Art curation, social events, management, communication, innovation and technology. Most of them seems also to have had good contacts with Cardano so far, even though it seems not to had been part of their \" core regular educational background\". Moreover, they already executed a prototype so I guess they wont have a hard time to put this project into action.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There are 5 good metrics provided to track project success. However, some of them could have targets, as the number of attendes and artists on the platform(only the number of events seems to have it, by the fesibility section (14)). These targets could be set in a % increase manner as more events are being held, for example. It is understable that it is hard to set them at first but as there was a prototype already, maybe some guesses could be made. I liked though that proposer already exposed the way they where provide these infomation to the community, this is key for transparency. An extra metric that could be added is the feedback from  attendees, artits and even those who used the playbook to organize the events on ther own. This could be measued by surveys, for instance, and would help to evaluate success. \n Definition of succes is fair but seems a bit subjective, hard to assess later if those points were reached. Maybe they could be translated into something more measurable.\nAll in all, proposal seems generally auditability, just some minor details could be enhanced to make it more robust.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2461", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 3, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7295, "q0": "The proposal aims to organize ArtSuite multi-chain NFT events, which are held globally, introducing Cardano NFT to all artists, both from other Blockchain platforms as well as new users NFT.

The budget is clearly and easily itemized, the budget is calculated for 14 events held in the capitals of different countries in Europe, including salary for a full-time event organizer. to sue. Total budget is 90000 USD, in my opinion that is reasonable. A positive thing is that the proposed team also spent their own money to carry out the prototype event, showing that the team has also tried and been active in building and developing the ArtSuite platform in particular and the ecosystem.

Through the recent prototype event, they conceptualise artist events and create standardised educational material in the most spoken languages in the world, that can be used in any future event under the guarantee of The Art Suite. At once, there is a huge potential of future Cardano users and NFT creators that are just waiting to be explained the concept of blockchain in general and the superior technology of Cardano in particular, and with proper guidance, most artists with a following are very open to being taught and guided into the Cardano ecosystem, and will then exponentially spread the word about Cardano, about what Cardano stands for and especially about Cardano NFTs.\nBlockchain technology in general is a tool to make a better world and that everybody is welcome to try their luck on other blockchains as well, and that integration and interoperability are essential into making a lasting difference in the artist\u2019s world; and the Art Suite is an artist launch platform with a social mission, supporting a range of projects around the world in the spirit of Cardano and all artists from other chains are welcome and needed to create a global family of artists with a Big Heart.

In my opinion, the author should bring out more meanings of this risk, such as information of organizing placement, of documents for event, or of communication,\u2026.However, the proposal gave how to mitigate the risk: they have our educational material ready and easily accessible for all guests; and there is a separate space and time for the artists to be able to sit down with the team that organises the event, to be able to absorb the information they provide about blockchain technology as a whole and the Cardano blockchain, and its philosophy of interoperability in particular; and at each event, the organising partners are selected carefully and with certain criteria to determine their capacity to deliver, for example in the quality of their communication with their artist communities.\n\"", "q0r": 4, "q1": "\"The team members will organise successful educational cross chain events by a detailed plan by the necessary steps: ceating a team with essential skills and experience; creating standard educational material in several languages; finding a suitable venue, and suitable, skilled and reliable partners in the city the event will take place; and the next event would take place in a much larger venue for several weeks and will have a much larger outreach,\u2026.With a clear Roadmap, specific milestones, long term visions, and how the team manage workload are enough for the proposal to achieve the goals that they desired.

In the section, there is a small shortcoming of technical aspects, as languages, technologies necessary to implement the plan, but maybe it doesn\u2019t affect too much.\nA detailed budget breakdown aligning with the above plan is also proposed, including: one time expense for creation of standard educational material; payment for team salary, payment for 1 actual physical event (advertising, event staff, travel expenses, catering, technical equipment,\u2026.).
