Proposals wants to integrate  a javascript library (Aries Js) into the RootsWallet, allowing Cardano DApps that make use of identities to understand identities from other chains. The implication for this in the gaming and other industry is huge. \n\nThe proposal provides a detail solution with easy to follow list of features (and capability) to be provided. The proposal provides spells out it's impact to the Cardano community and ties directly back to the challenge ask. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal provides detailed milestone and timeline with a total duration of 3 months. There's high-level details about of each \"activity\" or milestone. \n\nThe budget seems reasonable with line item detailed of broken down costs.  The team already has lots of experience in the identity and SSI space, deliver 5 related proposals to date and 7 more in development. Given short time span of this proposal, the pace at which previous proposals were completed, I don't believe their current workload will negatively affect their ability to deliver this proposal in the proposed 3 months. \n\nFive stars all around!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As this is a software product, the deliverables are clear.

In addition, this proposal is aligned with the key metrics from the cross-chain collaboration challenge setting that is making expansion of Cardano-based projects into other chains (in this case, RootsWallet is Cardano-based project that will be expanded so it could operate with Hyperledger Aries). This is according to cross-chain collaboration is about, that is to create new connections between Cardano and different blockchain. And of course, in the future this RootsWallet could be integrated with other chain/framework to increase the interoperability if needed. Taking everything into consideration, I give 5 stars for the impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In terms of experiences with Atala PRISM & Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), I think RootsID team is one of the most active team in Cardano community that brings lots of benefit to this field. One of their projects is this RootsWallet that is funded since Fund 7 alongside with another project such as WAL-CLI, which is already completed & delivered. Furthermore, I know these guys from Atala PRISM Pioneer 1st cohort, and they are active to promote Cardano in global SSI meetings. So, I believe that they could deliver the project if funded. Equally important is the budget for the development that they requested is clearly defined in the proposal. All things considered; I give 5 stars for the feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "To start with, let\u2019s take a look on the roadmap & milestones. RootsID team defined the work for total 3 months. During this period, they will build Aries library into the RootsWallet code plus doing integration, testing, and documentation. As this project is open-source, the community could track the project progress via their GitHub(https://github.com/roots-id) and also check their Sprint burndown chart. Last but not least, they included also clear description of solution to address the challenge that they would like to solve via this project in the proposal.

The RootsWallet Team has put forward an innovative and exciting digital identity wallet and now plans to integrate Aries Framework JavaScript into RootsWallet. This is exciting as the Aries JS is a major framework for building SSI solutions that is already being implemented by a variety of different groups and sectors. \n\nBy integrating the Aries JS in the RootsWallet, there will be more opportunities for individuals to transfer credentials between the two. Moreover, the interoperability is not just for Cardano but also will allow roots wallet to interact with credentials from a broad array of chains (or other sources) without needing to be fully educated on Cardano or identity solutions. This type of low-barrier adoption will only make Cardano more appealing while reaching the goal of being a fully interoperable blockchain. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. The RootsWallet team continues to deliver and has been successfully providing value to the Cardano community since F6. \n\nWhat also provides confidence in the feasibility of this proposal is that it is part of a broader series of optimizations and integrations the team is adding to RootsWallet. The wallet is already built, and now come the add ons. \n\nLastly, the team is well positioned to do this work and participates in a suite of different SSI communities in pursuit of their objectives. To me, this inspires confidence that the proposers are serious as they are not just looking to turn a profit but instead deliver true value.

However, the team doesn't rely on their track record but also uses Github for its code which is open sourced, and therefore can be confirmed or questioned by the community. \n\nIn addition to the open source code, the team will provide documentation explaining how to use the new Aries functionalities within RootsWallet. This documentation can be used directly be the community to interact with these functionalities, meanwhile these interactions will illuminate whether the documentation is effective, providing a constant feedback loop the team can use to improve its documentation.

RootsID already provides backend agents based on it, however RootsWallet, the mobile identity wallet, does not yet support it. The author has come up with a solution to the problem. RootsID will integrate Aries' JavaScript framework into RootsWallet and pave the way to interoperability with most Sovereign Identity systems in the blockchain community. In my opinion, the proposal impacts the challenge and is detailed and richly described. Hyperledger Aries is a mature library that provides a shared toolkit. RootsId regularly interacts with Hyperledger Aries developers at SSI meetings. The team is developing an interoperable open source SSI ecosystem, and is focusing on integrating Aries JS into RootsWsllet. And is: The first and only \"Open Source Mobile Identity Wallet\" for ATALA Prism. will technically be able to use many of the features of Aries JS. Integrating the Aries open source identity ecosystem with the Cardano open source identity ecosystem is interoperable with much of the SSI industry.

We know the members are all people with the right skills and experience to do the work on the project. At the same time, the author also provides texts presentation about each member, and attaches links to let us know more about the history and experience of the members that the proposal has presented.

The team has delivered short-term success: is having a cloud agent, and a mobile agent, based on Aries. long-term success, is to use RootsWallet, to utilize Aries functions, and to interface with projects outside of PRISM, and Cardano, to authenticate information from multiple ecosystems.
