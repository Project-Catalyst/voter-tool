Given that Charles came from Ethereum, there is an unnecessary amount of animosity between these two communities. By cohosting the event together not only will it be great exposure to different blockchains for the participants, it will also portray a more collegial relationship between the two chains, not mired in drama. \n\nIn addition to the impact being created for those who attend the events directly, the team's follow up actions and deliverables may act as a dos and don'ts guide for others seeking to host such events. These materials and lessons learned/participant feedback will allow this, or other, teams to continue breaking down the silos that exist between chains. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nThe proposer is a long time community member who has participated in numerous events and activities since the early days of Catalyst. They also have been funded and able to demonstrate their ability to delivery. This inspires a lot of confidence that this proposal would follow the same path. \n\nThe plan is straight forward, host different spaces and presentations for attendees to select from to allow for more diversity in subjects and preferences. What could have been improved here is to provide at least some high level content on what you hope to discuss, even just themes and subjects would be preferable to not listing anything. I don't doubt that they will be good sessions but voters may prefer a bit of forethought -(I'm sure they have, it just didn't make it into the proposal.) \n\nOne other issue I have with the plan is the $20k (almost half the budget) just for the venue. This may in fact be what it costs to rent a venue in Israel but for the amount there should be at least an indication of the level/scale that you would need. I find it hard to imagine the only places to fit 100-200 participants are $20k. If this is the case then providing some sort of source would be helpful. \n\nI am left wondering if the DAOstack team will be contributing anything to the event other than attending but since this challenge is about cross collaboration from Cardano this may just be my issue. Therefore, I didn't mark down for this but perhaps a bit more explanation on how the work would be divided would be helpful. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. \n\nThe proposer does a good job of breaking down their KPIs into different phases (pre-during-post event) which can help them gauge the level of interest and potential success at different stages of the project, rather than just at the end. This could help them adapt and perhaps seek additional community support to help promote their proposal. \n\nThe team's commitment to do a satisfaction survey after the event is also a good idea since it can help them discover what was strong and what needed work. This can help not only the team adapt but may provide valuable insight for other targeted events such as this one. \n\nFinally, I appreciate that the team set up a goal irrespective of the success of the event itself, which is to have one new team that forms to work on a cross-chain collaboration.  To me, this shows their ambition not just to hold an event but to provide real value to not only Cardano but the blockchain space writ-large. Excellent work.

It presents the problem of awareness of Cardano needing help in a nation known for their start-ups (some that could potentially build on Catalyst). Because the team is focused on working with other communities and blockchains and helping these friends build on Catalyst, it is certainly a fit for the Cross-chain Challenge.\n\nSuch knowledgeable individuals working on Catalyst after coming from the ETH community and others positively impact the Cardano ecosystem. This helps break down those silo walls between blockchains the author mentions are prevalent in Israeli (and verifiably other) social media. The potential of this Proposal is undoubtedly a value-add for the ecosystem as it builds bridges and calms tensions typically brought about by maximalism.\n\nThe KPIs match well, as increasing the # of events arranged with other communities is certainly one goal. Beyond this, there is great potential to contribute to several others as the project succeeds. Voters can feel confident that this Proposal aligns well with the Challenge.\n\nIf funded and they find success, they plan to come back to Catalyst. As this is a bit more community-building, building on established friendships, and opening the doors to new ones, this project isn't looking to \"scale\" and doesn't need to.\n\nThe proposer considers the RISKS reasonably and offers adequate mitigation for all 3. The main element of them all is the tensions between blockchains. The fact that the proposers have substantial friendships that cross those boundaries appears to be the factor relied on for success. Loads of promise for a team so seemingly rooted in reality\u2013\u2013very good.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The skill sets needed aren't explicitly explained, though that is the fault of the proposal submission form. However, it is easy to look at the plan and see that time management, logistics, community-building, and some format for hosting the event (in this case, Open Space Technology is mentioned as a skill needed within the team). These are tasks that the team is capable of executing themselves or hiring out with some of their funding. Further, voters can feel confident that the plan is detailed and that the 6-month timeline is justifiable for an event of this length and duration.\n\nFor Voter clarity, you might add that the VAT 17% amounts to $7,021 in tax. Please remember, voters, are looking at 1200 proposals. Clarifications are necessary. Further, let's always strive for accuracy in our ask and not go above it $179. In the larger picture, the $2000 contingency budget is relatively small for the size of the budget. I've been on planning committees for similar size gatherings and can say that if careful, the team should be just fine. Overall, the budget is thorough for an event such as this.\n\nThe plan is actionable and details in line with the work at hand. Specifics of event locations and such could add further information for voters, though they would likely add little value to this Proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPIs (pre-event, event, and post-event are very thorough) align with the Challenge and are all needed to track the success they are striving for; an outstanding effort by the team on that. The timeline provided would benefit from adding a roadmap and a more detailed list of milestones to track progress.\n\nThe one missing tracking mechanism is a way for the community online to track progress. Other teams have accomplished this by offering a 2-5 minute vlog or update video published on their YouTube account or a Gitbook update. Tools such as these are necessary for reliable auditability for the community. For this rationale, the team receives 4 stars for this section.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2261", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 3, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2717, "q0": "I am very much fascinated about the proposal put up by the proposer and team. The proposal is placed in the right challenge and addresses the challenge goals and objectives as well. An attempt to introduce the Israeli community to cardano blockchain and project catalyst  is game changing and has the potential of bringing value to the cardano community and the people of Israel at large. The stated key metrics in the proposal aligns with the keys metrics of the campaign brief such as partnering with DAOstack an an ethereum based company to educate Israeli community on cardano adoption etc, organizing events to give the Israeli community education about the cardano ecosystem etc. The proposer and team deserves commendation for a great job done.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer and team demonstrates that they are extremely prepared to execute the project should they be funded in the sense that they have provided small personal descriptions of themselves, which are summarized by they providing relevant links making it possible to get in touch with them directly and learn more about them, as well providing their skills and experience, this i think is impressive and qualifies them for the task. The Budget is well presented and broken down into smaller bits making it easy to understand and interpret. Even though the proposer and team have outlined their timeline i think they should have broken the project execution into a duration of three months so they can start gradually and expand thus seeking further funding from catalyst upon showing progress. Another part that deserves commendation is the discovery of the potential risk  thus the rivalry between Ethereum supporters and that of Cardano and by providing ways to mitigate this challenge, this is impressive, kudos to the proposer and team\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "How concerned the team is with auditability intrigues me. They have clearly stated the KPI\u2019s which are broken down into understandable bits. The proposer and team have also come out with a clear and precise strategy for project monitoring by the conduction of a survey to measure satisfaction by the participants and awareness and understanding of the projects. They went further to state how they will measure success by the formation of at least one new team at the event, that will work on a cross chain project. This I think is encouraging and making them up to the task to execute the project should they be funded. My further suggestion for the team with respect to reporting progress is to try as much as possible to engage with the various catalyst-cardano community channels and use their powerful reporting tools to complement their strategy so they will be able to give weekly or frequent reports on their progress should they be funded.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2350", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3094, "q0": "Projects on the Ethereum platform have many activities in the open space, DAO governance on Ethereum has been around for a long time, but on the Cardano ecosystem platform, the DAO governance system is almost nonexistent, the new ecosystem is in early stage.
