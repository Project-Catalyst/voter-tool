From the problem statement, the proposal is believed to address the common point of collaboration tools and platform hence there aren\u2019t decentralized oracles between Cardano and Polkadot. As the proposed solution came out with its best option of developing cross-chain interaction which led to the need of establishing the Cardano-Polkadot Interoperability Protocol. This is considered a scalability feature that would address future challenges within the Cardano Blockchain infrastructure among challenges in Catalyst towards community developers,...  The project process is broken down clearly with lasted proof concept (PoS, dPos, LPow, 3-zkc) where proposers clearly explained how they\u2019ll interact with the different technique on Oracles (through SaaS3 - PoN), this will eliminate the decentralized point of a server for developers to access. The project also their tokenomic by staking $SAAS token. In general, this project is one of the most vanguard projects in the challenge that targeted the characteristic of reducing time-code-complexity for developers with benefits returning to the Cardano system. However the risk management stated that funding would be vital to kick off the CPIP, beside Catalyst, the proposer should dynamically diverse sponsor channels through multiple methods (such as promotion, accelerator program). Human erroneous factors are also a worried angle to look at when it comes to smart contract engineering since the contracts policy needs to be extremely auditable to prove the transparency of the project. As they mention the solution to have 3rd party auditors to review the smart contracts, it\u2019s really important to be clear to PA about how the whole process will run to make sure that 3rd party will not be a factor that causes the system to lack transparency.

Besides that, the overall success is looking really good with a micro case of how a developer integrates with the communication network among two chains.

This proposal has properly addressed the goal set out in the Challenge. I find this very interesting. The problem to be solved here is that the Cardano ecosystem cannot yet support cross-chain interaction between Cardano and Polkadot. I understand this proposal was born to do that by creating CPIP protocol to build secure services and DApps and can transfer data, tokens, etc... If the proposal solves this then it is great. great, because this is a problem that almost no one can do today. If it is possible to enable cross-chain between Polkadot and the Cardano ecosystem, there will be a very large number of projects, tokens, etc...of the two parties linked together. Thereby solving the common problem of both ecosystems. This proposal will add enormous value to the Cardano ecosystem (if it succeeds) and fully scale and solve future challenges. Cardano will have a very large scale of operation when it connects with Polkadot, which is a great prospect - not only me but the whole community is looking forward to. I have high hopes for this proposal and hope it becomes a reality as soon as possible. With such impact when I completely agree - vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Proposer and team have in-depth Oracle, DeFi, Chain Bridge, etc... In-depth computing experience. The team has also provided full documentation related to the proposal. Especially the Linked social network link to publicize the identity of all team members. I strongly agree with this, especially the public through social networks, because from there the community has a lot of advantages in looking up the members' identities and verifying the feasibility of the project. export. A detailed list of members is not possible for every proposal. It is very commendable that the team has made this clear and very specific. The number of team members is 5 people, I understand these are the key members, the team may also have other collaborators that the team is not convenient to identify.\nThe budget is broken down by items and is logical to the goal. Although the team simply lists the budget, it still shows the key milestones in detail, which clearly shows the professionalism of the team. However, as a PA, I still want the team to show more clearly the budget required for each small job so that the community can look at it and have more confidence in the feasibility of the proposal. The team's budget presentation - professionals and people who already know the team well (know what the team needs to do) can also be understood from the current budget presentation, but I think that for everyone from the community (who are very new - they don't know anything about the team and this proposal) to understand it easily we need to have a detailed explanation. More detailed, and easier to understand. That's my advice on the budget. I have an additional question, if it hasn't been funded by Catalyst in Fund 9, will the team continue to work on this proposal? And what other sources of funding does the team have to be able to implement this proposal (from contacting support from other organizations)? I ask this question because I want to demonstrate the clear feasibility of the budget.\nAbout the plan and how to implement has been fully stated and professional. I was most impressed with this in the team's proposal. This is also one of the important factors in clearly defining the feasibility of the proposal. And the team is doing a great job of it.\nRegarding the necessary resources for implementation, I temporarily divided them into two main resources: financial resources (mentioned in the above budget) and human resources. With the current people, with professionalism and expertise, I believe that the proposal will be successfully implemented. However, as the team shared, some members are also working on another proposal in parallel with this proposal at Fund 9. I would like to ask if this reduces the quality of work on this proposal. shoot it? In my opinion, the team can demonstrate to the community that even though there are currently members implementing another proposal, the human resources are still sufficient for the successful implementation of this proposal. It is the best way to create more trust in the community, thereby increasing the feasibility of the proposal.\nIn terms of technique, technology and language used when implementing the proposal. It is a collection of high-tech learners in the new era: Cardano blockchain, Polkadot blockchain - the programming language of 2 blockchains, Oracle, DeFi, etc... It is made by experienced people. on the cryptocurrency market - members of the current team. That is the basis for me to believe that the team will do a good job when implementing the technical aspect of the proposal implementation.\nThe team is also quite clear about the risks that may be encountered when implementing this proposal: The lack of money to develop the CPIP protocol and another risk that is a vulnerability in the smart contract - accompanied by 2 solutions. measures to prevent the two risks mentioned above. I add a third risk which is Ada's slippage - which will affect the budget to implement the proposal. I would like to analyze this risk more closely: We know that the digital currency market is in a downtrend phase, so the price movement in the downward direction of digital currencies takes place from time to time. day. That is also the reason why Ada may depreciate when Catalyst funds are allocated to the team, then the team will face the problem of a lack of budget to implement the proposal. Therefore, my advice is for the team to consider the detailed budget related to Ada's slippage to make an appropriate budget request. Even if more funding is needed, the team can come up with a full plan to test.\nHere are my positive questions, comments, and advice. I hope the team can consider improving this proposal. I strongly agree with the feasibility of the proposal. I vote 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Through the proposal, I see the team's progress and clear milestones. What I am very satisfied with is that the team has linked the milestones with the timeline (specific quarters of the year). This makes it easier for the community to assess work progress, and to demonstrate the transparency and auditability of the proposal. I wish that any proposal would do the same. It also demonstrates the team's interest in the proposal milestone roadmap. However, I still want the team to be able to present the work done at each milestone in more detail to make it easier for the community to understand and grasp - especially for newcomers in the community. - they can easily read what the team needs to do at the milestones.\nI found it a pity that the team did not present the KPIs and key metrics. We all know the role of KPIs and key metrics in auditing. This makes it more difficult for the community to evaluate and audit when KPIs and key metrics are not visible. KPIs and key metrics play an important role in proving the transparency and auditability of the proposal. So my sincere advice to the team is to quickly add KPIs and key metrics. Having these two indicators in the proposal will greatly improve the transparency and auditability of the proposal.\nOn the other hand, the team stated what is the definition of success, it is seen as the standardization of smart contracts between Cardano - Polkadot, data is sent over blockchain networks and is simply decrypted. , etc... I agree with this definition of success. Throughout the proposal is a clear and easy-to-understand description of the problems, along with a clear statement of solutions. I found that the team made a strong effort to identify the problem and come up with a solution to solve the problem.\nHere are some of my positive comments to build more transparency and auditability of the proposal.
