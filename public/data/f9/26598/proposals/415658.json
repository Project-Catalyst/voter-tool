When the links between chains are created (usually as bridges) there are a limited number of ways for the value to cross the bridge.  Most of these ways involve parking or burning the token on its home-chain, and using some kind of validator to prove that the value in the tokens has been locked down or out, thus allowing that value to be represented on the new chain.  The description of a \"bridge\" leads many to think that the token has managed to \"cross\" over to the new ecosystem, but in almost every case, the tokens are actually held in a locked pool, with much less security than is present on the L1 protocol, while a doppleganger (and all too often this faux version of the token is stripped of valuable utility) roams around on the new chain.\n\nObviously, this lower security and pooling creates attractive targets for hacks, and of any recent hacks you can think of, chances are they were of this bridge vulnerability variety.\n\nMultiswap reimagines this vulnerability by eliminating the concept of the bridge, and instead tries to build liquidity protocols so that instead of transforming the token itself though a trust layer, the token is swapped for value on the other side of the divide.  The impact on the interoperability long game cannot be understated here, and Ferrum is as far ahead as anyone on this tightly competitive arc into the multi-chain future.\n\nSome of these liquidity protocols are of the \"white label\" variety (the token project itself provides excess value in the new ecosystem) while others lean into liquidity protocols of the dexes themselves.  When you start adding in the utility of the Ferrum native assets FRM and FRMx to generate investment and yield opportunity, as well as \"mini-impact\" from things like the tax-accounting viability of being able to keep a token's value intact through the swap, it is clear that this is a stable plan with wide ranging synergy with Cardano and its users.  I believe this proposal merits 5 stars for its alignment to both the cross-chain requirements of the challenge setting as well as the wider interoperability and scaling principles of Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "While the team is helpfully listed and linked in the proposal, following through any of their project links takes us into the depths they have already plumbed with this project, the multitude of partnerships and clients they have worked with, and I find this to be an extremely valid form of referential trust.  By checking out some interviews they gave I found their broad knowledge of the space between chains, and their specific knowledge of discrete chain protocols to be very reassuring.  They recognize the problems in the space, and also, importantly, the recognize that there are tradeoffs for any particular approach, including their swapping protocols.\n\nTheir timeline and milestones are extremely granular, listing out each milestone by number of days.  There were a couple of issues however.  One was an issue of clarity:  the team refers to several deliverables as being submitted to Catalyst for bug testing, signing off on shell apps and approving milestones.  This is likely a bit of confusion from applying this model, which has already been applied to many other projects, to the more decentralized Cardano.  In practice, none of these suggestions are issues, since there is a community to provide feedback and test, a robust technical community to analyze repos and of course, IOG with oversight of Coordinator for approving funding tranches.  If any issues arise, it will be due to funding tranches not lining up with expenses and misunderstandings that can arise from this lack of familiarity with Catalyst. It is highly recommended that the proposing team reach out to funded proposers to get a feel for how the funding is distributed.\n\nFurther, there is an issue around the lack of a budget breakdown.  The team clearly has an understanding of the resources required to integrate a new chain, but without providing any details, there is no way to assess whether the number they have presented is realistic, or whether it might be over- or undershooting their needs.  For what it is worth, for the scope of the work they are describing, this feels a bit under-budgeted, but it would be nice to have better numbers to reach that conclusion more firmly.  Along similar lines, and just as advice to the proposer, it would be handy to see the timeline summarized to include the total length of funding required for the project (as this number is used to divide the funding up into monthly tranches).\n\nDespite a strong team, a robust product that is available and working on other chains, a nuanced iterative approach and a deep knowledge of the space, I'm afraid I have to deduct a star for the lack of a clear budget and the uncertainty it creates in an otherwise solid proposal.  4 stars for Feasibility.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This project is written up here as primarily a software delivery, and as such they have included the dependable Jira tools and agile methodology.  There is a note about being familiar with sprint burndowns for reporting progress as % complete which is always an excellent add.\n\nIt is worth noting that they have a large section included under feasibility which actually lends a whole lot of auditability trust to the project.  The section covers what looks like a grassroots marketing approach, but which will actually function as a great transparency/availability layer for community feedback and interaction.  On top of this they have included a vow(!) to present monthly resource reports on anything required, and in particular transparent expense reports.\n\nBecause the audit points they have included indicate that they are familiar with the tools they need to use, as well as their ability to address any shortcomings related to their presentation of the budget, I believe they have presented a proposal that can be effectively audited and monitored by the community, so I give a full 5 stars.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Hey there z_assessor_2436!

At the same time the protocol offers a reflection (RFI), dividend, or burn mechanism. 3. The proposed protocol will never have control over the token contract of any asset using the protocol. 4. This protocol will use uses the APIs from DEXs and tap into DEX liquidity to support the volume being transacted across the protocol. The protocol removes the wrapper function involved in mint/burn multichain protocols thereby the UX is greatly improved. On analysis of the advantages, number 3 alone has substantial merit to rate this proposal as one of the far-reaching proposals in Fund 9. There is a need for such a fundamental contribution and in this respect, the proposal is outstanding since it offers a unique way to move assets between chains at the same time the smart contract will be able to be used to exploit the assets movement since it is not controlling the assets in both the chains.

In response to your statement about wishing we had divided the proposal into phases: We had attempted to do that for Fund 8 but the main criticism we received was that we had too many proposals (3) and that they were too similar to one another. The 'General' and \u2018'Impact' sections were the same throughout as the proposals were for the same product... the only difference was the \u2018milestones\u2019 section of \u2018Feasibility\u2019. For Fund9 we decided to lump it all together since our previous approach fell short. Furthermore, the last proposals totaled 300k between the 3 proposals as opposed to 200k for this one. After talking with the devs and the rest of the team, we agreed that we could build the product for 200k in an attempt to go for the entirety of the funding at once since our previous strategy of separating the proposal into phases failed. We figured that approaching this more leanly than we had originally intended and getting it done was more important than risking missing the opportunity to help grow the Cardano ecosystem.

This proposal will help us to gain access to the resources of EVM chains out there. Given the Basho era we are in now, I think the majority of the community is focusing much of their attention in scaling solutions and put interoperability solutions kind of in the sideline.

I think this is a fairly reasonable rate since there will be business/project manager, marketing specialist, and most importantly multiple developers and security auditors working to implement and deliver this holistic solution.

Success is defined strongly as complete deployment with substantial transaction volumes and values and number and diversity of assests listed in this MultiSwap as aggregator.

Furthermore, they will also provide marketing and communication to Cardano community members and wider crypto audience outside Cardano through highly informative, quality articles, public relations and influencer campaigns, youtube podcasts & Series, social media & lead generation, e-mail blasts, AMA sessions, website promo, and in-house sales and product representatives.

None of them were funded, and the Ferrum team is back now in Fund 9 with a single proposal, a very positive sign that shows they have at least learned this lesson - that their strategy of splitting a project into multiple proposals proved to be confusing for the community. Let\u2019s see how else they managed to improve their value proposition.  \n\nAs a refresher from F8 information we already know, Ferrum has been present in the crypto space since 2018, with services initially offering services for ETH, MATIC, BSC and AVAX. Now, at least judging by their website, their services are much more elaborate and fairly complex (staking lotteries, NFT products, web3 games, etcetera) and very wide in scope. \n\nWith this proposal they are asking for funding to provide a \u2026multiswap integration, but since it\u2019s not actually clear so I will quote them, maybe you understand better: \u201cMultiSwap reimagines architectural & OpSec best practices, providing a complete solution on the market while encouraging TVL across Cardano native DeFi protocols\u201d. So there you have it! \n\nJust as it was the case with their Fund 8 proposals, I am not convinced that there is a good fit with the challenge. Back then, Ferrum was unsure that there was a potential for their service to be integrated with Cardano. A few months have passed, and by reading the proposal we are not actually understanding if there is a good fit now. Have Ferrum taken a closer look at their services and development plans and did they come up with a viable avenue for integration? We are not being told, and the proposal does not mention this aspect. The proposal sadly maintains the same fuzzy logic and argumentation style that was confusing for the community in Fund 8 even now - since it\u2019s not easy at all to understand their explanations. \n\nConsidering all of the above I can only offer two stars - since the Ferrum team does not bring before us a solution that is easy to understand and they bring no arguments why it will be beneficial for the Cardano community. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team behind Ferrum seems very strong, and they have made an excellent effort into presenting themselves. Naiem is the founder, with previous experience working for Microsoft and Amazon. Ian, the COO, is a lawyer by formation and has joined Ferrum in 2018. These are just two examples, but more team members are presented within the proposal, and many more are available on their website - most of them with Linkedin profiles available, so definitely the team presentation is a strong point of the proposal. \n\n\nFrom a budgetary point of view, this proposal is very very similar to the ones they proposed in Fund 8. So my words are pretty much the same. The budget has used absolutely no figures whatsoever. The entire budget section is simply an argument as to why granting the funds is necessary in order for Ferrum \u201cto be able to justify prioritizing this integration [...]  cognizant of their backlog\u201d. Rephrasing the argument, for me it sounds more like \u201cwe are not entirely sure that there is a business case to be made here, but if you fund us we shall make an effort\u201d. These are the exact words that again, confused the Catalyst assessors in the previous round and it is very sad to see that the Ferrum team had not learned from the feedback provided.   \n\nTimewise, they offer 5 milestones. During the first a scoping exercise would be completed (20 day).  The second would see a bridge shell app being built and deployed internally (75 days). The third would involve testing by Catalyst and audit submission (30 days). For this phase it is rather unclear who from Catalyst would test it (will it be in beta mode available for anyone?) and what kind of audit submission we are talking about. Is it a third party audit? Who is the auditor, do they have a budget set aside? The fours milestone would be a multi-chain aggregator deployment and testing (35 days). The last phase would take into account the feedback provided and would see the live launch (20 days). So a rather concrete plan with clear milestones - definitely a strong point of the proposal. \n\nNo matter how strong the team presentation is, no matter how well defined the milestones are, the fact that the budget contains NO figures whatsoever does not allow me to offer more than two stars in this category. I consider it a very poor practice to do this and to my mind this fact renders the project rather unfeasible to implement correctly, if funded.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Their auditability section is very very close to the ones they had in Fund 8, hence my words are almost the same as well. The team uses SCRUM and runs 2 week sprints. They promise an open sourced Jira board to track the progress of each task and they also promise to to provide Progress reports and financial reports every month. \n\nMeasuring the project\u2019s success is rather confusing when judging by what the proposers offer us. They use a negative sentence so I am quoting them by turning it into an affirmative one: \u201cThe project will be considered a success when the product is deployed to production and we are seeing substantial transaction volumes and assets listed on the aggregator\u201d. Sadly they are not actually offering any anchors to base our expectations: what constitutes a substantial volume of transactions? Which exactly are the assets we are talking about? Is it only ADA, other Cardano tokens, or actually just pairs of ADA - to other cryptocurrencies that we will be measuring?\n\nThe team\u2019s approach to openness is transparency is duly noted, as well as the slight improvement in the auditability section from the previous funding round. Most likely the Cardano community would most not have any issues in tracking this project, if funded, with the caveat that the weak value proposition of the project is trickling down to this level and it is difficult for the team to offer meaningful targets of success, hence only four stars in the auditability section.

We\u2019ll try to provide as much clarity as we possibly can here as it seems your assessment was the most critical amongst an otherwise well receptive group. That being said, you bring up some excellent points!\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with your feedback on the \u2018Impact / Alignment\u2019 section. In regards to your praise for creating one proposal as opposed to 3 like we did the last time, we definitely heeded yours and other assessors\u2019 advice there. Although, interestingly enough, a few of the assessors this time around explained that they thought this proposal should\u2019ve been broken into multiple proposals. Either way, we really hope this is the best option here.  Furthermore, the last proposals totaled 300k between the 3 proposals as opposed to 200k for this one. After talking with the devs and the rest of the team, we agreed that we could build the product for 200k in an attempt to go for the entirety of the funding at once since our previous strategy of separating the proposal into phases failed. We figured that approaching this more leanly than we had originally intended and getting it done was more important than risking missing the opportunity to help grow the Cardano ecosystem. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019re a bit unclear on what you mean when you say that Ferrum was \u201cunsure that there was a potential for their service to be integrated with Cardano\u201d and that \u201cwe are not actually understanding if there is a good fit now.\u201d We are quite certain that MultiSwap is an incredible fit for the Cardano ecosystem. There are very few highly connected interoperability protocols in the Cardano ecosystem. MultiSwap IS highly connected; not only to a dozen or so EVM networks but also some non EVMs as well. Also, it will not only function as a bridge but it will function as a cross-chain swapping protocol as well. Meaning users can Swap \u2018Asset A\u2019 on the origin network for \u2018Asset B\u2019 on Cardano. Furthermore, with the frequency in which \u2018bridges\u2019 are exploited, we believe that a securely architected interoperability protocol is absolutely crucial for the Cardano ecosystem. Other reasons as to why we believe this product will be beneficial for the Cardano community include encouraging TVL and volume on DEXs such as Wingriders, MinSwap, SundaeSwap and MuesliSwap, making Cardano native assets more composable, and serving as a conduit to facilitate porting liquidity to Cardano. It also removes a barrier of entry for multi-chain projects who have an active investor and user base on other existing and established networks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you say \u201cHave Ferrum taken a closer look at their services and development plans and did they come up with a viable avenue for integration?\u201d Yes! We absolutely did. This was one of the main reasons why we opted against submitting a proposal for our Staking as a Service solutions like we did for F8. We wanted a renewed and more narrow focus this time around and thought the best approach would be to start with the biggest hurdle; interoperability. Think of MultiSwap as Phase 1 of the relationship between Ferrum and the Cardano community. Phase 1 is integrating MultiSwap and our Bridge protocols along with the underlying node infrastructure with Cardano. Ultimately though, Ferrum\u2019s success is intended to be aligned with the success of Cardano. We want to build here because Cardano is projected to shape the future of crypto and blockchain at large over the next few years. But after receiving the feedback from F8 we decided that in order to ensure the success of this relationship, we will first integrate MultiSwap, THEN integrate our staking solutions so we can offer them  to projects on Cardano in order to incentivize TVL to move to Cardano and give new projects a way to provide instant utility for their community as they build their core products out here.\r\n\r\nLet's move on to the \u2018Feasibility\u2019 section. I cannot believe we forgot to add the blueprint for the \"Milestone Breakdown\" and budget plan. This was the most widely given criticism amongst the assessors so we really hope that this document ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ReGjvFr-yK_MNJPtn0U4Cx-RqhK6MJ2CaHUxOnDPlL0/edit?usp=sharing ) combined with the below Milestone Overview and Budget Breakdown helps clarify some of the questions you had around that component.\r\n\r\nOverview\r\nMilestone\tEst.

That is a huge part of our iterative rollout strategy. There will also be an Alpha testing period that comes prior to Beta and will be available to any of the Assessors or Project Catalyst community.\r\n\r\nIn regards to \u2018Auditability\u2019, we truly hope that some of the answers provided above will not only change your mind about your \u2018Impact/Alignment\u2019 and \u2018Feasibility\u2019 scores but also mitigate some of the trickled down sentiment as it pertains to \u2018Auditability\u2019.
