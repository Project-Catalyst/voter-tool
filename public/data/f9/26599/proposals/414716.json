However, there is a lack of detail regarding the contents that are created. But let's take a closer look at the whole thing. A very positive thing is that the proponent places us well in relation to the problem that will be solved. The target audience is the students of a university in Canada, the proponent explains how there is a gap in the education of engineering students about blockchain; from what I understand the intention is to create some workshops that teach these students about the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem, so that they can work together with design students. It is not so clear if they would be separate contents, with different approaches for each area (engineering and design). Also, another problem is the lack of detail regarding what subjects would be addressed in these workshops. In reality, a more solid understanding of them is lacking: how many would they be, how often would they be launched, would they be online events? What topics would be covered in each session? It is positive, however, that the proponent is aware of the risks that may occur during the development of this project. Perhaps there is a certain resistance on the part of the students to join this study group, precisely because of the lack of knowledge about Cardano. It is said that a strong publicity campaign will be carried out to circumvent this problem. However, it is not clear how this disclosure would be made, exactly. He mentions that newsletters would be used, sent monthly to students. But do they have the habit of checking these newsletters, reading them carefully? Maybe it would be interesting to do work on social media, invest in platforms that students use frequently. I think, however, that the most important issue here would be to really understand what specific topics are covered in each workshop, in what order and why, and also if they would be adapted according to the target audience. In terms of impact, I think that this proposal has high value, because without a doubt our ecosystem needs manpower in the areas of engineering and design to execute the different projects, develop Dapps, and train Plutus/Haskell developers is a necessity that I I see in several Catalyst proposals. My observations are, that said, at the level of detail.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The script isn't bad, but it lacks a bit of balance. The ideal would be that it be divided into months and that they have the same level of detail each. For example, in the months of September, October and November, we have listed several activities to be developed (Event Oficina Cardano, Finalize site, Create series of tutorial videos and etc). But what would happen each month? Soon after, the level of detail drops a lot, all we know about the months from January to March is that work would be done on the project as a team. Like this? This is a very abstract definition, what would need to happen for the project to proceed properly this quarter? I would like to leave this suggestion, that the phases be defined in smaller time intervals, so that the activities would also be explained in a more precise and detailed way, so that we could have a better understanding of what would actually be the realization of this project. Talking about the budget, the parts of the project are well explained; they are not only mentioned what the expenses would be, but also detailed what they are. What I could suggest for an improvement here would be that we had a little more idea of \u200b\u200bhow much time the professionals involved would dedicate to each part. For example, 1500 from project to team, how many people would be working here, and for how many hours of work, approximately? If this information had been passed on, we would have understood even better how this money was being used. Finally, the team is presented in a satisfactory way, we get to know the names, we know who the students are and some of their previous experiences. We see that it is related to Cardano (for example Adam who participated in the Plutus Pioneer program), I believe they are prepared to execute this project well, although they are all students (maybe it would be interesting to have a veteran in the area participate, that had an already solid participation in our community, too). I conclude then that the feasibility of the project is good, all 3 topics inform us what is necessary to understand how this project would be put into practice. Although some more details would add benefits in our understanding, our view would be more solid, both of the development process, how the requested money would be used and also in relation to the team - who are these people, what are their professional backgrounds and how they are engaged enough to carry out the proposal with guaranteed success.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditability is average, we have basic information but at the same time I thought that the way the proponent suggests monitoring the process is superficial, because it is based on numbers, the number of students participating in the program. This is undoubtedly important data, but I think we could try to audit things further. The course creation process, that is, the work behind it all. How would this group of students be organizing themselves to produce the tasks, achieve partial goals, complete what was planned for each month? Perhaps it would be interesting for this process to be monitored through some online tool, such as the Miro Board (just a suggestion, as it is at the discretion of the team's preference). I think it is necessary for the Cardano community to be able to, in some way, directly monitor how advances are being made, how problems that have arisen along the way are being mitigated. It would also be very interesting to have a notion about the continuity of the project - as the proponent himself mentions, one concern is that, after the first wave of students appropriate such knowledge, the idea kind of dies, due to lack of continuity. So much so that he reserves part of the funding for a future generation of students. How could we be sure that this continuity was achieved? Talking then about the final results and how we can monitor them, the proponent defines well what would be the success scenario, which would then be for students to have actually learned about blockchain and Cardano, becoming Plutus developers, perhaps, participating in the construction. from Dapps and etc. I totally agree, but how can we find out if this scenario has become real? I think it would be important for the proponent to draw up follow-up plans with these students. One idea would be to contact them directly, to understand how they would be using the knowledge acquired in this program, what projects they are currently on, if in fact they have become active members of the Cardano community\u2026 them and how it all reflected in Cardano's growth and strengthening. Therefore, I think that the auditability is the most superficial part of the proposal, needing some deepening to make it adequate. More depth is needed here than in the previous topics, because both in terms of impact and feasibility, what we know is enough for a good understanding, but in the case of auditability, the absence of information is greater, which leaves the topic more to be desired.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 13, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 11763, "q0": "In fact, there are many small solutions that can bring unexpected results. Personally, I think this is true of the proposal \"University Design Team\", a good proposal to meet the requirements of the challenge \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\". This is an effective solution that directly addresses the challenge is \u201cspecifically designed to encourage and support student participation and collaboration within the Cardano Ecosystem\u201d. The authors propose to establish a Blockchain Design Group of Queen's University - a famous engineering school in Canada. The output of the solution is continuous improvements to the Cardano ecosystem through developer tools and applications developed by this design team. According to the author's findings, there are many student-run design teams at Queen's University, but not a single blockchain-based design group here. This is missing out on opportunities for students to engage in deep collaboration on Catalyst projects \u2013 where we are increasingly devoting more space and funding towards this potential audience. Also need to provide more information, according to my personal research, with more than 23,000 students, Queen's University is ranked 216th in the QS World University Rankings 2022 (https://www.topuniversities.com/) universities/queens-university-kingston) and ranked 13-14 in Canada in 2020-2021. This is also a school that is affiliated with 3 Nobel Prizes, the most recent being the 2021 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences awarded to David Card, an alumnus of Queen's University. Several prominent business leaders are also Queen's University alumni, including Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX and Tesla, Inc. and is also an active and influential person in the blockchain field. With the dynamism, enthusiasm and experience of running existing design teams, we can fully expect that the birth of a Cardano design team at Queen's University will help promote ideas and research blockchain creation here. This benefits both Queen's students and our Cardano ecosystem. Here, it would be great if the author provides the community with historical data on the model of the design research teams that have been formed before and their achievements. Regarding the risks affecting the success of the solution, the author has pointed out two main risks: First, the audience for whom the focus group provides learning materials is first-year students, which may not be comfortable ready to join the team. Second, the risk that the group will die after this year because the founders are all in their final year and will leave the university. To limit these risks, the author has also come up with remedial measures such as: organizing outreach events at the design group fair, messaging students through technical email newsletter sent to all students monthly. The intention to invite a professor to join the team is also taken into account to provide timely support even if the founding members may leave the school. I suggest, the authors should build a seed group to lead the team of 3-5 people, which are 2-3 year students. Each year, the group will admit 1-2 more people to create an alternative source for the final year graduates. The seed group will be directly selected and guided by the founding members. They will maintain the common activities of the entire blockchain design team at Queen's University continuously over the years, including: receiving funding, expanding and developing participating members. On the overall impact of the solution, I rate it 5 points because of the directness and clarity of the information provided by the group.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The process of implementing the solution is planned by the group in August 2022 and lasts until April 2023. I appreciate the actionability of the solution when the team plans to form a setup team even if the proposal has not been funded. The weekly/monthly activity schedule is logically and logically planned by the team. Student access forms are comprehensive and complete. Specifically: introducing students to the introduction at the design group festival that will take place in September 2022, organizing seminars, making web pages, creating tutorial video series, direct tutoring. The proposed budget is broken down into categories. However, I do not see a detailed unit price of components. Example: team outreach and creation cost $750 (marked as most important), but it's not clear how much the team will spend on a live event in the tech building to showcase the blockchain club with students. The scale of the event, the costs attached to it also have not been mentioned. Similarly, a website creation cost of $500 should be allocated in more detail. For example: $50 to buy a domain, $450 to rent hosting for 1-2 years. The cost of $1250 for video tutorials and seminars should be clearly separated into 2 separate items: First, the cost of the conference, how much $ is needed to rent the hall, posters, and the size of the workshop, how many participants are there. Second, the cost of making a video tutorial needs to clearly state the expected number of videos, the unit price/video\u2026 The authors also propose to leave $1000 in the approved budget for the team to use for years next. In my opinion this is reasonable but there should be a clear budget plan and guidelines. Regarding the team, other than member Adam Cooke has a profile to authenticate, the remaining members do not have a reference link to verify their skills and experience described in the proposal. So I rate 4 points, deducted -1 point for lack of link to team member profile.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "So what does the success of the proposal look like? I strongly believe that the community will have the necessary elements to audit this proposal. The team explained to the community exactly what will happen in the next 9 months. Measurements have been clearly calculated and described by the team. Specifically, the team expects 5-10 students to join the Queen's Cardano club in September (the expectation for an established design team is around 10-15 new students per year. The criteria for online education (number of viewers) are also used as a measure of success. However, I consider these only the inputs of success. Regarding the output of the solution, if possible. , I would like the team to consider adding additional success metrics, for example, the number of proposals submitted to Catalyst at Fund 10 through the club. Overall, I highly recommend this proposal, for its practicality practical, high action, directly addressing the claim presented by this challenge. If the proposal is approved by the community and funded, I hope, the solution will spur the creation of Plutus developers, and potential Haskell in our Cardano ecosystem. My score is 5.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3279", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 9, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 5660, "q0": "The proponent clearly establishes an identifiable problem that needs to be addressed via this initiative .This is an excellent project that seeks to create the platform for capacity building to engineer students into the professional world by using the Cardano ecosystem as a springboard. The focus here is to create an environment that foster collaboration among engineering students. The design of this project is a team formation of interested engineering students to collaborate on projects within the cardano ecosystem. Ultimately, by bring students unto this single platform, we also assemble diverse people with different skills to enable the students create their own possibilities on the Cardano ecosystem. Additionally, this creates an avenue to mentor young students and enroll them into the Cardano ecosystem. Eventually, the ultimate beneficiary is the Cardano, providing the community with a pool of developers from different backgrounds with diverse skills . From the script, the proposer doesn\u2019t only indicates it target audience but also provides a strategy to incite the and attract the students to this project. More importantly, this project also presents a long term sustainable strategy that would make the project more relevant to the Cardano community.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The information of the budget allocation, team experience, roadmap and the overall work structure is what will help determine the feasibility here. Base on these points, is the project feasible?. Let\u2019s look at the road map; we do know exactly how long each of these activities would take to start and finish. More importantly, the information on the activities for each phase of the implementation is not only sufficient but also elaborate and comprehensive. However, my view on the duration for each activity is that, there are no specific timelines to get activities done. An example will be appropriate here. For instance, when the proposers indicates that activities such as, \u201ccaradano workshop event, finish website, create tutorial video, tutorials and finish white-paper of team wide project\u201d, will be carried out from September via to November, without providing a detailed breakdown on the duration of each of these activities, the proposer makes it difficulty to determine how and when these activities will be carried out. In my view, rather than indicating what would be done within these 3 months, it would be appropriate to state what activities are planned for each specific month or weeks. Per the project, we do not know if, for example, the activities would be carried at random time within the week or would happen concurrently. I propose that the team provides clarity on this. On the team experience, I won\u2019t be overly critical here. It\u2019s fair to say that based on the profile presented, their experts and field of experience will be very relevant to the project in terms of attracting students from their field of study and also providing tutorials to students on the cardano ecosystem to help scale up the cardano ecosystem with developers. The team behind this project gives a lot of confidence on the likelihood that the project would be implemented. The individul team members has worth of experience and expertise that would be relevant to this project. However, the proponent failed to attach any link to help verify their profile details. Finally, on the budget allocation, i think some items have allocations that i believe are on the high side. I think the overall framework of the budget does not provide a clear breakdown. For instance, the budgetary allocation for tutorials videos and cardano workshop does not provide sufficient breakdown of how much each of them will cost. The same can be said of the budgetary allocation for team creation and workshop. My overall observation here is that, the team has a great idea but only need a bit of restructuring to perfect their project.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Does the audibility section provide sufficient information for the audibility of the project? Yes but could be better improved. My initial observation here is that, the proponent  cites specific KPIs such as \u201cthe number of students who will attend the event and the number of students who will view the online course\u201d as the measuring rode for determining the progress and the success of the project. The highlight here is the fact  that the proposer assigns specific expected target estimation for each KPIs. This is a more simplified  approach, given that the details required for the KPIs are more specific. The down side of the audibility phase is the question of accountability to the cardano  community. With the exception of making educational content available to the students on Youtube, how do the cardano community access the information on the success of the project. Hence, the proposal fails to provide sufficient information on how the information on the metrics (for determining the success of the project) will be made available to the community for their perusal. Accountability is key in the catalyst process, therefore, i suggest the team indicate how the information will be made available to the community. It can either be by telegram or discord or a website.

This not only shows dedication from their side, but also a vision for the future for the students and for the entire Cardano and Catalyst ecosystem.\nThe team will be focused not just on presenting the Cardano blockchain to other students and possibly attracting them into the ecosystem, but also on creating educational materials on subjects like Plutus and Haskell for those who might wish to delve deeper and start developing.\nOverall, I find the idea of creating this team to have a positive impact not just on the students and teachers of Queen\u2019s University, but also on the Catalyst and Cardano Ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The timeline dedicated to the project seems to be sufficient, from late August 2022 until April 2023, ensuring sufficient students get to know about the team\u2019s initiative, join, and start learning basic development on Cardano. If successful, another team will be formed to continue the first team\u2019s efforts. I find all the steps presented to be in the right order, manageable and thus leading to potential success. Then, when I read the budget, I must say, I found even more appreciation for the project. The team has found a way to allocate from the small amount of $5000 a portion of $1000 for the future team, the one that will be leading the efforts after this team graduates from the university, in order to help get them started without any external help until they, as well, can submit a Catalyst proposal. And on top of that, they have another portion of $1500 named \u201cTeamwide Project\u201d that is also open for a possible future allocation to the next team, if the funds will not be entirely spent on their upcoming initiatives. The rest of the budget is also well covered and looks feasible. The team seems to me to be passionate about Cardano, they are 3rd and 4th-year students, who are also interns at different known companies, like Ericsson and AMD, proving that they are also talented and hard-working engineers.

Perhaps an update from time to time would have been an added bonus, but it is definitely not a requirement.\nI appreciate how for the project\u2019s success, the team clearly envisions how the participating students will have some tangible achievements from joining the club: \u201cStudents will be comfortable with Plutus Development, the Cardano-CLI, and the Cardano Ecosystem as a whole\u201d, on top of this they will be developing actual dapps to be used by end consumers, in conclusion proving a real successful outcome to their initiative.

In this proposal, the author raised the issue of the lack of a blockchain-based design team at the school while at this traditional school being known for many other student-led design teams onion. This proposal has outlined a solution to the problem of needing a blockchain playground for students here, an environment for students to be free to create, voice their thoughts and ideas in order to connect, bring their ideas to the world and connect with leading experts in the field. It would be remiss if a school like Queen's University didn't have a blockchain-based design team.\nThe solution of the proposal is special in that the author team will focus on implementing 2 main solutions: establishing the Queen's Blockchain Design Group, where students collaborate on Cardano Projects and provide public funding deploy tutorials & introductory videos to help new students get started with Cardano. I see with these two solutions, the author team will give students at Queen's University a gradual approach, creating a habit to access the knowledge of the Cardano ecosystem and blockchain market by providing free fees for his lectures. I think the Cardano community needs to care and promote this project because like in our Vietnam or any other country in the world, students are subjects that are very interested in training by that country's government.

In the item 'Tutorial Videos & Cardano Workshops', it would be interesting if the team specified the number of videos and workshops that would be held. This way the community can better understand the budget per video and per workshop.\nA concern that I believe to be very pertinent is the sustainability of these design teams: how would they generate financial resources to continue to exist and promote the events and tutorials without having to apply for future funds?

Is it only from the core team, or would the proposer collaborate with others, perhaps an instructor from the university or a guest instructor? There is nothing wrong if there is only one source of knowledge, but I am just factoring that many of the members are in their 4th year, so there is a potential slowdown related to thesis, graduation, etc.\n\nLastly, I find the amount reasonable enough about the budget, although the items should be broken down into smaller details for better accountability. I am hesitant with the 1000 USD future team budget simply because the new members could make another proposal in the next Fund. Even better, they bring the goods and bads of previous design team execution, which would result in a better proposal overall. But it is not a serious obstacle because those funds could also be used as the budgeting safeguard or for unforeseen problems.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer target 5-10 members to join the design team, which I think is reasonable for a first design team generation, especially when there is no blockchain-related organization in the university yet. While it is true that those members would end up more well-versed in the Cardano ecosystem, thus increasing the number of developers in the community, perhaps one more simple metric for success is the sustainability of the design team itself. By laying the proper foundation and smoothly running the series of activities, I hope it sparks a brand new wave of Cardano contributors. There are improvements that makes auditing the overall progress of the design team activities easier. For example, the proposer has stated that they would release the video series publicly. However, there is no mention of how and when we can access them. Same with teamwide projects, it would be great if the end product is open sourced so we could see what the team learned along the way.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2878", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 1, "ng": 8, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7707, "q0": "The issue is that many students at Queen's University and elsewhere would benefit from being able to work together on Cardano Projects, but there is currently no team under which they can do so, leaving them without peers with whom to collaborate and without the means to advance their professional development. Additionally, many engineering students' education generally suffers from the lack of a Blockchain Team.\nBy establishing this Cardano Design Team, eager engineering students can work together on topics pertaining to ecosystems. Additionally, this enables the introduction of Cardano to first-year engineering students who are unfamiliar with or have not heard of Cardano and Blockchain Technology, allowing them to develop within the team over the course of their undergraduate degree into a fully-fledged Plutus/Cardano/Blockchain expert with the assistance of upper-year students.\nThis is exactly what the challenge's goals call for. The essential measures that will be important to this proposal's success have also been specified by the proposer. The issues they will face have already been mentioned by the proposer, and they have alternative solutions and are scalable.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": ") I think this plan can obtain a high score for feasibility based on the information in it. For completing the work, they have provided a timeline with checkpoints. I think the person putting up the proposal is completely aware of the foundation they are trying to build and the results they aim to achieve within the timeframe they have given. by counting the number of students who sign up for and take part in the club. This will demonstrate how their outreach efforts were received and provide information on how the following year's efforts might be improved. After a successful outreach, 5\u201310 students might enroll by September (expectations for a established design team are around 10-15 new students per year).\nThe number of persons viewing the instructional content online will also be counted. This will demonstrate how well our video and materials are accepted by Queen's University students and the larger Cardano Community. Growing educational material viewing over time, which shows people returning to learn more after finding prior videos to be helpful, can be used to quantify success.  Because of this, I think the plan has a good chance of being implemented successfully.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The project achiever has a well-thought-out route map.

The proposer has identified the need for such a platform for creating a group of people interested in blockchain designing and providing them the resources to build something useful.

In the first part, I saw the team giving clear examples including current students, it is absolutely true that without a blockchain team, it will have a bad impact on these students. So the team has also come up with ways to minimize this. Next is the approach to all that the team has, even if I am not an expert in them, I can completely understand and agree with the proposal's opinion. In addition, the team can also present the individuals involved and how to execute the project, the outputs and the results of the work are all very detailed, I think this is what everyone should learn .Team said that these solutions will solve all the problems, I mean the ways the team mentioned above are not repeated. Proposal has said \"brings new students into the Cardano Ecosystem while continually providing support for them to learn and create projects\", I see the feasibility as well as the results they bring will be very good, in addition to talking more about video presentation or clips. I found them to be very well put together. The team, although only given 2 risks, was extremely detailed and looked deeply into them. The problem that students do not join the Design team with the solution is too good, it is almost the best and most effective way.
