The authors propose to build the first high-quality online education platform on blockchain and Cardano in Arabic, exclusively for university students in the MENA region. The aim is to \"universalize and enlighten\" about blockchain for Arab students who are passionate about technology, and create a community to learn and enhance their potential in the field of technology. Personally, I think this is a good, useful solution that solves an important problem of the challenge. That is to remove barriers, unlocking potential in the group of Arab students who love blockchain technology. By creating an ideal, safe space to study, Arab students here can exchange ideas and find opportunities in the vast blockchain world. The good news is that these opportunities are free (online education so anyone can attend), and easily accessible (in their mother tongue). I believe this is extremely important for students, as well as young people, in MENA \u2013 a region where, according to UNICEF, almost half of the population is under the age of 24 (https://www.unicef.org/mena/education). I endorse the 5 main roadblocks that the authors have raised: financial difficulty, lack of blockchain knowledge, lack of tutorials to get started, lack of background learning in Arabic, a plethora of resources data on the internet in English but scattered and not systematic. Among them, I found that the biggest barrier preventing Cardano from accessing students in the MENA region is the issue of financial constraints. In addition, another risk that the author has not mentioned is the expensive cost of connecting to the internet in Africa. In fact, MENA brings developing together countries, the majority of university students in the region face difficulties in paying tuition fees and do not have adequate financial conditions to access public knowledge resources. new technology. Not to mention, the cost of internet in Africa is always among the highest in the world, people have to pay an average of 10-20% of monthly income for internet costs. This risk will be a major barrier restricting students from accessing online learning tools. In terms of the overall impact of the solution, I personally think that giving Arab students more opportunities to learn and interact on free platforms like this proposal is also giving them the and motivation to start a business in the field of technology. From there, help them improve their living conditions, and fulfill their personal financial goals in the future. This is also the spirit of the challenge \u201cChallenge & Scouted for Students\u201d. Therefore, I personally believe that if approved by the community, this idea will make a useful contribution to the development of our Cardano ecosystem in MENA \u2013 a high population, culturally diverse area, are interested in digital assets (https://www.arabnews.com/node/2056231/business-economy). This is why I rate 5 points on the impact of this proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project implementation roadmap is short and clear with a total time of 3 months, including 10 work items scheduled for weekly implementation. However, in my personal opinion, this roadmap is too short and can only produce a beta version. I hope, the authors do not stop at a mere knowledge-storing learning channel, but actually create a community of students who love blockchain technology in the region. Therefore, this educational platform should be supplemented with interactive features between learners and instructors, between learners. This has not been mentioned by the author in the implementation process. I suggest the authors connect with blockchain engineers and technology lecturers in the region to join together to create a Q&A forum, to answer the difficulties students face during online learning. In addition, activities to increase interaction among online learners should be enhanced. For example, organize online competitions with quick tests for students who complete each knowledge area, organize individual/team competitions according to learning themes (weekly/monthly), award prizes to the top 3 people. Cardano topics should be included in these sponsored contests to find excellent individuals and ideas after the online course. Personally, I think that the 3-month roadmap is just enough for the team to do the preparatory work and create a demo version with basic features. Still need another 3-6 months to continue to perfect and add the above additional features. The budget of the proposal is divided among the items but unfortunately there is no associated component unit price. For example, the $1500 payment to the instructor should be explained in detail: for how many instructors, how many months to pay? I myself am a website maker, with a website design category the author recommends $ 500, personal experience I would like to share: the cost of buying a domain (need at least $10-15, depending on the domain name will have a different price), hosting cost (average $30-50/month for traffic under 100,000 turns/month, suitable for the first 3 months of project development). The group also needs to have a plan to upgrade hosting monthly/quarterly if the amount of traffic at the same time increases, to ensure that there are no problems of congestion, network drops, or stopping access due to insufficient server capacity response. Regarding the team, the reference links to the individual profiles of the authors are exhaustive. The author himself is a second year computer science student at the Faculty of Science of Tunis, Tunisia. I believe, the authors will understand the difficulties MENA students face when approaching blockchain and Cardano. However, if possible, I need to add more convincing evidence to believe that the author is qualified to carry out this project. Therefore, I rate 3 points on the feasibility of this proposal, after deducting -1 point because it is necessary to add to the roadmap for implementing feature enhancement items for the web, -1 point because of the budget is not detailed.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "From an audit perspective, I think the team should have put more effort into describing to the community the auditable metrics in each category of work. The author mentions, success is when \u201caccomplish the purpose of the project by introducing the largest number of students possible to programming and blockchain\u201d. So I ask, what is the maximum number of students that can be here? I need the specific success number given by the team. For example, there will be 5000 students after 3 months of learning programming and blockchain, with an average learning time of 2 hours/day. I also need the author to give very specific related success KPIs. For example, platform traffic (per day/week/month), time spent on the interface (in days), what keywords or knowledge areas users search the most?\u2026 I consider this a well-thought-out and methodological proposal. However, the authors need to provide more specific and clear information and numbers. These are mandatory requirements so that the community can easily audit the achievable success of the proposal. I can only give 4 points, already -1 point for missing the above KPIs.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3279", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 8, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1040, "q0": "I find it valuable that the proposer has provided ample background information regarding the importance of implementation of his project in this specific region. There seems to be indeed a high need for resources to be translated and available, not just for students, but for everyone from the MENA region (the Middle East and Northern Africa), in order to start forming a community of developers and creators from that part of the world. \nFrom what I gathered throughout the proposal, the main language of education will be primarily Arabic, even though the MENA region covers a lot of countries that have a very diverse linguistic coverage. But for the first purpose of this project, Arabic is probably the most spoken and makes the most sense for a first edition. But I think this is an important factor that the proposer could have detailed further, especially since he mentions that one of the purposes is to \u201cSpot ambitious students with innovative business ideas\u201d, but I could not find a clear mention of where the students will be coming from, not just from which universities, but also from which countries in the region. \nWhat I would have liked to read more, not just through the impact section, but the proposal overall, is some more detail regarding the platform\u2019s structure and content, so I could get a better sense of what the team is trying to build. But since I find the main focus of the proposal as benefitting to our ecosystem and consider that the impact the project could have is valuable, I will be giving this section a score of 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "While I have generally seen several learning platforms and I can easily imagine one and its possible functionalities, I would have hoped to gather more information about the activities and design for the one described in this proposal. Even though I agree in general about the importance of such a potential platform, the information provided is not enough to get a sense of the functionalities that will be offered, that will be the main pillars of the success for this project. The purpose of this platform is to teach students about blockchain and Cardano, as such, I imagine that the driving factor behind its development would be how that information can be delivered as fast, efficient and interactive as possible. If the team behind the project has a very clear sense of what they want to implement, I think they have to try and learn to better convey that information to other people.\nBecause of the lack of such vital information, I am put in a spot where I cannot judge the timeline provided, the budget described or the skills of the team members, no matter how well they were written.\nSpeaking of the budget, I find the numbers provided to be appropriate, but again, I would have liked to see a bit more information about the number of hours or other metrics needed for some of the operations, like developing the website, and editing videos or translating content. \nEven though I like the idea, I cannot estimate if, based on the information the proposer has provided in this section, that the project can be successfully implemented or not.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I feel that the tracking measurements described by the proposer are the basic, general ways of keeping a team going and working on any project, and does not offer any specific insight into how the progress of this particular proposal will be tracked, and most importantly, how the Cardano Community will be able to track its development: \u201cEstablishing clear deadlines for every task\u201d, \u201cSetting specific goals and deliverables throughout the project\u201d etc. The team should have posted clear metrics that they will use to check if the project\u2019s progress is on track. As a quick example that comes to mind, tracking the number of students who enroll on the platform or the number of teachers willing to share their knowledge etc. would have made for some clear, verifiable metrics and the team only would have had to decide on where they would publicly track these. It could either be on a website, discord server, miro board or google sheet etc.\nGoing into the next section, the first answer to the success question is \u201cMaintaining the fixed budget and not exceeding it\u201d,  and even though I sense there is good intention behind it, I find it feels weird to read it as a success base for an entire project and casts doubt over the previous section of feasibility that contains the budget decided by the team as being sufficient. Combined with the fact that the proposal\u2019s plan is not well defined, the budget is not detailed, and the KPIs are missing entirely, I feel like neither the Catalyst, nor the Cardano Community can easily audit the progress and success of the proposal as it stands at the moment. If not funded in this round, I hope the team can come back and resubmit the proposal with the missing additional details.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 3, "ng": 5, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Auditability:\n-''does not offer any specific insight into how the progress of this particular proposal will be tracked, and most importantly, how the Cardano Community will be able to track its development''\n=> We will present monthly reports for the catalyst community considering our progress and we will make sure to receive constructive feedback from the community to improve our project's quality and based upon which we might adjust our planning.\nIndeed, Every phase of the project described in the Feasibility section will be fully visible to the community on our website https://www.explochain.com/.\n-Additionally, we aim to track the number of students enrolled in our platform and most importantly receive constructive feedback from learners to improve the platform's quality by arranging Zoom meetings to submit feedback and fill out surveys regarding their learning experience as we mentioned which will be the most accurate criterion defining the success of the project as we mentioned in our proposal.\n- As computer science students, we are eager to build opportunities from scratch to encourage the young generation in the MENA region to join the Cardano community.

Cardano will expand and get new ideas and the new ones will have the opportunity to earn and develop some new technology in their countries.
