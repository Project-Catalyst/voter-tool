A look at the main objective under this project, makes proposers the central focus of this project, without any clarity whether the proposers are existing or new. This is very important, due to the objective of the challenge and scouting for student setting challenge\u2013 focuses on the students entrepreneurs. There is no clarity on the target audience.

Obviously the role of a video editor would be required here and Tonis' profile suits this. In addition to these expertise, the proponent provides a clear role of each team member. Based on this, we know who will do what at what point along the project implementation. The overall experience and expertise of the team clearly suit this proposal and are well positioned to navigate through the possible challenges this project may face. The downside to the team\u2019s bio is the absence of attached external link that proves the expertise and experience of the team.

At what specific time does the project aims to set off before fund 11?And when it set off what activities would be performed from start to finish? What are the timelines for such activities? The general information on the plan for project implementation is so generic. More information is needed on the roadmap so as to know the sequence of events to be undertaken to ensure project implementation. For example, even though the proponent intend to market the project in several channels to increase the participation, I wish the team indicates when this would happen. I would entreat the team to refine the roadmap to provide answers to these questions. Again, the budget structure does not tell us the breakdown of each identifiable item. Lumping facilitating, Project Management, and documentation together with an allocation of 2500$, makes accountability difficulty.

And given that the proposal generally aims to improve proposal quality, I believe that it is appropriate placed in the challenge which addresses helping student entrepreneurs to grow their reputation by delivering high quality ideas.\n\nI look at this proposal from two perspectives.  1) As an entrepreneur, where developing and scaling a business is often secondary to the skills required to pitch and attract investment for ideas - since those skillsets often do not overlap.  2) As a former student, where academic performance is often measured by standardized testing, where scores can more accurately reflect the students ability when they have prepared for the test (format, duration, and content) and and are better prepared to apply their knowledge in a format that is new to them.  And from both of those perspectives, it is easy to see the value the proposers offer in terms of delivering an impact to Catalyst which is well defined in terms of goals, and strategically impactful in terms of engagement and content distribution.\n\nThe overall quality of the mini feedback videos provided as a sample of past work is high, and the proposer also did a great job of providing data from Fund 7 and 8 (after being funded for similar projects in Funds 6 and 7) which prove the effectiveness of their approach and how it aligns with their objective goals to help proposers exceed a certain overall rating.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the abundance of well organized data to show past performance and objective results from previous funds, it is clear that the team is knowledgable on implementation of their and monitoring the results.

The team's experience and history of collaboration also lends high confidence to their synergies as it relates to producing high quality work that is transparent and measurable.  And finally regarding budget requested, the proposal distributes chunks of the $5000 USD to different efforts based on an estimate which is not described in great detail.  While previous proposals from this team had a more clear cost calculation and operations estimates, the results of those projects are sufficiently detailed, so I could acknowledge that the proposer likely aims to achieve more flexibility on use of those funds even though the funding request was slighly increased.

Even though the workshops would be less relevant after the \u2019finalizing\u2019-stage, it does still bring important value in the Catalyst process, albeit for a specific part of the process (The proposer has acknowledged this in the proposal). \n\nLooking at the wide picture, this proposal addresses the challenge effectively by creating a space where the targeted student entrepreneurs can come for guidance and development of skills. For it to be a complete match with the challenge brief, I would have liked to see a heavier focus on on-boarding new student entrepreneurs into these workshops. I might be missing something, but the proposal seems to focus on people that already have come in contact with project Catalyst. I believe (personal opinion) that these workshops would be invaluable for new student entrepreneurs, but at a later stage after being introduced to Catalyst. Having said that, maybe students are exposed to these workshops without proposing, and then attending the next fund with a proposal after learning about the process. \n\nAll in all, the proposer addresses the problem and proposed solution in a way that communicates a lot of understanding and commitment.

Their experience and knowledge of Catalyst paired with the flexible attitude of adapting to what is needed in the workshops is indeed a very strong combination. It is not hard to track down the evidence of the teams track record or competence, since everything is provided with links (A follow-up track record and short statistical analysis from each proposal? Provided Curriculum for the workshops? If every proposal included this like it does in this proposal, my job as a PA would be a lot easier). \nThe videos are all public, so we can easily see deliverables from earlier proposals, and how they are treated and developed through time. \nWe\u2019re provided with a clear timeline presenting each step of the process in a detailed way. If I could wish for something, it would be to include further explanations on how the team manages outreach. What channels are they active on, is it just Cardano related channels? It is not imperative information to include, but some info on how they plan to increase participation rate would make this proposal even stronger. \n\nAs a teacher and researcher, I\u2019m figuratively thrilled to see so much material provided in the proposal, when trying to understand the contents and thoughts behind these workshops. By reading the documents and watching the videos of workshops (and feedback of these), it gives me a good chance to understand not only why or what the proposer wants to achieve, but also how. \u2028\u2028We are presented with a reasonable budget allocation, divided between the three team members based on responsibility areas within the project. One suggestion I would give to make the proposal even stronger is the inclusion of an estimate of the working hours for each person. This would make the division of labor a bit clearer, which might be valuable when for example understanding the actual workload of the project (for those of us who doesn\u2019t have experience in video editing, for example). \n\nAnother aspect that speaks well of the potential success of this proposal, is that the team aims to implement it starting Fund 11, giving them ample time to finish current proposals. The risk of the study material being obsolete (due to the rapid changes that can happen between funds) is highlighted in the workshops, and addressed accordingly. \n\u2028As a whole, I strongly agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As mentioned under \u2019feasibility\u2019, the proposal gives us an easy opportunity to understand each stage of the process via a roadmap.

Catalyst Swarm is present and very active in many different social media platforms (Youtube, Discord, etc) so communicating with the team and tracking the progress of development will be an easy job for most people. There seems to be room for development (as addressed by the proposer) in regards to scalability and outreach, but the team provide us with realistic target numbers for these aspects. (Increasing average video views from 30 to 40, for example).\nThe project KPIs provided show a steady increase in proposal quality (the ones who attended the workshops), which is further evidence of continued development and competency. \nConclusively, I strongly agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2504", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 5, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3508, "q0": "The proposers' contributions to the Cardano ecosystem clearly precede the submission of this proposal.

Therefore, taking into account all of the above, it can be stated without a doubt that this proposal contributes to the progress and growth of Cardano.

I quote: \"... the number of proposals to Catalysts is increasing rapidly, and the community does not easily notice small-scale proposals from students... Therefore, to make it easier for the community to recognize new ideas from students, we will establish a new Category exclusively for students. In addition, instead of the roadmap being ambiguous, we set a budget limit of $ 5,000. By doing so, many students can experience funding from Catalyst.\"  In my experience, these reasons become strategically important for an organization in search of innovation that will put it at a positive distance from its competitors (as in the case of Cardano).  That is the reason why I must drastically downgrade its rating to 2 stars since I consider that this proposal would be perfectly suitable in another category, occupying a place among more mature proponents.
