This proposal was the idea of \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200ba bachelor of business at the Grenoble School of Management, this is his second proposal in this challenge. However, after reading the 2 proposals, I found them to be completely the same, except for the target audience, in the \"International students for Cardano\" proposal https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/ 414506 is targeted at 80 Bachelor of International Business (BIB) students and the proposal is currently targeted at 80 students belonging to a student association (ALOHA). The goal of this proposal is to teach the ALOHA association about Cardano and Catalyst and then help them come up with some business ideas that could be useful for Cardano and Catalyst, which will then be shared among the technicians. Cardano's mentors will choose whom they can propose. In terms of impact, I think it meets the goal of the challenge. However, in terms of risk, I think the biggest risk here is that the proponent is currently a student, in addition to studying, he also has to propose, and as he said he has several proposals in this fund and is working as an administrator for 2 proposals from the fund 8. How is it possible to balance learning and implementing many proposals when the leader of this project only has one alone? I have 3 options for this risk:\n- Gather several members with similar interests, then assign and divide the work for each member, which will give peace of mind to the community about the ability to carry out the project.\n-Or an alternative I think is more convincing is that he submits a proposal for this challenge, then based on the results achieved, can expand this idea through upcoming funds.\n- And finally, it is to put these proposals together, because after all, the target audience for the proposal is students of Grenoble Ecole de Management (so the route is the same, we just need to ask for a little extra cost to make)\nFor the above reasons, although the proposal is in line with the objective of the challenge, unfortunately, my opinion is neutral on this proposal.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "It is difficult to assess the feasibility of the project. While the proposal provides a complete roadmap, a good explanation of the budget as well as providing enough information about the person implementing the proposal. But as I showed in the impact section, the proponent had a similar idea in this challenge so the planning, budget, and team aspects are the same. This also raises questions for us, I think it would be more convincing if the proponent could explain why the two proposals' roadmaps are the same but require 2 parts of the budget? For example \"Create a presentation: $40 in 5 hours = $200\" I think this cost can be minimized because we only need to do it once. After all, the target audience is all students, so the content may be the same. Quote \"Monitoring student ideas: 6 hours per week for 6 weeks x $40 = $140. Help students write proposals if needed: estimate 10 hours per week x 4 weeks x $40. = $1600\" I can understand that each week you spend at least 16 hours monitoring student ideas and helping them write proposals. So if all your proposals are funded, this time pool will grow exponentially! (not to mention the time spent on other tasks of the proposal). This is very difficult to convince the community. I think the most important thing right now is that you need to recruit more members to be able to work on the project together. Because of the above factors, I, unfortunately, disagree with the feasibility of this proposal. (It should be clear that on the \"International students for Cardano\" proposal I gave the maximum score, and I think that if the author only made 1 proposal in this challenge, it would be possible.)", "q1r": 2, "q2": "And finally about audibility, if this proposal is funded I think it is quite easily audited by the indicators provided by the author. The proposal takes care of setting goals and KPIs that will serve as a document for us to analyze the progress of the proposal. It's entirely possible to track results based on the different goals they set.

Also, I agree that I have two really similar proposals on the same challenge, but there was a budget limit of $5000 for the proposals which means that I can not have a huge impact, this proposal is meant for Cardano to start implementing in a business school and to expand among students.\nMoreover, he gives his personal opinion saying that the budget is too high"}, {"id": 3152, "q0": "I assessed another or Benjis proposals, which I found to be extremely impactful and relevant to the challenge. What works really well is that he has identified a concrete student group that he has access to - a captive audience if you will - and he has a clear, concrete value proposition for them: Learn about Cardano and blockchain, brainstorm ideas with guided help, and work with established community leaders to apply for funding. Far from competing with each other, I think implementing this plan with multiple groups within a university community has the potential to magnify the impact, and there is the possibility of cross-pollenization between the groups, sharing knowledge, and magnifying the effect.

The project provides a detailed description that suit the objective in the challenge setting. The adoption of the ALOHA community for this initiative open up access to a host of people with different background and expertise that could be beneficial to the catalyst community. \u201cThe plan is to teach the ALOHA association about cardano and catalyst, then to help them find some business ideas that could be useful for Cardano and catalyst, these ideas would then be shared to the engineers of cardano who will choose who they can do a proposal with\u201d. The context of the objective unpinning this project provides the cardano ecosystem enormous value addition to the network. In the first place, I envisage that, by this project, the team creates the  potential of not only attracting young people, but also serves as a transition(on-boarding) into the cardano space. Per the project, there is an already established network with cardano industry experts to assist in connecting and shaping the ideas of students. The more relevant point here is the myriad of ideas that could be available to the catayst  community via this program. Ultimately, the end goal here is to expand within the different associations of \u201cThe Grenoble Ecole de Management association\u201d (France).This is a long term sustainable strategy that could project the image of the cardano network and also help scale up the growth of cardano through the on-boarding of developers. However, the only missing element here is a marketing strategy to attract more students to the program. I see an amount located at the budget for student promotion but there is no marketing strategy that requires such amount. We know students are generally stimulated by incentivized learning platforms, therefore, as part of a marketing strategy, i suggest the team allocates a specific amount in ADA for participants. In addition, the use of social media channels is now the choicest medium for advertisement due to the volume in usage. Other than this few observation, i am generally impressed by the input of the team.  ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The clarity and the well elaborated project description in addressing the identified problem, coupled with a concise and precise design of the roadmap shows how the project would be followed through from start to finish. This shows the commitment of the team in executing this project. The project intend to use 8 weeks for the project, with a breakdown of the set of activities under specific duration of each week(s). I prefer the team assign specific duration of week(s) for each activity under week 3-4 and week 5-8. This would provide clarity on the activities the team would be undertaking for each week. Apart from that, i suggest the proposer indicates clearly whether the activities would be sequential as listed or random. Aside that, ibelieve the budget is accurately representation or reflection of the market value per my understanding. To add to this, the overall allocation of 4.16k falls \nbelow the cap set for this challenge. The project is educational based and the amount requested for falls within the range charged per an educational hour.However, per my understanding of market values on the items listed, i think the estimated amount for some items for the project is a bit too high. For instance, citing  point 3 of the bullet, \u201cSupervise the students ideas : estimated 10 hours per week x 4 weeks x $40 = $1600\u201d, i find it fascinating that the amount allocated is the same as \u201chelp the students write proposals if needed\u201d. In my opinion this amount should be lowered to reflect market value and the conditionality of the point in the bullet 3 (Help the students write proposals if needed). Clearly, the allocated money for item 3 would only be used if the conditional clause is fulfilled (it also possible it won't happen). Hence in my view, this amount  shouldn\u2019t match the amount for helping students write proposals.

Per the profile, Yoram is an interned in cardano ecosystem, PA and is already working on a few catalyst project, this suggest an accumulated work experience in the catalyst space and in project execution. Hence this confirms his competence to execute this project. However, i think the workload and the ambitious nature of the project would be too much for one person to bear. Therefore i suggest Yoram consider getting more team members.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "My understanding of the the information provided at the auditability section of the project is that, it is sufficient to ensure the effective monitoring of the project. It is hard to identify any set back on the auditability of this project.

The KPIs provided shows a clear alignment with the objective of the project and would help determine how well the team performs and grows. Additionally, the suggested KPIs provides the best quantitative metric for assessing this project. I am also impressed with the willingness of the team to make available their progress report to the community via town hall.However, i will also suggest that, the team also consider alternative medium (such telegram and discord) of making such report available to the catalyst community since not everyone may be present at town hall meetings. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2734", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8688, "q0": "The main purpose of this project is to educate the members of a university student association about Cardano to introduce them to a new avenue for funding their creative ideas, search for and filter useful business proposals for Cardano, support those proposals to participate in Catalyst in Fund11 under the advice of skilled engineers.
