I learned that Ghana is a country located in the center of West Africa sharing borders with the Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso and Togo. With a population of around 32 million, from 2017 to 2020, the country is frequently considered the economic powerhouse of West Africa. Despite being a country with a growing economy, the proportion of people in Ghana, especially women, participating in the financial market in general and the blockchain market using the rate is very small here.\nThe information that I learned through a recent TIME article for women entering the blockchain field is currently only about 4-6%, this would make this market lose an important piece of the puzzle areas where women are inherently preferred. According to another unofficial report, the female workforce in this industry currently accounts for only 10-30% of the total workforce. This has led to blockchain being a predominantly male-dominated industry. To overcome this problem, in Vietnam, we have established an organization dedicated to training female staff in the blockchain with the aim of helping to balance and bring women closer to this market. Therefore, I completely agree with the author's suggestion that in the increasingly innovative and continuously developing blockchain ecosystem, the Virtual Assistant project will help women not be left behind, This project will train young girls, equip them with the right tools to give them autonomy, use the power of blockchain in life. I see this as a very different proposition from the proposals in this challenge and should be promoted by the Cardano community.\nI have a younger sister who is currently a student at a leading technology training school in Vietnam. She shared with me that she really likes and wants to learn about the blockchain market. However, the difficulty she faces is that this market is too innovative and challenging, she constantly has difficulty in finding new information, knowledge, and technology updates. I learned that not only my sister, but many of her other female classmates also had the same problem. So, I appreciate the idea of the proposal, I think it is not only suitable in Ghana but also in our country Vietnam. If to grade this project, I will give the author team 5 points. The idea presented solved the problem and was a perfect fit for the challenge. The proposal has a clear plan and roadmap, giving specific numbers for the community to monitor the project progress.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The authors have given a specific figure that it takes 2 months to complete the project since funding. The plan table is broken down by week to make it easier to deploy and manage work. It was clear to me that the division of the plan was well done by the team members.\nThe project's budget to be funded is $4750, which is 95% of the $5,000 cost limit for each proposal in this challenge which is perfectly reasonable. The breakdown of costs by 7 items shows that the authors have carefully calculated the use of the budget. I find this to be a number that satisfies the given challenge and makes perfect sense for this proposal.\nThe authors have also anticipated the risks and come up with their solutions. The free educational solution will help attract interested female students and increase women's trust in the Cardano and blockchain ecosystem.\nProposers of the project are people with many years of experience in the field of expertise, they have been participating as content advisors for many projects at previous funds of the Cardano foundation. They do provide links to LinkedIn, Github, Twitter to verify activity on community sites. Identity and work experience are also disclosed clearly and transparently.\nWith the information presented clearly, I give the feasibility of the proposal a score of 4, a very high score on the rating scale.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "With this proposal, I see that the community can completely monitor the implementation progress and success of the project according to the weekly schedule of the plan sheet and each item of the budget.\nThe authors have also come up with four KPIs to measure the success of the project, which are the number of women who have signed up for the training course, the number of women who have completed the training, the number of women who attended catalyst and number of wallets Yoroi created. However, I see that these KPIs only stop at the content part, but have not been quantified by specific target numbers so that the community can easily monitor the success of the project.\nThe authors also said that when the project is completed and successful, at least 50% of young women will be trained in the areas of web design, digital marketing, content writing, and more. I think this is not a small percentage and it is worth looking forward to the results of this project.\nThis is a completely new project that has never been funded by previous funds. In this fund 9, this is a proposal that will ensure the 4 SDG sustainable development goals in which I see the 5th goal \"Achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls\" as one top target in many countries around the world especially in West Africa.\nI will give 4 points for the transparency part of the proposal because I think the team of authors has also presented their plan very well.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3281", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 2, "ng": 8, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11777, "q0": "This proposal is perfect for the \u201cChallenge & Scouted for Students\u201d challenge. This is one of the few ideas aimed at women in Fund 9. Personally, I like the solution that the team proposes. The solution content is, to organize a free training program for 100 female students, graduates, or young businesswomen to become virtual assistants in Catalyst. I appreciate the human spirit of this solution, with the desire not to leave women behind in the innovation of blockchain technology. Although this proposal only solves the problem on a small geographical scale in the Republic of Ghana - a country in West Africa, I believe that if accepted by the community, this proposal will bring great opportunities for Ghanaian women to participate more equally and actively in Catalyst activities. This will help spread the Cardano spirit and encourage similar proposals aimed at women to appear in subsequent Funds. I would also like to provide more information, on why I appreciate the impact of this solution. According to research by the World Bank (WB), Africa is the only region in the world where women choose to become entrepreneurs more than men. Women-led businesses make up one-third of all businesses in Africa (https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/opinion/2018/11/29/women-entrepreneurs-the-future-of -africa). So, women-focused solutions in Africa will make our Cardano ecosystem more accessible in this region. Regarding the risks of the solution, the team pointed out, due to the influence of cryptocurrency Ponzi schemes, many people lack confidence in activities related to digital assets. As someone with a lot of interest in the blockchain community in Africa, I personally think there are still some other risks the team needs to consider. Specifically: First, the risk of discrimination may prevent women from having equal access to the world of blockchain technology. Second, the poor quality of internet connections and the high cost of internet connections in the region also hindered entry to Catalyst for local women. Africa is known as a continent where people have to pay 10-20% of their monthly income for internet connection costs. This is also the highest rate in the world. Therefore, in order to overcome these barriers, I suggest that the group, in addition to organizing free training, should spend part of the budget as a reward fund, organize awarding minigames, and encourage local women to participate more in the project activities. Overall, I appreciate the impact and humanity of the solution. My score is 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the implementation progress and budget, the team described it in detail and clearly. The training plan is expected to be implemented by the group in 2 months, listing specific items for each week. However, I only have one small comment about the training time of the group \u2013 the expected 2 weeks is relatively short, in my opinion, for newcomers to Catalyst. I suggest the team consider increasing the training time by at least 2 weeks or organizing activities to connect, answer, and support after the training. This will help remove difficulties for those who are new to Catalyst. In terms of budget, the team spent almost a third of the total budget on the cost of renting the conference space for training ($1500) for 2 days. However, I could not find detailed explanations of conference room size and unit rent/day. Similarly, the remaining items (expenses for advertising, events, refreshments, etc.) do not have unit price * expected quantity. This makes it very difficult for the community to assess whether the basis of each cost item is reasonable. Regarding the team, the reference links to the member profiles are exhaustive. In it, all 3 members are female. I believe the team has enough skills and experience to successfully implement the project. My rating is 4. I have made the following deductions: - 1 point for missing budget item-unit price figures.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding the auditability of the proposal, the team gave a number of criteria to evaluate, including: number of women enrolled in the training course, number of people completing the training course, the number of women participating in Catalyst, number of Yoroi wallets have been created. Unfortunately, the team did not include KPIs for each of these metrics. This makes it very difficult for the community to understand exactly what project success will look like. A unique indicator that has been provided by the team, is that at least 50% of young women will be trained in the areas of web design, digital marketing, content writing, and more.

The proposer mentions the potential in \u201cblockchain-based solutions\u201d and by onboarding more women to blockchain technology, specifically Cardano community, more solutions will be devised to solve the problems that arise. It is impactful that the proposer mentions that women are also a workforce that are affected by the waves of blockchain technology. Therefore, their engagement will have an impact on the Ghana community and also on their own lives (empowerment, competence, independence, employment...), which should be given more analysis and emphasis on this proposal. The center of this project is Ghana. Although it is understood that young women in Ghana will be the target audience, it can be stated more clearly whether this project will be catering for women from all walks of life or will first target at certain demographics (highschool, university, working age,...?). The proposer could also speculate how this could become a trend in the surrounding countries of Africa. But most importantly, what is the scale of this proposal? (How many people will be trained?)

There could be information about this venue, such as its capacity, location, facilities,...

This proposer should be applauded for seeking to bridge that gap, by introducing women to Cardano and its numerous opportunities.\nThe team is also very capable and well experienced, with almost all team members having a connection with the Cardano community. Most of them have engaged in previous funds, and filled different portfolios. This is also going to be a locally based project, as it will target female students and entrepreneurs in Ghana.\nA few concerns are that, the proposer fails to elaborate on the type of training module the team will employ in their education quest. Also after training these women to be virtual assistants, how will they better serve the catalyst community.\nThis project will definitely help onboard more students into the Cardano ecosystem, but it fails to outline how these virtual assistants will be of help to the ecosystem, as the proposer fails to elaborate more on this point.

I believe these two activities are interchanged, I think the team should focus on advertisements before calling for applications.\nThere is enough information to ascertain the qualification and experience of the team members.

Education is the first step toward inclusion because the majority of students in Ghana, particularly female students, are unaware of the enormous possibility offered by the blockchain ecosystem.

A  major part of the deficiency in the educational setup in Africa is the lack of an entrepreneurial systems that empower women to be more innovative in providing solutions that meet local expectation. Therefore, I agree with  the idea of the proposer in coming up with such an initiative. The highlight for me in this project is the attempt to use this initiative to onboard more people into the cardano ecosystem. This will definitely scale up the growth of cardano ecosystem. Hence this is very commendable. However, I believe the end goal of the project, which is to train at least 50% of the young women into web design, digital marketing and content writing needs to relooked. In my view, the team should consider  providing a clarification on the link between the success of the project and how its value addition to the cardano community. Ideally, the end goal of training and mentoring entrepreneurs should lead to value addition to the cardano network.However, after getting young girls to learn web design, digital marketing and content writing, the proponent failed to indicate how to make these skills beneficial to the ecosystem. A key goal of the Fund 9 challenge is to prepare people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem, hence i suggest that the team realign the impact they intend to make to suit the end goal of the Fund 9 challenge. I suggest the objective of the project should focus on empowering young girls to rather provide blockchain based solutions via their skills.

We are also made aware per the project of when each activity within the roadmap would happen (in which month and weeks), therefore there is enough clarity on the strategy to executive the project. Worth noting is the the background of the team. Their profile highlights their years of work experience within the cardano ecosystem and their contribution to the community, especially in the case of Awura Adjoa, she is still a student and has a solid experience in the Cardano ecosystem which would be very relevant in helping to attract and onboard more students. However, for the seek of credibility and transparency, i suggest she makes available a link to her LinkedIn profile just as the rest of the team has done. This would enhace the reputation of the team and the project.
