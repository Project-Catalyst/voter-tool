As for context, this proposal is a continuation of the same idea from Fund 7. One of the problems right now is that students, even from IT backgrounds, don\u2019t get a formal education on what blockchain is. This is critical because the students are the ones who will drive technology development in the future, so equipping them with blockchain materials would help them use it to solve current problems that might exist. What I like best about this proposal is that the syllabus is very basic, which helps students understand what kind of usecases the blockchain would allow, why it exists in the first place, and why it is designed the way it is. Therefore, after the course, the students are more versed when discussing how blockchain could revolutionize the world. I appreciate that the proposer put Cardano specifically in the syllabus.\n\nThat being said, I do wonder if there are any changes compared to the previous implementation. Maybe there are certain topics that need more time, or maybe new topics that need to be added to the syllabus.

There is no problem with the timetable as it is the same as with previous lectures. Overall, based on the Fund 7 implementation, there seems to be no major hindrance that might occur.\n\nHowever, I would like the proposer to break down the budget a bit more precisely. The budget allocated for book expenses, websites, and services should have an explanation to justify them. For example, why does the proposer need to buy books (can\u2019t they just use online resources)? Which books are they buying? Why is there a budget allocated for a website when the previous lectures used Zoom? What services do they mean exactly? Why is the professor's payment 4200 USD? How many professors do they provide?
