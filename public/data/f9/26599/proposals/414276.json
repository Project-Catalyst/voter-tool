If this barrier can be lowered, or even better, entirely removed, the impact on the entire ecosystem could be great.\nAs such, I find this proposal to be very well in the parameters of the challenge setting, as they intend to develop an e-learning platform for Tunisian students to teach them about Cardano in an engaging, hands-on way. The lessons will be held in French and Arabic, two languages that the team has researched and found that there is very little content about Cardano in.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "While the feasibility sections of the two proposals the team has submitted are identical, I find that the additional information provided in the impact section of this proposal offers a lot from the missing details I was asking for.\nThere is more documentation regarding the platform and its intended use, as such, I have been able to get a better grasp of what the team intends to do, and even though the details are not very specific, I find the information provided can be sufficient. \nRegarding the budget, I am a little bit unsure if the requested amount can be sufficient for what the team intends to do, as I am still unsure about the complexity of the learning platform, but the mention of \u201cfull support\u201d from a software development company from Germany restores a lot of the confidence.\nRegarding the team members\u2019 experience, I think they are perfectly suited to get this project done. What I would have liked to see though, is a clear answer to the question if the team has any other proposals in the same fund, as mentioned, I have assessed the other, very similar proposal in the same challenge. In the answer provided, they could have connected the two proposals and mentioned they are part of the same project and as such, I could have taken some of the extra information provided here and connected it to the other proposal, thus potentially increasing its review mark. But since this information was not provided, even though it is clearly asked for, I am not only not able to do that, but I will, unfortunately, have to take one point for it. The mentioned question is very important, not only to see if the proposers answer honestly in the submission form but also helps the PAs and the entire Cardano community understand what the team intends to do, especially if they have projects that are linked to each other, potentially even completing one another.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As mentioned in the above two assessments, this section is identical to the auditability section in the other proposal, but with some of the additional information provided in the implementation section, the review will be slightly adjusted to accommodate the additional details provided.\nI feel that the tracking measurements described by the proposer are the basic, general ways of keeping a team going and working on any project, and do not offer any specific insight into how the progress of this particular proposal will be tracked, and most importantly, how the Cardano Community will be able to track its development: \u201cEstablishing clear deadlines for every task\u201d, \u201cSetting specific goals and deliverables throughout the project\u201d etc. The team should have posted clear metrics that they will use to check if the project\u2019s progress is on track. As a quick example that comes to mind, tracking the number of students who enroll on the platform or the number of teachers willing to share their knowledge etc. would have made for some clear, verifiable metrics and the team only would have had to decide on where they would publicly track these. It could either be on a website, discord server, miro board or google sheet etc.\nGoing into the next section, the first answer to the success question is \u201cMaintaining the fixed budget and not exceeding it\u201d,  and even though I sense there is good intention behind it, I find it feels weird to read it as a success base for an entire project and casts doubt over the previous section of feasibility that contains the budget decided by the team as being sufficient.\nIn conclusion, I find the entire auditability section a bit too ambiguous and cannot correctly estimate if the project can be successfully tracked for its progress, as such I will be taking a neutral stance on this aspect.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 4, "ng": 12, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1602, "q0": "The idea itself is fully aligned with the objectives of the challenge, in addition to the fact that the proponent argues very well which issue is the problem to be solved. One of the biggest difficulties for our blockchain to become global is the language barrier, so much so that this was the subject of a specific challenge in previous funds. As the proponent states, there is a lot of educational content about Cardano in English, available online, and the objective here would be to generate knowledge in languages \u200b\u200bcompatible with Tunisian students, so that they can concretely learn about the cryptographic universe, more specifically Cardano. The proponent points out several problems currently encountered by this audience, such as \u201clack of guidance on where to start when learning blockchain technology and lack of learning platforms and events to learn cardano in French and Arabic\u201d; also indicates how blockchain technology can be beneficial for various economic sectors. In other words, theoretically, the proposal meets exactly what we are looking for in the challenge: to correctly and safely instruct students about the technologies relevant to our ecosystem. In addition to this main point, this proposal would also help to disseminate Cardano to an audience that does not have easy access to such knowledge. The problem I identified here was, mainly, the lack of detail regarding what would be created. We know that it would be an online, e-learning platform, that the contents would not only be theoretical, but also practical (students would need to present a final project to receive certificates). However, some important points were missing: would the platform be completely free? How would it be disseminated to students, how could we draw students' attention to the topic? How to make them realize the importance of this? And, the most important point I think would need to be included: what topics would be covered specifically, and in what order? They would probably be taught the initial concepts first and then move on to more in-depth questions, but I still think this could be better defined. For example: the course would have a total of 10 videos, the first being an introduction to the cryptographic universe, the second focused on Cardano, etc. For these reasons, I believe that the proposal is in line with what we are looking for in the challenge, but it still leaves something to be desired in terms of specificity.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unfortunately, the script of the proposal is explained very superficially. It is attached in a table, which we can see through the given link. Some activities (front-end development, internal process, course promotion to students, website design, etc) are delegated for a total period of 3 months. It is not possible to understand with solidity what would be done, when, by whom and in what way. All we know is which tasks to complete and the total time in which they would be carried out. Ideally, the proponent would explain what would happen (at a minimum) each month and that these activities would be more detailed. For example, how would the website design be developed? What kind of visual identity do they want to create? What would the platform's publicity campaign look like, through which media would they be disseminated? I believe that all activities should have been explained in a more specific way, so that we had a more concrete understanding of the whole. That said, this part of the script leaves a lot to be desired, unfortunately. Now, talking about the budget, this one is also explained in a superficial way. It would be 1500 dollars to pay the instructors, but how much? How many hours per week would they work? What, then, would be the value of your working hours? Why would marketing cost $500, how would the strategy be done? It would be necessary for each value to be better argued, regardless of whether the projects are of high or low investment, it is always necessary to understand why such a financial amount was requested. The team's presentation is also not very detailed. We generally know how the team would be made up, with a programming specialist, 2 computer science students and also with guidance from some active and experienced members of the Cardano community. But we don't have specific information about each. We don't know, for example, the name of the programming specialist, or even the students. We do not know their resumes, what they have produced so far in their training, if they have any solid connection with the technologies of our ecosystem, and if so, which ones\u2026 that they have done until today. In this way, we would have more confidence in relation to the preparation of this team to deal with the issues addressed in the project. For these reasons, unfortunately, I consider the proposal not very viable, we have no way of understanding the process because there are no phases, the activities are not well explained; the funding is also not as detailed and the staff is not properly presented.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proponent suggests valid ways to track the process, such as \u201csetting clear deadlines for each task will keep team members on track\u201d and \u201csetting specific goals throughout the project\u201d. However, the ideal would be that such goals and deadlines had already been defined since then. For example, what would need to be delivered at the end of each month? How can we monitor the work of professionals in relation to the construction of the site, whether in the programming, design, marketing part? How can the entire process be monitored periodically and concretely by the members of our community? In view of these doubts, I believe that it would be important for the proponent to provide us with more support, solving all doubts that may arise when it comes to how things are being done, what advances are being observed (even if small), what difficulties emerged in the process and so on. My suggestion is that the proponent and his team determine some methodology for monitoring the tasks (for example, I've seen that some teams use the Agile methodology to control the processes); for advances to be reported to the Cardano community, either through written reports, a checklist of tasks could be created on the website itself, or even that these updates be released through some of the team's social network, for example. Now, thinking about the end results, we know that the main goal is to introduce \u201cas many students as possible in programming and blockchain and training them so that they are fully ready for the professional world\u201d. The proponent also makes clear the intention to build a recognized platform. But how can we ascertain the impacts of all this for the Cardano ecosystem, in a solid way? It would be important, in my opinion, for a survey to be carried out with these students, after the course, to understand how they are using the knowledge obtained, if they are participating in the construction of any Dapp, if by chance they have become active members of the Cardano community and if yes, in what way\u2026 In other words, we understand the consequences of this online course, in addition to the number of students involved in the conceptualization of the site. For these reasons, I think auditability still has a lot to improve. Ideally, further research should be carried out, in order to accurately understand the consequences of the project, and to be able to verify if, in the end, it matches what the challenge asks for.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Impact / Alignment:\n-''And, the most important point I think would need to be included: what topics would be covered specifically, and in what order.''\n=> Our content will be divided into 3 main parts:\nwe will have three parts:\n- Cardano for beginners:\n    * Basic concepts of blockchain technology\n    * What is cardano\n    * What is ADA\n    * What is a Wallet\n    * What is project catalyst\n    * etc..\n- Cardano for intermediary\n- Advanced Cardano.\n''would the platform be completely free?''\n- The purpose of this project is not lucrative.Indeed, our target audience of Tunisian students faces financial difficulties as a result of the country's financial problems, as well as limited opportunities in the field of technology.

The amount offered for the salary of the project person may seem low, but it is probably a result of the position of the proponent and their respective local economy. However, it is still not practical because there will be many other costs incurred in the implementation process.
