However, what I find very problematic, and this is just my perspective, but I really do not find myself enticed to interact with a smart contract that lets any of the both parties burn the funds inside. I don\u2019t necessarily see people as being malicious, but I know errors are very often made, unintentionally, and I know I trust people to make errors all the time. That would be keeping me away from such a service, and I imagine that perhaps others would be too.\nSo I\u2019m wondering if the smart contract could possibly have another way of functioning, if the team might not be capable of finding another way to keep people truthful, and not as they put it, \u201cforce\u201d them into collaboration. Letting people choose to be truthful, in my experience, has always provided better results than trying to force them into that.\nIn conclusion, I see a good point in building this project, but not as it is designed at the moment.

The budget is obviously on the smaller side, but I imagine that since students will be completing the tasks enumerated, the budget allocated for each one is more of an incentive to participate in the process and learn new things on the way.\nI can perfectly understand if not all of the team members are willing to provide their real names, but then I would expect to find a more comprehensive section for each of them, that proves they possess the skills needed to complete the project.

The use cases that can be covered with a scrow contract are numerous and the layer of security they add to each of them is solid.  Being involved in a project that is specifically based on the development of scrow contracts, I am aware first hand of the possibilities that this structure generates.  From the information provided regarding the team's experience it can be deduced that they certainly have the expertise to execute the project they are presenting for funding.  However, as clear as their skills are, it is clear that their profile is outside the guidelines prescribed by the Challenge for which they are applying.  I believe that there would be no objection to this if the stipulation of that profile did not have a valid purpose to justify it. \n\nThe fundamental motivation behind the \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\" Challenge, approved by the Catalyst community last fund, is to provide college and university students with a space completely separate from the regular Catalyst environment in which they can bring their projects to Project Catalyst and secure base funding, nothing financially ambitious. Clumsy projects, with flaws or weaknesses if any, but with a true innovative and creative student spirit, insolent and daring, that will lead their authors to find in our community a place to learn and get involved, a playground endowed not only with money, but more importantly, with the possibility to get hands on with the best technology in the industry while having access to the knowledge, experience and sense of collaboration of Catalyst members. A new concept for Catalyst no doubt, but an efficient one: in the student community of the planet lies that needle in the haystack that ends up changing the game we play so tightly with other blockchains and the legacy world, and it is our obligation to build the best of the magnets to find it. That's just what this Challenge is trying to do: build a suitable habitat for students, designed primarily by the students themselves. \n\nBecause of my affinity with this Challenge (formal experience in education at school, university, company level) and my experience in Project Catalyst (actively participating in 90% of the community positions that exist: CA, VCA, Challenge Team member, funded proposer, involvement in multiple projects in Catalyst) I have been following it closely since it was approved at F8, because it never ceases to amaze me how often the scoreboard seeks to augment itself with topics of undeniable importance (Developer Ecosystem, Cross-Chain Collaboration, The Great Migration (From Ethereum)) to the point of discarding areas that in the real world have proven to be an inexhaustible source of ideas, creativity and results, such as those related to students.\n\nAs an educator and experienced Project Catalyst member involved also in technical projects inside the ecosystem,  I understand the intention behind the proposal and consider it completely valid. However, it is evident that it is not being proposed by the type of students that the Community decided to support through this Challenge, therefore it does not fit the parameters of the Challenge.  I quote (excerpted from the Challenge information): \"By creating a category of students and increasing exposure for their ideas, they can expect easier funding and to be scouted by engineers\" (section What does success look like?). \"Most student entrepreneurs suffer from a shortage of resources, especially when it comes to funding and hiring engineers\" (Why is this important? section). \"However, the number of proposals to Catalysts is increasing rapidly, and the community does not readily perceive small-scale proposals from students. .... Therefore, to make it easier for the community to recognize new ideas from students, we will establish a new category exclusively for students\" (Challenge brief section). \n\nTaking into account the above reasoning, I must remove three stars from the final rating.      \n\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposers would probably agree that this type of project deserves a little more depth of detail at the implementation plan level.  As someone involved in this type of project I see this as necessary to assess the technical strengths of the project and I am sure that colleagues or others knowledgeable in the field will find this necessary as well.  It is actually a paradox: the low level of detail would be understandable if the proposers were college or university students in full exercise of their student status, however, as experienced players in the field, they should be aware of the level of detail in the information provided.  \n\nThe reduced level of detail presented in the implementation plan is also a rule in the budget description.  Therefore, as an evaluator, there are many assumptions that must be made to give the proposal a chance of successful execution.\n\nThe lack of detail in the information provided in the Feasability section leads me to reduce the final rating by two stars.

The development of twitter spaces and their corresponding number of attendees does not have any relationship with the status of the service to be built.  The same is the case for the growth of the twitter account and the discord server.\n\nOn the other hand, there is no clear methodology to reasonably establish how the leap towards the future vision stated in the subsection \"What does success for this project look like?\" of the Auditability section will be made.    The project as a whole does not offer the arguments to establish the possibility of such progress.\n\nTherefore, I must be in complete disagreement in terms of auditability, which means removing 4 stars from the final rating.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_2462", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4787, "q0": "The proposer states the problem of students who have a limited amount of funds and cannot risk being scammed by developers and freelancers.
