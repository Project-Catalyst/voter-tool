In the theoretical field, the proposal seeks to improve the accessibility of university students, in Tanzania, to the various features of blockchain technology (specifically with Cardano). The main objective is to make these students understand what Cadarno/Catalyst is and enjoy all the opportunities that our ecosystem offers. Proponents argue why it is interesting to develop the project in Tanzania: the place does not have good accessibility regarding the topics covered, I believe mainly because of the language barrier. It is positive that they have already started the work by translating about 10 thousand words, to serve this community, as they themselves declare. It is also very valid that they have (or maintain a partnership, this is not so clear) with a company that already carries out business consulting in the country, already having a physical headquarters and so on. In other words, we would not be starting from scratch when funding this proposal, as the proposers already have a good performance and influence with the local community in Tanzania. What I think could have been better defined would be how they would approach these students: it is said that visits to universities, in-person and online workshops would take place, and that topics such as the blockchain system (including smart contracts, DAOs, NFTs ); what are cryptocurrencies; how Cardano's sustainable infrastructure works (Proof of Stake) and so on. But it would be more valid if we had an action schedule that told us, for example, how many online workshops would take place, how often, how students would be encouraged to participate\u2026 Which universities would be the focus of the campaign, with what strategies students would be approached, in way they will be coerced to participate in the community (either through Catalyst or directly participating in hubs or projects, for example)\u2026 Anyway, in my view, how these ideas would be put into practice was a little absent, however much the proponents detail the what would be addressed and how (face-to-face or online, for example) things would be done, some organizational and temporal details would be welcome, as well as a greater understanding of which universities would be approached and which students (perhaps those who were already more close to forming). It is positive that the authors mention which challenges can be faced in the development of the project (costs associated with computers, educational difficulties and other associated costs) and already seek solutions to mitigate such aspects. Therefore, I conclude that the idea is very much in line with the goal of involving and encouraging students to participate in our community and our projects, but as I pointed out, some more information would be needed.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal's script is satisfactory, only that two things are not adequate, in my view: both the level of detail of the activities and the fact that the workshops with the students would only take place during 1 week. Regarding temporality, the total would last 4 months, and the time is divided into weeks, which gives us a great understanding of what would happen and when. Regarding each of the activities, I believe they could have been reported in more detail, with more explanations attached. How would the team be selected, in fact, what would be the positions to be occupied to carry out the project? How many people would have to be added, in addition to those who were presented in the proposal? How would the workshop be marketed? It would be important to approach a simple and attractive way of publicizing the project, so that even university students who are not in the technology area and who have never heard of blockchain before are interested in participating in the project. How would the workshops be held? As I commented on impact, some very important information should have been mentioned here, such as 1) number of workshops 2) type of workshops 3) who would present the contents 4) how many students are expected per workshop, a list should also have been provided clear which subjects would be covered in each workshop, or if, for example, in each workshop an overview would be made about Cardano, mentioning from introductory topics to more advanced subjects (a suggestion would be the following: half of the workshop could be destined for all audiences where a more general aspect of blockchain could be explored, and the rest of the time could be devoted to technology students, covering more specific and technical subjects. very clear, but more detail could also be provided for some parts, and some expenses are a bit confusing, in my vision. For example, in the part of the shirts. It is not very clear if it would be 4 shirts costing 150 dollars each, or 150 shirts costing 4 dollars. Would they be used by the \u201cteachers\u201d of the workshops? Where would advertising materials such as pins, stickers and posters be spread out? Probably in the 3 selected universities, but it would be good if this was clarified as well. How many materials is it intended to manufacture? What exactly is catering expenses all about? This term is not known to all readers of the proposal, probably, I had to research to understand what it would be (food service). Would it then be 200 dollars for each face-to-face meeting? It is also not so clear the hourly price of the professionals involved, since we do not know exactly how many there would be, and the payment would be 1000 dollars for 6 hours of work (of an X number of professionals). Finally, about the team, it's a partnership with a company, a lot of trust is conveyed, since they are well involved with Cardano and provide several means for us to contact them directly.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Project auditability is good, although not perfect. As a tracking of progress, we have several KPIs, such as \u201cThe prevalence of positive feedback from workshop participants (measured in the post-workshop survey) / Level at which workshop participants observe that their knowledge of blockchain has improved (measured in the survey post-workshop) / Views, comments and shares from the LinkedIn blog series / Future views and citations of the peer-reviewed article\u201d. Regarding the last two metrics mentioned, the city of Vienna is mentioned, I don't know if it was a mistake, but probably yes; this information causes some confusion. In general, the information provided is valid for us to understand the partial results achieved, but it would also be necessary, for us to have a complete auditability of this part of the proposal, for us to know how the work behind these advances was being developed. Are the workshops being properly designed and made available? Is the disclosure process being done with the promised consistency? How are students being counted? Would the team be working in their respective roles at the respective time it was planned? Finally, analyzing success, we know that it would be considered when the students involved in the project solidly understand what blockchain is, what are the characteristics and differentials of Cardano, and especially how to get involved in projects relevant to our community, mitigating local and global (as the bidders describe). I believe that these are really the final metrics to be analyzed, what is lacking here is to understand how this scenario would be researched, understood and proven through tangible data. Would a survey be carried out after each workshop, in order to understand the performance of students, how many and which ones would be seeking to insert themselves, in practice, in the Cardano community? And we also understand what roles they would be seeking to play, how their efforts would be rewarded and how they would be contributing to the better establishment of our blockchain in the country in question, and so on. It would then be necessary to carry out this study, analyzing quantitative aspects (for example: number of students who became active members of the community and number of digital portfolios created from the project); and qualitative (where these students would be inserting themselves, what consequences their activities would be generating for Cardano). All these studies and research would need to be made available to the Cardano community in a simple way (for example, through the project's website or discord). That said, the way the proponents suggest so that we can audit the project is good, needing only minor improvements.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 10, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 13429, "q0": "This proposal is more aligned to be submitted under \u201cGrow Africa, Grow Cardano\u201d as that challenge encourage solutions for Africa in terms of education and infrastructure.\n\nWhile your proposal will help onboard students on the platform (Catalyst) by conducting workshops to multiple universities, it doesn\u2019t directly conform with the challenge goal itself.

For instance, under \u201cExpensive computer utilization\u201d - keep in mind that Catalyst has a global audience meaning not everyone may have the same predicament. It would make sense to provide numbers as to why is this a risk. I would start by providing availability rate of computers in average per university or at least for each workshop venue?

Regina on the other hand have extensive exposure in the financial world. This is a good combination although it would be nice if they have someone on the technical side of the blockchain as well. I would imagine that some students would be interested on the financial and business aspects of Cardano and Blockchain while some will be heavily invested in the technology itself. Someone with proper knowledge needs to address those. \n\nThe lack of sample educational materials included in the proposal doesn\u2019t help gain my confidence for the quality of the proposed workshop program. I understand they have listed what\u2019s to be expected but it would help if they have provided an itemized subjects with detail on what will be part of the workshop program so the community can pitch in on what Cardano initiatives or technologies needs to be highlighted. \n\nBudget wise it\u2019s not clear to me what \u201cWorkshop for an innovative forum\u201d means. I don\u2019t see any mention on how much will be paid for the presenters hourly? I would highly appreciate if a proper timeline was also provided for these workshops, this not only helps us gauge the budget but also the length of the material for each seminar. \n\nBased on what\u2019s provided in the proposal here\u2019s my additional feasibility recommendations: \n\n\u2022\tIndicate length of each workshop (is this a one day 8-hour session, 2 days, etc..)\n\u2022\tWill these workshops happen simultaneously or different schedules?\n\u2022\tHow would you solicit participations?\n\u2022\tSalary for those who will conduct the workshop (Hourly?, How many?)\n\u2022\tProvide breakdown of Pre-workshop expenses.

If not provide expense breakdown of each activity and details on each execution", "q1r": 3, "q2": "At the end of the day success is the prime indicator if a project is worth funding or not. So, it only makes sense that we spend same amount of time if not more in its\u2019 Auditability.\n\nProposer is right to conduct a post workshop survey for satisfaction. This helps validates if material and presentation are well received by the audience. Having negative or what we call detractor responses will shed light on what\u2019s not working. Though there\u2019s no mention of survey results being available to the public? A common repository of updates is necessary for us to track progress not only during completion but while it\u2019s still ongoing. This can be thru twitter or any other public platform.\n\nIt was mentioned that \u201cViews & future citations of peer-reviewed article\u201d as a key metric however I haven\u2019t seen any mention of this all throughout the proposal. This is a good metric for IOHK as they produce peer-reviewed papers but not for this project. \n \nAlso, I need clarity on why we\u2019re measuring VIENNA catalyst participants or VIENNA Blockchain Community discord server? Under the impression that target community is in Tanzania? If \u201cVienna\u201d refers to something else under than the city then I highly recommend to prime your audience in advance so to avoid confusion. \n\nThe key to having good measures is to align it to your GOALS and make them as objective as possible.

This effort is even more significant when it is carried out in developing countries.  Young people in Tanzanian universities would benefit from the purpose of this proposal. However, the degree to which the proposal meets the parameters of the Challenge for which it was submitted must be considered.  The fundamental motivation behind the \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\" Challenge, approved by the Catalyst community last fund, is to provide college and university students with a space completely separate from the regular Catalyst environment in which they can bring their projects to Project Catalyst and secure base funding, nothing financially ambitious. Clumsy projects, with flaws or weaknesses if any, but with a true innovative and creative student spirit, insolent and daring, that will lead their authors to find in our community a place to learn and get involved, a playground endowed not only with money, but more importantly, with the possibility to get hands on with the best technology in the industry while having access to the knowledge, experience and sense of collaboration of Catalyst members. A new concept for Catalyst no doubt, but an efficient one: in the student community of the planet lies that needle in the haystack that ends up changing the game we play so tightly with other blockchains and the legacy world, and it is our obligation to build the best of the magnets to find it. That's just what this Challenge is trying to do: build a suitable habitat for students, designed primarily by the students themselves. \n\nBecause of my affinity with this Challenge (formal experience in education at school, university, company level) and my experience in Project Catalyst (actively participating in 90% of the community positions that exist: CA, VCA, Challenge Team member, funded proposer, involvement in multiple projects in Catalyst) I have been following it closely since it was approved at F8, because it never ceases to amaze me how often the scoreboard seeks to augment itself with topics of undeniable importance (Developer Ecosystem, Cross-Chain Collaboration, The Great Migration (From Ethereum)) to the point of discarding areas that in the real world have proven to be an inexhaustible source of ideas, creativity and results, such as those related to students.\n\nAs an educator and experienced Project Catalyst member,  I understand the intention behind the proposal and consider it completely valid. However, it is evident that it is not being proposed by the type of students that the Community decided to support through this Challenge, therefore it does not fit the parameters of the Challenge.  I quote (excerpted from the Challenge information): \"By creating a category of students and increasing exposure for their ideas, they can expect easier funding and to be scouted by engineers\" (section What does success look like?). \"Most student entrepreneurs suffer from a shortage of resources, especially when it comes to funding and hiring engineers\" (Why is this important? section). \"However, the number of proposals to Catalysts is increasing rapidly, and the community does not readily perceive small-scale proposals from students. .... Therefore, to make it easier for the community to recognize new ideas from students, we will establish a new category exclusively for students\" (Challenge brief section). \n\nTaking into account the above reasoning, I must remove three stars from the final rating.  \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Although the type of projects that the experienced proposers wish to implement are of low complexity and the execution under normal conditions certainly follows a pattern that is easy to control, more detail regarding the activities in the implementation plan is desirable. Each activity is so briefly described that in the end it is inevitable that questions about the process of developing each of them will arise.  On the other hand, I personally have no problem with the numbers stated in the budget.  In my opinion, based on my experience as an educator and entrepreneur, they correspond to the implementation of a project of the magnitude of the one proposed.  The experience of the team is sufficient to carry out the proposed project, however, as I justified in detail in the evaluation of the Impact section, the non-student profile of the executing team is the reason why I consider that this valuable project does not correspond to the description of the category in which it was enrolled.

The information provided by the proposal is not enough to establish if the methodology to be implemented will be the most appropriate for the job.\n\nWith KPIs 5 and 6 I have no problem (it is possible to use those KPIs as performance measurement tools), except for the word \"Vienna\" which, after reviewing the whole proposal several times, I can't find where it fits.
