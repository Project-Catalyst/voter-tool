I can definitely see the impact this proposal can have on past and future funded proposers and I appreciate the style of the artist and consider it to be a good fit for the Catalyst community. But, I would encourage the proposer to think about the above quote from the challenge brief and see how she can better fit her concept with it.\nOtherwise, I feel the idea is well articulated and can be easily and successfully implemented in the allocated time, and the imagery she could provide to the Catalyst community could indeed produce a better sense of cohesion and accomplishment.

Besides the artwork that she will be uploading in several file formats on GitHub, she will also be uploading the necessary code snippets that would allow for their easy integration on websites.\nAs an artist myself, I find the presented timeline and budget to be feasible and reasonable. Since the artist is planning to animate the artwork, it makes perfect sense for her to subscribe to the Adobe Creative Cloud Suite, which will be offering her all the needed apps to complete her task in the 3 months allocated. She has also carefully thought about a small amount to accommodate the feedback period, which denotes good planning from her.

Moreover past winners that are students themselves could benefit from greater exposure. With this in mind, a possible performance indicator would then be to track from where new fund proposers first heard about Catalyst/Cardano, with one option being previous fund winners.\n\nIn terms of KPIs to track how the project is progressing during the development phase, specific milestones were given in terms of how many images/sample logos should be presented at each main stage, which can act as a measure of the progress of the project."}, {"id": 7135, "q0": "This proposal brings an interesting initiative.

After looking at their relevant experience, I am confident the proposer could come up with many different art-style directions and the technical know-how to represent the categories.

The timeline is provided, and we can see the milestones and the time horizon for each of them.

Not to mention, including community feedback as part of the process is very awesome because, in the end, the people in the community are the ones who are going to use the visuals. The technical aspect is clarified by the proposer (the size of the design, the format, etc.). Lastly, the proposer also factors in the problem of design-breaking changes in the future and mitigates this risk by providing future-proof options.

I might have misunderstood the proposer's plan, but if the proposal is funded, I would like the proposer to dump whatever progress has been made (e.g. the different art-style drafts) into the same Github repository, not just when the final visuals have been made, so we can keep track of everything in the same place.

I do think this proposal can help Catalyst garner more outreach since it can make project marketing easier to do and therefore attracts new people into Cardano. That being said, there is the risk of the template becoming obsolete for future Funds and this is addressed in the proposal where the plan is to choose already established categories (e.g. Grow Asia) as well as the generic numbered funding campaign (e.g Fund 9).
