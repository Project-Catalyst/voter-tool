Lack of opportunity for these groups is problematic. Project Catalyst is a great way for Black PhD\u2019s to grow businesses.", "f6_no_assessments": 11, "f6_rating": 4.121212121212121, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 3510, "q0": "The fundamental motivation behind the \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\" Challenge approved by the Catalyst community last fund, is to provide college and university students a space completely separate from the regular Catalyst funding environment, in which they could bring their projects to our ecosystem and get base funding, nothing financially ambitious.  Clumsy projects, with flaws or weaknesses if any, but with an authentic innovative and creative student spirit, insolent and daring, that could find in our community a place to learn and get involved, a playground endowed not only with money, but even more valuable, with the possibility to get your hands on the best technology in the industry while having access to the knowledge, experience and sense of collaboration of Catalyst members. A new concept for Catalyst no doubt, but an efficient one: in the student community of the planet lies that needle in the haystack that ends up changing the game we play so tightly with other blockchains and the legacy world, and it is our obligation to build the best of the magnets to find it.  That's exactly what this Challenge is trying to do: build a suitable habitat for students.\n\nBecause of my affinity with this Challenge (formal experience in education at the college, university, corporate level) and my experience in Project Catalyst (actively participating in 90% of the community positions that exist: CA, VCA, Challenge Team member, funded proposer, involvement in multiple projects in Catalyst) I have been following it closely since it was approved at F8, because it never ceases to amaze me how often the scoreboard seeks to augment itself with topics of undeniable importance (Developer Ecosystem, Cross-Chain Collaboration, The Great Migration (From Ethereum)) to the point of discarding areas that in the real world have proven to be an inexhaustible source of ideas, creativity and results, such as those related to students.  \n\nThis proposal struggles to meet the conditions clearly stipulated by the Challenge in terms of proposer type and budget, as one who stealthily walks a very thin line.   The proposers are students of course, but PhD students, proposing an event for PhD students.  The proposal describes a scenario in which they will bring together PhD students in a two-day event called Writing retreat, where they will have the opportunity to work on their own projects while working in parallel on projects focused on Project Catalyst.  \n\nAs an educator, I understand the intent behind the proposal and consider it completely valid.  As an educator and as a member of Catalyst I find many moving parts that fail to stand still.  On the one hand, I feel that this proposal is not designed by or for the type of students that the Challenge is intended to support. I quote (excerpted from the Challenge information) \"By creating a category of students and increasing exposure for their ideas, they can expect easier funding and to be scouted by engineers\" (section What does success look like?). \"Most student entrepreneurs suffer from a shortage of resources, especially when it comes to funding and hiring engineers\" (Why is this important? section). \"However, the number of proposals to Catalysts is increasing rapidly, and the community does not readily perceive small-scale proposals from students. .... Therefore, to make it easier for the community to recognize new ideas from students, we will establish a new category exclusively for students\" (Challenge brief section).  On the other hand, as clearly described in the proposal, the two days of the event will be arranged to address both own ideas and ideas that can be taken to Catalyst, in a 20%-80% distribution (20% for own ideas, 80% for Catalyst ideas).  In my experience, two days is already too short for only one of the two subjects, not to mention the irrefutable fact that working on one's own ideas is much more exciting than on other study subjects. I find the 20%-80% distribution a difficult promise to keep.  At the same time, the proposal does not mention that the PhD students will somehow already bring some advanced Catalyst ideas to the event, so in that area they would be starting from scratch.\n\nIn conclusion, the reason I am taking three stars off the final rating is because I do not find the proposal in keeping with the spirit of the Challenge in which it was presented, and the potential results of the two-day event unsound.  However, I agree with the proponents, the Writing retreat type of events can become amazing incubators of new ideas, like the less sophisticated incubator of ideas and innovation that the Challenge \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\" intends to create.  \n\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The implementation plan described and the budget explained correspond in general terms to the execution of an event of the magnitude suggested by the proposers. Based on the information provided, the planning time (6 months) and the activities to be carried out during that time outline a path of adequate and judicious execution.  The variables to be monitored and adjusted if necessary appear to be within the controllable range.\n\nHowever, it would be valuable to have more in-depth information regarding the degree of knowledge regarding Project Catalyst that the students came to the two-day event with. I fear that if their prior knowledge is non-existent or basic, proper instruction will take up much of the event.  In the same way, and reiterating the point made in the Impact section of this evaluation, it would be desirable to have an understanding of the degree of progress the students will make in the field of ideas to be presented to Catalyst prior to the two-day event.  If such progress is non-existent, much of the event will be taken up by the idea conception phase.  If there is no work prior to the event in the area of instruction in the dynamics of Project Catalyst and the obligation of a previous work on the ideas to be presented to our ecosystem, the effective time of the event (2 days) will be really insufficient to reach a concrete positive result.  I proceed to remove two stars from the final rating as I cannot find any information related to these issues. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In my opinion, \"Number of proposals that participated in the next fund\" is one of the metrics that should be taken into account at the end of the implementation process.  However, measurements during the project execution process should be carried out to establish the health of the project during the 6 months of its execution.  Relevant measurements of the receptivity of the PhD students to the proposal that the project formulates, measurements of their expectations in relation to the project (Cardano as an ecosystem provides the necessary tools to develop their ideas? Cardano and Catalyst are a suitable environment for their ideas?), type of approaches that students can get to have during the 6 months of project planning, prior to the two-day Writing retreat event (attendance to Town Halls, participation in Project Catalyst telegram and discord channels , participation in Swarm events, etc).   \n\nTherefore, in my opinion, the KPI formulated in the Auditability section should be complemented with other KPIs describing the evolution of the project during the 6 months of its execution.

Writing retreats have similarities to hackathons, which is perfect for Project Catalyst proposals. \nAddressing the challenge, the proposer is saying that part of the writing retreat will include educational sessions on Cardano and Project Catalyst and this can be a perfect measure of the number of proposals that participate in the next fund. During retreats, their ideas can be supported by interested engineers in the ecosystem. \nRisk and mitigating strategy was mentioned in the proposal.

The whole project is seen as a 6 months project, and it is divided into monthly timelines with specific duties added.

The credentials of both are impressive and are capable of implementing the proposal. \nThe team has indicated that they will return to Catalyst for more support for more writing retreat in the next round of funding.

At the end of this Research-hackathon, the group will hopefully have submitted (with help from the organizers) one (or several?) proposal for an upcoming fund in Project Catalyst. \nThe issue of inequality will always be important, and creating a space where marginalized academics can collaborate on creating ideas freely rhymes well with the core values of the Cardano Ecosystem. I would have liked to see some statistics reflecting the inequality in academia (as stated in the proposal), just to provide additional weight to the problem statement. \u2028\u2028The fact that one of the two proposers are PhD-students and that the proposals target group is PhD students makes this proposal very much in alignment with the challenge setting. Especially since it also aims to have these students submit proposals in Catalyst. (Which hopefully will lead to further involvement with the ecosystem, and collaborations with developers, engineers, etc). \u2028\u2028Due to the limited spots of the planned writing retreat (12), the proposer is well aware of the risk to fill all the spots. In my experience as a researcher and organizer of similar events, the proposed solution of asking the participants to see if their respective universities would like to offer some funding for attending is a good one.  \u2028This concept is easily scalable and spread to other universities, universities being a perfect place of looking for young specialists in different fields. Theoretically, each of the 12 participants could be inspired to organize a similar event after attending, which would in turn have the potential of continue spreading throughout the world. \u2028\nThe problem statement and solution is presented clearly, and I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal includes a roadmap with milestones on a timeframe of 6 months. \nI don\u2019t know if this is a mistake when writing the proposal, but the proposers states to submit proposals for Fund 10, whereas the roadmap ends with hosting the writing retreat after 6 months (which would in turn make it more realistic to host the writing camp close to Fund 12, since each period is roughly 3 months long). Apart from that, the milestones from the roadmap seem realistic enough to be carried out successfully. Gathering applications (especially if it will include participants outside of the organizing country) is time-consuming, and it will give the proposers more time to focus on creating educational material (also mentioned in the roadmap). \n\nThe team consists of one PhD student and one Post-Doctoral researcher, the academic specialization of the two (engineering science, game intelligence) is easily relatable to a lot of existing proposals in Catalyst. We are provided with LinkedIn-profiles of the two (along with the official website and instagram of the organization), that makes it easy to verify their experiences of both academic studies and their other (impressive list) of competencies. There is also experience of organizing writing retreats successfully from before, along with other events that demand a lot of planning and organizational skills. In order to create a closer connection to Catalyst and Cardano, the team plans to hire a Cardano workshop mentor/facilitator, a wise decision since it is an area of expertise well needed if the writing retreat is supposed to culminate in proposals for Catalyst (with participants that have no experience of Cardano from before). \u2028The team has two other proposals for Fund 9, and I would have liked to see a paragraph included in the proposal where the proposers discuss potential risks (and how to mitigate those risks) in regards to the workload, if all of the proposals are funded. \n\u2028The budget is clearly presented, and seems (from my experience organizing similar events) to be realistically planned for, also leaving some leeway if a participant is in need of further support for accessibility (which is a nice addition to the budget breakdown). If I were to make a suggestion it would be to include an estimation of working hours for each person (and responsibility areas), considering the two team members are involved in other projects.

The proposer has chosen reasonable KPIs relevant in measuring the success of the proposal (Number of proposals that participated in the next fund, and of course number of participants). If the upcoming proposals from the students are funded, we will also be able to track the development progress through Ideascale and Catalyst.
