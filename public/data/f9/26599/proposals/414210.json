The proposal is within the challenge target because I think this implementation will be core to the Cardano community that will help more student developers to come to the Cardano playground and grow in the future. A great thing about this is that the proponent clearly defines the goal to be achieved through the entrepreneurship education program of Project Catalyst: Improving the entrepreneurial mindset of young people to help them be more creative and confident in their work. whatever they undertake and enhance their attractiveness.

We also know the affiliation of the members to Catalyst, all of whom are active members and also hold a certain position in the Cardano project catalyst community. So for a project as simple as this, I have complete confidence in their ability to execute successfully. Next on the roadmap, the proponent provides a roadmap with an estimated timeframe attached. The time to complete the proposal is quite short, in just 8 weeks, we know well what will happen in each subsequent stage, i.e., our visualization of the process is quite solid.

We can explain this point of view with the following opinion, we know that there is a barrier that needs to be overcome in order for the proposed format of business and students to reach many fields. But we recognize in the proposal that there is a concern to attack many of the methods of this commercialization, in fact, it is not yet well rooted; For example, regarding Arabic language learning, we observe: Arabic implementation, foreign language exchange, streaming.

The solution the authors came up with was, to introduce Project Catalyst to business and engineering students, mentor them to implement proposals, and help them turn ideas into proposals that received Catalyst funding. The purpose of the solution is, to help students who have an idea but lack the funding to implement it. This is exactly what we're looking for in this challenge. The idea the team came up with is direct and highly practical, but I don't know if the team will implement this idea across the African region or just in one or a few African countries. This is not mentioned by the group, leading to the community lacking information to assess the scope of the solution's impact. The list of 5 universities that the group plans to implement the idea also does not have specific information as to which universities and which countries in Africa. Regarding the risks affecting the success of the solution, I personally think that the team should consider some more risks that may be encountered. For example, one is the risk that students are uncomfortable and unwilling to participate in Catalyst; secondly, the risk that the expensive internet costs students have to pay may affect the quality and their ability to participate in the project\u2026 To limit this risk, I suggest the team should have some incentive rewards for students with good ideas and selected for training to participate in Catalyst. This award should be awarded in installments: as soon as the student is selected for Catalyst training, and after the student has a completed proposal submitted to Catalyst.

Two Cardano / Project Catalyst workshops with Students are planned by the team 4-6 weeks after funding. However, the size of the workshop and the number of participants were not mentioned by the group. This has to do with the estimated $650/workshop budget I think needs to be clarified. For example, conference room rental costs (unit price $ per square meter or according to the number of attendees), banner advertising costs, and on-site conference service costs (printing materials, water, etc.). Clearly dividing each item into detail with unit prices like this will help the community understand how the budget money is used. Similarly, advertising and marketing cost $500 but I don't know what platforms the team will advertise on, what is the unit price, and how long it takes... About the team, I rate them enough skills and experience with Catalyst to guide students to become more involved in Catalyst in Africa.

The community through these numbers can easily audit the success metrics of the proposal. Here, the most important criterion I evaluate is the number of 50 students who can submit their innovative ideas about the Catalyst project to Fund 10, out of 50 students selected to participate in the training project of the team. The rate of reaching 100%, this number is very impressive. If approved by the community, I very much look forward to the group results that have been achieved as promised.

The project aims to bring to life the great ideas that have a real impact on society by business and engineering students in Africa, specifically Ghana. In addition to connecting and creating opportunities for students to know and seek funding from the Catalyst fund, the project also solves the main problem that the challenge poses, which is to provide students with a place to live let them freely provide their ideas and actualization them.\nI see the uniqueness of the proposal as a bridge to introduce the Catalyst project to business and engineering students, ensuring there is investment to promote a business project. The Cardano Peer Education proposal helps students become more aware of their work, so they can seize the opportunities that the project offers, creating a foundation for students to be active in society and the community in the future ecosystem.\nI completely agree with the author's argument when providing solutions for this proposal. Entrepreneurship education will have a positive impact on a student's entrepreneurial mindset, entrepreneurial orientation, employability, and role in society and the economy. Once successfully raising capital, they will initially develop their projects, bridging the gap between the young generation and donors. In my opinion, students in any country are very accessible to convey information and attract them to participate in funded projects. In Vietnam, too, there are always programs and playgrounds for students to participate in at their universities or on television to help them call for capital, stimulate inspire business passion in them, help them develop their own dreams. All in all, I found the proposal to be contagious, and it's also a good solution to a proposal that should be promoted by the Cardano community.\nAt this point, I will give this proposal 4 points due to the impact the idea brings to the community, minus -1 point because this is not a very different idea in this challenge.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project has issued an implementation plan within 3 months, I see the timelines that the author team have divided into 3 main timelines with implementation content.

For example, plan more detailed seminars with students at schools, or produce more publications about the project's success stories and their feedback on wada.org.\nRegarding the budget of the proposal is 5000$, this is the maximum amount of funding for each proposal of the challenge & Scouted for students challenge at this fund 9. This figure is reasonable to me, but the authors need to explain the use of this funding in more detail for each category. Currently, I see that the group of authors just stops at providing the main content using the budget that needs funding without going into detailed explanations of them, which will somewhat make it difficult to determine auditability of the project as well as making it difficult for the community to monitor the implementation of the project later.\nThe proposal team also identified a foreseeable risk that prevented the success of the project and the options to overcome and minimize this risk. I found it to be sufficient and completely consistent with the current proposal.\nI see information about the team that developed this proposal. They are fully qualified to carry out their proposal.

Anyone who is preview to the unemployment challenges in Africa recognizes that the educational system is not only unfriendly but often unproductive. Therefore, i agree with the idea behind the project \u2013focusing creating more jobs via innovative initiative by young people. However, the information here is not well detailed. There is a starting point for every project; though we know students are the focus, but what is the target audience of the project at the early stage of the project? is it a random selection of students from any college institution or an initiative focused on a specific college institution?  How does the project intend to start or be organized? is it an in person event, an online event or both. The essence of this concern is to help anticipate the potential challenges the project will face if is organized online, if is in person based or both.
