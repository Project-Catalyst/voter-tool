Asking for the release of a document copy might take a very long time, days, if not weeks. Blockchain is definitely the solution for many of these instances. I greatly appreciate the idea and willingness of the team behind this proposal, to develop a cryptographic system on the Cardano blockchain for the town halls in Senegal. However, I am unsure, since it hasn\u2019t been described in the proposal if the team has actually contacted someone who is in the position to confirm that if they develop this infrastructure, it will also be adopted/implemented by the town halls. Unfortunately, these kind of endeavours are usually not being completed, not because of a lack of genuinely interested and capable individuals, who would be willing to work on a solution, but because the bureaucrats running these places are: \n1. Not willing to change the way they work\nIf they are\n2. then they will be offering the set aside budget (which most of the time is very big) for this task to either the best bidder or to a \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d company, as they would, of course, be incentivised to do so.\nSo this is where my concern lies. If the team behind the project does indeed finish the task, and since they seem willing and capable, I do not doubt that, but if they do, will it actually be implemented in the town halls in Senegal?\nMaybe for this challenge, this concern does not play such an important role and constitutes mostly a bit of advice to the proposing team. Especially since I consider the idea behind the project to be at least a very good experiment that could possibly offer unexpected results in the future. At the same time, I consider it to have a positive impact on the ecosystem through the development of a new infrastructure and as such, I will rate it with 4. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I am not a developer, but I have been monitoring the development of numerous projects, and as such, I find the timeline and budget (constrained for this challenge at $5000) of this proposal to be a bit too low to actually achieve the desired results. I can see that the student(s) involved in this project are dedicated and imagine that they would finish their work, even if it were to take longer than anticipated and without asking for additional pay. \nWhat I think is an important missing section of the proposal is the team description, there is a short paragraph containing the skills of the team members, but we have no way of verifying those, as there are no names, no external links, no mention of their previous work. I am not sure which of the team members are students and which are experienced professionals in their respective fields. Because of this, I find it difficult to assess the team\u2019s capability in implementing the proposal.\nI would also like to add, that the team mentions that they have other proposals in this fund,  and even though it was a requirement when submitting the proposal, the team has not offered any description related to them and/or links to said proposals.\nIn conclusion, based on the information offered and the questions I am left with after analysing this section, I must say that I am unsure about the successful implementation of the project, and because of this, I will rate it with a 3.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The answer to how the project's progress will be tracked is too generalised, to me, it seems it doesn\u2019t offer any particular details, metrics, or solutions.

How will the team define and respect the deadline? And how/where can the community verify if the deadlines are being kept?\u201d\nThe same applies to the success question. It is also too generalised and somewhat unnecessary, for example, \u201cDon't go over budget\u201d or \u201cAchieve our end goal\u201d are scopes upon which the team has designed their plan and budget, as such, it could be considered a success in regards to proposal writing but not in regards to the project they would be funded for. \nLastly, unfortunately, I find the auditability section to be lacking too much information to consider it properly auditable and my final score is 2. I hope the team will return to the proposal if not funded in this fund and consider some of the aspects I and probably, other community members have suggested and introduce those in their proposal and resubmit it.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 7, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3165, "q0": "The proposer identified as a student themselves, which aligns very slightly with the proposal.

Well, the proposal comes from a student entrepreneur, the target group of this challenge setting. \n\u2028The proposer mentions that the team aims to improve government efficiency by integrating all of the government transaction to the Cardano Blockchain, and expanding it to other governments. Here I would like to have had further clarifications on what governments the proposer means to focus on (Senegalese government? Regional or national?). Maybe also some further examples of how the team plans to collaborate with these institutions and expand their operation to other governments. \n\u2028In my experience working with educational institutions (as a researcher), it might be challenging to formalize a partnership that will be incorporated 100% by the institution. Especially if it is a lesser known actor within the space. And even if they do manage to find a way in, it might possibly take a lot of time to get there.

Furthermore, a roadmap is greatly benefitted by being paired with the information in the budget breakdown and information about the proposing team, so let\u2019s do that. \n\nAccording to the proposal, the team consists of a project manager and a web developer. There is contact information and LinkedIn-profile provided for the project manager, but no mentions of either identity or experience of the web developer. There are mentions of hiring experienced blockchain developers from the Cardano Community, but these does not seem to be included in the budget breakdown (so I\u2019m assuming it is for a later stage of development). The project manager is involved in several other proposals for Fund 9 in a variety of different challenges, working on different projects unrelated to each other. \nAs a recurring PA since Fund 6, this leads me to worry a bit about the potential workload that might occur, since the team consists of a small number of people. It would be nice to\nInclude a paragraph explaining how the team plans to divide the workload if all the proposals are funded. \n\nRegarding the budget breakdown, I would suggest to add an estimate of the working hours for each person in the team (maybe also add estimations of the hourly wage). With this information, we have access to more information that will help us estimate the total workload needed to finalize this project. In short, who will be working on what section of the project, and is there budget allocations made for this? Where does it fit into the roadmap?   \n\nAny extra information on the development process will be helpful to include.

It is good to see that the team aims to share weekly reports of the development progress with the community, and it would be even better if the proposal would include links to where these reports would be shared. Because as of now, there are no links provided where the community can follow the development progress, apart from the email of the project manager. \u2028\u2028When listing measurements of success, I would suggest to specify if \u2019End goal\u2019 means the finishing of this proposal, or the whole idea of the project.

I\u2019ll get back to what I mean by this in the next section.\n\nThe proposer should meet with their town hall first and talk about the bottleneck. Is it really because there is no database and IT infrastructure? If it is, then the question becomes how willing they are to migrate and digitalize. After all, they are the ones who are going to implement the system. We then need to consider how to maintain the IT infrastructure and deal with data security laws.

First, the proposer doesn\u2019t have enough developers to build the system within 2 months. The proposer stated that they would include a web developer and experienced blockchain developers from the Cardano community. However, with only 2000 USD allocated, the amount is just too low and the two-month time frame is simply not enough to get the system done. The budget is broken down into four different items, but none of them is further explained. For example, the item \"launch event organization\" is still too big. Does that include the venue or the food or the speakers? The item \"Buy PC Portable\" is also not justifiable. What is the laptop even used for? I advise the proposer to be more strict with the budget and give more details on what they are used for by dividing it with the number of hours or the number of people involved. The timeline provided is unrealistic. I would love to be proven wrong, but two months for setting up the blockchain database, designing the UI, writing hundreds and thousands of lines of code, and hosting it on a server is not enough. I understand that the proposer doesn\u2019t come from an IT background, but I hope they will take my advice to extend the development time to a minimum of 6 months. The proposer should also extend the time needed for government partnership (because birocracy is not quick, trust me) and plan on the risk of the town halls not wanting to cooperate (this could be mitigated, again, by reaching out to them directly).

I think the proposer misunderstood it as his experience of this city's situation.\n\nTo integrate 100% of the government transaction onto Cardano is what the proposer wants to do, but how to do that on Cardano, unfortunately, I cannot find in the proposal. (1) The first obstacle is how to convince a government to share all of their transactions on a blockchain, which is not very easy and feasible to do. Blockchain is still very new to the world, and it is also not yet legal in many countries. (2) Assuming that the government agrees to share their data with Cardano, the proposal lacks a detailed plan about how to build that information system on Cardano technically.\n\nI understand the good intention of the proposer, however, as what is presented in the proposal, the current team and action plan do not have enough ability and capacity to implement this proposal successfully.

As he mentioned most City/Town Halls in his area lack the proper technology to store, retrieve and distribute said government issued document. \n\nWhat would make this proposal interesting is if it is mentioned in detail on how the solution will work in a step-by-step manner. As student I don\u2019t expect a deep explanation on how the tech will work but at least a glimpse on the factors that will heavily impact this project. \n\nProposer mentioned that halls doesn\u2019t have database nor intranet but does this mean they have at least computer workstations and internet for government employees? I find this necessary to run any 3rd party solutions. Presenting a problem and solution requires holistic understanding of the situation.\n\nI would have loved it if more details were provided on what the current process of the document issuance and storage looks like, such as:\n\n\u2022\tAre these all done manually? \n\u2022\tPhotocopied? Type-written?\n\u2022\tDigitally stored in personal workstations or still physical stored in file-cabinets?\n\n\nAs for the solution itself, here are my thoughts: \n\n\u2022\tYou\u2019ve expressed that solution is a system that is accessible anywhere in the world and request can be made without physical appearance.

Will this be a web-based app and documents will be stored as NFTs? What\u2019s the request submission and request delivery/completion look like? \n\nAlso, I find that risk listed lacks research. Not only that you need the government to agree and partner with your project but also secure the right people to develop.\n\nWhile proposal address the challenge to encourage students to cultivate ideas and connect with engineering resources in our space it still needs refinement on what the problem entices and how and what the solution would be on its maturity. \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "We don\u2019t expect proposers on this challenge to have a team/implementor readily available.

Or Town Hall employees?, what outcome do you expect out of these trainings?\n2.\tSeeking partnership with city halls \u2013 how will this be executed? As your proposal heavily depends on their support will a legal expert be onboarded? Or have we secured support from a seated official?\n\nBudget wise, a good breakdown shows amount paid in salary for how long.

Event location? Marketing materials? \n\u2022\tBudget Limit for this challenge is $5000 and is meant to seed the proposal, so best to rethink on how this is spent properly to make the project sustainable or attractive for further catalyst funding. \n\nOverall, with the information provided in the proposal\u2019s current state it is difficult to imagine that it will move forward effectively.\n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "There\u2019s almost no concrete information on how the public would be able to track and measure the projects progress and even success.
