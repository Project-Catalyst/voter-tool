Here, we are looking to fund projects that contribute to students, in general, having more opportunities to get involved with Cardano and for them to learn more about our blockchain and its various technologies. In short, wanting to support them, so that they have a good orientation so that they can actively insert themselves in our community. The proposal in question suggests that this be done: Cardano and Catalyst will be presented to the students of the Grenoble Ecole de Management (which according to the proposer, is one of the most important business schools in France). An exhibition of contents would be made, so that they know, at first, what Cardano is, after all. And after that, a tournament would be developed in which students would have 2 weeks to think about proposals for fund 10, in which \u201cthe top 5 will receive a reward, these will have 1000 gimbalabs (this is a token from the Gimbalabs community), these tokens will allow that they have contacts and be introduced to Gimbalabs engineers.\u201d This is directly related to the scope of the challenge, as these students will be directly inserted into the community by establishing contacts with Cardano veterans, engineers who already work on ecosystem projects. It is also positive as some of the requested money will go towards prizes for this tournament, as a dollar reward is the most attractive way to keep students interested, in my opinion. In theory, the idea is perfect, but I have some observations to make. The first is: it would be interesting for us to understand exactly when the tournament would take place (I will comment more on the timing issue in the topic of feasibility); Fund 10 is scheduled to start in early October, according to the official calendar that was released at Town Hall recently. Could this be the beginning of the school year? It would be necessary for the challenges to be disclosed so that the students have a direction in relation to the proposals they will develop. Speaking of students, it is not very clear 1) who would be the target audience. It is said that the university focuses on business, so would it be only international business students? Or would there be students from the fields of technology, engineering, computer science, marketing, design? I believe that these are areas more directly linked to Cardano (in fact, any student from any area of \u200b\u200bknowledge is able to get involved with our blockchain, but especially those in the technology area, since there is a need for a lot of mother of work of developers ). It would be important for this point to be clarified further. 2) it is unclear how students would be encouraged to participate in the tournament. The main flashy thing would be the dollar rewards, but I would like the event publicity process to be better explained. Other than that, I agree that it is a very relevant idea and that it relates in a certain way to the proposed challenge, deserving maximum marks in terms of impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is quite viable, I believe that just a little more detail would be needed for this topic to be perfect. Speaking of impact, the whole project is divided into weeks, and we know what would happen in each of these intervals, what activities would be developed. What could be added here, in my view, would be more detail about the activities. We can see this in the excerpt \u201c\"Week 1 - 3 : Teaching: Prepare content, present to the BIB class, Introduce them to Cardano, Introduce them to the tournament. Week 4 - 6 : Tournament, Start the tournament, Provide help if needed, Answer the questions, On week 6: presentation of all the ideas, find the top 5 (as described above).\u201d For example, in the first step, it is said that the content would be prepared. contents would be covered (slides, videos, fully oral presentations?) In relation to presenting Cardano and the tournament to students: how would this disclosure be made, how would students be approached? How would the proponent, who is a student at this university , would you convince your colleagues about the possibilities of working with blockchain, in addition to the interest in profiting from the event? In the next step, the tournament itself would be held, and it is said that help would be provided, if necessary. would be held ? Perhaps the proposer would hold some face-to-face meetings, bringing together all students who have questions, or would individual calls be made? Would the presentation of ideas be done online or in person, and would this stage be open to the public or just to the judges? When it comes to funding, this part is great, the total (5000 thousand dollars - the maximum amount established for the proposals of this challenge) is divided in a very detailed way. We know which parts the amount would go to: content preparation, presentation, advice, awards, integration with Gimbalabs engineers and so on. The only question that came to my mind is the following: some activities, such as helping with the writing of proposals, can take a very different time to happen (it is said that it would take 20 hours, but maybe it would be much less, so as the money that would be left to be destined, in case that happens?). 11 hours are dedicated to preparing the expository content on blockchain, but as I mentioned earlier, it would be important for us to know which formats would be addressed and also what exact topics would be taught here, within the various subjects that make up the universe of our ecosystem. Moving, finally, to our last topic of analysis, which is the team, a lot of security is conveyed in relation to the mentors Yoram and Razali, as they provide a lot of information about them, in addition to attaching the links to their linkedin profiles. However, regarding Benjamin, we don't know exactly how he works at Cardano, it is said that he has been an internship since 2022, but it would be very interesting if we knew what project he works on and what role he plays. About Shlomo, no information is provided, but links to a proposal on ideascale and its profile on linkedin, it would be interesting if a small CV was attached here. That said, the topic is fine, but it needs some minor changes (detail improvement).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of the progress is good, the only thing missing is that the proponent suggested that the work behind the suggested partial results be followed up. In the excerpts \u201cOverall, we want to check the action of the project, mostly about the number of people participating and the quality of their work + A report will be given at the end of the project, Presentation of students on Gimbalabs playground / After townhall will be recorded in zoom, all proposals will be visible for the community\u201d. It would be important for our community to be able to understand if the preparation of the content was being done in the right way, if the presentations were being organized and carried out as planned, if each of those involved was fulfilling their functions properly (actually in this proposal, at the As I understood, the entire process would be developed by the proposer, and only at the end would the mentors participate in the evaluation of the proposals and provide feedback). In this case, it would be interesting if the proponent provided us with a half-time report, that is, an overview of how things were developing over the stages, in addition to the suggested metrics. The report would be a preview of the final report, and could include the work behind such achievements - such as the number of students who would be participating/proposal ideas being created/ideas evaluation and so on. It is very positive how the proponent has included numerical KPIs (like the ones I mentioned) and also more qualitative ones, such as feedback from students, the Cardano community and Gimbalabs engineers. Talking about the auditability of success, in this part the proponent only focuses on quantitative data (at least 50 participants in the presentation, about 20 ideas given, at least 5 proposals written, etc.). In my opinion, it is also necessary for him to assess how the tournament participants would have related to Cardano in the medium/long term, that is: the presentations were a starting point for these students to have more interest in the cryptographic universe, and study more about the subject, seeking to insert themselves in the community, beyond Catalyst? Are they new active members of our community, in the sense of being involved in projects, even if they are not funded proponents? How can we ascertain the consequences, even if sensitive, of this initiative for our blockchain? Has a solid bridge really been established between the students and Cardano? Did the movement motivate other generations of university students (example: younger students) to also be interested in the subject and seek to learn about it, understand how they could insert themselves in our community? It would also be very positive to follow the path of those students who had won prizes in the tournament, either within the Gimbalabs hub or individually. With that, I think the auditability of the project is good, but just like the topic of feasibility, some small changes could be added so that this part of the proposal receives the maximum score.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 11, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3989, "q0": "The problem statement, solution and execution mentioned in this proposal is a perfect match to the current challenge setting. Not only is the proposer a student entrepreneur (second year BA student of Business), the whole idea of the proposal is to educate AND onboard new students directly to Catalyst. The idea of educating business students in the first phase, then hosting a hackathon-like tournament, choosing 3 proposals (that will be rewarded with a small amount of funding) to present in the After Town Hall and Gimbalabs playground (where they have good chance of getting in contact with developers and engineers) is incredibly tailored to fit the challenge setting. As a recurring PA since Fund 6, I\u2019m very impressed seeing how much thought and planning that has been put into this proposal. \u2028\u2028I believe (from my experience as a teacher and researcher, working with universities) that targeting business students is a great place to start. Every student the proposal aims to get in contact with will have a deeper understanding of entrepreneurship from the start (since they are business students). \nNot only will it benefit Catalyst if a few or many of them are onboarded, it will also benefit the university getting exposed to modern era entrepreneurship. This type of beneficial symbiotic collaborations with universities is super rare, in my opinion. Not often do we see collaborations where university students learn new perspectives that are not taught at university, and the university gets their students educated for free, basically. The Cardano ecosystem gets what it wants, and so does the university, and the students. I believe that this model is something that more proposers could learn from. I very strongly agree that this proposal addresses the challenge, flawlessly.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team provides us with a clear and realistic roadmap, divided in 2-3 week blocks. Teaching, Tournament and onboarding, in that order. Although the initial intention in the timeline was to have students apply for funding in Fund 10, it is my opinion that the delay to focus on the student proposals for the following Fund (11) actually will benefit them. This way, they can Segway in to learning and experiencing Project Catalyst and Cardano instead of being thrown in immediately. It will also relieve a lot of time pressure on the authors of this proposal. Slow and steady wins the race, and even with the delayed time plan it still manages to (hopefully) achieve all the bullet points mentioned in the challenge brief. \u2028\u2028I love the fact that the lead proposer is a student entrepreneur himself, but with added team members who have lots of experience of trusted and well known projects from the Catalyst ecosystem (Cardano4Climate, Catalyst School, etc). The proposal includes LinkedIn-profiles and instagram account to verify the stated experience needed for the success of the proposal.  \nThe budget breakdown leaves me with no questions, it is presented clearly with an estimate of hourly wage, working hours and is connected to the roadmap timeframe. In my experience as a teacher, I know that preparing educational material and especially supporting students in their work can be incredibly time-consuming. With that in mind, the budget is more than reasonable for the work intended. \n\u2028There are some risks related to the potential workload of the proposing team, considering they are involved in several different proposals in a variety of challenges. Both from this and earlier funds. The proposer is aware of this, and reassures us that there is some safety nets should that be the case. The proposal itself is not as immense as many others are, but a word of advice is to be mindful of the workload and prioritize the health of the team members, should the proposal be approved for funding.  \u2028Risks of not engaging motivated students, or lack of quality in their upcoming proposals are planned to be mitigated through education, support and incentives. Based on what the proposal aims to achieve, it is my opinion that this is a good strategy. Overall, I agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap is (as explained under \u2019feasibility\u2019) clearly presented, and includes milestones on a clear time horizon. The suggested KPIs listed in the proposal are all relevant, and good choices when measuring elements of success after potential implementation. \nHow many students will participate in the project, number of ideas/proposals contributed (and the quality of these), feedback from students, Gimbalabs and the Cardano community, it\u2019s all there. If the estimated target KPIs will be met, it will onboard 50 business students into Catalyst, along with (hopefully) 3 funded proposals (and lots of new ideas).\nI really stand by the idea of creating feedback from all directions, since it might lead to perspectives that wouldn\u2019t normally be found if the only feedback came from the teachers, for example. It will also aid in creating a space where it is common to have each actor or collaborator have a voice during the development process, even if the project is hosted by this team. \u2028\u2028The community will be able to track the potential proposals through Catalyst, partake in the report planned for the end of the project, and of course view/attend the presentation from the students in the ATH/Gimbalabs playground. It will be interesting to see what this proposal will grow into being, and how the team plans to communicate with its community members if the students reach a much higher number (maybe it will turn into something similar to Catalyst school, who knows?). If I were to make a suggestion for improvements, I would like to have seen a social media channel or means of communicating with the team directly. Or a place where the community could follow the development progress of the project, even in its infancy. \nConclusively, I strongly agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.

A platform that enable students explore and engineer their ideas into the real world to provide relevant solutions to societal problems. The cardano ecosystem provides such a platform, not only to shape and develop the ideas of students but also help them integrate their ideas into the real world. From the proponent perspective, the main impact focuses on \"...increasing the exposure of the students ideas, access to an easier funding and can be scouted by engineers, this could also be an awesome opportunity for the students to get to know Cardano and Catalyst\". This goal fits perfectly with the objective given by the challenge and scouting for student challenge setting. The proponent defines a systematic approach to address this challenge, segregating them into 3 phases; a teaching phase, the tournament stage and the onboarding stage. Ideally, per the project design, the expectation is that, going through these phases successful should enable students refine their ideas (with the assistance of the professionals) for funding in the catalyst space. Its worth noting that the project provides a detailed incentive system that could attract more students developers who are left behind with their ideas due to financial contraints and mentoring system. What's the value addition to the ecosystem? Ultimately, by introducing  students entrepreneurs to the cardano ecosystem, the team would create the opportunity to scale up the number of developers within the community and the number of ideas developed on the cardano Network. More importantly, this would be an entry point into the community where students could be onboarded either as PAs,Voters, Dreps and any other role. The overall observation here is that, the proposer presents a detailed project description, a well captured target audience and a definite marketing strategy that would support the team's effort in project implementation.

Would this experience be required in this project? obviously, the project intend to shape the ideas of the students entrepreneurs therefore his experience would be relevant here. Aside that, he provides the relevant links to his projects to confirm his expertise. Yoram Ben-Zvi, a partnership lead, social entrepreneur, mentor and an active CA, provides a different perspective to the project with his experience and expertise. His mentorship background suits the outlook of this project. With Razali Samusudin as a research lead, i believe his expertise an educator, catalyst school core member, social entrepreneur, catalyst proposal mentor, and education coordinator would be more significant considering the general objective of the project. I am impressed with the designation of specific role for each team member. Overall, the team experience and expertise covers all the areas required in this project.

To determine the performance of the project in achieving the overall objective, the proponent also set specific deliverables such as, attain at least 50 participants on the presentation, enroll 50 possible new Catalyst community members, develop around 20 ideas given and at least 5 written proposals for fund 11. Based on these deliverables, the team further provides specific KPIs that align with the general objective and the deliverables provided for the project. Among these KPIs, the proponent cites the number of ideas given, how many students participate in the project, number of proposals that come from students and engineers, are the proposals funded, rating of the idea and feedback from the students, as the indicators. In my opinion, these are comprehensive approach to help measure the overall progress and success of the project.

Further on, after they start getting involved and understanding what Catalyst is about, they will most probably become more interested in joining the process and committing their time and ideas to the future of the blockchain.\nI think the project stands a very good chance of succeeding and in that case, the impact it will have could be very beneficial to the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I find the implementation plan to be easy to follow, as it is well organised for each phase of the project - teaching, tournament and onboarding -  each with its subcategories, organised neatly in a provided timeframe, to be completed in an interval of 9 weeks.\nJust like the plan, the budget is also very well organised, on the same 3 sections, each with adjacent tasks, well-described and with the corresponding amount of hours and dollars needed budget.
