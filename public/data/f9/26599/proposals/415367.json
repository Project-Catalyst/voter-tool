On the one hand, the mentorship aims to solve a well-defined and legitimate problem, but the solution is described in two sentences. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the end product - \"platform where catalyst members and students will match up\" - will be physical or online. If it intends to build an online platform, will it be open to all students worldwide or only to students at a specific university? How will students and Catalyst members become aware of the platform - no explanation is given as to how awareness of the envisioned platform will be raisedFurthermore, which students are expected to participate in the project? - The proposal promises to connect new Catalyst members with mentors in one section and students with mentors in the other. Does the term \"student\" here refer to Catalyst newcomers? Furthermore, the project seeks to develop a system for evaluating mentors but fails to describe how it intends to do so - what the criteria will be, what type of survey will be used?, and how it will be quantified/analyzed? Another issue that the proposal does not fully address is the alignment with the current challenge, as it does not specify how such a platform would assist in connecting students with community engineers. On the other hand, it is fair to say that finding the right mentors would help students navigate the Cardano space more effectively and find opportunities for idea materialization and business what is one of the goal of the campaign.

Equally, more information could have been provided about how this Feedback survey will take place (what questions will be asked, what is the average level of satisfaction expected to be obtained). An interesting point would also be to try to measure how this project is being talked about among the members of the Cardano community, to understand the engagement. Finally, it seems valid to leave as a future indicator of success the number of projects that started to be mentored from the next fund.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 2, "ng": 13, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2063, "q0": "According to the author, Catalyst Newcomers can have a hard time boarding and navigating the Cardano space, because the Ecosystem is complex and it is not always clear whom you should talk to. So his solution was to create a bridge between the sponsored proponent and the qualified mentor. The idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal is quite amazing because students have a lot of good ideas but can't always give the right direction, by connecting with the mentor, the student can solve the problem and solve problems faster. At the same time, having a Mentor helps focus their attention and keep them motivated so they can pursue projects to the end. The problem and solution described are reasonable and within the scope of the challenge.\nThe proponent also mentioned 2 challenges that may be encountered during the implementation of the proposal: 1. Lack of mentors and 2. Quality of mentoring. In challenge 1 I think it will be easily solved by Catalyst members who are always willing to volunteer as Mentor so it's not too big of a problem here. In the 2nd challenge, I think that the proposed solution provides a very good solution to be able to limit them. So, in my opinion, this proposal fits very well with the goals of the challenge and does it straightforwardly and directly, so it deserves the maximum score in terms of impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Unfortunately, the feasibility of the project is not appreciated, because all the elements of the budget, roadmap, and implementation team are very poorly explained.

Perhaps after receiving funding? Based on what was provided I can't imagine how you would implement the proposal, what activities would be included in it? Next is the budget this section is also explained very simply \"$500 per month, $1000 per catalyst iteration\". Based on the budget I can guess that you will complete this proposal within 2 months. With a salary of 500$/month and 2000$ for 2 catalyst iterations. Here you can explain more about the budget, for example, a salary of $500: how much time will you spend on this proposal, how many days a week and how many hours a day? Although the budget requirement is low, it is important to explain it in detail, helping us to visualize what work you are asking for, as well as better understand project workflow.\nAnd finally, about the project team, there is only one person mentioned that is Quirin Schlegel. Based on the experience summary, I know that he is a student and I have been funded in F3, based on this information alone it is difficult for the community to judge the author's ability to carry out the project.

It's not bad, but it's superficial, again. How can we track the progress of the project?

However, the Proposer mixed up \"a program\" with \"a platform\" and \"a framework\", and \"funded proposers\" with \"students\" in later Parts, which makes me question his/her understanding of the proposed solution in particular and of the Project as a whole.\nThe Proposer has a good idea that would be greatly beneficial to Cardano Catalyst Fund if it can be carried out methodically ad devotedly. If the Project can equip students with knowledge of the Cardano Ecosystem and Community, it will help increase the popularity of Cardano amongst students and increase the quality of projects submitted by students.

We as Project Analysts need more information to assess the budget.\n\nThe proposed solution was not properly presented to the audience. It is hard for the Audience to determine if the Proposer wants to provide \"a program\" or \"a platform\". A program lasts for a certain amount of time, then 2 months might be possible. A platform or framework normally takes more time and requires a capable technical team to build. Since the proposed solution is unknown, it is impossible to judge if the Budget or timeline is enough for the Project.\n\nSince the Proposer was unable to provide a proper solution to the stated problem, the execution risks are high.

Therefore, the idea is proposing to mitigate the problem presented in the challenge, building a bridge students-engineers worldwide. Besides, the project has the ability to scale as there are more people interested -students and mentors-, and as the tool improves, such as providing new skills to it.

The roadmap lacks detailed information. The fases of the project are not well explained, and the budget is not detailed.\nFor example, the proposer sates \"2 Months Setting up a Framework to manage and match Students and Mentors\", \" $500 per month\". First of all, how would the proposer attract all the students and mentors for him to build this framework, since one of the risks he stated was that he did not know if there wold be enough Catalyst members willing to be mentors - and he did not know how to mitigate this problem yet. In addition, how this Framework would be built? Which information does he need in order to provide a good match for users of his tool? Will it be self-matching or admin-matching?

Here, the quantity of private student-mentor sessions would fit, as well as how many accesses the platform is having per day or month. \nMoreover, there is no importante milestone defined in the proposal. \nAccounting the success of the project, the proposer writes \"A thriving Community of Students and Mentors who inspire each other, get their projects done and maybe build frindships\". And yes, I agree. But shouldn't it be also the recruitment of some of these mentored students? Shouldn't it be measured the rate of mentored/recruited student as an important KPI? Or, those who were not recruited, did they submit any other projects to improve the Catalyst Ecosystem? Were they funded? Did the use of the platform contribute to this achievement in comparison to those who did not use the platform? \nThese are important and necessary rates and KPI's, in my opinion, the should be shown to the community in order to have a good audition.
