How will they find you?\n--What do you really mean by youth? Are you creating materials for children? Teenagers? College undergrads? Grad students?\n--WHAT makes these resources different than the ones that are made for non-youth? Is it cartoons? Tik-toks? I'm joking, but also not.

The proposal's entire solution is nicely supported by market research linked\u00a0from Binance, statista.com, and other portals.\u00a0 Furthermore, the proposal does a good job of explaining WHY the entire project is a good idea, using specific\u00a0examples in the\u00a0context of\u00a0Catalyst and Cardano. The Cardano ecosystem\u00a0is likely to grow and scale as a result of the formation of such a well-thought-out community establishment\u00a0and open-source educational course for youlth, proving how well the idea converges with the Cardano ecosystem values. Furthermore, the proposal's overall context aligns with the challenge for a variety of reasons: 1) It aims to guide youth through the often-confusing blockchain system; 2) It aims to expand their skill set for future digital economy solutions by providing the necessary resources. 3) Its goal is to connect young people/students with more senior Catalyst members. While I think the proposal is well written and contains a lot of information and statistics, I think some of the statements are overly ambitious, such as \"We aim to offer a program for all youth, and plan to have a lead on each continent, multilingual program, transformative education.\" However, if the program is successful, it will most likely be easily scalable and have a global impact.

The detailed timetable, which includes a roadmap divided into multiple phases, is another reason I believe the proposal will be implemented.

Although this is the case, there are no further details on the particulars of how the funds will be allocated which makes the budget appear to be a little vague. Even though this fund is at a smaller scale compared to other funds it is still important to break down the budget into identifiable items. The proposer outlined a budget of \u2018content creation \u2013 3000USD\u2019, for example, if this was further expanded by stating that 1000USD will be used for course 1, 1000USD will be used for course 2 and 1000USD will be used for youth block platform development or broken it down in a similar approach \u2013 It would have reassured me of their financial stability in implementing their project.

I agree that Cardano Community needs more resources for educational programs to involve the younger crowd in the community and educate them. But I haven\u2019t found any specific information about how this educational program will be different from many others which already exist, and why will it be better for students than other similar courses? For example, when you search on Google you can find a lot of free resources to learn about blockchain. It's very accessible and you can even get a certificate of completion without paying anything. Here are some examples of some free blockchain courses: https://www.mygreatlearning.com/, and https://www.upgrad.com/.\nThe Youth Block education community claims to create 2 courses:\n1. What is Blockchain?\n2. How to work with crypto wallets?\nMy question here is are we talking about the course about Blockchain in general including Cardano blockchain or are we talking about a course about only Cardano blockchain? So, this needs to be clarified.\nThen the proposal says that they will publish the first two courses in Blockchain Learning Center and make them free to use. I\u2019m not sure how Cardano Community will benefit from it. It will benefit only if students will be enrolling in this program and will really learn something from it. But the proposal doesn\u2019t explain why students will be interested to enroll in specifically that course? What does make this course so unique? Authors just talk about creating content and open-source platform, and they only assume that students will be enrolling just because this course exists. How do we know that people will really learn something from it?

But there is no explanation why the budget for research is 2000$ when it will last only 4 weeks and the project itself is planned for 17 weeks. Phase 3 is related to project release. If that is not considered as \u201ccontent creation\u201d, then where is the budget for Phase 3? \nThe proposer offers a realistic timetable to complete the work in 17 weeks.

Who, how and when will be translating courses into different languages?\nThere are some risks which hasn\u2019t been considered in the proposal.

Basically, the proposers wants to build a foundation for young people that enter into the blockchain/Cardano world, step by step. Looking at the larger plan and how the proposal fits into the larger scheme, the proposal has great opportunity to bring great value not only to Cardano, but also everything Blockchain-related. \n\nIn my experience as a teacher and researcher, I know by fact the value of the need to adapt educational material to what group you are teaching. Not only in order to reach the target group, but also for them to understand the material in the best way possible. And this is exactly what the proposing team seems to understand. Lowering the barrier of entry to learning about blockchain technology, creating networking platforms where people can connect and communicate, updating and growing the educational approach, collaborating with different organizations.

This information is well needed when assessing the workload connected to the roadmap. \nThere is a clear roadmap provided with milestones on a timeframe, which looks realistic (depending on the workload of each team member). It is probably a good decision to post the first batch of educational materials on an already existing platform, that will take some pressure off of developing their own platform in tandem with the material. \n\nThe budget could be expanded upon by adding details on which team members will be part of conducting research, who will make the educational content, etc. Even better if there was also an estimate of the working hours for each team member, in relation to the budget and the roadmap. For example: Person X works with edu-material 15h/week for Y amount of USD per hour during Phase 2 of the development process. At the moment the budget could be a lot of different things (since it only contains Research - 2000USD and Content creation - 3000 USD). \u2028\u2028In order to achieve the long term goal of the idea behind this proposal, the team will have to apply for further funding, which they state in the proposal. \u2028\u2028Worth mentioning is that the people involved in this proposal also Is part of other proposals in this fund.

I find the experience and knowledge of the other team members admirable and outstanding but outside the guidelines clearly stipulated by the Challenge to which they are submitting this proposal. The fundamental motivation behind the \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\" Challenge, approved by the Catalyst community last fund, is to provide college and university students with a space completely separate from the regular Catalyst environment in which they can bring their projects to Project Catalyst and secure base funding, nothing financially ambitious. Clumsy projects, with flaws or weaknesses if any, but with a true innovative and creative student spirit, insolent and daring, that will lead their authors to find in our community a place to learn and get involved, a playground endowed not only with money, but more importantly, with the possibility to get hands on with the best technology in the industry while having access to the knowledge, experience and sense of collaboration of Catalyst members. A new concept for Catalyst no doubt, but an efficient one: in the student community of the planet lies that needle in the haystack that ends up changing the game we play so tightly with other blockchains and the legacy world, and it is our obligation to build the best of the magnets to find it. That's just what this Challenge is trying to do: build a suitable habitat for students, designed primarily by the students themselves. \n\nBecause of my affinity with this Challenge (formal experience in education at school, university, company level) and my experience in Project Catalyst (actively participating in 90% of the community positions that exist: CA, VCA, Challenge Team member, funded proposer, involvement in multiple projects in Catalyst) I have been following it closely since it was approved at F8, because it never ceases to amaze me how often the scoreboard seeks to augment itself with topics of undeniable importance (Developer Ecosystem, Cross-Chain Collaboration, The Great Migration (From Ethereum)) to the point of discarding areas that in the real world have proven to be an inexhaustible source of ideas, creativity and results, such as those related to students.\n\nAs an educator and experienced Project Catalyst member,  I understand the intention behind the proposal and consider it completely valid. However, it is evident that it is not being completely proposed by the type of students that the Community decided to support through this Challenge, therefore it does not fit the parameters of the Challenge.  I quote (excerpted from the Challenge information): \"By creating a category of students and increasing exposure for their ideas, they can expect easier funding and to be scouted by engineers\" (section What does success look like?). \"Most student entrepreneurs suffer from a shortage of resources, especially when it comes to funding and hiring engineers\" (Why is this important? section). \"However, the number of proposals to Catalysts is increasing rapidly, and the community does not readily perceive small-scale proposals from students. ....

However, if they are not correctly directed towards acquiring knowledge, they may waste valuable time in the search for knowledge that is really relevant. Although we learned many things as we went along, due to the lack of prior knowledge of our predecessors, since most of the knowledge in this area was not accessible to our parents or grandparents, we currently have a very different situation, in which the younger people generally know more about digital technologies than we do.\n\nUsing the knowledge we have had so far with our mistakes and our successes for the education of the youngest is a fundamental tool for them to obtain individual and collective success, accelerating in time the achievement of results that perhaps we would take much longer to achieve, in case we didn't follow a satisfactory plan. The clarification of what the system is, the correct way to use it for the benefit of the community, and the advantages that the system can bring to the human development of the community, and of humanity itself, through the exchange of experiences, will have resulted very positive in training future developers.\n\nThe basic model of education, always in need of transformation and development to better deal with the diverse talents that students have, directing their skills to certain areas of knowledge, will be even more revolutionary in the face of the challenge of a new proposal for the provision of services and their remuneration. However, this new model will serve to better take advantage of the talents of people who will be involved in projects with which they really identify. And in this new model of communication between countries, the formation of diverse groups with different ideas and different previous experiences will greatly enrich the composition of ideas for the planning of innovative projects.\n\nThe success of a model in which we can obtain the best results for a given project basically depends on the way it is built. The promotion of distance education in the digital model can offer young people and children around the world the possibility of taking advantage of an innate talent, however different it may be. The performance of a remunerated activity in a fair way and compatible with your reality is the final objective of this education, because there will always be a specific market for each of these skills, even if not locally available, but facilitated by the possibility of providing a service to the distance. Even though children probably hear about cryptocurrencies before the age of 18, solid knowledge about these new technologies and the best way to deal with them, including for better planning for their future, should materialize from when they already have. are of age and autonomy to manage their own assets. The transformation of service delivery systems and their remuneration will undergo a transformation that is an irreversible path, and therefore it is necessary to prepare our young people to deal with this new technology in a responsible and productive way.\nThe proposal to create mechanisms for the absorption of young people into the labor market in a model different from the conventional one, usually offered to them, will provide the possibility of selecting work opportunities compatible with their individual abilities, seeking the necessary motivation to carry out an activity that bring not only a fair remuneration, but also maintain interest in a motivating project throughout their lives.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Considering the need to educate young people so that they know better how to manage their own patrimony, and understanding that it is necessary to build a society in which everyone has access to knowledge and the sustainability of projects, we conclude once again that early education on new technologies will be of great value to avoid future inconveniences. The challenge is to do this efficiently, since it is a new idea, with new values to be learned, with new perspectives and also new purposes. And for young people to learn how all this works, it will be necessary to build innovative teaching material that is easy to understand at the same time. The idea of exploring individualities and systems, whether in relation to ecology or sociology, no longer fits into an idea of a sustainable world. The challenge is to make the new generations pay attention to the importance of learning to deal with values and talents in a fairer way. For these purposes, the team proposes an initial phase of content creation, looking for previous examples to be improved, adapting them to the existing resources today. In the second phase, once the models to be followed have been chosen, the team will dedicate itself to developing the first materials to be offered to young apprentices. This phase also includes the presentation of the materials to the partners, for internal adjustments, before the presentation. From the seventeenth week, the proposal is to share the first content with the community. We consider that this is the most important phase of this planning, because the correct choice of matrices to be developed will determine the success or not in reaching the final objective. The $5000 resource distribution is split between: $2000 for research and $3000 for content creation. As for this distribution, we imagine that the proportion may not be the most adequate, since the research will probably involve fewer people and less time than the second phase, which is dedicated to the actual creation of the content, in which much more time will be required. As well as the creation of content, which will require the participation of several professionals in different areas, such as pedagogy and technology itself. Although there is no influence on the total value which is limited to 5000, we believe that the distribution of $1000 for the research phase and $4000 for the creation phase is more coherent.\nAs for the description of the team, it seems to us to be well-prepared, with sufficient knowledge about the technology in question, in a mixed team in which younger people associate with more experienced ones, which can enrich the experience of building a new educational model. focused on Cardano blockchain technology. The proposition of exchanging experiences with partners involved in various development problems around the world provides a better foundation for the construction of this educational project, which needs to contemplate the needs of young people in different parts of the world, adapting locally to the needs of each of these places.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As important as implementing a good project, is being able to measure its results. To promote its success in the long term, it will be important to keep the teaching materials constantly updated, especially as it is an innovative subject that will require educators to have the ability to adapt content that is not yet part of conventional education, to a language easy to understand. The proposal to keep the meetings recorded for future adjustments of doubts and the preparation of monthly summaries accessible to everyone involved in the program will facilitate the auditability of the project. It is also important to feed an information system on the follow-up of the work in which the people trained by the project will work. Knowing how many of them perpetuated in the performance of jobs involved with blockchain technology, and measuring the number of projects they were able to get involved in will be a good way to audit the success of the venture. A kind of database that records the trajectory of these students, after their initial training, will be able to show how many of them really engaged with the new technology, and managed to continue working with it. The natural tendency is that with the increase of the market that embraces the new technology, more content has to be taught to those who intend to work with it. And with that, the continued transformation of the material used for this teaching becomes fundamental. Understanding the effectiveness of these transformations, which are constantly necessary, will have a fundamental impact on the understanding of the results achieved. Monitoring the final results of the projects in which these future students will be involved is one of the ways to measure the success of the initial project. It is not enough just to provide initial information, about the number of students who graduated, soon after the work was concluded, about how many of them dedicated themselves to a project involving the new technology. However, continued monitoring, over the years, will bring more consistent information about the achievement of goals to be achieved for the future. Something that can be fed by the student himself, recording his performance in engagement in projects, over months, or maybe years. The awareness of these students about the importance of feeding this database will be fundamental for future evaluations on the impact that this action will have over the next few years, regarding the training of new project developers.
