However, I find the way they stated the solution very misleading. The Team said that they wanted to create a \"platform\" for University students, yet there is no platform built during the project duration.

Another impact of this project is to help students build their own business through the support of Cardano/Catalyst project. This will hele reduce graduate unemployment in Ghana. On the issue of risk, the promoters have identified reliable internet connectivity as a major risk that will affect the implementation of this project.

That is using social media platforms like WhatsApp, Zoom, Instagram and Twitter are most appropriate for the target market. In addition, the promoters hope to blend this with face-to-face interaction to get these students appreciate the benefits of Cardano blockchain and project Catalyst. In total, the proposers hope to on board at least 100 students after the implementation of the project. The budget is reasonable just that the promoters should provide a breakdown on the expenditure on the workshop to include cost to be incurred on personnel who will support the project.

So this might be quite a challenging task other than the instability of internet connection. Also, though this is a very short project of two months, I think the proposer could add more on its vision on where the educational purpose is going.

Very clear. What I can suggest for future progress is first, to increase the reachability of students knowing about Cardano in other universities, and second, to incentivise a reward system to students that creates business solutions related to blockchain technologies.

You build the implementation plan within 2 months in my opinion is not very suitable because the amount of work is relatively large, the documents and news about the Cardano blockchain are very large, so with such a time it is difficult to complete. .

The brainchild behind catalyst fund9 and cardano as a whole,is to  prepare Africa for a future of wide-scale Cardano adoption and to continue to seed and grow adoption in 2022 and beyond. I strongly think this proposal very much addresses the challenge, as it is desinged to create a platform for University students,to educate them about Cardano blockchain and project catalyst so that those with great ideas can access benefits since a large percentage of students in  tertiary Institutions in Africa are not aware of Cardano blockchain and project catalyst which hinders the discovery of great and  excellent ideas that are out there. Cardano ecosystem therefore seeks to address the fundamental issues preventing Cardano adoption in Africa and also bring on-board new Africa-based users onto Cardano (wallets, platform sign-ups).in view of this I find this proposal very practical, and pragmatic way of using blockchain technology, if this project is right, I believe it can be a good example of how blockchain technology is useful. Hence the proposal will be beneficial to both Cardano and developing countries. This shows that the proposal identifies a problem within the challenge which needs to be solved and it clearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem. My concern is that the platforms to be adopted as undicated by the proponent is too scanty, in-that, other equally beneficial platforms and social media handles like Telegram,Google meeting, ticktok and YouTube which have oodles of subscribers were not listed hence, I suggest that the proposer takes into consideration these alternatives. My other concern is,why the target is geared towards only University studnets,when there are a lot of high school students and high school graduates who are out there going through hurculine task looking for opportunities like this and will be neglected in this great opportunity. I will suggest that,the proponent widens the purported target base of the category of people who will be brought on board. Though there is no gainsay that there have to be a specific target for a start,I strongly believe when such audience as stated are added to the target, it will add a great value to the community,Because it is better \"to catch them young \"\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This proposal I belive is feasible and  is likely to be successfully implemented. However there are a few things that I think could be improved.The budget allocation has not been  clearly outlined and categorised into identifiable items. Firstly I will suggest that the proposer will take into consideration the risk and difficulties that are likely to be encountered in getting access to an event space  for a face to face interaction if the target of audience become more than expected as another risk that may be encountered. It may not be considered,but it is very common that,in as much us cardano is now gaining popularity among  Ghanains,people may be very reluctant to release thier space for a program like this to be carried out for security reasons. Unless the team hire a place for it which will increase thier expenditure and that is not captured in the budget.Again,I will also suggest that the proposer,make an altermative for when the actual ,exceeds the projected target of audience to be brought on board. And vice versa. Which means that budget and funding may either increase  (under budget ) or will be less than funding that will actually be required.(over budget) Hence a clear cut should be putten across to address these future uncertainties when funding is released. Also timelines indicated in the proposal to me is a bit vague. Even though it seem feasible,it does not give a detailed itinerary into the activities. In my opinion,I think the timeline should be more specific and give a comprehensive plan and details about when and how activites will be carried out,and not to give a vague range of time. For example the period of time given is between August and September. And in August, the activities have been clearly outlined,so as September. But as to when a specific activity would be carried out and the duration allocated to it was not taken into consideration. This I think should have a relook so that it will help them to work within the timeline should the proposal be funded for implementation.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I believe we have the fundamentals for what is expected and available to audit this proposal already, what I think is partially left out is how the Cardano community will have access to the information and progress of the project. With regards to monitoring, I did not see indicators suggesting how the process and progress will be monitored. In view of this I suggest that they do an overview of how the team Will work,and an action plan that shows what will be done,how it will be done and duration it will last for. This information can be provided and made available together with the indicators given by the proposer via any of the means of communication in the Cardano community (or through email,telegram,etc.).I think I should congratulate the proposer and his team, for having a spectrum of complete survey, looking out for quality work to be done. The final objectives which is quite clearly listed in the proposal, will have a great impact for Ghana and the cardano community. This also will help realise the objectives of SDGs, hence what I will again suggest is that the proposer looks for a complete way to collect data regarding and bring it to the community. In my humble opinion this can be done through,research work conducted internally among themselves and presented in a PowerPoint,spreadsheet,or a word document.This will be clearly achieved if they give a comprehensive report on how to do it,when to do it and what will be achieved. All this could be presented to the community during some Town Hall,for instance.

This challenge focuses more on student entrepreneurs who are willing to put innovative ideas into projects but lack funding, therefore the goal is to find these students, educate them on catalyst and assisting them to put their brilliant ideas into proposals for funding.

In my view, i suggest the proposer leverage on his membership with WADA to form partnership that\u2019ll connect students entrepreneurs with the engineers within the community via WADA. Already, WADA is a big community in the ecosystem with myriad of engineers within the community who are prepared to shape the ideas of young folks in order to make their ideas relevant to the community.

Per the project, the proposer cite series of activities to be carried out within the month of August and September, but fails to provide enough clarity on the expected duration of each event. i suggest the proposer streamline his project to incorporate specific timelines for each activities, to enable us appreciate the extent to which each activity will last. For instance, as part of the project, the proposer intends to organize a workshop but we\u2019re not told the duration(expected hours) for such an event. A careful look at the team profile shows that Kingsley has gathered enough experience with the cardano ecosystem that would be relevant to this project. However, in my opinion, the information provided on the profile is not sufficient to confirm the expertise of the team. To show the professionalism and transparency of the team, i suggest the team readjust the project to include external links as evidence of the area of expertise. The overall budget of the project looks moderate and reasonable but some items lack a detailed breakdown of the amount allocated. For instance, the proposer fail to describe how the workshop would look like and the items that would be required for the workshop that would justify the amount allocated.

Ultimately, the main success the project intends to achieve is to \u201c enable engineering students in the school have access to cardano blockchain knowledge which will help them to connect to the ecosystem and put their ideas into proposals and also get connected to engineers in the ecosystem\u201d. Based on the aforementioned objective, I think the KPIs provided is in sync with the objective and would help determine the performance of the  the project. I\u2019ll cite two examples to explain this point. For instance, the proposer\u2019s goal of having a 100 attendees for each event can only be determined by the KPI that indicates that, \u201ci will measure the number of students who participate in my event\u201d. Apart from that, another goal of the proposer is to on-board students into the community. To determine whether this is achieved, the proposer cites the third (3) point \u2013\u201cmeasure how many students are interested in asking relevant questions and want to become members\u201d, as the indicator to ascertain whether the goal is achieved or progress is made in achieving such a goal. However, the proponent failed to indicate clearly, how to update the community on the above information. In my view, to show transparency, i suggest the team restructure the proposal to reflect their intention to communicate the data on the progress and success to the community.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2734", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4796, "q0": "The proposer points out that the students at his school are not aware of Cardano blockchain and project Catalyst!

In regards to this proposal, it is exactly what it is. Two young entrepreneurs that aim to educate and onboard other students into the Cardano/Catalyst ecosystem, easing into the learning curve but still realizing their ideas through Catalyst. \u2028In short, the proposers plan to create a platform for university students (locally, at first) where they can educate other students on Cardano, through workshops, face to face support, and social media. \n\u2028Considering the project is relatively small (at this stage), it can be scaled easily by incorporating more students and expand to other universities. Another important aspect is that the participants of the workshops (hopefully) has the possibility to spread the information to other people, creating a natural on-boarding loop. \u2028\u2028The proposer clearly states a problem (not enough students have knowledge of blockchain tech or Cardano, nor opportunities to realize their ideas into products) with a simple but effective solution: Educating them. The platform is also intended to work as a connecting platform between entrepreneurs and engineers, according to the proposer. \u2028\nIn accordance to the challenge brief, I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses this challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project is planned to take place during two months, August and September, as presented by the roadmap (with milestones) contained within the proposal. In my experience as a teacher, I cannot understate the value of interactions with the students (which the proposer have made a heavy focus on). Had it been just educational material that was planned to be created, I would be much less confident in the experience of the team. They aim to host Zoom meetings, daily face to face-interactions and bi-weekly workshops along with being active on social media. This might seem like a lot for two team members, but that is the value and efficiency of having direct contact with the participants. Questions can be asked and answered immediately, and if the person answering has a good base knowledge of the subject in question, it is just up to the one asking to take notes, ask more and listen. Efficient. \nI would have liked to see specified in the proposal if the educational material being used will be created by the team themselves, or if they\u2019ll use online resources. Also, (I might be a bit biased from working as a teacher here) it would bring a lot of structure and understanding to the proposal if an example of curriculum or the educational material was included. The proposal includes mentions on topics they will bring up during these sessions, but as an educator I would have loved to see a plan on how they choose to structure it. For example: \n\n1st-2nd session, What is a blockchain? \n3rd-4th session, What is the Cardano Blockchain?\n5th-6th session, What is Project Catalyst?\n7th-onwards, Getting involved in Project Catalyst. \n\nThe proposal contains a detailed budget breakdown, which is quite reasonable of 1800 USD in total. I would almost say that it is too low, accounting for the work the two team members are planning to put in. 1000 USD will cover the internet costs (which is previously mentioned as one of the potential risks/hinders), 200 for incentivizing on-boarded students (great idea), and 600 for workshop costs. Considering there are proposals out there asking for several hundred thousand, this is a long term investment for very little money. What I would suggest is including an estimate of the working hours for each person, which will make it easier to assess the workload of the team. Who will do what work, how many hours? Also regarding the potential workload, will the team have time to work on this project while managing their studies? How do they plan to handle time management?  \n\nThe two team members are students at Accra Technical university, Cardano ambassadors and frequent participants of events held by WADA (trusted actor in Catalyst). Here would be a fantastic opportunity to add some information that might validate or confirm the experience needed to convey information to the students, or skills required to organize a workshop. It can be anything from social media posts from WADA events where the team is present, LinkedIn-profiles to validate proof of person, etc. A diploma of selling ideas to people, anything of use, really. Because without verification of competence or person, it is just words on paper. The team seems committed and passionate about their project and Cardano, and it is my personal subjective opinion that this is shown in their proposal. \u2028\u2028Considering the scope of this project is relatively small, I agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.

Measuring the success of the project will be by counting number of participants in workshops, along with number of participants who carry on to be PA, proposer, voter etc in Catalyst and the Cardano Ecosystem. It would further strengthen the proposal if an estimated target number were added to these KPIs. For example, how many participants are we aiming to onboard, and how many of them do we expect to be involved with Cardano/Catalyst, realistically? Adding this along with links to the official website or social media channels will bring transparency to the project and give the community a chance to keep track of the development progress.
