As far as I see you're lamenting the unfair conditions in the creative industries towards creators, specifically in the fashion industry. You are definetely making a point there. What you are proposing there, to make a fashion show, some DAOs and some smart contracts lacks coherence and further explanation. How is it determined within your concept hiw the creators are rewarded and how can it be guaranteed that they are rewarded fairly? Since you only have the fashion show in your budget I suppose the rest ist just perspective planning. The fashion show however does not really have something to do with the challenge, as it explicitly refers to on-chain projects. so you don't really define how it will affect the cardano ecosystem. As a positive thing however, you have identified an interesting new usecase for on-chain projects regarding thise reward mechanisms for creatives, so I do encourage you to work on that and refine it with a more concrete implementation plan. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I think the proposal still needs some planning. There is a budget for oranizing a low budget fashion show, but there is not really a time-bound implementation plan with detailed milestones. Also, we don't really get to know the proposers other than by a few sentences and a linked instagram account. No further credentials or references. While the implementation plan could be more detailed there is still a slight chance that something will be organized, as the proposers clearly seem to have some experience in the fashion industry.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The overall problem and solution statement are a bit confusing. There are not really any metrics presented other than that some people are going to form an organisation and generate income, but no way to track or audit anything is presented. There are no KPIs and the proposal dies not really fit into the challenge unfortunately.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_2257", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2449, "q0": "We realize that the proposal aims to provide a way to more fairly reward creators for their inventions. We were able to tie this idea to a real-world problem, as beginning artists don't have much help to protect their creations. In fact, an optimized system to solve this problem would bring the saving of resources and greater efficiency. But from what was described in the proposal, we realize that a very long way needs to be traveled until this impact is better demonstrated. With this, we have that perhaps the proposal does not fit so well in the objectives established by the challenge, also because the actions for this path to be well accomplished were also not very clear. Therefore, we are currently unable to find a justification for the $10,000 budget being requested.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "As mentioned earlier, for the project's impact to be more plausible, we would need a more detailed action plan. However, according to the ideas presented here, we can only get a sense of where we want to go. We understand that the objective is to establish a fair way of remunerating new artists and that for this, a small-scale experiment will be carried out first. But as from this experiment it is expected to obtain the structure that will model smart contracts in the future, it would be interesting to have a more in-depth explanation of how the merits of each creator are distributed. Regarding the professionals involved in the project, we see that they have relevant experience for the work in question, but it would be interesting if, in addition, their CVs were made available so that the experiences could be investigated. Regarding the budget details, we noticed a plausible distribution of expenses, but it would be interesting if a portion was also destined for marketing, so that the concept was, from now on, better understood by the public. In general, we believe that the foundation of this proposal has potential, but the points mentioned could be better addressed to increase the chances of success of the project.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "In the section on the way used to measure the evolution, we find the description of some facts that the project will carry out, but we lack parameters that facilitate the understanding of how these actions will be carried out. In general, we see that the ideas mentioned here convey more a scenario of where the project will act than the way in which these actions will be measured. It would be nice if some indicators were established as an expected amount of positive feedback received. Thus, it would be easier to assess whether the proposal was successful or not.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2553, "q0": "This project can have a global impact on the Cardano ecosystem and would embark new users that would otherwise not be familiar with the Blockchain.
