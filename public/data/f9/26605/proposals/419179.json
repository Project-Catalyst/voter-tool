Lokole Numeriques is ready to roll out in some educational and medical institutions as well as in other public places under specific monetization contracts.

The roadmap here is divided into 2 quarters, in each quarter there are a few tasks outlined, but we don't know how it will be done, who will be in charge of it and it would be better if these tasks are tied to a specific timeline (monthly or weekly). Next is the budget, which looks good because we know what the budget is going to be used for. So the amount of $31200 requested for this project is quite convincing. And finally, about the project team, there are 4 members mentioned in this project, we know the role, experience as well as the LinkedIn link to each member. Based on that, I think this team can successfully carry out this project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The ability to audit this project is excellent, all information on the project's progress will be made available through the GitHub page: https://github.com/ascoderu/lokole/issues.

The Box Lokole Numerique offers a POC working prototype that is built specifically to address the challenges the continent faces. For example; poor power supply and lack of internet infrastructure. To solve the above issues the box has a solar panel that addresses the power inefficiency and with no prerequisite understanding of complex tech to own and run the device, theoretically, it will sever all age groups and internet literacy spectrum.\n The team has also identified some challenges like theft or equipment damage from climate and Security and data privacy which they plan on managing with battle-tested cloud technologies for data storage.  \nSuccessfully scaling the Box Numerique in the DRC will see small-size businesses flourish and they will be connected to the internet, can create wallets and have access to the global financial markets. \nThe ability to customise and add several other content and apps makes it versatile for private, public and institutional clients. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Looking at their Github there are over 13 active contributors to the development. Some members of the team were born in the DRC and now work in the Western World, this offers them a competitive advantage of knowing what the locals want and having the technical know-how to complete the task. Someone like Nzolantima Swasisa(Nzola) who was born in the DRC now works with the Canadian National Defense Department.\nThe reservations I have with this project despite a well-rounded team is that though the team has listed people who will be participating in the development of the project the budget breakdown only shows two items (a)software developer salary and (b)coordinator salary but doesn't state who will be receiving these funds. Secondly, it doesn't provide a detailed plan on how it will execute this project. For example; part of the first 3 months would be used on \"consultations with Cardano catalysts\" but it doesn't convey what that means and what hurdles they might face.\nThe budget breakdown suggests a 6 months timeframe before they run out of funds, this corresponds with the teams' timeframe of completion. What pricks my mind is what happens to the development IF they run out of funds before they complete?\nDespite the above points about my reservations regarding the ability of the team to complete the job I still believe with the amount asked, the diverse nature of the team, their combined expertise, and a working prototype designed without Catalyst fund they can deliver a scalable product.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The Box Lokole Numerique is designed to be a general-purpose tool that can positively impact the lives of people in many ways. The problem the team is attempting to solve is a gigantic fleet- providing internet infra to rural areas in the DRC and eventually, this can be used as a model in other African countries. \nThey have provided a few metrics that can be used to measure the success of this project, things as their Github repo which has seen active code contribution from the team.\nThe number of Box Lokole Numerique sold can be considered as a viable metric (more bought indicates a strong desire to use the product) the problem with this is the team hasn't provided any platform that the community can use to review how many were bought, when and where. Adding some sort of purchasing/shipping receipt as a CNFT mintable on-chain will be supper as some degens can buy this in speculation of the success of the product while this adds another layer of revenue to the project.\nAnother interesting KPI that can be used is their Lokole web app UI. The idea here is the number of accounts and daily active users can be used to signal a growth in the adoption of the Box Lokole Numerique. This data will have more credibility within the community if it could be provided on-chain by the team.

Providing connection to unconnected people is a highly impactful project and creates a lot of value in the communities. The proposal lists multiple ways how it creates a positive impact on people\u2019 lives. Manufacturing and distributing devices alone does not exactly define solutions to the challenge question for creating tools to measure, value and monetize impact. Automating the data collection of the amount of the device utilization instead matches the challenge. It gives an objective measure about the scale of the utility. The proposal talks about designing KPIs for defining the monetary value of the impact but does not go into details. Nevertheless, verifiable information could possibly be captured in NFTs and become valued by the markets. \n\nThe proposal describes the concept to collect direct survey feedback from the users via email. The plan is to ask about the impact of the solutions to their lives. Email survey in this case is a quite natural way to collect information about the impact because it is all enabled by the Box Lokole Numerique itself. Simply asking people about how much they experience impact and value from some service is one fundamental way to measure it. Evolving this side of the proposal could make it even better to match exact challenge questions in this type of challenge in the future. It may also provide some ways to capture the value experienced by the users as well as find opportunities to monetize it.\nSome more information on topic can be found for example https://hackernoon.com/wealth-a-new-era-of-economics-ce8acd785441\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There is a clear and reasonable budget breakdown regarding salaries but not regarding the progress.
