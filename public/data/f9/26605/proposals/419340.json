Changing film financing and distribution is obviously one of my main hopes for web3.\nHowever, the lack of details regarding the process of financing, the subject of the film, and the minting and distribution method have been pretty disappointing. \nFrom the rigorous teachings of the film school, I find it hard to believe that this is a film-financing pitch. From my experience, any film producer would like to know more about the subjects I have enumerated above, to better gauge the potential success of the project. As such, I am surprised to see that a person who claims to be a successful screenwriter would leave the entire pitch at this level of detail. And when I read that the proposed solution is to finance this film, because Nokia has also pledged four 5G smartphones and Acer an i7 laptop I found it staggering, since it conveys no information about the project itself. I know there are other film projects, even on Cardano, who are financing their production through NFT minting, so maybe the proposer can take a look at what other teams are building and see what he could potentially add to the space.\nI would really like to see successful film enterprises on Cardano, but I would not give my vote or my trust to projects if they do not take into consideration all aspects of filmmaking, as being amongst the first in a domain and a new space, sets up the standards and the expectations for all the projects to come.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Two of the three main sections of the feasibility section are not finished. The text says \u201cTo follow\u2026\u201d, as such, I will not be giving advice on what is missing, since it hasn\u2019t even been started yet. My only advice is that perhaps for a future fund the proposer will have more time to think about the proposal, add the missing information and perhaps complete the missing sections with the needed details.\nRegarding the team description, the proposer has provided a minimum of information, by writing the names of the screenwriter, directors and actors. However, since this proposal is for a tokenised film funding, the proposer is missing some important key jobs, with specific skills in the blockchain space.\nConsidering the unfinished section of the proposal, I cannot be giving the feasibility section more than a 2.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposer mentions \u201dWe can give monthly updates on our progress\u201d as the only answer to the project\u2019s progress. If this is their answer, then my questions to it becomes where, where will those monthly reports be published?  It is very important to mention, as this part of the proposal that is dealing with auditability is specifically meant as a way for the community to be able to assess the advancement of each and every proposal. If such an option is not given by the proposing team, then the PA will have to decide how many points to deduct for that specific missing aspect. It is also important to mention what kind of metrics the proposer will be using to evaluate the progression of the project.\nIn regards to the success of the project, naming a few famous film festivals is, from my point of view, a good outcome. The presence of both the film and possibly the author could garner a lot of attention from the film industry. \nIn conclusion, the auditability section is only partially answered, but the most important part of the section, the evaluation of the progress has been completely neglected by the proposer, as such, I will rate it a 3.

We would need better structured concepts for such an amount to be better justified.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Given that a large budget was requested, it would be interesting to have a very detailed action plan. However, we found a lack of information about this. It seems interesting that a system is created and explained that shows how people would invest in the films and if there would be a return on that investment. In fact, this possible return seems to be one of the ways that would cause greater traction to invest in the films. We also see that the budget breakdown section does not present information that shows us how the $200,000 will be spent. It would be nice if there was a schedule with well-defined milestones, both in terms of what will be accomplished and also in how long.

However, the metrics used to monitor the evolution of the project are a little scarce.

Obviously, there isn\u2019t nearly enough substance in this proposal to justify a highly risky $200k ask but I\u2019d like to engage with the concept to see if I can\u2019t help develop this idea a little more. I would be very disappointed if these requested funds were meant to BE the fund for indie films, as opposed to building a solution for funding indie films that produces a more long-term sustainable impact. I may not have any $200k ideas about how this solution can function but I do have a lot of thoughts about economic mechanics on which this platform is built. For example, this funding cannot just be created out of nothing, there has to be an inflow of liquidity from people that are incentivized to provide those funds. First, I\u2019m excited about the idea of indie movies put into NFTs (or NFT keys that enable exclusive access to indie movies) because it creates more adoption potential for the Cardano ecosystem if it means attracting indie film movie lovers. Next, it might increase funding potential if a created token had created demand through utility that expanded to indie film makers, equipment/costume companies, ticket sales, merchandise/memorabilia purchasing and a variety of other related industries that made this kind of platform an all in one place for filmmaking and film viewing/interacting to happen.  I think more blockchain related development for this solution has a far greater chance of impacting the Cardano ecosystem than just the funding of a single film with Catalyst funds for publicity sake. That\u2019s not productive, efficient, or aligned with Catalysts mission to pursue the highest levels of community innovation.

As this proposal continues to look like an end credits reel and goes on to describe a movie plot, I realize that this proposal was intended to be a request for funding of a single indie film. If we\u2019re evaluating the feasibility of the core team to produce a completed indie film, I think there\u2019s a real shot at confidence (if we were given all the necessary details)  because the proposer has seen success in it before. If we\u2019re evaluating feasibility of this proposal to produce an ROI that reliably impacts the Cardano ecosystem, I\u2019m not seeing any strong links to believe that this would be the outcome. In the event that this proposal attempts another round, I would strongly suggest providing a very specific roadmap and timeline as well as a budget breakdown that proves every dollar is being spent efficiently. If Catalyst voters will respond positively to funding an indie film simply for the hopes of massive public exposure (which also needs to be quantified), they would be substantially more inclined to do so if extreme detail is provided.

I have to rank this section a 1 because there is not enough substance to measure an impact that directly links to the Cardano ecosystem. The problem here is that there is an incompatibility with this proposal trying to evaluate auditibility (which was designed for projects aiming for innovative technical development). This proposal is essentially a grant for advertisement/publicity of the Cardano ecosystem, which is not the purpose of Catalyst funding.

Perhaps some content coverage of Cardano in the film could be considered?  A form of exposing the audience to Cardano ( like advertising!) There does not seem to be much reach beyond the film being funded - which would be good for the film maker.
