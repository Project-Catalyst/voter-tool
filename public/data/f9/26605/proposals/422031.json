If such benefits were brought only to the WADA organization, we would have that the proposal would already be interesting, but we see that the model being developed could be used for several other projects, indicating an even more positive impact for the Cardano ecosystem.

The most positive point about viability seems to be the close monitoring of the factors that can make a company more valuable, but that are not always seen by external agents. As WADA already operates and has experience in exactly this field, its partnership with Edify Business is likely to present great synergy, with key points to extract maximum value from the deals being discovered. We can also indicate this because the professionals involved in the project have extensive experience in projects, especially related to Africa. And to find out about this, you can find the WADA organization's LinkedIn and there, we find links to the profiles of the professionals involved. Regarding budget detail, we were able to find consistent allocations, with the largest amounts being allocated to important actions for the execution of the project.

Furthermore, the Wada organization is already notorious for its impact so far in Africa when it comes to educating and creating future contributions to the ecosystem. Although the organization mainly targets Africa its content can still be accessible for everyone which is a big enough impact, especially with their new model which represents a paradigm shift in the space.

Also, the budget is broken down into specific needs like research, setup, and auditing...\nThe team doesn't specify too many risks (mainly two) but they do indeed discuss them carefully and provide ways to mitigate them. On the other hand, the detailed planning and extensive information provided makes up for that since it showcases a well-thought-of project.

Furthermore, the milestones that the project seeks to achieve are not too ambitious as a way to manage expectations. Many KPIs can be considered here, as said the earlier number of consistent attendees is one, alternative budgets raised, as well as the follow-ups on the business plan.

This proposal will allow the creation of a prototype to evaluate the Web3 Education DAO, and enable the basis for Wada and similar organizations to develop strategies that will allow them to monetize their projects.

The budget was based on the actions within the plan, and presents the cost per hour according to the type of activity to be performed. It would have been helpful (especially for activities that are associated with higher costs per hour) if you could present the professional profile expected to perform these tasks.
