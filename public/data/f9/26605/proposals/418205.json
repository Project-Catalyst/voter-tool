The research primed the ideas and preliminary work done for this proposal.\n\n(+) The need for, and advantages of a personal chat client over the page interface we most often  use for App UX, are reasonably and clearly described.\n\n(+) Fits very well into the challenge as successfully closing this proposal would enable the emergence of a rapidly innovating social apps framework and marketplace. \n\n(+-) 2 Apps will launch with Appstore, Ikigai is a proposal in F9 and might not get funded or not launch; \n\n(+) Mitigating feature creep and over complexity\nis done by using live classes, modularisation and the natural/intuitive chat like approach that makes design and lay outing much easier and faster. At the same time exploring the highest potential of collaboration within Catalyst.\n\n(+) Owning personal data, related to (mental) well being and health, that's processed in an app, would be a game changer for individual and collective social & cognitive security.\n\n(+) Risk of toolkit misuse is being mitigated by having to apply for tech stack license at a Social Design Academy (SDA) partner.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "(+-) It's worth mentioning at first that the requested budget will not cover all development costs of the Social Appstore. The purpose of this F9 budget is to stimulate development via task rewards, in a decentralised way, spanning multiple communities. \nThis is extraordinary experimental, a bit risky but very well thought out and driven by very committed and valuable community members. Funding proposals like this is exactly what Catalyst was created for. \n\n(+) The UX/Storyline works well as an enhanced version of user story. Is well defined, but could go into further detail how research ties into questions\n\n(+) SDA classes budget in another proposal, what if not funded? I inquired with the proposer and he replied that the tookit is being developed also without the SDA classes, just slower, with more hurdles and less educational content as byproducts. \n\n(+-) It's mentioned the funding won't cover full development and production costs, the revenue model relies on apps being bought in the store and remunerations being paid after the store launches successfully.\n\n(+-) The budget seems small enough to give the MVP a spin, only because trusted communities and members stand behind it. Experiments like this is what makes Cardano and Catalyst special.\nThat's why the Feasibility score is higher than it would be with a different team.\n\n(+) Design Circles let insights and knowledge be shared across the network and help to collaboratively build the so called \"Lego Bricks\" for the social impact revolution.\n\n(+) Deliverables are clearly structured.\n\n(+) Real-time progress tracking, thanks to live classes and Gitbook\n\n(++) A network of Game~B advocates and well respected Cardano communities coming together sends a strong & trustworthy signal of honesty, diligence and transparency.\n\n(+) Data and experience gathered while working with decentralised workstreams, using the UI toolkit approach is extremely valuable to Cardano's and Web 3.0 communities in general.\n\n(+) The planned workshop series by SDA, that will conjure the MVP is presented in detail and makes an awful lot of sense, additionally it would create valuable educational content as a \"byproduct\".\n\n(+) Conversational design principles and tools are well explained, put into context, as well as showcase a great understanding of the topic.\n\n(+) Collaboration with Little Fish Foundation (well known SDG focused DAO) is essential to proposal and give the toolkit an immediate purpose fit application.\n\n(+) The budget breakdown is very detailed and shows how much thought went into planning and mapping out the MVP.  \n\n(+) The selected approach for engineering with CUI blends together education with design and engineering. Creating a hyperfast iteration cycle and allows for efficient software development\n\n(+-) How can the financial incentive of class participants scale? Some additional info on that would be helpful for assessing scalability,\n\n(-+) The revenue model of selling apps is briefly mentioned and requires more attention!\n\n(+) Publicly supported (strategic partnership) with LittleFish foundation and Konma, showcases par excellence the ability to collaborate within Catalyst.\n\n(+-) After successful funding likely to return, in order to polish the app store ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "(++) The team around the SDA has so far displayed splendid documentation and process visualisation skills in Miro and Gitbook.\n\n(+) The 5 key metrics measured on a weekly and monthly basis, will allow for comfortable and sensible short- and mid-term auditability.\n\n(+-) Ideally long term KPIs referring to Apps or SDG impact created will be formulated during the first month of production.\nThey are somewhat present in paragraphs just need some reshaping.\n\n(+) Funding this proposal will close the long running R&D proposal from F6, that was the primer for the Social Appstore.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2170", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5541, "q0": "From the problem statement, the proposer\u2019s point of view is from a real world view of how that Gen Z customers now want to change their buying habits to protect but are however constrained.

The proposal has a high potential of changing positively in the long term to suit into other challenges by allowing for new ideas or innovations within it since it\u2019s concerned with building a social platform for users.

There could have been more breakdown of the items, products segment, module production and peer review group which cost $18,000, $19,800 and $1,600 respectively so that it can be better audited. The amount can be reasonable to achieve the desired outcome though. The roadmap and timetable presented here are very clear and detailed. The proposer has clearly explained how activities would be carried even making use of some diagram representations with clear time allotments. I must commend this effort.
