This process of research prior to development would enable this tool to be used in a variety of different contacts.

The proposal aligns with the ethos and broad goals of the Cardano community, the self monitoring of good behaviours could also be impactful as it is a self measure, of shifts in conduct. It is not possible to determine how broad use could be as this will depend on the technology used and accessibility - is this for people who already function in an environmentally friendly manner or is the goal to access a broader base and educate and integrate knowledge of Cardano etc? The project could scale up if more people used it but could be limited by incentives offered and interest - being a gimmick needs to be avoided.
