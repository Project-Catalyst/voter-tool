According to the proponent, in Africa 8 out of 10 workers are engaged in informal work and their contribution to the economy is not properly measured and appreciated. The solution to this problem is ERS (\"ERS CONCERSO\u00ae\" already exists in Alpha version and has been deployed in Ivory Coast), an approach to continuing professional training that measures \u201cemployment impact\u201d. It is a digital tool that connects informal workers to job opportunities by assessing their skills. The proposed solution seeks to improve impact coding and more specifically aims at social impact. The ERS matrix allows to measure of the value created by informal workers and creates a social network of economic mentors/stakeholders. It is also a factor in the idea of \u200b\u200b\"employment impact\" coding. There is clarity in the problem, the solution, and the connection of both to this challenge is clear. I agree that this proposal addresses the objective of the challenge well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Proposal feasibility is an average, budget, roadmap, and team factors are all provided, but they can be explained in more detail so that the community can more accurately assess the extent of the proposal. its feasibility. The route is divided into 2 phases. Phase 1 (quarter 2-3-2022): is the Beta version development phase. Phase 2 ((Q3 2022): Conceptualize and implement POC in collaboration with the authorities. It can be seen that the proposal provides the necessary tasks in each phase, however, the information provided I think the activities in this phase should be broken down with a defined timeline (months/weeks) and who will do the activities. Next is the budget, $20,000 is requested, which we also know will use for purposes such as Upgrade alpha to beta, Operating costs, and Marketing costs, these costs remain can explain in more detail so that we have a clearer view of how this money is used.\nFinally, the team, this part also needs to add more details. It is mentioned that this proposal was presented on behalf of Florence Lacave. She will lead the project full-time in all aspects related to the operation and implementation of the ERS solution in the territories and is supported by 2 advisors, Alexis Abric (Abric Consultants) and Trishala Suresh (SmartChain). We need to know more information about the parties involved in this project such as experience, professional skills, as well as authentic links to the above information. Unfortunately, these details are not enough for us to assess the feasibility of the project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Project progress metrics are also listed:\n\"-We will measure the progress of the project by calculating the number of informal workers transitioning to the formal economy through the use of the ERS platform.\n-We will also calculate the contribution to the local economy and community based on this.\"\nBut how can the community track the progress of the project? It would be better to list a few stats that are directly measurable so that everything can be tracked more clearly. In addition, the proponent should prepare reports, at least monthly, with project updates, that these documents will be analyzed during meetings with the IOG coordinators and are also simply and directly shared with the community.

Furthermore, we realized that there is already an initial version built of this platform, which also facilitates a possible success of the enterprise. The budget being requested also seems consistent with the current phase of the project and what is planned to be accomplished. We can say that this proposal is innovative and that its possible success would contribute positively to Cardano's visibility as it is using its technologies to solve a latent problem in many developing nations.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As this is a project still under development, we were initially afraid that very grandiose pretensions had been applied to its execution plan. On the contrary, we noticed actions consistent with the current moment of the project and we realized that they are very focused on validating concepts and structuring a slightly more elaborate version of the platform. In the budget breakdown, we have that appropriate capital allocations were indicated, it is also interesting to see that a part of the budget was dedicated to project marketing. Regarding the team behind the proposal, it is interesting to see that there will be a person dedicated full-time to the project, but it would be nice if a curriculum was made available so that their experiences could be proven. In the same way, it also seems interesting that the CVs of external consultants were made available.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Given that one of the main points of the project is the use of the platform to make the transition from the informal to the formal market, it would be interesting if more parameters had been defined to understand the evolution. For example, in addition to the number of workers who made the transition, it seems interesting that the engagement around the project on social networks was also measured, as well as the average time the worker spent on the platform until he migrated to the formal market. . Regarding the perception of the project's success, we found ideas consistent with what was developed, it is also interesting to see the establishment of an established goal of migration to the formal market. But still about the ways to follow the evolution, it seems interesting that it was indicated which tool would be used to measure the evolution of the platform development (something like GitHub). It would also be interesting to understand if the development will be organized in sprints and what will be the average duration of these sprints.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2574, "q0": "The proposal identifies a real problem of informal employment in Africa by providing evidence a Background Paper from the International Labor Organization. I see this problem addresses both Social and Governance aspects of the ESG criteria and it has some good potential to form an impact to feed the current challenge. The proposal attempts to describe a solution based on a digital tool named ERS that will train informal employees, measure and tokenize employment impact and aim to employment inclusion in Africa. However, the description is not clear enough and fails to suggest a robust and concrete outcome that can be used as an input to the challenge. Perhaps the reason is the wording or automatic translation used in the proposal. Getting the assistance from a translator would benefit the proposal because it has indeed some good potential to positively impact the Cardano ecosystem and the Cardashift launchpad. The identified risks look sensible but there are more than those like challenges for attracting and creating a social network of financial stakeholders and informal employees, impact measurement accuracy and quality, adoption of ERS solution etc.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal provides only one name that will lead the project and use some external resources for further support. This information is not enough to determine the skills, the experience and the roles of the team members and how many resources are required by the project. The proposal should provide at least some references to the people involved and more details on their roles and their allocation.\nThe budget is broken down in three main categories: Upgrade, operational and marketing costs. Each category should contain more identifiable items and explain how the costs were determined. It is not feasible to evaluate whether the requested budget is reasonable or not.\nLikewise, the provided time plan is quite poor as it only suggests two steps with a quarter resolution and little description of the project tasks. Neither resources are specified to perform the work nor actionable tasks or order of execution are communicated.\nOn the other side, it is positive that the proposal includes a presentation of the ERS solution that showcases the motivation, the mission and the main concepts its blockchain and onboarding model.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal suggests two valid metrics for tracking the progress of the project but there is no explanation how these metrics will be calculated. Besides the calculation method it would be advisable to present a draft roadmap with milestones so that the project becomes more auditable. There are three points specified to quantify the success of the project but only the last one is a valid KPI.

What\u2019s not clear to me from the information presented by the proposal is how the Cardano blockchain would be bootstrap for this effort. In the attached pitch deck they mention creating tokens of the data collected, which raises a lot of questions since it\u2019s not explain how or why. Are they going to create tokens with personal data from unemployed people as a tool to get them jobs? How is that process going to work? A lot of safety measures need to be input in place when handling personal data on a public database such as a blockchain.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal presents a rough timeline with key milestones to complete by end of the year.

It\u2019s hard to assess if the timeline is realistic or not, since they don\u2019t provide enough information of current features and the future developments to be implemented. The team is composed by one person full time, but no links to LinkedIn or personal website is provided. It\u2019s also mention that two external advisors will be supporting this project but again no links to verify their expertise or career.

They lack a robust methodology for tracking and measuring progress, no KPIs are mentioned only \u201cthe number of informal workers transitioning into the formal economy\u201d.

The project should design a funnel to measure the number of informal workers who interact with the platform, the second level could be the number that signs-up to the platform and so on.
