I find the issue this project is trying to solve, to have the potential to disrupt an unequal system in the Agri-food supply chain, opening up a path for a transparent and equality-based solution. But that is if successfully adopted. Not just by the farmers themselves, but most importantly by producers, brands and eventually, end-consumers. The developed app is well described, and seems to be very complex but, at the same time, easy to operate by users.\nThe team has identified a number of possible risks facing their project but hasn\u2019t defined some solutions on how to mitigate those risks. I have some ideas that I hope might be helpful. For the issue regarding the lower adoption rate due to the tool being too complicated, my advice is to make use of a tester service that can evaluate your app. I know there are several paid online services offering this, like uTest, maybe it could come in handy if the team cannot find enough people to try the app. Or, maybe they could set up a bounty board payable in ADA directly and tweet about it and have community members try it out and offer feedback.

The budget is split into two amounts, one amount of $2000 set aside for the farmers from Africa to obtain their certifications and the remaining budget of $1000 will be used to pay a marketing specialist to help the team. From my experience, the amount set aside for marketing looks too low, and I\u2019m unsure if the team can achieve what they planned to. If not sufficient, I would advise the team to maybe submit a proposal in a future fund with a dedicated budget for marketing, after consulting with a marketing specialist.\nThe team seems to be very capable of implementing the proposal, they seem to have the knowledge, and most of all, they have been working on it and have also been previously funded, so I feel safe to say, that, besides the somewhat too low budget, I don\u2019t see any problems in the implementation of the proposal.

The only problem I see is that the team might need more labor to work more extensively on the projects, especially when it comes to front-end and UI/UX which is crucial for adoption. The team presents a period of 8 months split into two periods each lasting for 4 months where the team will work on marketing and adoption of the project.

I would suggest pulling the tokenomics-related information (the video is good for a sky-level view, but we need a bit more) into a subheading, the information about the Living Roots platform into another, etc. Consider also adding a diagram illustrating the tokenomics and how it might provide monetary incentive and accountability for the supply chain process.
