The Algae Token team does all that and more. They are creating an on-chain business model for setting up and scaling up a network of algae farms globally. The first one will be set up in Australia and the next ones, decided by community, in e.g. Middle East and Africa. Algae can be used for animal feedstock, human nutrition/health, CO2 reduction and various circular economy business models.\n\nFirst version of the website (http://www.algaetoken.com/) and the whitepaper outline everything on an understandable level, without going too much into nitty-gritty detail. The model itself could be scaled outside of the algae farm use case. It\u2019s all about providing decentralized funding, using Cardano, to support sustainable products and services.\n\nThis has massive potential that can be further increased through partnerships with other RealFi projects and initiatives. When ready, it\u2019s easy to see the Algae Token team join collectives like Blockchain4Good. Connecting with e.g. World Mobile and Empowa in Beira, Mozambique could be a quick way to access the market in Africa, at the same time enhancing everyone\u2019s impact in synergistic fashion.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Having watched the interview with Peter Bui (https://youtu.be/jtGind6UhY0), it is fair to say that this is a top-notch team who has considered most everything\u2014and what still needs to be considered will hopefully be Catalyst-funded.\n\nThe team has altogether six proposals in Fund9, ranging from setting up a DAO to product integration to ESG reporting* and legal and financial standards around the world. Going through these, it\u2019s obvious they are mutually complementary yet independent. Not getting funding for one of them doesn\u2019t endanger the others.\n\nThe team is amazingly high profile and well-versed in this topic. Anything and everything from nutritional value of algae to return on investment to supply chain management has been considered. They also understand what still needs to be clarified (such as regulatory compliance). The budget is well thought-out and scoped for a five-month period, employing each of the three core team members for one day of the week.\n\n*Mind you, the ESG Reporting proposal (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/419513) could have also been part of this challenge because it is exactly about measuring impact.\n\nThe outlined risks and their mitigation plans were a bit vague but acceptable. Any RealFi project is a long-term investment and any startup has a high likelihood of failure. So, there\u2019s that. To be able to not only survive but thrive, Algae Token needs to land on a model that enables the investors to be convinced that there will be return on investment early enough and that the token utility extends beyond mere voting. Another thing that should probably be considered by the community, once everything is set up, is to see if existing like-minded algae farms could be linked to the Algae Token network as well. This could help scale up faster.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal is neatly divided in five perspectives: Governance, Dapps and Smart Contract implementation, Legal Framework, Education and Marketing, and Cardano Onboarding. Key performance indicators are very well outlined and the team is committed to report on milestone completion, legal and financial issues and budget spending on an ongoing basis.\n\nThey have set things up so that they can be in constant communication with the community. They solicit feedback and input from social media, discussion channels and GitHub.

It does not even ask for funding for any part of the project other than the blockchain environment, the Token sale will be financing the actual bioreactors/farms\n4)They have described all the tasks that need to be done and already completed some milestones, showing they are really deep in the project.\n5) There is both scientific evidence of the feasibility of the concept easily to be found and links of the proposers qualifications can be found in the proposal.\n6) A risk analysis with a credible contingency plan has been made.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As hinted above, the description of the solution presented in this proposal is pretty clear and obvious.

No additional financing will be required. A realistic timetable is included. The intention is to complete this project in 5 months. It is good that milestones are included per month. The milestones are certainly achievable within the chosen time frame. The proposal sets out the resources needed to implement the proposal. Most of the budget will be used to pay for the working hours. The team has clearly thought about how everything will be implemented.
