The number of 15 Cardano native tools added at launch and an additional 3 tools per month after launch seem both realistic and proving of their success. They have also considered the projects utilising the website to find the needed tools, with a number of 20, which is also feasible.

The solution was to create an information dashboard for impact projects so that they could understand the existing tools they could use for their projects. Thus, the team identified the problem to be solved and came up with a plan to solve the problem. In my opinion, this is very necessary because so far there is no page available for projects so projects can refer to it and use it as a source of information to apply additionally. the projects. From there, discover creative ways to generate financial value from making their impact.\nWith the aggregation of tools available in the Cardano ecosystem that can be used by high-impact projects in one dashboard, this proposal adds value to the Cardano ecosystem. In addition, the proposal can also scale and explain the future challenge with the very fast evolution of blockchain platforms - truly valuable digital projects will grow and close. To contribute to a large-scale impact is to create a society and a world with outstanding development. In short, the proposal has a definite impact on the Cardano ecosystem, promising to be able to scale and solve challenges in the future. I strongly agree with the impact of the proposal, I vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has experience in the Cardano and Haskell/Plutus blockchain, some members are also computer scientists, programmers, etc\u2026 The team also provided a full explanation of the problem and related documents. related to the proposal (MLabs websites,...). However, I don't see the disclosure of all team members' identities via social networking links (Linkedin, Facebook...) - in a team of 4, only 2 people reveal their identities via Linkedin, and the remaining 2 people do not have a social network, which is a hindrance that makes it difficult for the community to look up the members' identities and verify the feasibility of the proposal and affirm more credibility. of the team (who are already reputable and experienced in MLabs). If you want to know all members' information, you must visit the MLabs website. I've come across several other proposals that do the same. Core team size as I understand it to be 4 (listed by name and area of \u200b\u200bexpertise in the proposal), these are key members, and the team may have others not yet mentioned identified in the proposal. My advice to the team is to try to add a social media link (Linked, Facebook, etc...) directly to the proposal to make all the members of the team public. Because thanks to the full complement, the community has a lot of advantages in looking up the members' identities and verifying the feasibility of the proposal.\nThe budget is presented briefly, somewhat sketchy, and not yet stated how to calculate the labor to make up the budget cost. I think the community needs to list more details about the budget to increase the persuasion and feasibility. Because when listing the details of the work related to the budget, it will clearly show the professionalism and meticulous attention to the team's budget balance sheet, through which the community can strengthen more confidence in the ability of the team. examination of the proposal. The fact that the team presents the budget as it is, only people who already know the team well can understand and believe, but I think for everyone from the community (some people are very new - they don't know yet). about the team and this proposal) can understand it easily, we need a more detailed, more understandable presentation. That's my advice on the budget.\nThe plan and how it was done was outlined by the team step by step - this was a roll call of what needed to be done, not a level of detail. Through this, the feasibility of the proposal can be assessed to some extent. It can speak to the enthusiasm of the team's presentation of the proposal.\nHere, I consider the necessary resources for implementation, I divide them into two main resources, which are financial resources (mentioned in the above budget) and human resources. Regarding human resources, with 4 key members who have professionalism and experience, I did not see the team mention other collaborators. This makes me somewhat doubtful that the proposal will be implemented successfully. In my opinion, it is necessary to involve many members, not just a few key members. So can the team share more about who (collaborators or other groups) can build and implement this proposal with the team? Are they members of MLabs? My advice is that the more the team shares publicly, the more trust the community will gain. In addition, as the team shared, some members are also working on another proposal in parallel with this proposal at Fund 9. I would like to ask if this reduces the quality of work on this proposal. shoot it? Although the team mentioned that there are still human resources to perform. Because I'm afraid resources will be scattered when the team works on proposals at the same time. In my opinion, the team can demonstrate to the community that moreover, even though there are currently members implementing another proposal, the human resources are still fully guaranteed for the successful implementation of this proposal. This should be presented in real detail to make the community believe (specify the name of the implementer and related members). It is the best way to create more trust in the community, thereby increasing the feasibility of the proposal.\nIn terms of technique, technology and language used when implementing the proposal. This is a collection of high-tech technologies: Blockchain Cardano, DAO, etc\u2026 I think it was mainly built by core team members who already have many of the skills I just mentioned. In addition, a large reputable team like MLabs can completely mobilize external support to make the proposal implemented in the best way (possibly with the team's ability - it is not necessary). . But I still support this and give my subjective opinion. That is the basis for me to believe that the team will do a good job when implementing the technical aspect of the proposal implementation.\nThe team stated the potential risk of implementing this proposal: The possibility to find enough tools that have been verified to be useful and safe for impact projects to use - I didn't see that mentioned. solutions to prevent risks. Why didn't the team come up with a specific solution to prevent the risk? Here, I add the risk that: Ada's slippage - will affect the budget of the proposal. We know that the cryptocurrency market is in hibernation (devaluation of digital currencies), so Ada may depreciate when the team receives from the Catalyst fund, then the team will face the problem of a lack of budget to implement the proposal. So my advice would be for the team to take a close look at Ada's slip-in budget to fit the budget requirements in the proposal.\nThese are just my positive comments, the team can review and adjust this proposal. I both agree and disagree on the feasibility of the proposal. I vote 3 stars.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The roadmap of the proposal was presented in quite a detail by the team with a total duration of about 4 months. This is a reasonable roadmap and milestone for a proposal that takes time to implement. The work steps to be performed in each stage have been stated and in a certain order - containing all the necessary information - albeit briefly. However, I still have advice for the team that the team should attach the milestone roadmap to specific months of the year (eg January, February,...). If so, it will make it easier for the community to evaluate the transparency and auditability of the proposal. As a PA, I have evaluated several proposals and have found that not many teams can do this and this makes it easier for the community to quickly assess the transparency and auditability of the proposal. fast and accurate.\nI don't feel satisfied without the presence of job performance indicators (KPIs) and key metrics. The team needs to look more carefully and specifically to come up with KPIs and key metrics. We all know the role of KPIs and key metrics in auditing. I consider KPIs to play a certain role in demonstrating the transparency and auditability of the proposal. So my advice is to quickly add KPIs and key metrics to the proposal. By doing that, this proposal will have higher transparency and auditability.\nI find the way the team defines \"what the success of this project looks like\" pretty well, it ties into specific numbers of the number of useful tools, the number of projects using the site, and the volume of interviews/beta testing. Thus, the definition of success is well laid out, and it is easy to audit when it comes to specific numbers but also the theory and practical applications. Throughout the proposal, problems and solutions were clearly articulated by the tissue group. We hope the team will consult with me, keeping in mind the addition of KPIs and key metrics.
