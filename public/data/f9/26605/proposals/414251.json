It is a little bit hard to understand, maybe because the proposal has been translated using an App or Google Translate.\nI would suggest the proposer to look for partners who can help for translation.\n\nIt seems that the proposer found out that the \u201cworld of work\u201d needs to be promoted, in some ways.

However, although we understand the predominant context in which this project operates, the impact that would be generated with a possible success of the project is not so evident, since we were unable to find a greater detail of the purpose of the project, since the aforementioned ecosystem is finished. Also for this reason, it is not clear how it would be possible to bring value to the beneficial actions that the project will carry out, and this valuation would be one of the central points that we need to find in the ideas belonging to this fund. Furthermore, it is clear that, taking into account the aforementioned observations, the amount being requested of $100,116 is very high, not least because this amount would represent about 50% of the fund's resources.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Regarding the paths mentioned for the development of the project, we were able to observe a certain coherence in the actions to be carried out over time, since these activities start from simpler premises and gradually become more complex. However, it would be interesting if more details were given about these actions, for example, it is mentioned sometimes that more partners, developers and funders will be sought, but only with these statements there are still some doubts such as: what characteristics are being sought in these funders and partners? What would be the main technology required by the developer in question? These open-ended questions don't sit well with the relevant amount of about $100,000 being requested. And still in this context, given the initial situation in which the project finds itself, perhaps it would be nice if the total capital being requested here was smaller, it is that a good part of it was more focused on research and development, thus, since the central idea If the project had better-formed pillars, it would be possible to move on to a phase that required more intensive capital. Given the amounts being earmarked for different actions, we noticed that now the project already seems to be, precipitously, at this stage, requesting considerable amounts like around $20,000 dollars for website creation and optimization, but before that, as mentioned previously, it seems more It is interesting first to make a good definition of the actions that must be taken to create an ecosystem with enough traction to attract people and promote a positive impact on the job market. Regarding the professionals involved in the project, taking into account the breadth of markets and people that the project aims to reach, it seems significant that a better-formed team was already defined. The curriculum of the professional currently involved in the project is also not available at the moment, so that we can verify their experience.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Regarding the ways mentioned to follow the evolution of the project, we noticed that the two main ways indicated to verify the evolution are quite relevant, especially the use of github, since the project will have a strong technological bias. However, again, it seems constructive if more information were given here on how this follow-up will take place. For example, which system features will have higher priority to be developed and, consequently, how long can we expect these features to be implemented and placed on github as a form of verification. Additionally, it seems pertinent to mention the future monitoring of this development by Cardano members with technical knowledge in the area. Likewise, it would be nice if the aforementioned roadmap already had an outline so that we can better understand how the follow-up should take place. Finally, regarding the perception of success, a positive point would be the presence of quantitative parameters that would help us to measure the scope of the initiative. Some quantitative targets could be established, such as an average number of workers using the platform after a certain period of time after its launch or an expected proportion between employers and employees using the system.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 2, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6647, "q0": "This proposal wishes to create a token system which provides incentives for all people to work. The token would actually promote and create incentives for reasonable working conditions, would collect information on employment and would advocate for equitable treatment for all stakeholders. Such a tall order from the first sentence! \n\nI find the proposal rather unrealistic through its very broad scope. It\u2019s impossible to create change in the entire world employment ecosystem without focusing on a clear solution or on a clear problem to resolve. We are faced with a vaguely described solution and we are not being offered too many details regarding it. \n\nConsidering all of the above, I can only offer two stars since I am not convinced that the proposal would be a great addition to the Cardano ecosystem if implemented. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The feasibility of this proposal is questionable at best. Let me offer a few points of view as to why. First, the budget split does not look feasible. A third of the budget would be spent on incorporating a company in Germany - which to my mind is an excessive amount and not a good use of funds. Second, marketing costs would be 26k USD and website creation an additional 21k USD, without any split according to the actual tasks, applicable hourly rates or any description as to who exactly will be actually building. On top of this, there is another 7k USD caption to include finishing the business plan and a whitepaper. I find the budget completely unfeasible. \n\nWe have a similar problem when it comes to the team behind the proposal - sadly there isn\u2019t one. The proposer simply says that he will ask around for people interested in building the solution with him. Again, not having a team in place when asking for 100k USD is definitely an additional red flag. \n\nA similar experience hits us when looking at the roadmap. The project would be split in five quarters. A big surprise comes in the Q1, when the proposer informs us that the necessary steps of the project will be to (1) quit his job, (2) finish the whitepaper, (3) incorporate the company and (4) find more business partners. So in other words one fifth of the project would involve offering time for the proposer to cut his existing attachments and finish the idea behind this proposal. Needless to say that this is very unconvincing. A similar poor experience exists when going into the details of the other stages, but I shall spare you of the details. \n \nAll in all there are extremely high chances that it will not be feasible to finish this project according to the existing plan.

What does that mean exactly? We are not being told.\n\nSo far the team is a one-man-show, so there are of course no communication channels open for the Cardano community to interact with the project, if funded (Telegram Twitter, etcetera).

Make use of that token to enable trading as well as to pay and cover transaction fees for other users. That is a good idea. However, there are a few problems with the way that you present the problem that the solution to the project can solve the challenge: Regarding the numerical statistics, we are of the same opinion. People are working all over the world, and I believe that number is likely to be even larger, but constructing a system or an application that people can know and use is a different matter. I really have not seen any solutions that are effective and positive as well as specific for you to solve the problem that has been posed.

You only have ideas, no significant internal capacity, or significant economic or professional factors; in addition, you are looking for companions in the near future.

I see that you always want to find someone. Find partners with whom you can grow and work together. The fact that you are going to quit your current job and devote yourself entirely to this endeavor is indicative of your level of determination. However, this is not sufficient on its own. For instance, you have a very robust community, which enables you to receive assistance from the community, or you have been familiar with the Cardano Blockchain for a significant amount of time, which enables you to easily comprehend it and gain access to it.

The establishment of the company will take place in the second quarter of 2022, and after that, you leave it in the final item equivalent to the second quarter of 2023.
