This step will be used through something they call Cmrt contract, named after credential validation and smart contract. The way the process works is that when an employer, for example, is looking to hire a specific individual with certain skills, who provided his/her DID including a number of given credentials. To be absolutely certain that the skills are validated, the employer can run a Smart contract, which will run a smart contract in which the owner of the credential is re-issued another one in order to be verified by the employer. However, what I couldn\u2019t find anywhere in the proposal or video, is how the re-issuing process works and what guarantees that the set of skills has been maintained and updated? Perhaps in the example provided with a truck driver, this is not as relevant, but for someone who claims to be a neurosurgeon, for example, having a certificate reissued should contain the guarantee that the person who is being validated has indeed practised his job in the past x number of years, and has been keeping up-to-date with all the new surgery tools and practices.\nIf this aspect is not covered, then why would this step still be needed? How can a credential be falsified on the blockchain, especially on Cardano, where tokens have their own policy IDs, thus offering validity?\nSince there is some missing information regarding the workflow of the process, I find I cannot rate the proposal a 5/5. However, since I find the idea to be potentially impactful on the entire Cardano ecosystem, I will rate it a 4. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan provided is well designed and simple to follow. The team has divided their workload into 16+ weeks and has provided details on the tasks each week or group of weeks will be handling. In the Cardano Community spirit, the team has written for the final week \u201cContinue hard work, but celebrate along the way!!\u201d, which to me, an active member of the community, sounds very familiar. We sometimes forget to celebrate, and even when we do, we still keep working.\nThe budget is well detailed, though I find the development budget rather on the small side, especially since the proposer wrote that they are looking to hire a Cardano blockchain developer from the community. From what I know, the rate is usually upward of $65/hour, but I hope they might be able to find someone who can see the potential of their project, and accept the provided amount.\nRegarding the rest of the team members, while I understand if some of them would rather stay anonymous for now, for those who don\u2019t and have provided their names and skill in a short paragraph, a link to a third-party website like LinkedIn, GitHub etc. would have helped in assessing their credentials - ironically, this is the maximum that can be asked at the moment and hope that the LinkedIn profiles are truthfully completed.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I feel like the first auditability section was somewhat misunderstood. While it\u2019s very important that the team has provided the key milestones and steps for the proposed implementation, what the question was mostly referring to was, how will the team verify that those milestones have been implemented, and most importantly, how can the community independently verify that, as well?\nThe success vision of the team looks solid to me, although, some metrics would have provided some extra clarity in judging the team\u2019s expectations of their implementation. For example, how many issued credentials would constitute success? Or what adoption rate of the Cmrt contracts would prove successful?\nGiven the missing details, I will rate this section a 4.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 5, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2540, "q0": "The project presents a solution for verifiable Credentials (VCs) using new smart contracts built on the Cardano Blockchain. This solution would be used mainly in education but can also incorporate any other form of credentials like licenses and so on. This project represents a real-life application of Blockchain technology in a very critical space where a global solution is needed to make transferable credentials and proof of skills possible. The ecosystem would definitely be richer with this novel approach to such a big problem that the community has been talking about for a while now! The project falls under the challenge's guidelines since it represented a new paradigm for certifying education which falls also under 3 of the UN sustainable development goals. It will be interesting to see such a project in action and perhaps see the MVP applied to the Plutus Pioneers and Atala Pioneers program programs that are part of the Cardano ecosystem. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From the links provided and the information in the proposal, I feel comfortable saying that the project has a high possibility of success. For starters, the team is a very qualified and includes a veteran in the VCs space. The development consultant's name is not disclosed according to their request s the team said. Furthermore, the team presents an extensive explanation on what their design would be and even better resource to understand their design of the Cmrt would be the video presented by Andrew Fisher. They also present a weekly timeframe with what exactly will be done to mage expectation. While the team acknowledges the harshness of the task they do have a solid design and the expertise to make it happen. The team also recognizes that one of the main risk they are facing is slow or limited adoption which would make all this work redundant. I look forward to trying these contracts over in Marlowe, having such integration would be great. I also would like to see more details from the team on how their solution might interact with Atala.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "While the team seems to be transparent and is sharing their core design and so on, they do like some quantifiable data point to determine success or to judge their development. The fact that these metrics are lacking is understandable since the project is still in the research phase. Furthermore, the fact that the team provides a detailed budget with a breakdown of the number of hours needed for every task is appreciated. The team also says that any subsequent money needed in this phase will be taken care of by the team. The delivery time is not provided but that is again understandable due to the nature of the project. On the other hand, a weekly breakdown of what will happen is provided and a detailed report will be presented to the Catalyst community members in weeks 9-10.\nThe fact that the team makes the catalyst part of their roadmap shows a good level of transparency. The community can expect in my opinion an MVP in best cases or at least a proof of concept which could be implemented in subsequent funding rounds. If the team gets funded, I'd like to see more quantifiable data point about their development that will help us all understand where the project stands.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2317", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4579, "q0": "The proposer makes a complex but compelling case for the need to build a system that can audit credential checks, which in turn can potentially further the challenge's goal of demonstrating and monetizing impact. As Catalyst and Cardashift mature, there will likely be a need to more confidently verify credentials. A Cmart smart contract prototype would be a useful tool for testing this approach to identity verification.\n\nThe linked video provides a useful visual model that voters can follow along with, while the description of the proposed solution provides a detailed walkthrough of the necessary concepts. I would suggest, however, that the proposer consider making a white paper for the in-depth walkthrough that can combine the solid descriptions with some visual aids and strategic subheadings. The proposal itself could then be used to provide a 10,000 ft. view of the subject that is more easily parsed by Catalyst voters. \n\nIn other words, all the components already exist, but the effectiveness of their presentation could be streamlined.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given that the project is based around verifiable credentials, I'm surprised Andrew did not link to his professional biography in one of his other activities. The proposer presents information in a way that suggests genuine experience and knowledge, but frustratingly doesn't, for example, name or describe the projects he's worked on for New Hampshire or Arkansas. What is the NFT title marketplace he worked on with Matt Ross? All of this sounds intriguing, so it would be nice if it were easier to admire some of the work that the proposer and his partner have done.\n\nBudgetary expenses appear to be reasonable for the task. Voters should keep in mind that this proposal is for a prototype to check the viability of the Cmrt model, not for successful implementation thereof.
