Allied to this, it is planned to use a business logic that will develop a utility token, which can be used as a currency of exchange for health services, when providing data to the application. In this way, the proposal is actually making a positive impact tangible in the health sphere, while using technologies from Cardano's ecosystem. Therefore, we see that the proposal is in line with the goals established by the challenge. It is necessary to mention that, considering the initial research phase, a considerable amount of capital is being requested, so that a solid base is formed and perhaps in the future the product reaches a state of profitable maturity. Therefore, the proposal has considerable inherent risk, but if successful, the visibility brought to Cardano will certainly be immense.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In accordance with the aforementioned, a very positive factor regarding the feasibility of the proposal is the great use given to blockchain technology. We know that the subject in question is not widely debated, often for cultural reasons, so, by creating a means of securely obtaining data, several arguments can be based on this information and the debate would be greatly facilitated. The authors of the proposal seem to understand well that the path to obtain this result must be gradual, accordingly, we note that this initial phase of the project is more focused on research and structuring the paths to be followed. This is totally justifiable and consistent, given that the ultimate goal is to launch a very comprehensive product. And in this context, we also see that the team has a methodologist specialized in conducting research. Additionally, we also found an IT professional on the team, which is equally crucial given the scope of the project. But it would be nice if the CVs of these professionals were more easily available, I didn't find links with this information in the proposal or in the available document. We note that the amount being requested is quite considerable, but it does not deviate much from what is planned to be accomplished, given that this initial sketch will form the basis for the rest of the project. We just miss more details on how this amount will be subdivided between the activities to be carried out. Another positive factor for the project's viability is that there is already a projection on how the project's tokens will be useful and their exchange possibilities.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding the ways described by the team so that the success of the project is monitored, we note that the points mentioned here are relevant and really refer to what was intended to produce. However, in addition to the description of what will be delivered, we also miss the indication of the means that will be used for the gradual monitoring of these deliverables. Some tool with this purpose could have been mentioned here, or the time intervals in which the feedbacks will be provided. Regarding the perception of success, it would be interesting if some more goals were established, in addition to the general deadline provided. For example, an evaluation could be carried out with a certain number of people to gather opinions about the UX developed and establish an expected average score in relation to this test.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8844, "q0": "Sometimes Women cannot speak freely regarding some of her personal problem which includes periods, and during such times if she cant find doctors around her , during those situation this app might help her to overcome the problem that she is facing.\nThis app might can collect most of the problem faced during period and help them immediately or can conduct survey and help in bringing best idea to solve the issue hence This proposal effectively addresses the challenge .", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Creating this app might be easier with proper UI/UX developer but making people to use it is a challenging task her, as some people might think it is unsafe to add personal data in such apps.\nHere the survey is done by methodologist who is expert in biology and an IT professional who has expertise towards block chain\nhas it has experienced team, this app should provide an development where women can speak among them openly regarding the issue they are facing , so Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The project has key indicators for only building app and surveys , it is not considering number of people that will use the app as key indicator which is poor.\nThe team here just wants to take the survey it hasn't mentioned about providing solutions to any problems that are faced during period.\nIt doesn't have budget breakdown achieved yet properly.\nThe proposal is of very long term  idea where the proposer can provide its first data on dec 2023, so information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3008", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9925, "q0": "The proposal suggests researching a proof of concept for an application where women can fill surveys regarding their period health after which the collected data adds to the collective database which again can be analyzed to benefit all the participants.\n\nValue generated would be tokenized and owned by individuals which provides possibilities for it to be valued and traded in the markets. There are certainly opportunities to use statistical methods to measure the contributions for finding the relative values of different data points. That would address the challenge very directly but the proposal does not go into details here. There is also work to do with the databases and marketplaces when we are talking about health data. Advances there address well the challenge\u2019s descriptions about monetization infrastructure. The proposal recognizes a need for these solutions and describes some possibilities but it is still at a level of early vision. \n\nI like that this proposal focuses on approaching health data generation and monetization from a specific subarea direction. Interoperability between data storage systems, analytics algorithms, token models etc, will enable multiple independent solutions to synergistically cooperate in the future. Thus I could imagine potential partners in decentralized healthcare space to help and find collaboration opportunities on many of these issues. My view is that this project\u2019s advantages so far are mostly in conducting effective surveys and in a deep understanding of the health topic in question. After completion, this project would be a great value add to the decentralized health ecosystem but regarding this challenge, the impact on measuring and monetizing impact seems not very high. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "There is an initial draft for the roadmap taking place mostly in 2023 which takes the plan from the discovery phase to the beta launch. This funding request covers only the discovery phase which is taking place in december 2022 and consists of the user interface mockup and the first set of surveys. The proposers have analyzed the markets extensively and understand requirements of being competitive in this area so I think they are capable of delivering this initial phase. However, the hard part is to move forward from it. Even though this specific proposal is about the discovery phase, I would expect a somewhat more detailed plan of the next phases because the difficult design questions and technicalities live there. I am a bit concerned that the project gets stuck after those first steps. Financial risks (to a funder) could also be lowered by asking less funding in the beginning and then scaling up after successful completion of some milestones and a more detailed follow-up plan. The total funding needed to finish the roadmap is estimated to be 930 000 USD. There is a rough budget breakdown for that but not a detailed breakdown for the scope of this proposal. \n\nThe proposers are a survey specialist and an IT professional with blockchain qualifications so they can be expected to have skills required to work on the project. There is LinkedIn information available (although not given in the proposal). ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is no source or a way given to follow the progress in real time. If the project is not open source, some kinds of regular short progress updates might add transparency and auditability of the process. \nThere are three clear deliverables which are targeted for the end of 2022. The first two are UX mockup and the initial survey design which become available and auditable when they are finished. As the third criteria, the proposal also mentions the response from the impact ecosystem regarding funding design as one way to measure the success. Obviously if there will be a clear roadmap forward with a sustainable funding structure, it is a big success and a great step forward for the realization of the vision. Whether this becomes reality or not will be known at the end of this initial roadmap. Because this is a key factor for the future outcome, I would like to hear about the progress made along the way. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_3138", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12114, "q0": "The problem raised in this proposal is the limited availability of quality data on health for PWP while this related information is urgently needed to support research, policy change, gender equality, and gender specificity. PWP requires information that is easily accessible, up-to-date, holistic information about how to care for yourself (and maybe others) during menstruation. Periods can already be a serious pain in the butt (and womb), so where we can we choose to make menstruation that little bit easier for everyone.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer sees this risk from the idea side, because this idea is in the early stages it will be easy to copy and unstable crypto valuation problems will have an impact on productivity. But I see other risks, namely 1. Difficulty in obtaining accurate data on health/menstrual conditions only through surveys. However, it is not clear the incentive mechanism for people to be motivated to fill in the surveys. Are they paid in your proposed native token? Or do they own the data that is then auctioned in the future on permissioned networks such as dHealth Network (so they get a share of the revenue generated from these data exchanges??), and 2. Transparency in the blockchain system will also be a consideration for people cloud users of the application, there will be user concerns that their data is open and insecure. This project has a good idea and purpose. $30,000 in funding is too much in the discovery phase. The proposer does not have a clear plan regarding what approach this project will take to run this project, the breakdown of the budget is also unclear (there is no description of what project funds will be used for), and the team that will work on this project is also not explained about its qualifications and the job description, and there is no roadmap or timeline for this project, there is only a deadline in December 2022.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This proposal has several corrections, namely there are no KPIs that will be the benchmark for success, there are no milestones for the project, and it is not clear how to solve the problem. Proposer must do deep exploration in making this project, the initial idea is very good and helps PWP. In the future, this idea can help PWP to take care of themselves in period conditions and provide information to the surrounding environment on how to take care of their family, spouses and friends who are PWP when they are in the period phase and help the government make policies related to this. Good luck!!", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_3362", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12560, "q0": "The plan intrigues and piques my interest because it is excellent for developing nations and is especially helpful to people who are pregnant. I appreciate this and think it's acceptable that it specifically works to modify how society views the weaker sex and lessen its stigma. The ability of the project to communicate and offer information for medical research, medications, and policies towards the particulars of individuals with time to balance life is according to the proponent token model. and they do a respectable job. This proves unequivocally how the idea will benefit the Cardano ecosystem. The proposal still has to be resolved so that it may be used in practice. I hope the author clarifies in the upcoming work. So I rate it a 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proponent's UX model goes into great depth about the implementation and the technique of exchanging tokens with user data over the entire time frame. At this time, I feel great. However, there is a slight issue with the budget, and the details given are rather hazy. I need you to assign that amount precisely, not the author's $30,000 that is stated in this beta's budget. For instance, the cost of the outreach phase, the outreach phase, etc. so that I may understand precisely how the costs are handled and whether they are appropriate.\nSecond, I observe that there is relatively little information about the qualifications and experience of member of your team working. Since the proposal is directly related to health, I believe it is essential to have the perspective of someone with medical training and expertise alongside those with experience surveying and understanding the ecosystem Cardano.\nThird, despite the fact that I have reviewed the plan numerous times and can see that you list numerous potential hazards, it is not clear how to address these issues. This makes me not enjoy this aspect.  Even though it's still in the discovery stage, I see one more obstacle. In other words, although the program is used to communicate and manage user health information, it is not subject to FDA regulation. Because users won't know if they are affected after downloading a program that promises to bring them many benefits, this will increase the potential of harm. Do you thus have a plan to address the concerns you and while also explaining what I see? I hope you'll think about it and reply. Rating point 2.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "In terms of project transparency, the proponent puts out the strategy in a series of rather transparent steps.I understand that it will be difficult during testing to give specific numbers, but I think in addition to the number of people with menstrual cramps, you also need the number of surveys done and user reviews after use demo app,... all of that can ensure that you have a successful experience model. As far as I'm aware, the most of the health applications still in the experimental stage have a good chance of succeeding. Once more, this initiative has a fantastic and uplifting concept. Hopefully it will be successful. All the best to the author! \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3437", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 13876, "q0": "This proposal clearly fits within the developmental challenge listed about, demonstrating and monetizing impact. In brief, the proposers plan to develop a token incentivized app/platform to collect data about People with Period (PWP). An interesting side note, this was edited from \u2018women\u2019 as a fellow PA/community member pointed out, gender definitions are constantly changing and people putting together these proposals need to be inclusive. It does show the proposers active engagement and willingness to take feedback onboard.\nThe proposers list 4 main SDGs that their proposal hopes to address, which may not be as many as several other projects, but according to Unicef roughly 26% of the world's population are PWP, so this equates to over 2 billion people. If this data could be collected efficiently, effectively and be incentivized, it indeed would be valuable to global health markets, governments and production companies. Hopefully, that would flow on to the PWP in terms of global health benefits, more discussion and truthfully the stigma removal about periods - but I think I\u2019m getting slightly ahead of myself here.\nIt\u2019s interesting to note the proposers list \u2018risk of being copied\u2019 as their initial main concern. Quickly browsing online there are dozens of free-to-use period monitoring apps already available, so I guess their concern is someone copying the monetizing aspect. This is a concern, however, it will also be a benefit over the competition if the app is developed to the same level as the other products - then with some incentivization about this, it could potentially succeed. \nOverall, there is massive possible impact due to the data pool size and existing market of apps that could be improved through monetization. I rate this proposal 5 stars for impact.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal states that this development is in a very early stage and they are seeking \u2018seed investment\u2019, as such the budget and timeline is only for a proposed proof of concept. They clearly state that they plan to return in future funding rounds to see how the project could take off.\nWithin the context of purely a discovery phase, there are limited details provided. The timeline is a simple quarterly outline of steps they plan to take, with the deliverables and funding considerations tied into a small table. It\u2019s sufficient for the discovery phase of a project, however, going further I\u2019d expect a more explanatory timeline with specific itemized action points.\nThere is no breakdown of the $30,000, which can not be excused. Even the proposals written by students requesting only $5,000 have specified roughly where the funds will go. I would encourage the developers to amend this to the proposal as soon as possible, even just briefly describing salaries, overheads and possible outsourcing costs.\nAnother concern regarding the feasibility is the lack of information about the proposal team. There is just one sentence explaining \u2018Margarita\u2019 and the writer whom we presume is \u2018Kiransingh.\u2019 A lot of success depends upon the team, and this information needs to appear clearly, or be linked to the proposal. Even though this is just the discovery phase for the project, more needs to be known about the proposers to gain the confidence of potential investors.\nI rate this proposal 3 stars for feasibility, there was some clear evidence in the timeline, but also several missing pieces that are important to determine the possibility of a proposal.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As with the feasibility, there are certain strengths and several weaknesses in terms of auditability. Initially, the measures to track progress and success are quite clearly laid out. They plan 3 phases, 1) mockups, 2) initial survey design, and then 3) initial test launch with some other details involved. I would like to see more details within this criteria for success, particularly stage three has the connections to the finance ecosystem that will have many sub-projects to consider.\nThere is nothing to consider for financial auditability as no information has been provided about where the $30,000 will go. This planned spending needs to be itemized to rectify this proposal and make it eligible for future funding.\nThe proposers could list or detail where the information discovered along the way will be published. Will you be able to see it easily on social media or head to a website to see the progress of their proof of concept? Who knows - as they have not explained this clearly in the proposal.\nI rate this proposal 2 stars for the lack of information regarding auditability.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_3840", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "A privacy first app for :\n\u2022Data capture over longitudinal surveys over multiple years allowing to build a comprehensive profile for users\n\u2022Analytics of trends and personalized recommendation systems", "experience": "This is a first venture in the blockchain entrepreneurship space.
