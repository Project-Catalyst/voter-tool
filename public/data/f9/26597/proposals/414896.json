However, the Haskell programming language prevented them from implementing their ideas. Realizing that Haskell was a major barrier for developers, the team came up with the idea to create a Haskell course for developers from other programming languages. This course will give developers easier access to the programming language used in Cardano's smart contracts. This is a great idea to increase the number of developers for Cardano.\nIn this section, the proposal writer presented their product functions and features or the main components and main activities of the project. The team chooses social media platforms to popularize the course. This makes the course accessible to many people which in turn will attract more members to the Cardano community. The target audience of the project is programmers. The course will positively impact these audiences and make it easier for them to execute their projects on Cardano. We can see that the proposal perfectly fits and supports the goal that Challenge is aiming for.\nThe results that the project promises are also presented very specifically, and clearly in each part. These results are completely consistent with the Key metrics of the Challenge, which simplifies the programming language approach for programmers and attracts community participation.\nThe difficulties that the project will encounter are also anticipated by the proposers.

This also helps the project receive a good assessment of its potential to achieve the expected results. However, to be more appreciated, the team should Proposer clearly define the positions and the number of people needed to carry out the proposed project.\nAs for the budget plan, I think the team should provide a more specific plan. In order for the community to consider whether the budget is reasonable compared to the plan outlined in the proposal, the team needs to provide details about the costs that they will use the budget to spend on it. It can be personnel by monthly salary, hourly salary, weekly salary, or per job. Or pay for necessary assets that are specified in the plan. The budget plan should be broken down and presented in a clear bulleted format to be used for each item.\nThe proposal should include a section that provides information about the people implementing the project.

I am very pleased that the team has raised the risk in the proposal and the solution to overcome it if the risk occurs (Q&A about the lesson via Zoom). I believe the proposal will help many developers switch to the Cardano ecosystem to work Cardano is one of the best blockchains available today. From there, they contribute their programmability to smart contracts on the Cardano platform and create useful applications on the Cardano ecosystem. In short, the team can add more social network links to make their identity more public (increasing transparency in front of the community) according to my reference advice. I always want to contribute ideas to the team for further reference. I agree with the feasibility of this proposal. I vote 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap and milestones outlined by the team are very clear with the work spread over 6 months. I would like to comment: The team can attach milestones and roadmaps to specific months of the year (January, February, etc\u2026this is just an example), it will be very convenient for the audit community and assess the transparency and auditability of the proposal. The problem is clearly described in the proposal, with the solution included of course. I was very impressed with the way the team presented the proposal, it showed the professionalism and focus the team put on this proposal. In the proposal, I do not see the key metrics (KPI) and key metrics. Surely the team knows that these are two important indicators to evaluate the auditability and transparency of the proposal? I advise the team to add quickly and accurately so that the community can see it more clearly. In return, the team has very specific definitions of what success looks like through actual estimates, which are considered the result of Haskell videos implemented. The team did a great job with this. I find this to be a realistic proposal that meets the community's needs and expectations for its success.

For instance, pointing out if it's going to be a one-to -one support session, if it will be in telegram groups, etc. The Q&A zoom sessions for the exercise part is a good idea but it's nice also to incentivize debate amongst them so having a dedicated channel to it can help also.
