According to the proponents, there is no youtube channel that works to post content aimed at developers to learn better about Cardano's technologies - with that, the idea is precisely to create a youtube channel that publishes Cardano development tutorials with a good frequency; it is also said that these videos would be created in a simple language accessible to everyone. In theory this serves very well what the challenge seeks, as is very clear in the excerpt: \u201cChallenge KPIs include easing the learning curve for new cardano developers, and this proposal aims to do just that. Cardapper discord server, telegram and twitter will be posted with all updates. The comments, conversations and feedback from aspiring cardano developers on youtube and in the communication spaces will help in communicating the project results.\u201d However, in practice some situations should be better exposed. The main issue that should have been clarified is the exact content that will be addressed, that is, what will be said in each of the videos, what knowledge will be addressed. It would be essential to have a notion of the curriculum that would be work here, let's say. It would also be important for proponents to explain in what way they intend to create easier and more accessible content than what is already available so far on youtube on this subject. For these reasons, my opinion on the impact is neutral, because while the idea is good, it is not adequately explained and developed.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "More or less, because this topic leaves something to be desired in several ways. The information given here is very basic, not allowing a good understanding of how the project would be put into practice. Speaking first of the script, we don't have enough information passed, it's not possible to understand what the pre-production process of the videos would be like. We know there would be the search, script, and edit steps. How would each of them be developed? How would the subjects to be taught be selected, how would proponents plan to write a script for each video, what would the editing style be like? How will the 20 hours of work that would be needed to create each video be divided for each part? All these processes would need to be explained in detail. Talking about the costs, the asking value for the project is not lacking compared to other Catalyst proposals. I believe that this is the part that is best in terms of feasibility, as the total amount is divided between the price for the production of each video ($800) and also for the purchase of materials: \u201cQuality microphone - US$ 100 + 1 TB - $150 + Studio Decor - $50\u201d. So speaking about the proponents, finally, I believe that they are qualified people, because they have a lot of understanding of Cardano's technologies and have already posted some videos that serve as a demonstration for the content they intend to create, but I still think they could have invested in more detailed CVs and they should also have attached their linkedin profiles, so that we could get to know them more in depth.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Unfortunately, this is the topic that leaves much to be desired in the entire proposal, there is very little information passed, both on the auditability of progress and success. For progress, monitoring would be done based on the analysis of \u201csteady good growth in developer viewership on youtube, consistent quality video posts every week, and positive feedback from developers\u201d. But how could we audit the pre-production process of the videos, the making of the scripts, the recording, the editing? We would need to know if the 20 hours of work combined for each video were fulfilled and also if they were done properly, I would like the proponents to provide us with ways to understand these processes that would be behind the scenes of each video made available. It would also be necessary for us to have an understanding of how the videos would be disseminated - how they would reach developers interested in working with the Cardano ecosystem. As for success, unfortunately defining it as just \u201chappy developers and they find it useful to ease the learning curve\u201d is pretty abstract. How can we verify if the videos were being put to good use, that is, if the students and professionals who watched them understood the past knowledge and put it into practice? In my view, a direct survey with the audience that watched the videos would be necessary, and the results should be shared with our community, so that we could understand if the learning curve was really enhanced through this new channel of the youtube.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 7, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1950, "q0": "Providing video tutorials about development on YouTube is a great way to reach out to developers and aspiring developers. If the videos would gain traction by the algorithm, it could on-board lots of new developers as well as bring more attention to the Cardano Ecosystem. \nThis proposal suits the \u201cDeveloper Ecosystem\u201d challenge setting somewhat well since it could (1) Increase developer productivity and (2) Broaden the knowledge base, (3) Attract new developers from outside our community when they stumble upon the videos.\n\nHowever, it is hard to make great educational development videos and from the proposal and the videos provided it is hard to tell what the course of direction is for the videos. It is stated that they will help developers by making tutorials. \nQuestions I would like to have answered is: In what format will the tutorials be? Will they be courses, projects, small videos where you show a piece of code? What level of knowledge do you expect your crowd to have? What is your main target audience? Beginners, developers unfamiliar with cardano, experts, Plutus participants?\n\nObjectively speaking, the provided video material displays interesting topics but it could be argued that they are not educational in their current format. Is the plan to keep the same format and educational style in the videos if you are funded? Have you in any way researched if this type of teaching is requested by developers/the community? If that's the case, it should be included to increase the credibility of the proposal. If not, you could do a case study and adjust your content according to your findings.\n\nThe intents and purpose of the proposal are great but the questions raised above bring the proposal score to a neutral standing. 3 points are given in terms of impact.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers have experience with Plutus Pioneer program, Gimbalabs Plutus PBL and other general dev and blockchain technology.

The hourly rate is included in the budget which proves that the budget is fair for the required work. \nIt is for sure feasible to provide 12 videos in 12 weeks but a more important question remains about quality. Since there is no indication or target level in terms of quality it is not possible to be confident in giving a high feasibility score. A suggestion is to clearly outline the level of expected quality in order to assess the feasibility of the videos. At the moment they are estimated to consume 20 hours each, but what can the community expect from these 20 hours?

The current definition of success states \u201cHappy developers and them finding this helpful in easing the learning curve.\u201d. This is not measurable, unless you perform surveys, but there is no plan provided for that. A suggestion would be to define your success together with KPIs that are identifiable and measurable. A few examples could be: 12 videos produced, 1 video per week produced on time, 100 views per video after 1 month, 1000 views per video after 11 months etc.\nThis proposal is easy to audit, but also very hard to measure the success since no measurable KPIs are provided.

In turn, this boosts the ecosystem's overall productivity, adoption, and capabilities. The proposer has definitely read between the lines and has come up with a clever plan to include the developers in the chain. This idea clearly tackles this issue to some extent by ensuring that the proper assistance is provided to people who want to start off, which is why the majority of developers have given up owing to the lack of appropriate content to guide them. The proposal is all the more credible and effective for the readers since the proposer is aware of what needs to be done, is aware of the difficulties involved, and ensures that the community is aware of their strategy for overcoming those difficulties.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal's feasibility metrics are quite succinct and logical given the type of work involved. The proposal maintains it to a minimum by outlining the overall number of films they plan to create and the timeframe needed to create each one. The cost to produce each movie is approximately $800, and while the budget breakdown is very straightforward, it is difficult to determine whether it is justified until the community has access to one of the videos and can assess the content's value and clarity of the production. Nevertheless, the total funding isn't exaggerated, so one could assume that the team is not trying to rip off the community. However, there isn't much to comment on because there aren't any examples of the author's earlier work to get a general notion. The introduction of the author is really brief, as is the introduction of the Plutus developer who may have created the movies.

Given the novel strategy they suggest, I'm certain that the views are the only realistic measures available. A plan like this might give qualitative metrics more weight than quantitative metrics. Additionally, with regular videos, the consistency could be monitored, and the quality of the proposal could be evaluated with the rise in user interactions with the material.

The main question that needs to be asked is how will people find out about this Youtube channel? Growing a community is extremely important because trying to start an educational platform without a large community can be hard.

A quick search shows that the problem is indeed valid. As a software engineer myself, I can attest that tutorial videos on Youtube are one of the most accessed resources for new developers to start learning programming languages and tools. Based on what I read in the proposal, what the proposer means by Cardano development tutorials includes Haskell basics, advanced Plutus, and dApps development. This is a problem. The proposer plans on releasing 12 tutorials in total, but I would argue this amount is simply not enough to cover the aforementioned topics, at least not for new developers. There is also the problem of existing resources regarding Haskell and Plutus. Developers typically learn Haskell at learnyouahaskell.com, and there is a Plutus Pioneer Program playlist on the Input Output Youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqC8oiurqsI&list=PLnPTB0CuBOBypVDf1oGcsvnJGJg8h-LII). The proposer could mitigate this by making tutorials around Cardano dApps development only. It would solve the problems of not having enough videos and having redundant learning resources. That being said, the sustainability aspect has not yet been touched by the proposer. Remember, the proposal statement centered around the lack of consistently updated resources. Therefore, I fail to see how the three-month implementation would solve that problem since it lacks details on how to keep producing tutorials sustainably. It could be mitigated by relying on Adsense, putting the video on other Youtube programming tutorial channels such as Traversy Media to gain a wider reach, or simply asking for a longer-lasting runway by requesting more budget. Whichever alternative the proposer picks, it would help them to resolve the problem. As presented to us, I have to disagree with the effectiveness of the proposal.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I have mixed feelings regarding the proposed implementation plan. The proposer does list their relevant experience, and we could see what each member is responsible for. However, there aren\u2019t any links we could use in the proposal to verify their profile. I can only find one of the members on LinkedIn through their profile website from one of their Github repositories. The proposer should have provided these LinkedIn and Github links in the first place so we could determine if they are technically capable of making learning resources. The budget requested is broken down by their hourly rate multiplied by the number of hours they have to spend. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t entirely support the budget breakdown because the details around the number of hours are vague (how many hours do they spend researching? How many hours for editing? It\u2019s also hard to justify the 40 USD per hour as it is a senior software engineering rate and one of the members is still in high school (based on the profile website). That being said, I applaud the initiative to manage a stake pool after the end of the timeline, though the details around that are unclear too. The proposer has mitigated the risk of delivery delays, but the risk of developer-related concerns is not mentioned yet, such as what if the videos don\u2019t gain any traction or what if they are dissatisfied with the quality. Overall, I am unclear whether or not the implementation could be carried out smoothly. I do want to remind the proposer of something. If this proposal were to be funded, please make the tutorials with a clear narrative as if you\u2019re teaching them to a stranger. I\u2019ve watched one of the provided videos, and to me it feels like they are only explaining what the code does, not guiding you on how to create it from scratch or improve it.

There are a lot of metrics that could objectively quantify that. For example, the number of likes to views ratio, the number of comments, the number of average views per month, etc. As of now, the proposed KPIs around developer feedback are ambiguous.
