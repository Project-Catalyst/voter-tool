This opens up their health information system to developers who prefer to work with Rust. This is a useful addition it could bring new Rust developers to Cardano and give an existing developer who prefers to code in Rust, or has integration needs with other Rust a platform to get started quickly. The SDK is geared towards Hippocrades and therefore not reusable immediately for the rest of Cardano ecosystem, therefore the reach is limited to some extent. It would have been good to see the proposer extend the scope to cover other parts of Cardano for which it could be used. However, the relatively low budget of $7k makes the reduced scope justified. The proposal scales to the extent that more developers will come to work on the Hippocrades apps. Note: The proposer has a similar proposal to build a Java SDK which I have also assessed. This proposal is in its entirety the same to the Java SDK proposal with only minor differences in the name of the SDK. For this reason, the text of this assessment is very similar as well to my assessment of the Java SDK", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has provided the list of individuals that are needed to deliver the proposal but has not identified who those individuals will be. The proposed however has a track record of delivering other parts of the Hippocrades app and states that access to a pool of developers who he can pull to work on this proposal. It would have been nice to see who those individuals are to be able to assess their technical capabilities. The budget of $7k is outlined and split between the tasks of a project lead, a backend developer, a python developer, and a documentation lead. The budget monthly rates for each of the tasks are competitive (e.g., $3k for a senior backend developer). The project is planned to be delivered within 1 month and this is quite realistic given that the team already have a Javascript SDK. The language differences between Rust and Javascript are still quite large, as Rust is typed language and Javascript is not, so there is some work involved in defining the type for all the variables which can identify some bugs in the existing javascript implementation and lead to some delays beyond the 1 month that has been allocated in this proposal. I think the proposal will be able to deliver, but it would have been nice to see a little more detail on the planning and recognition of the delivery risks. The proposer highlights that there is minimal risk to delivery. I suggest the proposer elaborates a little more on how the porting of the Javascript to Rust will be done. I think the proposer will be able to deliver, but there are risks of a delay. Note: The proposer has a similar proposal to build a Java SDK which I have also assessed.

This is a key piece of infrastructure that could prove very important for the adoption of Cardano. This particular proposal is requesting funding to build an SDK to allow Rust developers to quickly deploy an app on top of their existing infrastructure without the need to learn a different programming language.\n\nBest part about it is that we don\u2019t have to hope that the team will have the skills to deliver on an SDK as they have already built one for JavaScript that\u2019s available today and linked in the proposal. The funding they are asking for in this proposal will go towards building the SDK for a new programming language, Rust (this proposal).\n\nThe team has 4 proposals in Fund 9 with the goal of building SDKs for developers working with languages to be able to deploy on their infrastructure with ease: Rust (this proposal), Java, Golang, Python.\n\nI understand and agree with the decision of the team to submit a different proposal for each programming language they intend to create an SDK for. This enables the community to choose and allocate funds to those it considers necessary, and also select one or a combination of multiple languages that are relevant and would be good investments for the treasury. This is not something that would have been possible in case of a single proposal that would have bundled all languages together.\n\nThe team has been very transparent about the fact that they have multiple proposals in Fund 9 all with the same objective, just for different programming languages, as they mention this fact in every one of the proposals. This should also help with discoverability by the voters, but my recommendation would be that if there will be a next time, they should consider including links from each proposal to all the others to help with navigation in case a voter or a community member wants to support multiple.\n\nThis set of proposals are clearly a very good fit for the Developer Ecosystem challenge because they directly answer the key guiding questions of the challenge: \u201cwhat are the tools that we need to prioritize first\u201d - those that will make the development process on Cardano the most seamless and effortless, and \u201chow do we attract developers from outside of our current community to participate in Catalyst?\u201d - by allowing them to build on Cardano in the language they are most comfortable with. By splitting up their plans for SDKs into multiple proposals and giving the community a chance to vote on exactly which ones they believe are the most relevant they also allow developers to directly answer the questions \u201cwhat do developers want, and how do they get it from the Cardano dev ecosystem?\u201d  Also the Hippocrades project as a whole very much addresses the last guiding question of the challenge \u201cwhat are enterprise dev managers looking for in order to be able to build out enterprise projects - either internal or commercial?\u201d, at least as it applies to dev managers connected to the medical industry.\n\nMy assessment of this set of proposals in the Developer Ecosystem challenge is based on my experience as a project manager working directly with Cardano developers since July 2021. I have participated in almost all roles in Project Catalyst since February 2021, including as a previously funded proposer, and I\u2019ve been involved with the Cardano development community and NFT community for about a year and a half.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team presents not only an impressive list of qualifications in the proposal but also a complete list of their already operational medical services infrastructure platform and a demo app. We don\u2019t have to envision what developers could build with the new SDKs in the languages they are comfortable with, we actually get to see it. After inspecting it I can say it looks impressive, it seems to cover all the needs of a health professional while also maintaining a modern clean look.\n\nThe implementation plan is logical and makes sense within the context of the overall project. It\u2019s for 5 weeks of development time and seems to cover all the necessary steps to successfully implement the SDK for Rust (this proposal). Each one of the 4 proposals in the set is estimated to take 5 weeks, meaning that in the case that all 4 proposals are funded, the total estimated completion time would be 20 weeks, given that the same team will be responsible for the execution of each SDK.\n\nAs this is a straightforward development project at an existing company, the budget breakdown only concerns itself with worker compensation for the month it is estimated that the development of the Rust SDK would take. The amounts seem very reasonable, low for Western standards but that shouldn\u2019t be a problem since the team has indicated that they are in Africa (they haven\u2019t directly specified this in the proposal, but since they are part of the Ariob Incubator / Iceaddis program I assume this is the case.)\n\nThe team members involved in the development of this particular part of the Hippocrades project are described in detail within the proposal, and the technical speciality of each is presented. They seem to collectively possess the skillset required to successfully deliver. However, because the proposal didn't link to any professional profiles (LinkedIn) or examples of previous work, I wasn't able to verify the claims around credentials and experience. But, even though they haven\u2019t provided links for each individual separately, they did provide a very ample description of their project overall (Hippocrades) and numerous links to multiple resources about the project and showcasing the project.\n\nAll these factors make me very confident in the Hippocrades\u2019 team's ability to deliver on the scope of this project if funded.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is very clear in what it wants to achieve and what are its intended deliverables. This alone should help a lot with the auditing process. A clear roadmap for the project is presented and from that, the delivery date can be easily extrapolated and verified. The team states it plans to use GitHub to record and monitor its activities and deliverables, which should further simplify the verification process as that is an almost universal tool used by most programmers in our developer community. \n\nGiven all this, I see this proposal (and this set of proposals) as being very easy to audit by any member of our community with the right technical skill set and knowledge of Rust (this proposal), Java, Golang or Python.\n\nNote on the proposal set and the assessments:\n\nI have verified the content of all 4 proposals using software that allows for snapshots of text and comparisons between snapshots (Scrivener). I did this to make sure the text of all proposals is the same before writing this assessment. They are indeed identical, only the name of the intended programming language differs between proposals. As such, I have assessed all 4 proposals as a set. Just as the text of the proposals, I have also changed the specific programming language in each one of my assessments and I\u2019ve written \u201c(this proposal),\u201d where this needed to be highlighted.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2169", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 5, "ng": 6, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2123, "q0": "Hippocrades, a decentralized healthcare infrastructure for web 3.0.

Once available, Rust developers can focus on building health apps without having to learn another language. This proposal meets the goal of the challenge, and it will benefit the Cardano ecosystem because the team has been building the Healthcare Infrastructure in Cardano, other developers will also encourage building their health apps in Cardano.

The requested budget of $7,500 is also allocated straight to the point, we understand what the money will be used for. And finally, the team, sure that the team set out to develop the project is quality, have been building healthcare solutions since 2016 and they also built Hippocrades. There are several projects the group has successfully done and all are provided with links so we can better understand their contributions. This project will be led by 3 members Dale, Joff, and Nad with the listed experience I fully believe they have the capacity to make this project a success.

I feel that the only real proof of success is the finished product. The team uses GitHub as a platform to track project progress. They should deliver better KPIs within the quantifiable deadline. The proposed team should also consider other forms of reporting, online meetings, or biweekly reports to keep the community informed that the project is on track.

The cool thing about that for the not tech savvy is that regular non-block chain developers would be able to create a blockchain healthcare app. Those apps have very specific requirements. Data privacy and compliance are two of the most relevant ones with different standards among other things. The SDK will greatly benefit the positive experience developers and that makes this proposal in line with the challenge settings.\nThere will be impact over the development ecosystem, although this sdk and language is quite specific and not everyone will be able to use it, but that's why it's valuable as well because it will bring these specific rust developers into the ecosystem. I like the plan for versioning the SDK in other languages as well. I already saw they had java and python among others. This methods will involve more devs from specific programming language communities and involve them in cardano by offering them a smooth transition.\nThis proposal will be able to scale with the future challenges and I'm can say, as developer, that a lot of people will be interested in using this project and possibly contributing to it and working with the proposers as well.

It's helps out non technical perople to understand the projects progress without too much hassle.\nI wasn't able to verfify the listed skills and people because only first names are given and no github or linkedin profiles which makes the verification process impossible for me which is not idea, but it's ballanced out by the fact the proposal has a whitepaper which not many proposals do.\nThe proposal does have a good budget breakdown, but I am a bit worried about the sdk progress timeline because I've worked on an SDK similar to this one, and it is no small feat. I like the fact, they have already built a javascript SDK, because the process to create a new sdk when you have another one already up and runnign even if it is in another language is a lot easier and would make the progress quicker.\nThe technologies and the skills necessary for each team member to have in oder to finish the development successfully.

From their website: \"Hippocrades provides a comprehensive decentralized healthcare infrastructure and protocol that unlock interoperability and security challenges among different health systems. This allows users - patients, health providers, and health facilities to manage and audit their medical records while making them shareable in a decentralized, private, and permissionless health exchange.\" \n\nThe team has several whitepapers, extensive documentation, both for the product, and for developers. At a glance, Hippocrades looks to be one of the best projects I've seen on Catalyst. It solves a great host of problems related to interoperability of healthcare systems. It is an original use case for blockchains. Suffice to say I love the project. Now onto the proposal.\n\nThe proposal is one of 4 very similar proposals in this fund. Each of the 4 proposals is to create an SDK for a different language: Python, Rust, Java, and Golang. The proposers have already created the first SDK on Javascript and now are working on these 4 languages. \n\nDeveloping an SDK that can be used by developers is entirely aligned with the challenge. That is, if the SDK has anything to do with a Cardano. There is no obvious connection between Hippocrades and Cardano. The proposers state: \"Since the team has been building the Healthcare Infrastructure in Cardano, other developers will be encouraged to build their health apps in Cardano as well.\" I wholeheartedly agree that if this project is being built on Cardano, other developers will build their health apps on Cardano as well, using Hippocrades. I'm just not sure Hippocrades is being built on Cardano. There is no mention of Cardano on their website, or on their whitepapers. \n\nI asked about this connection in their developer Discord server got this response: \"The Hippocrades Protocol (Hippr) talks about zero knowledge proofs being saved in blockchain. The health exchange is triggered by those proofs. The blockchain being used is Cardano.\". Since this is an amazing project being built on Cardano, there is some alignment between the project and challenge, yet not total alignment. The team makes almost no effort to market Cardano. It took me additional effort to even confirm how Cardano is being used. I don't believe this project will onboard many developers to Cardano.

It has no specifics as to the work, the featureset to be implemented in the SDK is not specified. I'll give the benefit of the doubt to the team here, I think they know exactly what they want to build, as they have already created a Javascript SDK, and they have a lot of work done already on Hippocrades. For the future though, I suggest giving some of this information on the proposal as well.\n\nA team member is knowledgeable on Rust so I have enough confidence they have the skills necessary to develop the SDK.

The javascript SDK also doesn't have documentation, so we don't know what features it has. As such, what features the SDK will have is entirely unclear. \n\nFrom where the progress of the project can be tracked is also not specified.

However, this is understandable, as long as it is separate from each other, using different programming languages. Like my reviews of other SDK recommendations, this rust SDK has a few problems. I think communication and marketing play an important role, it helps to increase the number of people reaching the project. Adding it to the roadmap was essential. In addition, the budget should be further clarified. Everyone needs to know how the $7500 is being used.

In my opinion, delaying SDK support is more cost-effective if they need to be synced again. It actually relies on whether or not the reward system will result in any fundamental changes.

To reduce the chance of delivery delays, the proposer should also add a buffer to their timeframe, especially in light of the potential for various subtleties between Javascript and Rust. The proposer could have have factored in this buffer time in their strategy or they might be certain that it won't take too long based on prior Javascript SDK.
