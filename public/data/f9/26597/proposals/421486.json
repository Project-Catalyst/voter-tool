The team behind this proposal has identified a great way of helping developers in the Cardano ecosystem \u2013 through the proposed development of an open-source instructional book that covers everything needed to master Plutus (and Cardano programming in general) \u2013 with no prerequisites \u2013 both in English and Spanish. The team might \u2013 if resubmitting this proposal in Fund 10 (if it does not gather sufficient votes in Fund 9) \u2013 think about renaming this proposal to \u201cAn open source book on Cardano programming\u201d \u2013 as \u201cAn open source book on Cardano\u201d. A suitable problem has been identified \u2013 the lack of resources for aspiring independent programmers who wish to delve into the Cardano languages and build, plus a nice focus on a bilingual solution is more than welcome. Spanish and English are great for the deliverables. The proposing team has clearly demonstrated how their planned project would add value to the Cardano ecosystem and the Developer Ecosystem challenge. Additional applause for going for an open-source publication concept that will be beneficial to everyone. Great that the team has already considered which type of license will be used \u2013 \u201cThe book will be open source under the MIT license.\u201d This aligns well with one of the challenge\u2019s proposed directions: \u201cKnowledge base & Documentation\u201d. What makes it (hopefully) more valuable is its intention to make it accessible to a broader audience as the team specified they will create content for readers with no background in mathematics or programming\u201d. However, I would advise the tam to make sure that they find a stellar writer \u2013 bridging the gap between a high-level subject matter and a low-skilled reader requires a fantastic author. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "My biggest concern when reading this proposal was quality. Will the proposing team be up to the challenge of delivering what is a frankly speaking a deliverable that is so dependent on quality? Of course, it is impossible to know whether it will be done, what can be done is we can ascertain at this stage whether the team has a credible plan and whether the team has the relevant competencies that would qualify them for this type of endeavour \u2013 to banalize - bringing Plutus to the masses. The team has provided a very convincing general outline of the book with a tentative breakdown of the chapters indicating that the proposal is based on a specific plan \u2013 not a general plan of the \u201cI want to write a book\u201d type. I personally have started learning Haskell on my own, so this seems like a very welcome addition \u2013 as I am in the target audience for a book of this type \u2013 as Haskell is a stepping stone for Plutus and Plutarch. The references to be used for the book are all laid out . The team has given an 8-month long plan of action with a plan for chapter completion in that period. The formats (HTML and PDF) have been specified. The budget has been broken down into the key components and they seem realistic. The author has teaching experience \u2013 which is critical. The author is Camilo Chac\u00f3n Sartori - a Ph.D. student in artificial intelligence at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (IIIA), in Barcelona, Spain. He has already authored a book that touches on the theoretical (lambda calculus) aspect of functional programming, among many other impressive references of his polymath abilities. Seems like a perfect fit. The other team members have also provided their references. One risk that has not been addressed is the risk that the author\u2019s Ph.D. studies (which are time consuming) will interfere with the project. If the project is resubmitted in Fund 10, it would be good to address this. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability seems straightforward thanks to what the team has provided. At the end of the first month the first & second chapter will be online on Github\u2026 same goes for the third chapter (end of third month), fourth chapter (fifth month) and the rest by the end of the eight month. Github commits will be a key indicator of writing progress, according to the proposers. What I am missing from this proposal, is the quality control, namely the editing and the editing advice. An author is usually too close to the subject matter to be able to realistically see some glaring mistakes. Yes, the budget does include a provision worth $28,000 for the main author for \u201cResearch, Writing & Editing of the Book\u201d \u2013 however, if the project is to be financed by Catalyst \u2013 the end result should be not only written well, but also verified for consistency, quality, readability and presentation/coherence. Hence, I am not completely sure that the solution (author is paid for both writing and editing) is good enough \u2013 for a project of this scope that effectively relies on quality of output (like any book). If it is my misunderstanding \u2013 then it is probably a good thing to clarify if this proposal is resubmitted in Fund 10. Even bestselling authors such as J.K. Rowling require editors who are independent and experienced. This proposal would probably need an independent editor \u2013 who would help to \u201caudit\u201d (edit) the final result (the book) before finalization and publication. Probably it would be done best, chapter by chapter \u2013 as the book is being delivered.

These are just some of the topics the book plans to cover and it will be targetin people who are not developers and have no prior knowledge.\nThis is a great idea, althought I don't think it's very feasible. I'll get to that in the feasibility section, because I want to focus on the possible impact here. A book that will teach you mathematics, functional programming and blockchain development will be trruly invaluable. The idea of making the book online with an MIT license is great, because all community memebers will be able to offer edits and knowledge on all different kinds of topics and chapters, which there are a lot of. I still don't know how a book will give you practical knowledge without excercises, because setting up the environment to start learning something has been an integral part of any programmers learning curve. That's the beauty of it infact because programming gives you the opportunity to learn by doing, unlike many other diciplines where that simply isn't possible like biology or quantum mechanics. There the entry level is much higher.A self contained book that covers all those topics seems unreasonable, especially if the authors don't want it to be outdated quickly.\nI did see mentioned possible challenges, but I didn't find any possible solutions to them, and considering there might be quite a lot of challenges, it would have been nice for the authors to include their plans for overcomming them. Overall if created this book will have an impact over the community for sure with the few caveats I've mentioned.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has provided their credentials and they all seem well educated and completely capable of writing a book. For that I have no doubt.\nI do have a couple of other doubts which I think I should share:\n1. As a software engineer, I can say with certainty that in order for this book to be usefull it's going to have to be at least 20k pages if not more. Let me explain. Each of the aforementioned topics has several books of their own, and these books do not cover introduction to programming and are actually targeting programmers mostly, part from the ones that explain only theory. The notion that one book will be able to teach you mathematics, programming and will give you practical knowledge in blockchain development and will be done in 8 months is practically impossible.\n2.Budget breakdown is not good enough. After reading the proposal I have a lot of questions regarding the actual creation and expectations of the book. There is no explanation on what exactly does project management of the book means and why it's 15 000 dollars. If the book will be published in 8 months doing releases every month, when will be the time to edit it?. A book and especially a textbook has an extremely rigorous editorial process that sometimes means reordering rewording, retrying or simply deleting chapters. I simply don't see the time for that to hapen. \n3. Considering all goes according to plan, the proposers have stated to do the work in 8 months. There is no specification on when those 8 months will be. Also considering they do both this and the e-learning platform (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/422099) projects, I don't see enough time in the day for both of them to be done in paralel if both get funded. So I'm really uncertain about both projects reaching completion if both get funded.\n4. There is a mention of the book not being outdated. While that might be true for a book about blockchain, this could never be true about Plutarch or marlowe. These are rapidly evolving. Another argument related to that statement is that I don't understand the reason behind sending a hardcopy to 50 ICT colleges around the world. I think it's a great idea to have them use the book, but why would you want to print an online book just to send it all over the world, considering 1. it could be used online, and there's no need for a hard copy. 2. The book will probably be updated several times untill it reaches some parts of the world where it were intended to. 3. If the universities wanted to, they could just print the book themselves and save the delivery fee.\nOverall, mainly for the aforementioned reasons I don't consider this project to be reasonable. My suggestion would be to focus on one topic and generate an online book for it and then perhaps move on to the next one. There are plenty of amazing books for blockchain and haskell and mathematics. A book about marlowe would have much greater value, because it's unknown territory, unlike most of the other topics. Another option is to translate books already created in english and have proven themselves over time in spanish, which would also be effort well spent. Especially if it becomes an online book providing royaltees to the authrors.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Having an online book will be great for auditability, because as the authors mentioned commits will be a proof of the work being done. There's a clear problem - we need more educated cardano developers with practical abilities. The solution could maybe use a bit more polishing, but the general idea to do a practical book / books seems a good one to me. The choice of the authors, doing MIT is amazing and doing the whole work online is a great step in the right direction as well. The metrics and KPIs are reasonable and would serve to check on the progress of this project.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2463", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 3, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thanks a lot for taking the time to review this proposal :)\n\n1)This is a book of fundamentals, of course it would be really hard to master each topic treated in each chapter, of course there are books about mathematics with over 700 pages, about functional programming and Haskell over 500 pages and others about blockchain with over 600 pages, but this book get inspiration from books like this one \n\nhttps://www.oreilly.com/library/view/computer-science-illuminated/9781284155648/ \n\nThis one in particular covers topics that are complex as binary systems and representation of the information,  programming languages, databases, operative systems, simulation, computer graphics, telecommunications network, computer security,  theory of computation, artificial intelligence, etc. As a summary: a Book of fundamentals  \n\nOur proposal\u2019s goal is to show the fundamentals to be a Cardano developer, as an example, types of maths are omitted that would not be as useful for our objective (for  example, calculus and linear algebra ); only some aspects of lambda calculus are shown (not everything); just some characteristics of Haskell that are relevant to learn Plutus (not all  characteristics of the language), etc.\n\nThen this book doesn't guarantee that the reader will become an expert in each topic, rather into someone who will have a solid base of fundamentals to build applications in the Cardano ecosystem, that in the future can go deeper on the journey of learning. This  book will contain a suggested reading books list. \n\n\n2) Edition is important. That\u2019s why it is an open source book,  it\u2019s hard for us to think that after eight months the book won't have further changes. it's a book that should be in constant changes, some chapters more than others.\n\nThe change in the order of the chapters (or even the elimination of them) it\u2019s a strange process, I have published in editorials and the first to be defined and get\u2019s to be validated is the book index (that\u2019s why we submitted at the proposal) before start writing it; the changes that usually happens are on the form that the content is presented, but not in the structure\n\nWe thought as mentioned in the project description that we are thinking about doing the edition process through a someone who had finish PPP (plutus pioneer program)\nalready have people in mind for this position, also The Latam Cardano Community will provide support with another peer. The idea is that they can work on the chapters as Camilo writes the following one.\nProject Management, thanks for pointing out the lack of information about this item on the budget. The management of the task  consists of taking care of KPIs of the project mentioned on the project description such as finding the individuals with the credentials for the task and the responsibility of taking care of the progress of the project as a whole and also doing the task of  research and  creating the network with the ICT colleges introducing Cardano to them through meetings where this book is presented, creating trust and relationships with the cardano ecosystem. \n\n\n\n3) The second proposal \u201cCardano e-Learning Platform\u201d is a bigger team of people, Camilo is just one of the members involved on it, and his labor, in case of both projects being funded by Catalyst voting, will never be as big as the task of writing this important book.\n\n\n4) The first chapters of the book could change little with time. And as well you mentioned at the end, when we talk about Plutus & Marlowe this chapters will see more changes, then it\u2019s when it\u2019s relevant that it is an open source book (MIT License) not a close one, because especially at these chapters we could see the community proposing changes.\n\n\nThat\u2019s why we write the book in 8 months, but there is not the end, as the same as an open source project life, it will continue if the community decides so.\n\n"}, {"id": 7428, "q0": "The project created a book of Plutus instructional resources in English and Spanish, giving developers more tools to perfect their products.

Blockchain technology and crypto are increasingly developing, especially in the last few years from 2017 to 2021 Bitcoin continuously set new price records. This promises a great future for all blockchain developers including the Cardano developers. According to a report by Evans Data Corporation, there are 26.9 million software developers worldwide in 2021. This shows that the current developer community is very large. But there is one problem that hinders the developers and all those who have no programming experience and want to learn to program on the Cardano platform, finding and accessing reputable, official resources is extremely difficult. Currently, there are not many professional documents specific to Haskell or Plutus on the Internet, if there are, it is very difficult to verify the quality of the materials, while the official reputable courses are very expensive. In addition, language is also a huge barrier for people who are not fluent in English like Spanish or any other countries that do not speak English fluently. Therefore, creating an open-source book on Cardano is a very good idea and meets the actual needs of people. According to the index of the book, the book has very clear and methodical content that helps people who have not had any programming experience to read and understand and become Cardano developers. The content goes from the core concepts of programming such as data types, reduction, and abstraction to logical algorithms and then an introduction and in-depth conceptual knowledge of blockchains such as consensus protocol, Smart contract, Staking & Testnet, etc. In addition, it is open-source, so everyone can contribute and edit the content so that it is most accurate and suitable for readers. This will have a very positive impact on the developer community not only in Spain but all over the world. The book is a reputable, methodical, accurate but highly effective miniature blockchain forum. Help everyone to learn and become a Cardano developer in the future.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is a hundred percent feasible. The proposed solution is completely workable and very suitable for the current situation when specialized resources for blockchain-specific such as Cardano are very limited and difficult to find. The members of the project team are listed very clearly and in detail with personal information, professional qualifications, experience with LinkedIn, and even personal interests and achievements of each member. All of them have many years of experience in technology, research, translation, writing, and publishing as well as working with many corporate organizations around the world. For example, Mr. Camilo with more than 23 thousand followers on Quora in Spanish, was Quora's \"Featured Spanish Writer\" for four consecutive years (2018-2021) for her 800+ replies on computer science and is the author of books like Computaci\u00f3n y programaci\u00f3n functional, Marco editorialmbo, Mentes geniales. La vida y obra de 12 grandes inform\u00e1ticos, Editorial Marcombo. The budget breakdown is well planned and provides sufficient clarity for each project activity and purpose. Especially, there is a section to donate books to 50 universities and colleges to help expand the project flexibly and meaningfully. With quality members with a lot of experience, good solutions, and reasonable capital allocation like this, I believe the project will be easily possible.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project can be easily outlined for the auditability.
