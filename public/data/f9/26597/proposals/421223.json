The proposers articulate that a platform for pitching catalyst proposals in a short format would attract new developers to show how the developers can get what they want from the Cardano ecosystem. I think the benefit of this proposal is largely that dev who build products want a quick way to communicate with their potential users and create a sense of community by being given an platform to defend their ideas. I think the proposal addresses the challenge, but the proposers should make a tighter argument for that in their proposal. The proposers plan to return for additional funding in future rounds if HeartBeat becomes valued by the community. The short nature of the presentations: 1min pitch and 2min questions make it scalable by replicating this into multiple rooms running in parallel, similar to how Ideafest works. I have pitched at Ideafest in the past and found the experience very rewarding. I think the alignment to the challenge goals needs to be tightened in the proposal text; however, it addresses the challenge setting of creating a sense of community for developers and encourages developers to pith proposals knowing that they will get a chance to present them.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Yes, the prosper are known members of the Carano community, and LinkedIn profiles are provided for each. The proposal is not technical; the proposers will not build new software; they will instead use an existing solution called Leancoffeetable.com to organize and keep track of time. The recordings will be uploaded to youtube for others to view afterward, with background information on each presentation. The proposers should check their math in the budget section. There seems to be some inconsistency in the budget numbers. In a video attached to this proposal, one of the proposers mentions a budget number that is roughly $2k smaller than what is written in the budget section. The math in the budget does not sum up to the total for organizing the event. Not a dramatic mistake, but would call out the attention to detail. The $500 per session budget is quite reasonable and includes hosting and secretariat work to register participants and upload videos. The proposers included a youtube video in their proposal with a demo of how the HeartBeat would run and the schedule for each event. This video validates that they have tested the format and take preparation seriously. The main risk highlighted is how to select the proposers for each round in an equitable manner but not provide any mitigating actions. I would suggest that the mitigating action could be to do it on a first-come, first-served basis and then replan to have more or longer sessions in future rounds. I agree that the team would be able to deliver on the proposal, and they have tested the format, and the budget is set competitively. I would personally go to one of their events and present my proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, anyone in the community can audit the deliverable by attending their Heartbeat events. The videos will be uploaded online, which can be verified. The KPI is the delivery of the sessions and the videos. Success is clearly articulated as having full sessions all the way through.

Having said that, the proposal itself has not managed to totally convince me it will work in the current Cardano and Catalyst environment, and that we would see enough engagement or participation for it to reach its potential, particularly as a tool intended for developers (it is in the Developer Ecosystem challenge after all).\n\nHowever, as I think this could bring something new to The Catalyst environment, and given the relatively low asking price to implement this project, it represents a relatively low-risk proposition for the Cardano treasury, so I agree that it's worth running the experiment and analysing the results after the initial HeartBeat episodes.\n\nI would have really liked to see more focus and more details in the proposal on how the organisers plan to promote the event itself, especially before the start of the podcast\u2019s first season.\n\nThe proposal successfully identifies the challenge questions that it could address however it doesn't provide any info on how it would address them.\n\nA pertinent risk to the project is identified, however, no solutions to address this risk are given in the proposal. This would definitely help voters better assess the planning that has gone into this project and I would recommend that the team include this info with their next submissions.\n \nMy assessment of this Developer Ecosystem submission is based on my experience as a project manager working directly with Cardano developers since July 2021.

However, no details are provided in the main feasibility section as requested by the proposal submission form.

The proposers clearly articulate that the information overload in the community makes it impossible to be aware of all the amazing projects going on, while also limit's proposers' abilities to reach out to the broader community to highlight their main issues. Listening to ten projects in ten minutes will certainly provide more exposure to these projects and also allow the broader community to engage with those projects that interest them. \n\nI am removing a mark here because the focus on developers appears somewhat tangential. Instead, the project is much broader and appears to focus on all projects across the community, that may or may not be developer related. To increase the score here I think the proposer could add in a small section about their desire to focus on builders specifically, or perhaps half the spots are earmarked specifically for developers? Something along these lines would certainly strengthen this section.

This is a true testament to their desire to get this project up and running. The team is also composed of some well known community members who fulfill numerous roles all across the ecosystem. Given this, there is a very high likelihood this would be implemented successfully. \n\nThe plan is well laid out and straightforward which makes it easy to know what the team hopes to achieve and how they plan to do it. The division of the podcast into the 1 minute stand ups followed by conversations initiated by the community, and then follow up actions by the participants. One thing I may have liked to see here is the broader vision in addition to the episodes themselves. For example, how will you do outreach and engage the proposers? How will follow up activities and connections be facilitated before and after the shows? While I don't feel these necessitate a reduction in score, their addition would make the proposal that much stronger. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. \n\nAs I've said elsewhere, any project that commits to being open source by default and using open source tooling such as gitbook/github should inspire confidence in  the broader community's ability to audit the proposal. \n\nAnother positive for auditing this project is that all of the recordings will be uploaded and made available for free for the community to listen to. This means that not only can the community audit the podcast itself, it may also lend itself to following up on the projects that presented, thereby assisting in indirect auditing of those projects. \n\nThe team also does an excellent job at listing tangible success measures so the community can see whether or not they actually delivered. If the proposers fill all 10 slots each episode, collect the resources from all presenters, and average 100 views per episode then the project will be deemed a success. This takes the guesswork out of it. \n\nCongrats on a great proposal and I wish you the best of luck in the voting stage. What do they say...?

It may have been better placed in the Dapps, Products & Integrations challenge setting, where although not specifically targeted at Catalyst-internal proposals, the usefulness to boost integrations and create new projects would have been obvious. To compete with tooling, SDKs, APIs and edu-tech proposals specifically targeting the incentives and productivity of our devs makes this proposal slightly less impactful when you compare it to the entirety of the submissions in its relevant funding category. I have no doubt that short, accessible pitches by projects to the community, organized by this experienced team will have a positive impact for Cardano.\nThe three rounds of the show format are a great idea, and should be brought to more events like this.

The budget could have been broken down a little bit more to show how the funds are divided between the proposers and who is responsible for which part of the implementation, but taking into account the good milestones and strong team, I do not consider this a negative.\nThe existing artwork and presentation in the sample clips could be \"slicker\" but this is not a necessary requirement for project success, especially as this is proposed for the Developer Ecosystem where function probably beats form.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The goals of this proposal do not seem very ambitious with only 100 views on average at the end of the entire project.

I think this could be a very useful (and entertaining) tool for the Cardano community because NOBODY can reasonably keep up with all the Catalyst proposals that exist out there. Based on the demo video, it looks like they\u2019ve got relatively decent production value and the guiding questions seem to help frame how this proposal might move forward to achieve success in securing these impacts. I think this section could benefit from greater quantification of the impact, perhaps with market research about engagement on this kind of format and difficulties with keeping up with all these different projects (or how many proposals get submieted each round.

The roadmap section isn\u2019t so much as a roadmap as it is a sentence that explains 16 episodes will be recorded once a week. I think there needs to be more steps taken to contact/communicate with Catalyst proposers, organize schedules, edit videos, advertise content, and workshop the format. The description of the format feels a little bit like filler content when placed in this roadmap portion. While the overall budget is much cheaper than most other proposals, this one does not breakdown the budget in a way that leaves voters with a clear understanding of efficiency of spending. It could be further defined why each episode will cost $500 and what the $1k Dework Community Organization category entails.
