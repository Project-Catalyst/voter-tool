Sometimes no matter how much of theoretical concepts you consume, it will never be the same as listening to someone who has had experience in the field. Hence, these videos would serve a huge purpose in instilling a sense of ownership and responsibility in the new developers and engineers who are building new products on the chain. The interactive live chat during the interview sessions will involve a sense of belonging to the viewers and would be happy to get their queries answered from the seniors in the field.

The choice of project to interview based on the public voting results of the community demonstrates decentralized of the proposal of great value impacting the video viewer. We can see that the implementation of the content selection of the given video is very rich belonging to the Cardano ecosystem. The interview includes: COMMUNITY, DATA, DEFI, EDUCATION, EXCHANGE (DEX), GAMEING, GAMING, IDENTITY/KYC, INFRASTRUCTURE, LAUNCHPAD, LENDING, MARKETPLACES, MEME COINS, METAVERSE, NFT, ORACLE, PAYMENT, POOL, STABLECOIN AND WALLETS.

The solution is popular, conveying understandable content through interviews in line with the challenge set out. The author has identified the challenges and risks of implementation, solving the challenge has been given by understandable interviews that can convey information to anyone.

In addition, the video is also published on the social networking site and the project page of the Cardano ecosystem will attract many viewers.

The proposal has raised a problem that is attracting quite a lot of people, that is: \"People find it difficult to understand the potential of projects by reading whitepapers and websites, with unfriendly technical terms used. The terms used are very technical and not easy to access\u201d. It can be seen that this proposal has identified that technical language is a barrier for people to learning about the Cardano community. Conducting 100 face-to-face interviews with TOP projects on Cardano Blockchain which are all projects that get many votes in each community vote, can show the quality of the proposal. Moreover, interviews will be broadcast on the Youtube channel and published on social networks, and videos will also be published on project pages on the Cardano ecosystem. I think this suggestion is very good and useful for those who do not know anything about Cardano or do not understand this ecosystem. The solution proposed by the proponent has identified most of the problems of the challenge, and reasonable arguments and evidence help to demonstrate the impact of the problem. To successfully implement the project, the proponent also foresees risks, of which the main risk is to make the team of project founders talk in a user-friendly way and avoid using too much technical jargon that is confusing. This difficulty has been effectively solved by the group through specific measures. I believe that proactively responding to difficulties will increase the success of the project.  However, interviews only meet the demand in terms of providing and exchanging information and data. I think this will not be enough to attract the interest of the community.

However, they have not given a start date of implementation, and have not clearly stated the main tasks and tasks to be completed in each of those milestones. Instead of a general timeline of 2-6 months, the proponent should develop a plan for each month, what results should be achieved each month, and who will be responsible for controlling the progress and output quality. Regarding the budget, the proponent also presented quite clearly and in detail how to allocate as well as the purpose of using that budget. However, in this part, in my opinion, the proponent should also clearly divide the budget to be used in each period, each timeline corresponding to the implementation roadmap is 1 month and 2-6 months or can be more detailed according to the plan monthly. In this way, the team can control this stage of ineffective or ineffective use of capital. In addition, this part of the budget has been presented in the form of a list, I have a question here the specific budget for each piece of work will be divided equally or will be paid according to efficiency and productivity for each individual, for example, Editor and presenter = $1,900 x 5 months = $9,500. So the cost will be divided equally 50/50 or will be divided according to another competitive rate to encourage creativity as well as enthusiasm in work. About the project participants, the proponent provided information of 5 members, who are experienced and active in many fields such as Founder & CEO at Cardano Feed, Co-Founder of Cardanista Stakepool, Full stack and software engineer, Crypto journalist & content editor, Marketing Assistant.
