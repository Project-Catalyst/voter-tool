The proposal aligns with the challenge setting of creating an awesome experience for Developers and bringing new developers to Cardano; however I am slightly surprised that no mention is made of the existing back and wallet services on Cardano. The wallet will be integrated into the Unity game engine thus creating a starting point for other game developers on Cardano.  The proposal is scalable as it will be released as open-source and any developer can use it in the future.  As a developer myself I find that a wallet integration into a platform is one of the key steps in delivering a quality and functioning product. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The delivery of projects will be led by Andy who's the CEO of Universal Studios that has more than eight years of game development experience in South Korea.  A link to his facebook account is provided in one of the attached documents. The requested budget is $26,000 and the budget is not broken down into identifiable items. An Excel sheet that is attached to the proposal called \u201cdetailed budget\u201d is the budget for the overall Miverse game and it was not possible for me to find a breakdown of the budget just for building the wallet.  The Proposal also attached a print screen that is too small to read and which supposedly has the breakdown of the wallets budget. Furthermore the proposal states that the rate of a paid developer is $3,000 per month which is a competitive rate for blockchain development and is well below the rates of other proposals that I have reviewed.  The proposer's planning, in general, is good and he has a detailed breakdown of tasks for delivery of the Miverse game; however, I did not see a detailed plan for implementation of the wallet. In the attached excels, there is mention of different wallet integrations, and one of them is the Trust Wallet; another one is Wallet Connect. I also wasn't able to find an implementation timeline however judging from the budget and the monthly rate, it works out to just under 10 months to deliver the project which sounds reasonable for a wallet integration given that there is a cardno-wallet backend service that IOG provides. The proposal mentions that the wallet will be implemented in the Unity game platform but does not discuss the language or the technical aspects. The proposer suggests that they don't have any technical risks or challenges with the proposal. I find it difficult to believe. Overall I think the proposed is technically capable but not enough detail is provided to judge whether implementation can be successful or not.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A road map with milestones and time horizons for the wallet is not provided; however there is a general plan for the Miverse game of which the wallet is part. The Proposal will track the number of minted CNFTs, the number of GitHub repos, and number of developers that go to Miverse. The definition of success is that it makes gamers quit less because of purchasing.  the success statements is worded ambiguously and is aimed at the Miverse game rather than the wallet itself. The proposal has generally done well in communication and putting information online for the public.  I, therefore, think the proposal is auditable, but with some difficulties because of the lack of tractable metrics for the wallet implementation.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2123", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 4, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1420, "q0": "There is a big need for more developers working on tooling for the Game developers who want to use Cardano as their blockchain. With gaming being a high net new user growth opportunity this certainly has a high impact potential. \n\nIntegrating wallets directly within Unity as an open source tool is highly anticipated and needed. Even if Blockfrost is working on a similar integration, competition and different approaches should be encouraged.\n\nSome notes for the Proposer and General ADA Voter to consider in regards to the impact of this proposal: The title of this proposal outlines a clear use case but upon reading more of the proposal there is much more added in that doesn\u2019t align with the Challenge criteria. I would encourage the proposer to focus on the Wallet Integration. With what seems to be a majority of the time/scope for deliverables to be CNFT projects for their own game(?) as part of this proposal I have to give this a 3/5 ranking. I believe the focus as outlined in the problem, challenge solution, and execution should be refined in the future.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "With the scope of what is outlined, this team has a lot of work ahead of them. Considering they have a large team of what seems to be experienced game developers, manager, and staff from Vietnam it\u2019s likely the cost associated for the work to be done is possible. It\u2019s worth noting that Andy Nguyen - CEO of Unicorn Studio is not the same Andy Nguyen that is well known in the BAYC and his work in the Ethereum space. \n\nWith a level of experience outlined, it seems more likely than not that this team could deliver an open sourced wallet solution for Unity. For this reason I give this a 4/5 ranking.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The use of a lot of external links is helpful, but woefully overwhelming for a voter - having reviewed (most) links, it seems that this is a carve out of the overall Miverse, and isn\u2019t as specific to addressing the actual proposed problem/solution.\n\nI found the budget to be hard to tie into the impact and deliverables with the Open Source Wallet Connector + the CNFTs listed in their impact section. While they do have a clear graphic noting man-month costs, there is little transparency on what is being built specifically. This tied to the extra tasks listed in the Impact section lead me to give this a 2/5 ranking as I cannot determine what is being spent on the actual problem statement.

Further the deliverables include 8 line items out of which  of 7 are about CNFTs specific to the game being developed by the team whereas just 1 item is the open source wallet add-on.

While the proposal provides various links related to the Miverse metaverse game, there is not any easily accessible information that explains what the value proposition is of Miverse. Some voters may react positively simply because there are previously funded proposals related to this project but this proposal will not do it for those that require greater justification/proof for why every individual proposal has something of value to provide. In order to provide that for this proposal, the uniqueness/value proposition of the Miverse game needs to be reiterated for context, to make voters care about the problem statement for this proposal. Once that foundation has been established, voters can then weigh the solvency of the problem statement against the cost of the proposal in a cost-benefit analysis. To enable that more easily, the proposal needs to provide some kind of data on how many people this might impact, modeling evidence on the benefits of this kind of solution, and any other quantifying factors that give voters a sense of the magnitude of the given impacts. Voters are more likely to respond positively if these impacts appeal to the benefit to the greater Cardano ecosystem through adoption, innovation, or integration with the real-world.

We do get a promising professional description of the CEO of Unicorn studio but we are not provided with a LinkedIn source or any other information about other members of the team. This leaves me moderately optimistic but uncertain. I think credit does need to be extended for the tremendous detail of the given roadmap (though the roman numerals are a bit odd). The roadmap tells me that there is a clear technical understanding and direction for the steps that need to be taken to accomplish this project overall. The budget is confusing. As much as I appreciate the attempt to explain the system, it\u2019s still rather difficult to objectively measure spending efficiency as I (and the voters) am used to doing.
