This opens up their health information system to developers who prefer to work with Golang (GO). This is a useful addition it could bring new Golang developers to Cardano and give an existing developer who prefers to code in Golang, or has integration needs with other Golang a platform to get started quickly. The SDK is geared towards Hippocrades and therefore not reusable immediately for the rest of Cardano ecosystem, therefore the reach is limited to some extent. It would have been good to see the proposer extend the scope to cover other parts of Cardano for which it could be used. However, the relatively low budget of $7k makes the reduced scope justified. The proposal scales to the extent that more developers will come to work on the Hippocrades apps. Note: The proposer has a similar proposal to build a Java SDK which I have also assessed. This proposal is in its entirety the same to the Java SDK proposal with only minor differences in the name of the SDK. For this reason, the text of this assessment is very similar as well to my assessment of the Java SDK", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has provided the list of individuals that are needed to deliver the proposal but has not identified who those individuals will be. The proposed however has a track record of delivering other parts of the Hippocrades app and states that access to a pool of developers who he can pull to work on this proposal. It would have been nice to see who those individuals are to be able to assess their technical capabilities. The budget of $7k is outlined and split between the tasks of a project lead, a backend developer, a python developer, and a documentation lead. The budget monthly rates for each of the tasks are competitive (e.g., $3k for a senior backend developer). The project is planned to be delivered within 1 month and this is quite realistic given that the team already have a Javascript SDK. The language differences between Golang and Javascript are still quite large, as Golang is typed language and Javascript is not, so there is some work involved in defining the type for all the variables which can identify some bugs in the existing javascript implementation and lead to some delays beyond the 1 month that has been allocated in this proposal. I think the proposal will be able to deliver, but it would have been nice to see a little more detail on the planning and recognition of the delivery risks. The proposer highlights that there is minimal risk to delivery. I suggest the proposer elaborates a little more on how the porting of the Javascript to Golang will be done. I think the proposer will be able to deliver, but there are risks of a delay. Note: The proposer has a similar proposal to build a Java SDK which I have also assessed. This proposal is in its entirety the same to the Java SDK proposal with only minor differences in the name of the SDK.

The project is quite short in terms of time, so it is unlikely that there will be intermediate steps to monitor progress. The proposer commits to pushing the development of the SDK for the community to monitor. The success is stated as the delivery of the SDK which is in with what the proposal set outs to deliver.

This is a key piece of infrastructure that could prove very important for the adoption of Cardano. This particular proposal is requesting funding to build an SDK to allow Golang developers to quickly deploy an app on top of their existing infrastructure without the need to learn a different programming language.\n\nThe best part about it is that we don\u2019t have to hope that the team will have the skills to deliver on an SDK as they have already built one for JavaScript that\u2019s available today and linked in the proposal. The funding they are asking for in this proposal will go towards building the SDK for a new programming language, Golang (this proposal).\n\nThe team has 4 proposals in Fund 9 with the goal of building SDKs for developers working with languages to be able to deploy on their infrastructure with ease: Golang (this proposal), Java, Rust, and Python.\n\nI understand and agree with the decision of the team to submit a different proposal for each programming language they intend to create an SDK for. This enables the community to choose and allocate funds to those it considers necessary, and also select one or a combination of multiple languages that are relevant and would be good investments for the treasury. This is not something that would have been possible in case of a single proposal that would have bundled all languages together.\n\nThe team has been very transparent about the fact that they have multiple proposals in Fund 9 all with the same objective, just for different programming languages, as they mention this fact in every one of the proposals. This should also help with discoverability by the voters, but my recommendation would be that if there will be a next time, they should consider including links from each proposal to all the others to help with navigation in case a voter or a community member wants to support multiple.\n\nThis set of proposals is clearly a very good fit for the Developer Ecosystem challenge because they directly answer the key guiding questions of the challenge: \u201cwhat are the tools that we need to prioritize first\u201d - those that will make the development process on Cardano the most seamless and effortless, and \u201chow do we attract developers from outside of our current community to participate in Catalyst?\u201d - by allowing them to build on Cardano in the language they are most comfortable with. By splitting up their plans for SDKs into multiple proposals and giving the community a chance to vote on exactly which ones they believe are the most relevant they also allow developers to directly answer the questions \u201cwhat do developers want, and how do they get it from the Cardano dev ecosystem?\u201d  Also, the Hippocrades project as a whole very much addresses the last guiding question of the challenge \u201cwhat are enterprise dev managers looking for in order to be able to build out enterprise projects - either internal or commercial?\u201d, at least as it applies to dev managers connected to the medical industry.\n\nMy assessment of this set of proposals in the Developer Ecosystem challenge is based on my experience as a project manager working directly with Cardano developers since July 2021. I have participated in almost all roles in Project Catalyst since February 2021, including as a previously funded proposer, and I\u2019ve been involved with the Cardano development community and NFT community for about a year and a half.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team presents not only an impressive list of qualifications in the proposal but also a complete list of their already operational medical services infrastructure platform and a demo app. We don\u2019t have to envision what developers could build with the new SDKs in the languages they are comfortable with, we actually get to see it. After inspecting it I can say it looks impressive, it seems to cover all the needs of a health professional while also maintaining a modern clean look.\n\nThe implementation plan is logical and makes sense within the context of the overall project. It\u2019s for 5 weeks of development time and seems to cover all the necessary steps to successfully implement the SDK for Golang (this proposal). Each one of the 4 proposals in the set is estimated to take 5 weeks, meaning that in the case that all 4 proposals are funded, the total estimated completion time would be 20 weeks, given that the same team will be responsible for the execution of each SDK.\n\nAs this is a straightforward development project at an existing company, the budget breakdown only concerns itself with worker compensation for the month it is estimated that the development of the Golang SDK would take. The amounts seem very reasonable, low for Western standards but that shouldn\u2019t be a problem since the team has indicated that they are in Africa (they haven\u2019t directly specified this in the proposal, but since they are part of the Ariob Incubator / Iceaddis program I assume this is the case.)\n\nThe team members involved in the development of this particular part of the Hippocrades project are described in detail within the proposal, and the technical speciality of each is presented. They seem to collectively possess the skillset required to successfully deliver. However, because the proposal didn't link to any professional profiles (LinkedIn) or examples of previous work, I wasn't able to verify the claims around credentials and experience. But, even though they haven\u2019t provided links for each individual separately, they did provide a very ample description of their project overall (Hippocrades) and numerous links to multiple resources about the project and showcasing the project.\n\nAll these factors make me very confident in the Hippocrades\u2019 team's ability to deliver on the scope of this project if funded.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is very clear in what it wants to achieve and what are its intended deliverables. This alone should help a lot with the auditing process. A clear roadmap for the project is presented and from that, the delivery date can be easily extrapolated and verified. The team states it plans to use GitHub to record and monitor its activities and deliverables, which should further simplify the verification process as that is an almost universal tool used by most programmers in our developer community. \n\nGiven all this, I see this proposal (and this set of proposals) as being very easy to audit by any member of our community with the right technical skill set and knowledge of Golang (this proposal), Java, Rust or Python.\n\nNote on the proposal set and the assessments:\n\nI have verified the content of all 4 proposals using software that allows for snapshots of text and comparisons between snapshots (Scrivener). I did this to make sure the text of all proposals is the same before writing this assessment. They are indeed identical, only the name of the intended programming language differs between proposals. As such, I have assessed all 4 proposals as a set. Just as the text of the proposals, I have also changed the specific programming language in each one of my assessments and I\u2019ve written \u201c(this proposal),\u201d where this needed to be highlighted.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2169", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 5, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3338, "q0": "This proposal wants to create an SDK to cater to Golang developers to build Health App, and has already built a health infrastructure with APIs.

The aim is to attract Go developers and facilitate their ability to build their own health apps without having to learn new programming languages. It aligns with the challenge settings and, if implemented, would ultimately add value to the Cardano ecosystem because, in theory, more health apps are going to be developed. However, I am a bit concerned about whether the Golang SDK support is premature or not. Looking at their roadmap on hippocrades.org, we can see that many SDKs are on the way before the reward system. I think it's more cost-efficient to delay the SDK support if they have to be re-updated again. It really depends on whether or not there will be any breaking changes after they implement the reward system. I hope the proposer could clarify more on this matter. Other than that, I strongly agree with the proposal contribution and am personally excited to see more healthcare usecases in Cardano. This proposal acts as a stepping stone as it makes development easier.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I am inclined to agree that the proposed plan would ensure smooth implementation. The proposers are the ones who developed the Hippocrades infrastructure, and they are the ones who understand the most how their modules and architecture work.

The budget is broken down into items based on the amount of resources needed and the amount is reasonable. I applaud the proposer's initiative to emphasize QA and documentation too, since it supplements the aim of supporting new developers. However, since the proposer has proposed four different SDK support in this fund, I would like to see an explicit explanation of how they would manage all the projects simultaneously if they were all funded. Another improvement that would help the proposer is to add a buffer to their timeline to mitigate the risk of delivery delays, especially considering there might be different nuances within Javascript and Golang. Perhaps the proposer has already added this buffer time within their plan or, based on previous Javascript SDK, they are confident that it won\u2019t take too much time. Finally, I am confused about the Python developer budget item. Why is it Python? Is it a typo and the proposer meant Go? Is Python the language Hippocrades is written in? A quick clarification about this would be helpful as well.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer has provided enough information for us to audit.

This challenge seeks to develop tools for Developers to create apps on the cardano network. This team has developed the Hippocrates health  application framework on cardano.

This is a really powerful and useful tool to expand the user base of cardano. I would like to see this framework become widely adopted with dozens to hundreds of new applications on it for the next couple years.

In this challenge the goal is to make it easier to onboard new developers, make it easier for developers to develop, increase developer productivity, attract high-caliber developers, and developers given ample resources to work on platforms that suit their interests.\n\nThe proposer is proposing to add a Golang SDK to Build Health App on top of Hippocrades, a healthcare infrastructure that is already built. Currently they have a SDK for JavaScript, and want to create an software development kit (SDK) for the Go language. The go language is quickly becoming one of the most popular languages out there and the impact this would have could be very big for Cardano. \n\nThe medical industry is massive and in and of itself can bring big growth to Cardano usage, and Hippocrades has already built infrastructure for the medical industry on the Cardano blockchain.  However, what good is this protocol if there are no or little developers to work on applications to run on this secure/zero knowledge protocol? So the idea is to create SDK for various highly used and popular programming languages so more developers can easily create apps to run on the protocol. This has the ability to bring in new developers outside of the Cardano ecosystem into our ecosystem, as well as enable current developers on the Cardano blockchain that were not previously able to help build apps out to now be able to if they know this language. This would make it easier on developers as well as enable more developers to create applications on top of a protocol that is operating in extremely large industry.
