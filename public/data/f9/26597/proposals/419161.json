If successfully implemented the Wallet OneBox has the potential to greatly speed up the process that a developer of a wallet-like tool would need to go through.\n\nThis assessment is made on the basis of my previous experience as a mobile app development studio manager. I have also been involved with the Cardano developer community since March 2021 and I have been actively working with Cardano developers since the summer of 2021.\n\nThere\u2019s only one area that I\u2019m a little concerned about, that might affect the potential impact of what is being proposed, (this is reflected in my rating of 4 for Impact).\nIt\u2019s the fact that Flint, the project from DC Spark that is already using the components that they wish to deploy in this OneBox solution, is sometimes very slow and buggy. I\u2019m not entirely sure what has caused this experience for me as a user, as I have not done debugging on the product, but the wallet has been constantly slower than the multiple other Cardano community wallets I have used and crashes have been pretty frequent. \nThis may be cause for concern if we encourage the Cardano developer community to base their tools on a tech stack that is not fully optimised yet.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "While this project has the potential to have a great impact on the speed with which developers building wallet-like products for our blockchain can deploy their solution, as a proposal, there is very little information given by the team to address the feasibility and auditability questions.\n\nThe role of a proposal assessor in Catalyst calls for looking at the proposal in isolation and considering what is presented in the text and in the attachments. The fact is that the proposal as it is now doesn\u2019t meet even the most basic requirements of what a Catalyst proposal should be. It lacks a proper implementation plan, the budget is not broken down at all, and the exact team that DC Spark anticipates will be working on this particular project is also not described. One element that would have assisted the Catalyst and Cardano community assess the investments we are all making into DC Spark via the treasury and Catalyst would have been an hourly rate and an estimated number of hours the project development might take. In that way, it would have been plain for everyone to see that the funds allocated are not being mismanaged.\n\nThe team has also answered \u201cYes\u201d on both of the workload questions that have been introduced in Fund 9. Despite this, the proposal doesn\u2019t give any details on how the company team will manage all the workload that they have currently committed to through the Catalyst process. A simple inspection of the data available on https://www.lidonation.com/en/project-catalyst/group/dcspark reveals that the team is already working on 37 proposals that have been funded by Catalyst and currently has 15 proposals in Fund 9.\n\nThe information posted by DC Spark on their social media accounts seems to indicate that they have sized up the company to more than 40 employees, yet this is not mentioned in the proposal. Even knowing this, it\u2019s still hard for me to visualise how the company plans to manage the large number of projects it has taken on without a clear presentation of this in the proposal.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Considering the otherwise great work that the DC Spark team is doing in the Cardano ecosystem I would have liked to be able to grade every aspect of this proposal high. However, the auditability section is missing the information required to properly explain how the team will make the process of verifying the progress of the proposed project easy and transparent. There aren\u2019t any KPIs mentioned in the proposal, the definitions of success are barely described and there aren\u2019t any plans presented in the proposal for a more detailed accounting of the development of the project. My rating was given taking into account what\u2019s present in the proposal.\n\nGiven that the team has a vast experience with the Catalyst process, the company has participated from almost the beginning, since Fund 2, it is obvious that they have not taken seriously the task of writing this proposal, otherwise, I\u2019m sure they would have known exactly what to include and would have been capable of writing a complete and compelling proposal. \n\nIt can be argued that the DC Spark team is too busy building and deploying tools and products to worry about the Catalyst process. And indeed why would they, since almost all of the proposals that they have submitted to date have been funded, and as of now they represent the largest recipient of Catalyst funds (data: https://www.lidonation.com/en/project-catalyst/groups ). But, I\u2019m a bit worried that if the Cardano community continues to vote for the DC Spark proposals regardless of their quality or presentation we will end up creating a two-tiered system that will very closely resemble nepotism and corruption even if at its core it may be well-intentioned.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2169", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 7, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2081, "q0": "Unfortunately, the proposal is poorly explained, the proponent only gives us a general idea of \u200b\u200bhis project, without the necessary details so that we can understand what he is saying. How the proposal will be implemented and what impact will this have on the Cardano Ecosystem. The stated problem of this proposal is that currently if we want to implement our lightweight wallet or similar application, there is no single tool that can be used. Instead, we have to figure out how to implement and combine multiple tools. The solution was to provide a \"OneBox of Cardano Wallet\". A single deployable image will set up all the indexes and downstream engines needed to support all the endpoints needed to run the wallet. I believe this proposal aligns very intelligently with the goals of the challenge. However, the problem here is that although the solution description is suitable for the challenge, the concept of the proposal is reasonable, but the absence of a blueprint greatly affects the testability of the proposal. So, even though the idea is good and can be successfully implemented, we cannot know how it will be implemented. In my view, this proposal is more like an idea than a complete proposal, because all the details it provides are of little value, so I think the proponent should return to fund 10 with a more well-presented proposal.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "No team information has been released.

We will need to know each team member, name, role, relationship to Cardano Blockchain, etc. The more detailed the better, unfortunately, we don't have any details here. The proponent did not provide any roadmap to follow, so it is impossible to understand what steps would have to be completed to complete the project. It just says that they plan to deliver this OneBox solution in Q3. However, this doesn't tell us what will be done, what will happen next, and how long it will take until everything is ready. This proposal did not provide enough information to help audit the progress of the plan, was very sketchy, contained only one line, and did not include information on the roadmap, timelines, or timelines to be achieved. desired results.\nThe budget division is also not justified. The proposal asks for $45,000 for the project and states that all these funds will be used for project development costs, without any details to break the budget, which will certainly not be added. co-accepted because it cannot be audited.

With that said, this proposal would benefit from having a roadmap with milestones on an estimated timeframe. This way it can be tested transparently and the community will be able to track progress during development. I wanted this proposal to provide KPIs so that the community could easily check the progress of the project, as well as the detailed allocated budget. In this proposal, no detailed experience of the proponent was given, lacking all basic proposal components such as roadmap, detailed scope, metrics, budget, etc. For the reasons just described, I strongly disagree that this recommendation provides me with sufficient information about my ability to measure progress in achieving the stated goals.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_2299", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 3, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2613, "q0": "When a user chooses to use one of the following light wallets available in the market: Yoroi, Nami, Eternl, Gero, Typhon, etc., they must trust the server of that lightweight wallet issuer.

This is a proposal aimed at users who are project developers on Cardano so that developers can allocate more resources to develop projects faster, and the Cardano ecosystem is more and more expanded. This proposal to complete it also attracts developers in other ecosystems, as they notice that Cardano has more and more protocols & tools to help develop projects quickly. I consider the Cardano Wallet OneBox solution to play an essential role in the development of the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponent offers a proposed solution by creating a single image to set up and run the necessary wallet tools such as Carp, Blockfrost, Ogmios, Token info service, Price feed service, Cardano-nodes. All these necessary services will be launched, synchronized, and managed by the Cardano Wallet OneBox. Personnel to implement this proposal have experience building Flint wallet and Yoroi wallet. So, with only 1 or 2 employees in charge of this proposal, I still consider the ability to complete the job completely within their ability. However, the proponent did not divide the detailed budget for each work item. Although the completion time of the proposal has been determined, it is still vague and not specific. This proposal uses many advanced tools & protocols of the Cardano ecosystem; Now, these tools & protocols have been launched on the mainnet by dcSpark so that this proposal will be completed on time. The scalability of this solution by creating multiple Cardano Wallet OneBox will meet the capacity when used by a large number of developers. I appreciate this potential. However, this proposal still carries the risk of users having to spend time learning how to set up a wallet. So this proposal is not a solution for individual users; it is only suitable for professionals suitable for other project developers. This Cardano Wallet OneBox also has another weakness: sync time depends on the Cardano-node's sync time; this weakness the proponent has no way to solve.

However, this is not uncommon for a first iteration and in my opinion there\u2019s nothing wrong with starting with a less use friendly development solution (after all, most blockchain tools are like this to begin with).\nI fully agree that this proposal effectively addresses the Developer Ecosystem challenge.
