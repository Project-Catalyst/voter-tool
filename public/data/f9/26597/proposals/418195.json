Normally I would be sceptical about such a proposition, but after watching the videos already produced by the proposer I have to agree that these would add a lot of value to the ecosystem. His previous work demonstrates that he is capable of producing concise and very informative videos in an appealing and quite charismatic way. I've seen a lot of educational content about Cardano floating around YouTube, but I have to say that so far none that I've come across has been so engaging. I also really appreciated the fact that throughout the proposal the proposer has been candid about his own mastery of the domain and his intention to learn along the way, taking the approach that \"the best way to learn something is to teach others\". This can bring a very fresh approach to the topics he intends to cover.\n\nThe proposal itself is very well structured and written, serving as proof of the quality of the content we can expect the project to deliver.\n\nThat is what can be said about the planned productions themselves but another area of interest, with very promising potential, is the topic of the productions: token engineering and the creation of novel incentive models. This has the potential to greatly benefit the community of Cardano builders and set the decentralised applications our blockchain offers apart. It is this part that makes the proposal a great fit for the Developer Ecosystem challenge.\n\nWithout giving away too much about myself I can say that I have extensive film/video production experience and I\u2019m also basing my assessment of this proposal on my background as a project manager collaborating directly with Cardano developers since July 2021. I\u2019ve also been involved in Project Catalyst, in almost all roles, since February 2021 and working with the Cardano development and NFT communities started almost a year and a half ago.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The production plan for the video tutorials is logically structured and offers a great overview of what we can expect from the videos thematically. The lessons are to be broken down into five modules that will run over the course of 3 months, according to the presented production schedule. Unfortunately, the proposal seems to contain the description for Module 2 twice, instead of Module 3, however, I won't be lowering my score for this as it appears to be a simple copy/paste error.\n\nThe budget seems reasonable for the task, but, I will say that I would have preferred to see a breakdown based on tasks that need to be accomplished instead of by Modules. That would have painted a much clearer picture of intended cashflows and would have allowed the community to better judge what it is we are funding. Perhaps that could have been topped off with an hourly rate estimation for each task, instead of the \u201cnormalised hourly rate of USD$70\u201d the proposal currently contains.\n\nThe background of the proposer and main implementer is adequately presented, and given his experience and training, there is a high likelihood that the project will be successfully delivered. However, the implementation plan and budget of the proposal seem to suggest that additional people will need to be hired to complete the work. But, no mention of this fact is made in the text of the proposal. For example, the description of the project mentions the fact that the videos will contain high production values including animations, yet the proposal doesn\u2019t mention who will work on these animations and doesn't provide any examples as reference. This is not a big omission, nonetheless, I would have liked to see these details included. My recommendation would be to include such details in the future or to specifically mention that the proposer will do everything alone and is capable of delivering on all aspects required for the implementation of the proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Given that the deliverables of this proposal will be public YouTube videos and a dedicated website, they will be by their nature highly auditable. In addition to these, the proposer also intends to release the code produced for the tutorials as open source. GitHub interactions with this code are given as another KPI for the project, which makes perfect sense.\n\nThe definitions of success described for the project are well presented, and again make the case for why this proposal could be so relevant.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2169", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 7, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "An excellent review with some very valid criticisms on budget and plan. Some of the criticism highlighted were considered but dropped from the proposal to aid readability. And yes module 2 was accidentally copy/pasted twice. I was alerted to the error only after proposals where locked so posted the correct version in the comments."}, {"id": 4951, "q0": "The proposal aims to produce token engineering tutorials in the form of videos, code, and writing. Token engineering is a new, cross-disciplinary academic field that is just beginning to find its footing. I am very interested in the area and am working to learn more about the subject. Currently, the hub for this in the crypto space is the Token Engineering Community. They produce lots of content on the topic, including books, guides, and courses. The proposers is well aware of the current ecosystem and has cited all the major resources to be used in the proposal, and one resource that was entirely new to me, so kudos to him. This shows me he knows what he's talking about, has a good idea of what the problem space is, and a good solution in mind.\n\nThe output of the proposal will be comprehensive: short video tutorials with animations, code examples, and writing. So often, existing resources fail to present a full picture. Complete examples are very difficult to find, and nearly non existant in Cardano environment. This hampers projects that want to take a serious look into token engineering. This is potentially the greatest problem in all of blockchain. Bad token engineering is what leads to Luna. People take their own lives due to lost wealth. This is not a joke. Token engineering is like engineering a skyscraper. There is no rewind. No taking back. It must be engineered WELL. This is why this proposal solves an incredibly important problem. \n\nThis problem is also entirely aligned with the challenge. The knowledge gap for developers in token engineering is MASSIVE. Token engineers must know at least a little bit about: economics, psychology, game theory, ethics, optimization, and a lot more. Suffice to say most developers don't have a clue. Fundamental education on token engineering is thus incredibly important for developers. The proposal thus will fill in exploration stage gaps and bring in new developers by making Cardano's token engineering capabilities more widely known.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As a token engineering enthusiast with a hobbyist background on economics, history, psychology, and game theory, and as someone on the same learning path as the proposer, I feel confident in sizing up the plan in this proposal. The plan is made up of 5 modules. Module 1 builds background knowledge: introducing economics concepts, token engineering, crypto economics. I suggest giving some additional information in Module 1 about all the different disciplines that apply here. Psychology, behavioral economics, and ethics especially are fields of study that apply well here. Modules 2 through 5 go into token engineering in detail introducing concepts like markets design, token design, and incentive design. This is a comprehensive course that is well put together. \n\nThe budget is fair for the type of work involved. Even learning token engineering is hard work. Making videos, code examples, and writing to teach it to others. That's very difficult work. I think it's a fair price for the services being offered. Jack has the video producing background necessary, we see this from his work on Youtube and his personal portfolio on his website. He has the capability to learn and teach highly technical concepts, we see this again in his Youtube. He has great explainers on highly technical concepts like Native Scripts (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUl0e1S_69nW2EBAi_xlpxA). \n\nI have no question in mind as to if he can deliver the proposal. Though I think the timeline is a bit tight with only 3 months. He's started learning the concepts already, so I'm guessing he already has started work on designing the tutorials. If so, I think he'll be able to deliver on time, if not, it will take a little longer than the three months proposed. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The main KPI for the proposal is Orbit's gravity metric. This is something completely new for me. So I checked it out in detail. Orbit is the \"mission control for your community\". As a community leader I was immediately interested in the technology. Gravity is the \"rate at which member involvement is changing.\". This is measured through various methods like Discord activity, Github activity etc. depending on the use of of Orbit by the community. The proposer notes documentation and code examples will be pushed to github, so gravity will be measured using those. This misses the progress on video tutorials but those will just be tracked from Youtube. So all important metrics to track project progress will be tracked. We know where to track the progress too, as both the github repository and youtube links are provided.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2643", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "An excellent assessment that captures the essence of the proposal\u2019s subject, share\u2019s their opinion on the importance, and correctly assesses the work involved along with progress to date.

Please provide a social network for the community to consult and comment on when needed. While you have the knowledge and resources available to you, translating it from your own into your tutorials, helping people to understand more, is often a multi-step, time-consuming process.

I would like to add one more indicator that is the number of people interacting with the tutorials, for example, the number of people who follow the channel, and exchange questions with the author. These are the people who really care deeply and follow the lecture schedule closely.\nThe success of the project helps create high-value tutorials that are accessible to developers when translated into multiple languages and promoted in the Cardano community.

I am fortunate to be able to draw upon many people with the expertise to help me on the subject matter. I will be doing all the video production work myself, the work and budget does not warrant creating a full production team. However I will have assistance on material, design, script, and code.  That includes assistance from very active members of the Cardano Community. However I have not named these people directly in the proposal because they are only involved at arms-length providing guidance, editing, and review as needed (and in many cases at no cost to this proposal).\n\nExpanding a budget to minute detail to include working hours etc. is redundant.

The proposed idea is to create educational content in forms of written and video tutorials. All of these videos will be recorded on Github and will allow for any user to have access to it. This is important because it will allow more builders and creators of tokens to understand the engineering behind the technology and how they can use that to create a more secure project. As I stated before. Education is extremely important and has the potential to have a global impact on the Cardano community. Without proper education, the Cardano community may receive more backlash from other communities.

There is a detailed roadmap that breaks it down into different modules and months. Overall, the project will take around 3 months and there is information included in each of these sections. The specific details are included in each module. It suggests what the educational content will look like and how it will be created. This engineering content is planned to be created in a form of a simple and digestible video that allows for projects to understand the information simply. There is a detailed budget breakdown that shows exactly where the requested funds will be allocated. There are 5 modules that will each require funds and also software services in order to complete this. Overall, I would suggest including a LinkedIn profile or another form of proof of identity. There can also be more specific information in the budget breakdown that suggests exactly why the certain amount of funds will be needed for each module.

However, I am uncertain if there is enough to truly determine the likelihood of success for the proposal. It is a great idea and is proposed to bring more educational content to builders and engineers. However, there needs to be more methods that will allow the principle of accountability. The two biggest forms of this is proof of identity and specific information throughout the proposal.
