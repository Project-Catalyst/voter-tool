Yet,\u00a0as often noted, Cardano's eUTXO design poses challenges not least of which is txn throughput.", "f6_no_assessments": 6, "f6_rating": 4.666666666666667, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 118, "q0": "The team is proposing to design, implement and develop a protocol that will resolve some issues that Cardano\u2019s Eutxo model has in terms of constrained throughput which limits the kinds of DApps that developers can release and develop. The solution proposed by the team is to avoid existing centralized shortcuts that rely on trusted setups and instead to increase decentralization through a novel protocol inspired by Cardano\u2019s own Ouroborus. This novel protocol will take a leaf out of Ouroborus\u2019 book and be split up into sequential slots, which will be accompanied with a random election of leaders for each slot \u2013 thanks to the use of verifiably random functions. The leader advertises that they are the leader (i.e. they advertise the result of their coin toss), and lock the state machine for one slot. In this one slot, only the leader can interact with the protocol. Key to mention here is that the proposers also confirm that \u201cthe system isn't foolproof since a leader can still put in trades before and after a trade by a user on a Uniswap-style DEX for example\u201d. The proposers are keen to find a way to prevent this \u2013 however the proposed solution to this will pursued as a future project \u2013 which points to a plan for future development on top of these achievements. I commend them for thinking about the possible exploits such as miner-extractable value scenarios - hopefully if this proposal is funded, other teams can build on this solution in parallel. I commend the proposers for stating that they \u201care committed to open-source tooling for the Cardano ecosystem\u201d.  This submission does give a very clear picture of how the team intends to provide added value to Cardano and the goals of the proposal are well in line with the challenge settings. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind this proposal is a competent and known development company in the Eutxo blockchain space. Mlabs developers have previously partnered and worked with with some of the leading Dexes that are operational on Cardano \u2013 which also indicates there high-level familiarity with the issues that they are attempting to resolve through this proposal. The team has provided detailed information about the specific team members \u2013 software engineers and developers - who will be engaged on the proposal. The Github repos of the developers are available \u2013 one of them is also the is the creator of the Plutarch typed eDSL in Haskell for writing efficient Plutus Core validators. The total budget of $81,200 is the result of an estimated 1015 engineer hours that will be invested in the project. The team has given a breakdown of the budget with a great hourly tally by individual tasks. The key milestones have been given for the implementation period of three months. As regards the technical aspects \u2013 this team has the required competencies to tackle the design of the system and the necessary familiarity with Plutus and Haskell. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Based on all the submitted information, I do agree that the likelihood of successful delivery is very high. The GitHub repos are publicly available and the team committed to measure some well thought out metrics to allow for auditing the success of the proposal, including an important measure - the number of Cardano projects relying on this approach. The team has provided a clear roadmap with milestones and have set themselves a realistic time frame to achieve what they set out to do. What could have been done to improve the auditability of this proposal \u2013 from the point of view of the not-as-technical Cardano and Catalyst communities \u2013 is to commit to a certain cadence of technical updates and/or blog posts detailing what has been achieved. For example, via a fortnightly or a monthly update on how much progress has been achieved. This would be separate from the standard, terse Catalyst reporting \u2013 which is only linked to fund disbursement. Without these updates \u2013 which could even be done via posts on the MLabs social channels \u2013 it is less easy for an outsider (still inside the Cardano bubble) to keep abreast of the progress.

This is called concurrency and has been on the minds of the plutus developers from the outset. Even before smart contracts launched on Cardano the teams from Minswap and Sundaeswap identified that this would lead to difficulty implementing a DEX type app on Cardano. As the proposer points out the solution adopted by the existing DEXs has been to use a trusted third party which \u201cscoops\u201d the transactions by essentially breaking down the transaction into two steps. The proposal from MLabs seeks to eliminate the need for a trusted third party and have the contract run fully on-chain. The source code will be open-sourced. The advantage of this type of proposal is that they not only solve a problem that developers are facing, but also creates an example for the new developed to learn from. As a developer myself, I very much welcome the opportunity to have the problem described in detail and then be shown how the solution looks. This will be a big value add to the developers working with Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provide the details of two developers who will work be working on the proposal, the Github profiles are provided and I had no problem validating their experience by reviewing the type of code written on those Githubs. The budget is outlined in the number of hours that it will take to get through each of the 7 tasks into which the delivery is broken down. The implied hourly rate is $80/h which is competitive for an experience Plutus developer. The proposal timeline is split into 3 months where the first month is spent on planning, the second month on development, and the third month on testing and verification. There is a logical split between the knowledge base of each individual, Las is an expert in Compilers and Formal Methods, whilst Chase focuses on Performance and Type systems. The plan is formulated in buckets of deliverables by month, the proposers suggest that part of the smart contract has already been written to validate the initial idea, this is encouraging as would suggest the proposers have planned at length. The proposal clearly outlines the language, Plutus, and the architecture to be used. The proposers have created the Plutarch repo which I am personally a user of and find very useful as it reduces the memory and CPU requirements of smart contracts, and the proposers intend to reuse parts of the knowledge gained in designing that for this smart contract. The proposer also explains logically the problem of concurrency, this gives comfort that they are familiar in-depth with the issue. The main risk highlighted is dealing with Miner Extracted Value (MEV) where the pool operators might try to front-run the users of the contracts, this is a prevalent problem in all blockchains because of its transparency - if there is a solution to it then this team has probably one of the best credentials to deal with this.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "A roadmap with monthly milestones is present and a logical split of tasks between individuals.
