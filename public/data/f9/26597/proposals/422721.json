The proposer points out that it is important to do this in order to expand support of programming languages on Cardano. Currently, only Haskell, JavaScript and Java are supported properly, while upgrades like this one will immediately add support for Go and then other languages in the future as well. This means that the pool of developers who will be capable of building on Cardano will grow considerably, which I agree is something necessary for us to keep expanding.\nThe risk that the proposers identified is that serialization libraries are very difficult things to implement and it\u2019s hard to estimate the necessary time to complete them. The mitigation to this risk is simply being aware that this is the case and factoring in the possible extra difficulty into the estimated time for completion.\nI fully agree that this proposal effectively addresses the Developer Ecosystem challenge, as the outcome here will be increased support for developers to build on Cardano. Score: 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Five Binaries provides us with a worst case estimation of 5 months to complete the work and a best case estimation of 2 months. This is quite a range, but it\u2019s understandable considering what they mentioned in the Impact section above. We are also given 3 milestones to look out for, which seems enough planning to me for something that is a straightforward (but possibly difficult to implement) task. The requested budget of 32000 USD is very reasonable considering the rough estimation of 480 man hours needed to finish the work (this comes out to 67 USD/hour, a very modest price for a developer in this space). \nThe person working on this will be Five Binaries\u2019 lead Go programmer. Ideally, we would have been given a name and some credits to back this person up, but it\u2019s not the first time I see companies with Catalyst proposals not do this and given the track record of Five Binaries (visible here: https://catalyst.fivebinaries.com/), I still feel confident in their ability to deliver. As a recommendation for future proposals, however, do try to provide a link to a social platform for the people that will work on the project, as this allows the community to see that the person is real and possibly get in touch with them if necessary.\nIf anyone has the relevant programming knowledge, the repository for this library can be found here: https://github.com/fivebinaries/go-cardano-serialization. \nI think this proposal is highly likely to be completed successfully. Score: 5.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "It\u2019s been a pattern for a few Catalyst funds now that companies are not very verbal in the auditability section and it\u2019s no exception for this proposal. Five Binaries provides us with a link to their Catalyst dashboard which I also added above and while it is true that one can find what\u2019s been done for a project there (especially the ones already delivered), I would be remiss if I did not mention that Catalyst strongly recommends that proposers think about key progress indicators in the Auditability section, as these will help the community keep track of what is being done here. It\u2019s understandable that companies with many successfully delivered proposals rely on their reputation to take care of this aspect, but in order for me to be able to give a perfect score, KPI\u2019s and clear success metrics need to be included here, which unfortunately they are not. As a measure of success we are only told that this will be the final implementation with documentation and examples. This does help show that the code was written, yes, but it does not prove that the proposal succeeded in helping expand the Developer Ecosystem. For that, for example, a success metric could be \u201chave at least 1 team start a project on Cardano using Go within 3 months of this proposal being completed\u201d.\nAll in all, however, as I stated before, support for more programming languages is always a good idea and since this company has a good track record, I am sure the community can work with them to verify the progress and success of this proposal.

It's a straightforward idea and will have some impact on the community, but probably later on. Right now the library doens't see much support so the impact would be limited.\nThis project is in alignment with the challenge settings and would help development efforts of golang software engineers and would invite devs to work with it. As the author stated the isn't much attention right now for one reson or another, because because the toolchain around go isn't mature enough yet.\nThe proposer has one challenge in mind, and has solved it with extra time, but I can't say if that extra time is 10 or 20 or 50% of the final 480 hours which is problematic for assesing argumentatively.\nThe proposal currently lacks details. There isn't enough information about the budget, extra time estimated, technical details and plans and some more, but these are the main ones. Overall I' heasitant to state this will be an impactful proposal, but it might have some backing later on.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal lacks links to team members that will work on it. I looked through the repository to see the github commits so I can see who's going to work on it and found a person called HannesKimara if the github handle could be trusted as a name. I searched for this profile in linked in and only found https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanneskimara/. This profile has no information about skills so I don't know where to go on from here.\nThere's no breakdown of the necessary budget. There's a mention of 480 hours for a successfull implementation and a budget of 32000 so that means 66.67 $/hour, which I can't say is ideal considering most other proposals I've seen hang between 45 - 50 $/hour. But the real question that I have is how much time from those 480 is a buffer for unpredictable circumstances and how much is for planned development. The usual reasonable buffer for unpredicted circumstances is between 5-10% from my experience as a developer. Unfortunately it isn't specified in the proposal.\nConcerning the timeframe, 5 months seems a reasonable amount of time to deliver the listed functionalities. There is some lack of the technical plan of implementation which is not broken down so there aren't any segregated tasks to estimate to make a combined expected timeframe, so I have troungle estimating that as well, but as I said, 5 months seems doable.\nMy sincere suggestion to the proposers would be to put more effort into the next proposals they will do, because it will leave a better impression on the assessors and the voters and that increaces the chance of the project to be realized and funded.\nOverall I can't say if this is a feasible proposal or not, because lack of information. Good luck in this and the next funding rounds.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal has really good auditability.

Anyone interested can go to https://catalyst.fivebinaries.com/  and check out their projects by following the links.\nThere's a clear problem and a somewhat clear solution to the given problem, but I didn't spot any KPIs or metrics for user adoption or technical progress. People can always look at github and see the commits directly, but for non technical people I don't think this would be a prefered choice. I do hope this proposal gets funded, in the future when it's polished and has some community behind it.\nAs a summary I think this proposal is auditable and people can follow along with it's progress on github and the aforementioned site.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2463", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 4, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4694, "q0": "The well-defined issue of supporting the Byron and Shelley eras to attract author developers who needed to update it with Plutus needed to be addressed at this challenge.

By listing even the smallest things to do, then allocating them to specific timelines. Also, I think the marketing and communication will also help increase the reach of the project, please add it to the roadmap section. The budget should be broken down even further, everyone needs to know how the $32000 is being spent.

For context, serialization means converting an object into a format that can be utilized, and in this case, into formats such as Cardano address, transactions, fees, etc. I personally experience how data structures in Golang are a bit strict; thus, having a serialization library without having to understand the underlying implementation would make developers' lives a lot easier. It\u2019s obvious how this proposal would fit with the challenge setting, which is to attract Go developers who aren\u2019t fully supported in the Cardano ecosystem. I consider this a potential opportunity because many software engineers in the industry are using Golang to develop their software using microservices architecture.\n\nThat being said, I am still unclear whether this proposal's contribution would be as significant as I made it out to be because, based on pkg.go.dev, there aren\u2019t any imports yet. It doesn\u2019t mean that providing updates is a bad idea; it just means that there haven\u2019t been any new Go packages that depend on this serialization library. Considering the huge 32,000 USD budget requested, it\u2019s crucial to address this. Perhaps the proposer could give us some insights on how the previously funded serialization library has impacted or attracted developers. Another way to emphasize this proposal's impact might be to explain a little bit about what changed for the Vasil fork, and from there we could determine if there are many breaking changes or not. I understand that providing this information might require a lot of research time, but that\u2019s just one of many ways for us to understand the proposal\u2019s necessity.

The proposer has relevant experience previously, both in developing the Go serialization library (which includes researching the Haskell implementation as well) and providing the Golang SDK for the Blockfrost API. The person in charge of this proposal seems to be just one person, their lead Go programmer, and if we calculate the total budget divided by the approximate man hours spent, we\u2019d get a rate of $66.67 per hour, which is a senior software engineer rate. Considering the team experience, I think this number is reasonable. The timetable provided is great since they also put in an additional time buffer to deal with delivery delays. I do want to hear the response from the proposer themselves about one question. What is their workload right now?

We could track this in real-time using the library\u2019s Github and also monitor the team's overall work using the provided Notion. Overall, the provided information is sufficient. That being said, I wonder if it\u2019s beneficial to measure the library forks, stars, or imports as a way to determine developers' usage.
