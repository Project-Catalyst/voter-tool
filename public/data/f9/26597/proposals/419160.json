Essentially, this is a proposal that will contribute to the decentralization of the Cardano code base through the implementation of an open source Rust, WASM and Typescript library for the Cardano Improvement Proposal (better known as CIP) no. 25. The team intends to use create this native new library from the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) given in CIP25. This will help the developer community working with NFTs by providing an open source library in a new language - as CIP25 is the NFT standard for Cardano\u2019s nonfungible tokens.

Seb and his team really do not need a lot of introduction, if you have been following Cardano as closely as I have for the past five years or so. To cut a long story short, this time has what it takes to take this proposal and run with it to its natural conclusion. The modest budget of $7,000 corresponds in my view to the scope of the proposal and although a budget breakdown has not been provided \u2013 aside from a general statement that the funds will be used to finalize the project \u2013 for a team of this competence and a budget this small, this is satisfactory. I would commend the team for including a breakdown of the key milestones that will be checkboxed in order to realize this proposal. The GitHub links to the dcSpark code repo have been provided.

The auditability section of the proposal is a bit bare bones to be frank, yet we need to remember that Seb is one of the Catalyst funded editors of CIPs AND an active member in the discussions that are revolving in the Cardano improvement Proposal forum \u2013 hence there are multiple levels of auditability that do exist (social media channels, open source code on GitHub, final delivery of the product) \u2013 but the proposal as is written leaves scopes for improvement in the Auditability section. I would commend the team on their very clear presentation of the problem and offering a useful and practical solution to facilitate the writing of dev tools in Rust, WASM-compatible languages and Typescript that need to consume the CIP25 standard", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2047", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 7, "ng": 16, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 718, "q0": "Yes, parsing to and from the CIP25 metadata standard is useful to ensure the correct standard is used at all times.

I am a heavy user of the cardano-serialization-lib that is written by the same team and find it very useful. The deliverable scales well as it would be open source and available for anyone to use.

The plan is outlined in 5 bullet points and a budget of $7,000 is set. It isn\u2019t clear how the budget was derived as there is no meaningful links between the plan and the budget.

Given their previous work I am confident that the dcSpark team will deliver a very useful support structure to NFT developers.\n* source: https://opencnft.io/ \n\nThis will be a very meaningful addition for the entire NFT ecosystem on Cardano and as such the project fits very well within the scope of the Developer Ecosystem challenge.\n\nTo further add to the potential impact of this proposal overall, the project is helmed by Sebastien Guillemot and the dcSpark team, very high-profile contributors in the developer ecosystem of Cardano, as such the outputs of the library this proposal is seeking to fund, are almost guaranteed to be impactful as they will reach a large audience right out of the gate. This in turn will guarantee that the library will gain adoption.\n\nMy qualification for making this assessment comes from the fact that I have been actively involved in the Cardano NFT ecosystem since February 2021 (before we actually had the capabilities to mint NFTs on Cardano). During this time I have worked together with developers in the NFT ecosystem on multiple projects.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Even though the proposal is lacking in certain key areas of its feasibility presentation the dcSpark team has constantly delivered very high quality tools and products on Cardano, and I have no reason to believe that this project will be any different, as a consequence I think that there is a very high level of assurance that this project will be delivered according to the specifications presented in the proposal.\n\nThe requested budget is very sensible, modest even, and I see it as a further reflection of the commitment this team has towards the betterment of our blockchain.\n\nAs a proposer assessor, I would have liked to see a lot more elements presented, such as a clearly broken down budget or a more detailed description of the team, but I will exercise my judgement in assessing that, even though, the proposal itself is missing details about it\u2019s implementation I am very confident that the dcSpark team will deliver on the scope of the project if funded.\n\nOne area where I wish the team would have been more diligent, is in describing the exact commitment required by all the projects they are working on that have been funded by Project Catalyst plus the ones they have submitted in Fund 9, and based on that present a plan on how they plan to manage the workload. These are elements that are requested by the new questions on the submission form. The information itself is very easy to get to however, simply by looking at their page on the Catalyst data aggregator website, Lido Nation,  https://www.lidonation.com/en/project-catalyst/group/dcspark , we can see that the company is currently working on 37 projects funded by Catalyst and have submitted 15 more proposals in total, across multiple challenges of Fund 9.

As such the output of their work will be inspected by many other developers. This is especially true for this library related to NFTs (CIP25), which will not only be browsed by many developers, but actually used by most on a regular basis. Even more so given the fact that NFT projects constitute by far the largest number of projects on Cardano, according to data released by IOG. Because of this, it is very likely that the deliverables of this proposal will end up being some of the most checked outputs of any project funded by Catalyst.\n\nThat is why my rating for auditability is higher than it would have been had I judged the proposal solely on what is presented in it, as it is lacking a clear outline of KPIs and milestones, and the definitions of success are very minimal.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2169", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 4, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1943, "q0": "The proposal wants to build an open source library to parse on-chain metadata according to the Cardano Improvement Proposal 25 (CIP25).

The problem today is that data is represented in simple JSON formats but this implementation of libraries for CIP25 will bring structure and standardization to the ecosystem. This kind of standardization will help developers focus on building great solutions that tackle problems instead of spending lots of time on data management and/or integration. \nThe proposers acknowledge that there is a possibility of future work in order to keep the libraries up to date and compatible, but it is estimated to be minor work and no further funding should be needed.

In its current state, it is unclear if the project will be finalized in a week or a year after funding.\n\nFurther, the budget states that all funds (7000 USD) will be used to develop the solution. This is not detailed enough, a good start to justify you claim of 7000 USD would be to list what work that needs to be done, estimate the work in hours and then multiply these hours with your hourly rate. This would give voters more confidence that your funding is honest.\n\nThe team is working on other proposals in this fund, these could be provided to increase the transparency for voters. Also, funded and implemented projects from previous proposals could be added to further increase credibility and transparency. They can prove as a \u201cbadge of honor\u201d and it makes it easier for the community to quickly review your previous work and achievements. \n\nTo summarize, the team is very credible and the chances of a successful implementation if funded is high.

It is unclear if this will be done in any of the github repos/profiles linked, or if any updates will be provided at all. Since it is an open source solution being built, transparency is key and this should be clearly stated. \n\nAll in all, the proposal is rather poor in terms of auditability and could be improved by providing the details discussed above.

The impact of this proposal will be to standardize the approach to this feature, which will help people build apps faster and in a safer manner.\nAs risks, the proposers identified the fact that some projects that have already made ad-hoc implementations might not be capable of integrating with the one proposed here easily, so further work might be needed in the future to support them.\nI fully agree that this proposal effectively addresses the Developer Ecosystem challenge.

I believe we have no excuse to not fund this proposal since most of our members surely hate delays, bugs, and the worst, error in their transactions or while using Cardano dApps.
