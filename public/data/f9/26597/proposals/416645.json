They look to significantly improve the experience of developers using Catalyst. The proposers suggest they have 500 verified members in the community; however there are no links provided to verify this. The deliverable should appeal to new developers looking to join Cardano by knowing that there's a community where Catalyst proposals are discussed as well as for existing developers who currently use Catalyst to discuss their ideas and create a sense of community.  So I think it aligns with the challenge setting. I would have liked the proposers to elaborate on why Discord is suboptimal and how the new platform improves on Discord. The new platform (tribe.so) has a fairly high monthly fee ($599) and it is not one I have heard of before,  so the benefit of the transition is not clear.  The proposals also will come back for additional funding if the deliverable is well-received by the community.

The budget is set at $42,000 which will pay $7,000 for a subscription to Tribe.so. Then approximately $23,000 will go towards the salaries of the proposers for 3 months and the rest will be spent on media production and advertising.  The timeline is supposed to start in September and finish in December.  The architecture languages are not discussed as this will use an existing third-party platform. The highlighted risk is that there will be lack of participants in Catalyst and we are in the bear market  which can affect the uptake of their content.  I personally think this will only be the case if the price of ADA falls significantly from here and the budgets start to be distributed in Ada rather than dollars.  Overall I think this is an interesting idea however it lacks some detail on the implementation plan and size of the target community that they will be able to onboard.  There is the Catalyst Swarm project that aims to do a similar thing, and it would have been good to see if there's any overlap with them and potential collaboration.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A monthly roadmap is provided with milestones.

The definition of success is qualitative to a great extent, and it would have been better to see quantitative measures of success.

I've been part of the community for a year now and I've never seen people haiving a problem communicating betwen funds and making improvements. Discord has specified channels for each fund and telegram discussions happen often as well. So I'm not sure about the impact of this proposal. All the groups listed in the proposal and much more already exist in the \"Cardano Project Catalyst\" discord.\nFurthermore there are quite a lot of discord bot integrations already done, so all of those will have to be migrated to the tribe. I had a look around I read the proposal twice, but I couldn't figure out why tribe is better than discord. I'm all for people joinging tribe if they want to, and I do really enjoy the UI/UX, but the impact would be limited considering.\nThe key metrics seem relevant and overall this is a fair proposal. As a developer I do have concerns about the re-integrating all the current discord functionality developed by community members over to tribe, and I'm not sure all functionality would be able to be migrated.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers do have a long history in catalyst and I'm sure they'll be able to deliver this project. I checked out their team in the left presentation and was able to check and verify all the team members listed there. I asume those will be the people working on the proposal. I believe there will be enough team members to cover all development and other needs of the project.\nThe timeline separated in 3 development months and one follow up seems good for a roadmap, but I was hoping for a bit more detailed breakdown of the separate tasks in what exactly the preparation would be or organization and so on.\nThe budget breakdown is quite high. I didn't find in the proposal what would the 599$ per month would be providing, beyond creating spaces for discussions that's also provided for free in discord. That coupled with the integratinos already in place makes me hesitant about recommending this. I also thought for 599 a month some of the services of the listed team members would be included instead of having 3 months of pay for Community Leaders Labor and contenct redaction. I understand the Social Media production salary for 7800 for 3 months because I haven't seen a subscription service that does marketing and ads for you, but at least for the first 2 I expected to be free of charge.\nI am no expert in organizing events so I will defer to the proposers estimation of the timetable necessary to accomodate all the proposed work. I don't agree that the biggest risk for this proposal is the bear market. I think the biggest risk is adoption and migrating the current discord users onto a new platform.\nOverall this is a fair proposal, but I'm uncertain for it's feasibility because of the arguments listed above. Good luck to the proposers nonetheless.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal is absolutely auditable, no question. There are reports, and measurable data, decent KPIs that can be tracked by anyone interested. There's a clear problem statement and a proposed path to solve it - onboarding users into a new platform. Concerning auditability the roadmap and milestones could have been a bit more concrete, but they're good enough.\nI would suggest to the proposers to put themselves in the shoes of the voters and let themselves be open-minded about improving their proposal by making it more accessible to the community. \nOverall a decent proposal.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2463", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "The assessor criticizes with a score of (3) the Feasibility section, indicating that the month-by-month work calendar does not have enough information. The reality is that it is nothing more than creating a space with a couple of clicks and a content writing that we are already doing in the community. Then another justification for its low score, criticizes the budget presented, which we believe is in line with the normal salary costs within the European Union, in addition, the platform offers an annual plan with a special discount for the same, so we believe that it is worth betting for a year, being able to evaluate the impact and engagement in a long time.
