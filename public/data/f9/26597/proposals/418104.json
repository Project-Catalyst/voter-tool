This brings a lot of buzz. The ecosystem resonates and the curiosity to experience the features Cardano has to offer, from businesses across a variety of sectors, inadvertently impacted the requirements of the challenge.\n   The short list of proposed solutions are: setting up a placeholder at the event, hosting a live webinar and providing feature solutions that are of interest to the target audience, holding hackathons to stimulate community interest in Cardano. meet businesses to discuss topics like banking and finance, and more that the Cardano ecosystem can address in the future. more specifically, introduce the community to the opportunities and funding process of Catalyst's potential ideas. In general, this is a strategic activity that has a great influence on the Cardano ecosystem. I welcome the team that proposed that have great ideas so developing these high-impact ideas would be great for such re-engagement.\n  The reason that the proposal states is to apply for funding from now, but only until 2024 because of concerns about queuing problems, I agree with this calculation. \"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\"Even though it was funded more than a year before the event, with the specific and convincing explanations of the proposal in the roadmap section, I completely agree with how the proposal should be handled. I'm sure that you've been planning this scenario a lot of time because it makes sense to do it, plus the logistics also include mini games and precious souvenirs as a reward.\n    The proposed team is very experienced in spreading advertising and Marketing. so it makes perfect sense to develop this idea. as well as the budget details, the details are clear and easy to understand to ensure transparency. great, congrats on getting my vote in the funding round\"", "q1r": 5, "q2": "\"all videos will be uploaded to the Youtube channel provided by the proposal, and also promise to provide copies of the logistics contracts including: stage reservations, banners, audio accessories, as well as receipts for the money spent on those activities.\n   The success of the proposal will be the interest of businesses to the Cardano ecosystem, many businesses are known to our ecosystem. In addition, it will especially expand the Haskell / Plutus developer community in the Cameroon region, connecting and collaborating with each other. this is a perfect project from concept to solutions and foresight calculation of the proposed team so for me it will get full marks. \"", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2352", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 1, "ng": 8, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3541, "q0": "The idea of the proposal is to secure a spot at the 2024 Promote Conference, which is a good way to spread the word and recuit more cardano devs from all over. I think it's a valid idea and it will have an impact over the community although I can't estimate as to big or small. The proposal nonetheless is fit for the challenge and is in alignment with it's settings so this is the right place for it. \nThere are quite a lot metrics provided and influencing the finance sector is hard, even getting your foot in the door would be a significant improvement so I appload the effort on their part. Another thing I appreciat is the fact they're planning for 2024 from now and that would give them ample time to prepare and git prices while they're low, because I know firstt hand that the early bird gets the worm. Doing the phisical hubs the proposers already have developed and are familliar with, seems like a really good compliment to the effort of promitong cardno at the 2024 Promote Conferance. Sticking to what you know while exploring new territory is smart move and is sure to be beneficial. \nMy suggestion for the proposers would be to polish their youtube channel and try and make it look and feel more proffesional. It might sound superfluous but it's an important part of the popularity game, which is what they're plaing.\nOverall a decent proposal that should have an impact long term. Wish the proposers good luck.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The links of the people involved are present and I do respect them for standing with their names and faces behind their ideas and are willing to go the extra mile and plan ahead in the future to make their goal a reallity in the smoothest way possible. Anyone can get to anywhere but the less problems along the way the better, and planning makes that a probability instead of a possibility. The skillset and the number of the team members is also specified and even though I don't claim to be an expert, because of my experience reviewing proposals for the last 4 funds this looks like a decent team and skillset to do the work successfully. The budget is outlined clearly and should be enough to get them a spot at the conference although I don't know what's the living standard, but I deffer to their research on the cost of thing. All I can say is it doens't seem expensive to me, so I think it's a bargain. There's more than ample time to do the work, and that means time is on their time.\nThe plan for implementation of the proposal is sensible and having a booth while combining workshops for haskell developers and doing one or two more things at the same time seems a bit difficult to say the least, but as I previousle mentioned I did notice they have previous experience with the cardano hubs, which must have evolved their multitasking skills. Another thing that left a good impression is the practical setups and materials they'll prepare for the event.\nThe authors have thought about challenges and are ready with solutions when trouble gets in their way. Even though you can't plan for everything it always helps to try. Overall a decent and more than feasible proposal.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Let me start of with saying I don't think there will be an issue with auditability, because from a 150+ proposals I've read this is the first to offer to show receipts to their \"investors\". This is a somewhat overlooked part of the funding, because it's proof that something was bought and payed for and it's a regular practice for anyone working in a corporate environment, because it keeps you accountable, which I'm a big fan of.\nThere's a clear and understandable description of the targeted problem as well as a well thought out solution that will have time to grow into reallity as 2024 nears. I don't doubt the proposers have put themselves in the shoes of the users of their services and know what to offer and how to serve up the information necessary to keep the trustt going. Overall a great team, a great proposal that's impactfull, feasible and auditable.

PROMOTE will welcome more than 1000 exhibitors from 30 countries, covering a wide range of industries such as agriculture, energy industry, construction, infrastructure, information technology, communications, banking, finance, etc. So, this will be an opportunity for Cardano to introduce its ecosystem to the community of developers and businesses looking for innovative solutions. The project will rent a booth at PROMOTE to organize a number of seminars to introduce Cardano to 3 groups of business people, developers and businesses looking for solutions. For entrepreneurs, the project will introduce Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and especially the opportunities offered by Cardano through the Project Catalyst platform. For developers, in addition to introducing the tools available to join the Cardano ecosystem, the project also organizes 3 additional seminars geared towards technical topics: functional programming paradigms, Haskell, Plutus and Smart Contracts, Highly Appreciated Hackathon (Cardano, Haskell, Plutus, Smart Contracts). For businesses looking for solutions, the project will focus on already active cases in the blockchain space and the value they bring to businesses. They will present applications in the following industries: banking, healthcare, education. \nThe project also has a potential risk of not securing both the stand and a conference space at the PROMOTE event and the solution to minimize it, it is to register as soon as it receives funding to secure a booth at PROMOTE 2024. \nI see this is an excellent idea, an opportunity to promote Cardano, promote blockchain applications in the fields, increase the number of developers and so it fits the goal of the challenge.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project has set out a specific roadmap such as: when receiving funding, they will immediately register a booth, ensuring logistics-related contracts as soon as possible.

Within 6 months from March 2023, they will contact the Cardano platform to seek cooperation in defining both the content and program for the event. The project has only stated that it will organize face-to-face seminars but has not yet detailed the content presented at each seminar.\nIn my opinion, in order to successfully organize the event, the team should give a detailed program for each day at the Exhibition, for example, what activities will be held on the opening day of the Exhibition, and in the following days, there will be seminars for 3 groups with different target, the project should determine a specific time for each group, specific content presented for each group...\n\nThe project required a budget of $24,000 for items such as stand and conference reservations at PROMOTE 2024 $3,000, logistics $2,000, marketing materials $2,000, decorations $2,000\u2026 I find the budget quite detailed and reasonable.\n\nThe project implementation staff consists of 6 people, they are software developers who are experienced in programming, coordinators, advertisers... in line with the project's requirements.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The specific goals of the project are: Great exposure to the Cardano Ecosystem, Enterprises willing to learn more about the Cardano ecosystem, PROMOTE becoming a funneling mechanism of Developers into our training program, a growing Haskell/Plutus developers community in Cameroon.

This proposal intends to introduce blockchain and Cardano into a wide audience of entrepreneurs and developers and it is just what this challenge is all about. So yes, this proposal does effectively address the challenge. Live workshops and conferences will produce an interesting amount of audiovisual content that our community can certainly take advantage of in regards to their challenges and goals. It is interesting how they intend to get closer to a wider audience through comedy scenes addressing general blockchain reluctance. It might be useful for this proposal in next funds, to find a project in which they can produce a long-term proposal for the Cameroon developer community that does not die in the Promote Conference, as they intend to do in the creation of a Haskel / Plutus Community in Cameroon through its education initiative.
