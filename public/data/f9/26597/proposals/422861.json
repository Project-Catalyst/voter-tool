On one hand, I can very clearly see the potential for impact of what this proposal aims to deliver: tutorials, sample code and educational content for the community. This undoubtedly has the potential to facilitate and create the opportunity for many more people to build tools to interact with Smart Contracts. But, on the other hand, I feel that the proposal itself fails to provide sufficient examples of potential use cases and applications that could be built on top of their deliverables, apart from further developing the use cases specific to MuesliSwap (matchmakers) and making these the focus of their education efforts. If that element would have been present it would have made the value proposition of this project very clear.\n\nHaving said that, this would still represent a potentially good investment for the treasury. Developer education and sample code are key areas we must focus on at present if we want to facilitate and make it easy and time efficient for new developers to adopt Cardano, especially given that today it\u2019s not the easiest sell given the steep learning curve of Haskel and Plutus. In the case of this project, the value of the effort would be amplified further by the fact that it would originate from the developers one of the most used DApps in the Cardano DeFi ecosystem today.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The implementation plan is mostly presented as part of the budget breakdown, but this is not a problem as it\u2019s still detailed enough to get a very good overview of where the team intends to take this project and how. I found the time estimation to be very feasible for each of the described steps and I really appreciate the fact that the team had the foresight to budget and plan for an auditing phase. The entire development stage of the project is estimated to be completed in 2-3 months. That should mean that the project will be delivered by the end of 2022 if the team receives the funding and work begins shortly after. But that is just my personal assumption as the proposal doesn\u2019t mention anything about this and I would have liked to see the team clearly specify an expected launch date.\n\nThis proposal comes from the developers of one of the most well-known DeFi dApps on our blockchain and this fact contributes a lot to prove their competence and dedication to the betterment of the Cardano space, especially since the dapp has been constantly updated since its November 2021 launch. However, this does not completely excuse the fact that the proposal does not provide any information about the exact people who will be delivering this project. Most likely not all voters or proposal assessors are familiar with the company\u2019s previous work and as such it would have been important for the proposal to include links to professional profiles (LinkedIn), examples of previous work and other credentials that would have presented their qualifications and proven their skills. As such my advice would be to include these details with any future submissions.\n\nThe proposers, the MuesliSwap Team, have not submitted any proposals to Project Catalyst prior to this fund. They have submitted 9 proposals in Fund 9, though.\nSource: https://www.lidonation.com/en/project-catalyst/users/2032 \n\nBecause 9 projects is a big commitment, I really would have liked to see a description of how they plan to manage the workload if all projects are funded. This is now a requirement of the newly introduced workload questions in Fund 9. They answered \u201cYes\u201d to the question of other Fund 9 proposals but unfortunately failed to provide additional details in the Feasibility section as requested in the question description on the submission form. They have mentioned in the proposal they are a large team, so I\u2019m not very worried that they won\u2019t be able to manage the workload if all proposals are funded, but it would have been helpful to voters to have a clear understanding of how they plan to manage that situation if it happens. As such my advice would be to include a detailed workload management plan with the next submissions, not only to inform voters and PAs, but it could actually help the proposers themselves be better prepared for every circumstance.  This was a new requirement on the submission form so I will not be lowering the Feasibility grade for this, because a very low number of proposals provided the requested details.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal indicates that it will use GitHub as both a means of tracking the project's progress and delivering its output to the community. This is especially important since this is an open-source development project.\n\nThroughout the proposal presentation the team is concise and clear about the deliverable of the project and the time they will get done in. This will make things a lot easier when the project's progress gets reviewed.\n\nThe project\u2019s ultimate success will be perhaps harder to quantify exactly, as the results of education most often. The ramifications of successful education and tooling initiatives are very likely to go beyond GitHub interactions in case the project is successful. However, this definitely shouldn\u2019t stop us from making the commitments needed to developer education, and this proposal presents a good option for implementing that in a practical way.\n\nMy review of this proposal in the Developer Ecosystem challenge is based on my experience as a project manager working directly with Cardano developers since July 2021. I have participated in almost all roles in Project Catalyst since February 2021, including as a previously funded proposer, and I\u2019ve been involved with the Cardano development community and NFT community for about a year and a half.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2169", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 6, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3067, "q0": "Off-chain SC interactive tool, a proposal to create tools\nto help Dapp programmers have a library of tools to practice with and\nbuild better off-chain SC part.

As suggested,\nThe ecosystem is lacking in specific use cases, the accessible resources are only the original documents released by IOHK. This proposal will helps a lot for the Dapp ecosystem and has a great impact on the community.\nThe risks this proposal would face are as described by the proposer as nothing.\nIn my opinion, it is necessary to add one more risk such as: The number of tools is enough for the community to use and\nhow difficult or easy it is to apply to building a Dapp. The proposer should anticipate this risk or\nIf there is a solution, it should be clearly stated in the solution section.

According to the proposal raised, their team force is very large and professional. Then I suggest that the proposed team should give basic information about the team leader, which I think is very easy for the proposer.\nThe plan to implement the proposal is 2-3 months. However, in the details section, I find it unreasonable in dividing timelines, it will be difficult to determine timelines even though the proponent has detailed the work done as well as the workload and number labor hours required to complete. My suggestion is that the proponent should specify 1 day = how many hours, the tasks in the same milestone are done concurrently, the minimum number of people to do the work to match the plan is 2- 3 months. If it is only as suggested content, it will be misleading.\nFund allocation should also be more specific about wages for 1 hour of labor. Because I see 2 different milestones, the salary for 1 hour of labor is different. Of course, the characteristics of the work of the two milestones are completely different, so the difference in price is understandable. However Voters will need to see more details.

With the implications that the proposal brings to the Dev community or Dapp developers, this will be a proposal that helps a lot for the Cardano ecosystem.

As a developer, I'd be happy to learn how to do my own tooling for my speciffic purposes, but it would also be nice to know I'm headed in the right direction and doing standardized development (more or less) to avoid logical errors.\nI do see this proposal as an integral part of the future of cardano, and I agree with the authors that such samples and knowlede needs to be funded by the community and it costs to have that knowledge and know-how. This proposal is aligned with the challenge settings and would grow the development environment with not only developer onboarding and ease of usage, but with available standards and tooling as well.\nI want to make certain to acknowledge and appreciate people giving away their hard earned knowledge on such new and difficult topics. This is priceless and I hope it's appreciated. I am following muesli swap since their inception and I'm sure there will be no problem scaling the solution when the time comes.

I'm not sure about the auditing phase, but I deffer to the teams' expertise for that. The timeframe of 3 months seems reasonable for the planned out work and entirely doable. I love the detailed description of each phase and milestone with it's individual steps and time each one will take. This is the idea way to breakdown your whole plan and it's quickly becomming a standardized way of doing budget breakdowns. I hope more proposers follow this example. \nTwo things that left a very good impression:\nFirst the proposers do appreciate the active community they have and plan to make use of that fact and second they do have a plan to monetize their development and are capable of funding extra costs and have buffered them into their plans. Both of these leave a very good impression, because it shows foresight. There's a known number of developers that should have no problem implementing the work needed.\nIt's going to be an open source project so that brings the feasibility up, because there's always chance for contribution by the active community which would speed up the process even more.
