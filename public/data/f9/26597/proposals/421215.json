The campaign brief and the problem statement are very well aligned, as is the suggested remedy. There are several tools readily available for hiring people with the required skills, but it is quite insufficient when it comes to blockchain developers, there are so many more criteria and previous experiences that matter when hiring given the scarcity of exceptional developers and the existing tools may be too generic to identify such things. The proposer seems to have a solution for the above issue. A designated tool where the Cardano or blockchain developers, in general, can sign up and get hired from professionals working on projects. This proposal could actually end up making the Cardano ecosystem self-sufficient and independent of external hiring needs. It could end up bringing in more developers onto the chain once they realize that their talents are put to the right use and even bring more entrepreneurs who are looking to bring their projects to life once they have a portal such as this to assess the technical capacities of the developers available to work with them.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The submission's milestones and comprehensive plan seem logical and doable.

The proposer definitely makes an elaborate introduction of the team and the members are no doubt competent to do something of this sort. Despite being a great proposal, the proposer seems to miss out on some key details. The plan provided even though mentions the monthly milestones, but there are not many details about the technology stack the team is planning to develop the portal. The plan is too abstract for us to draw any conclusive decision regarding the capabilities of the tool. The budget also follows a similar notion, the high-level division of the funds looks very transparent but it would have helped if the kind of work each of the roles would be doing in the detailed plan.

But there is not much to look forward to apart from that. Announcements over some channels at regular intervals might help the community easily get updates about the progress.

This \"Developer List\" plans to address the challenge of newer developers finding projects to work on, by creating a place where these developers can share their skills and experience and get onboarded on a team. Whether it's small projects or becoming on a part of a long-term team. It gives more developers access to positions to use their skills.

These two principles together help determine the auditability and potential success of the proposal.

The proposal intends to build a platform for junior developers where they can seek help from senior developers. In my opinion this would provide great value to the community given that there would be shared knowledge between developers and this is going to maximize efficiency. At the moment developers ask question to each other on different social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit however this proposal intends to concentrate all of this into one single location. Such a platfor will provide mentorship for young developers but at the same time would give senior developers the full power of community behind. For example if they need help with a project they would be able to gain a lot of insights just by reading the feedbacks of the community. According to the proposal the platform is going to have a payment options where senior developers would get paid for the time and effort they put in by the junior developers said roughly. For this part I have one suggestion for the team, what if instead of money the platform rewards the senior developers with points and reputation inside the community, and this way they may get rewarded by finding better jobs or better projects. Not everybody has the financial means to hire a private tutor for programming. It can be really expensive and can take a lot of time as well, so if the team is able to refine this idea in something else that doesn\u2019t envolve paying money to the senior developers I belive that this project will have the ability to scale and have a global impact.
