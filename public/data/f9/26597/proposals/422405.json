The events are targeted towards this. The proposer aims to add value by running 3 workshops for new developers over 3 months. The goal aligns with the challenge setting to attract high-calibre Developers and ensure the developers have ample resources to work on platforms that suit their interests. The proposer will be able to replicate the format of the workshop after the first 3 months with additional funding. I personally receive regular updates from the proposers regarding other events they host, therefore the brand has been with Cardano for many months and have a track record of reaching out to the community", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provides a list of people who will work on the project and describes their skillsets, however only the first name of the people are provided and no links to social pages are provided, which creates an impression of anonymity. It would have been great to check the background of the individuals who will work on the project to judge the merit of each on. I would suggest that prosper includes this information in the next iterations. There are a total of 8 people who will be involved, this is plenty to run a workshop and prepare documentation, it is good to see that there is contingency should some of them not be available for the event. The budget is broken down in great detail (6 categories) with a logical explanation of how it will be spent. The budget is reasonably set, the net cost will be c. $4.4k per event which includes slideshows, videos, marketing and speakers\u2019 salaries. The proposal does not include a detailed plan of who and when will complete what tasks, however, the event will follow a tried and tested format that the team has delivered on other topics. It would still however be good to see a detailed plan in future iterations as it gives comfort that the team has a detailed plan to complete the work. The plan does include the resources to complete the work and is broken out in the budget section of the proposal. The proposal does not explain the architecture, or the software to be used, however, the project is not a technical deliverable and nothing will be built as such, but rather information will be provided to developers. The proposal considers the risks that developers might fail to recognize the potential in Cardano, that that onboarding might be ineffective, and the community might grow faster than they are able to facilitate events. These risks are true to most proposals. To address these the proposer will use welcoming languages, reference official material, and continue to grow their offering. As a facilitator of workshops myself there is nothing in the proposal that makes me doubt their ability to deliver, only the fact that it is not possible to check the background of tutors.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The plan lacks a formal plan, however, it is made clear that the workshops will be delivered monthly and will be produced by an established team who runs other workshops for the cardano4climate brand.

It would have been nice to see metrics tracking the number of participants in the events and collecting feedback post-event - this is something quite normal in the corporations where the organizers collect feedback to understand how it can be improved in the future and track return on intentions. Progress will be communicated communicate on their social media accounts and the workshops will be recorded and made available on YouTube.

At least no results or evidence of this initiative\u2019s effectiveness is cited in the proposal. If there are, I would strongly advise the team to include them next time.\n\nIt isn't sufficiently presented in the proposal, and it wasn\u2019t clear, why this project is a good fit for the Developer Ecosystem challenge.  Apart from mentioning the intention to host a new series in their program, titled  \u201cDeveloper Impact\u201d, no other connection is explicitly made.\n\nI'm providing this feedback based on the fact that I've been part of the Catalyst community since February 2021 and have engaged with Cardano development communities since March 2021.

I wish they would have expanded on them a bit, for instance instead of writing just \u201cThematic event\u201d I would have liked to see what are the themes that they think would make sense for developers.\n\nThe budget breakdown is very detailed and thorough covering all aspects of the event(s) production, including an amount set aside for contingency use.\n\nThe team seems to be made up of very motivated and dedicated individuals. I also really like the way they chose to present themselves.\n\nThe questions about the workload on previously funded proposals and projects, submitted as proposals in Fund 9 are answered \u201cYes\u201d.

The first six words of the very clear problem statement offer a perspective for voters to see such developers through before even getting to the problem\u2013\u2013well done. An excellent fit. \n\nThe solution of hosting these unique gatherings will have a positive impact on the Dev ecosystem and Cardano at large. It's one thing for communities to offer social benefits. The meetings described go further and contribute to a deeper purpose for those in the dev ecosystem\u2013\u2013connecting the work of utilizing the bleeding edge of cryptography to help save our world. This value-add is profound and offers a more purpose-level reason for new devs and old to become a part of Cardano/Catalyst/and the Cardano4Climate group. \n\nThe purpose behind the three meetings, which essentially constitutes their KPIs for the Impact section, matches very well with the Challenge in that they speak of connection, support, collaboration on developing ideas, and so on. These directly answer the problem: \"...developers don't find meaningful projects and fruitful collaborations. The developer experience is solitary.\" Well done.\n\nThe risk section can often tell voters a lot about how deeply a proposer has thought about the implications of their proposed work.\n\nInspired by your deep considerations of potential risks and thorough mitigation tactics, I'd like to share a thought with the proposers: If looking for fresh ideas for these or future gatherings, consider searching \"event\" or \"hub\" in funded proposals, currently F8 and before, on Lido Nation's tool (tinyurl.com/CatalystProposals). The results are a window into such knowledge gained.

Currently, the plan consists of a list of 4 deliverables (timetable included) from the 3 events at the bottom of several paragraphs of, albeit valuable, historical context. If rewriting, please consider one idea of offering the detailed plan as the priority for voters and the historical context after. Also, consider adding the actionable tasks and order of execution. At present, these are missing elements to the team's detailed plan. This is the rationale for 4 stars.\n\nThe budget is thorough, and costs are articulated well for voters' ease. If rewriting, perhaps adding the total paid for each of the four bulleted items under  \"Event Planning Budget\" would add even more transparency for voters and perhaps for future proposers who will benefit from seeing such totals when researching past proposals. As someone who has worked in event organization and logistics, the budget is more than reasonable for the events mentioned, especially given the historical context of the team's past experiences.\n\nThe skillsets are implied in the plan. When offering the proposal team by name, voters will benefit from the attention paid to providing \"relevant experience,\" as this area of feasibility suggests. There are 8 team members and many community members the team can likely find help from if they find a need; the team is clearly well-staffed.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is no roadmap with milestones in this section, though something similar exists at the end of the detailed plan section.

Another potential area to track could be the simple survey attendees might fill out at the close of the third event. Perhaps an anonymous google form survey with 2 or 3 questions.\n\nAs all weekly planning meetings are published, the team has created a built-in auditability tool for everything they do.

It could mention, for instance, whether event will be online or offilne (it seems to be only online but this is not clearly mentioned), how they will communicate and engage people both to attend and speak, what sorts of presentations it will have (round-table talks, regular speeches, workshops, fair/stands/breakout rooms, discussion panels, etc). It would be good also to have interative activities related to Cardano and blockchain, maybe leveraging some of the products developed in Cardano so far.\nI would also mention what were the lessons learned with previous events and how they will improve them here.\n\nIn a summary, it is a nice idea that will add value to the ecosytem but more information on the main events could be provided.

The budget breakdown seems good enough and is somewhat broken down to it's parts which have reasonable rate of $/hr which makes the cost to value ratio worth it to vote this in.\nI couldn't say if the timetable to complete the stated work is enough or not, because as a developer I don't have any such expertise, so I defer to the proposers and thier estimation on the matter. The plan for implementation seems logical and reasonable, but as I mentioned I'm a developer so take it with a grain of salt.\nThe platforms going to be used are mentioned specifically and are all good choices considering they've become a standard like - youtube videos for educational and marketing purposes, telegram and discord for discussions and twitter for growing the communiny alongside others. \nOverall despite the fact I wasn't able to verify the team members, the organization Cardano4Climate seems to get things done and you can't argue with results.
