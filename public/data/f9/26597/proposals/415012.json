The proposal wants to create an open source library of smart contracts that developers can use for rapid prototyping, as it claims that Cardano ecosystem does not have such prototypes for creating quick smart contracts. However, I am not sure if this is entirely true, because a quick look on Fund 7 funded projects shows \u201chttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/382311\u201d no code, audited smart contracts proposal which also allows dApps developers to kickstart their project by managing smart contracts via their platform.\n\nAdditionally, the key metrics and goals are not presented and left to reader inference, so I can not really compare them against the  challenge settings. Overall, even though there are signs of some alignment with this challenge settings, the proposal write up lacks coherence and some research information on similar proposals/works from the past. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The experience of the team seems well versed in Ethereum based development, which means I assume they have good experience with Solidity. However, we know that plutus programming is very different from Solidity and there is no proof here on the expertise of Plutus/Haskell/cardano development experience. I could find a link to linked in for lead developer Chris, (from previous round but link seems to be broken). \n\nThe plan is represented in quarterly milestones, starting from 1st quarter to 4th quarter, where deliverables are given out per quarter. The new developer rates are justifiable, but there is no details on the engineering hours needed to fulfill this proposal. It would have been great if there was a matchup between quarterly milestones and actual engineering hours needed to write these smart contracts (estimation at least). For instance, they want to relaunch their website in quarter 1, but which website is it ? Does it already exist ? Is it highlander.tech ? If so, then why does this proposal website need to be relaunched ? All such details should have been thought through and answered. \n\nFinally, the risks section mentions user adoption, e.g. who will use these smart contracts. However, I see also hiring of the developer also a potential risk as it is directly affecting the project finish timeline, and budget constraints. Overall, I disagree, therefore, that this proposal has a high chance of being implemented successfully.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I can neither agree nor disagree that the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. The measurement of development (progress) is done by how many proposals are released to the public. However, does it mean released to production ? Why is there no progress via Github Commits for contracts that go to staging/testnet etc ? \n\nThe writeup basically wants to measure the progress via the end result of this proposal, however, it should be about how biweekly/quarterly stories/milestones are being delivered and how the community can track it e.g. via github commits/PRs merged/reviews etc.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2114", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 2, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 948, "q0": "The team behind this proposal wants to create a set of Plutus smart contract templates and make them available to the Cardano developer community.\n\nThis goal is aligned with the Developer Ecosystem challenge in multiple ways. First by addressing the main guiding questions:  \u201cWhat are the tools that we need to prioritize first?\u201d And second by explicitly tackling one of the potential directions described: \u201cSamples, recipes and templates.\u201d\n\nThe project is easy to understand, but if correctly executed the deliverables of this proposal could have a substantial impact and a two-fold effect:\n\t1.\tEase the workload of existing Cardano smart contract developers.\n\t2.\tAct as a great resource for attracting outside developers to Cardano by making their transition smoother because they can rely on a prebuilt library of smart contract templates to work with and draw inspiration from. \n\nOverall the proposal could have a big impact on our ecosystem if funded and properly executed as it could make the experience of smart contract developers on Cardano much better by bringing quality of life improvements to their development routine. Templates not only provide a base from which to start, but they can also provide inspiration on how to build on your work. This in turn could make the whole ecosystem healthier.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The implementation plan covers a year of development and the allotted time frames seem very manageable. \n\nFull bios with credentials and links to the LinkedIn profiles of the people currently involved in the project would have been useful but the team has been developing blockchain-related applications and their website hosts several NFT-based games, so they have provable blockchain development experience. Given that they demonstrated their experience by linking their website I consider the desire for anonymity understandable.\n\nFrom what I could see, the team\u2019s current smart contracts only run on the Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum. It is unclear if they have Cardano-specific experience at this time because that is not mentioned in the proposal. Although it\u2019s very likely that this won\u2019t affect the likelihood that this project is delivered because the team plans to recruit a new developer full-time to write the Cardano-specific smart contract templates and presumably handle tasks related to that. According to the budget breakdown, most of the requested budget will be spent on this hire ($62,400 out of $65,900). The rest of the budget is to be spent on marketing and hosting. Depending on the location of the dev they plan to hire the $30/h rate might be workable but in my experience, the standard hourly rates for Plutus developers can be several times higher.\n\nFrom what they have presented in the proposal, it seems as if their goals are realistic, the proposal plan sounds quite achievable and the requested budget seems reasonable. What I would have liked to see in addition is a plan for the future sustainability of the project. The smart contract templates will probably need to be kept up to date for years to come as each new hard fork will bring new capabilities for the foreseeable future. The proposal makes no mention of this, however, at this point, I see this as a minor omission, something that would have been nice to have, but certainly not something that calls for a lowered rating on it\u2019s own.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability section provides an overview of the general KPIs the community could monitor to keep track of the project\u2019s progress. I would have preferred a bit more detail in the presentation, especially since all the metrics mentioned will come close to the end of the project, after the smart contracts are released, so presumably towards the end of the third quarter of development.\n\nThe definitions of success are brief but in accordance with the overall goals of producing and promoting the smart contract templates collection.\n\nNo estimated launch date is mentioned in the proposal, but the implementation plan spans twelve months, so we can probably safely assume that it will be around 12 months after funding. The plan does say that the first production releases of the contracts will come out in the third quarter of development but that\u2019s the best hint for when the deliverables of this project will start rolling out.\n\nEspecially important in the case of this particular proposal, the community would need to assess two aspects: the overall project completion but also, probably more important in this case, the technical quality of the output.\n\nOur main objective as proposer assessors is probably to safeguard the Cardano community treasury, however, in the case of this project, we as a community would also need to ensure the quality of the smart contract templates delivered is up to standards. If funded, the project would receive a badge of trust that would potentially get far more people to interact with the templates and as such there will be less room for buggy code.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2169", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 3, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3263, "q0": "If you search around the Cardano ecosystem for a one stop shop for basic smartcontracts to prototype an idea, you will come up short.  There are plenty of places where opensource contracts are available, but really no way to find or sort them as needed.  While this project sees the need for such a library, here they are primarily suggesting the creation of some basic contracts and placing them in an opensource repo for the community.\n\nThere is an issue here where the idea, which aligns well with the challenge setting and Cardano mission, does not quite match up to the deliverables suggested.  Their suggestion to prepopulate a basic repo with basic contracts puts them in the same category as what we already have: disparate lists of contracts only slightly vetted and with weak categorization, in random corners of the ecosystem.  The risk, which they correctly note, is that their repo remains just as obscure or disorganized (see https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps/tree/main/plutus-use-cases/src/Plutus/Contracts) as everything else.  And this is where they try to separate this proposal from that group.  They intend to restructure their existing gaming website (presumably, this wasn't completely clear in the proposal) and then create professional marketing videos to draw the community in, and then to have the community iterate the contracts if need be.\n\nI am curious as to why this proposal misses the low hanging fruit of focusing on the flexible, feature-rich interface of the OpenZeppelin site that they are seeking to model, and then letting the community populate it with their contracts, many of which have been audited (and the plutus contracts repo linked in the IMPACT field would be a good start).  I suspect that this is their plan, and unfortunately it isn't really clear from the proposal, which doesn't address the idea in feasibility or auditability.\n\nThough the project lays out a real and persistent issue in the Cardano ecosystem and suggests an approach that aligns with the principles of the challenge setting, the actual deliverables seem to be at odds with meeting the needs of the problem they have identified, and further, outside of a marketing campaign does not seem to address the deeper cause of organizational entropy affecting these smartcontract resources (lack of a versatile, expressive platform for storing/retrieving them).  I'm marking the impact section down by 2 stars, for a 3 star rating.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "In line with the lack of clarity regarding the proposed deliverables for the solution, the budget and milestones lack the kind of granularity that would have helped to understand that better.  The lion's share of the budget goes to a year's salary for a full time developer (which was a fair rate, I think), and one of the first tasks was redesigning their games website.  But that is all the detail we get, when what we need to know is what they are redesigning it to, and how that is relevant to the solution.  This is really the crux of the proposal, is the plan to create a robust OpenZeppelin inspired smartcontract repo?  They have a statement which pretty much says no, that isn't attainable at this point, but they are still leaning into the redesign of the website for this repo to some end.  This point, more than the others really needed clarification.\n\nUnfortunately, the largest oversight seems to be the lack of details regarding the team.  It is understood that they have yet to hire the main developer to build the smart contracts (and redesign the site) but even the existing site had no information about the proposers or their relevant skills.  It would be advisable to include some details for the project lead to increase confidence in their ability to manage the project, as well as to pursue at least handshake partnerships for the developing and marketing components, so voters could have an idea of what kind of quality is to be expected from the deliverables.  I was also unable to find any place where they provide transparency or feedback, including in the comments on this proposal, which have gone unanswered.\n\nBecause the lack of clarity and details around team and deliverables, and because the budget and roadmap lacked enough granularity to effectively parse for outcomes and milestones, I have to downgrade this proposal by 3 stars, for a 2 star rating.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The auditability section, while sparse, does seem to inform one aspect of the proposal:  the main deliverable here doesn't have much to do with the site, and is to be measured primarily by the total number of contracts created and how many people are using them.  What would have been really helpful here is to have some sort of concrete target, or expectation for rates of creation for the contracts and users.  The goal isn't so much to target some exact number, but to have some specific reference to gauge what is reasonable progress.\n\nThe biggest oversight in this area is probably \"How many contracts, and what kind?\"  This question would make a good foundation for submitting this proposal as a basic prototyping repo, which seems to most align with what they have presented here, while leaving a platform buildout for another day.\n\nThough they do intend to make the repo public, which I assume means opensource, the lack of concrete measurables and team transparency makes this a very difficult project to audit confidently.

The highlander team mentions that there is a lack of smart contract templates for token issuance and customization, NFTs and governance protocols.

The Highlander team has drawn the difference of this project from OpenZeppelin- a library which shows all tested libraries of smart contracts (popular with Ethereum and Binance Smart chain) in term of size and customization as the modules they plan to create are introductory series of smart contracts. Moreover, their project is an open source project and available for developers to view on GitHub and the Highlander website. The open source nature of this project is aligned with strategic goal of fund 9. The challenge the team mention for this project is user adoption but they plan to market aggressively with the release of informational video that explains how to use the contracts. I would like to also mention another challenge as the learning curve of the team itself as all team members has experience in game development in Ethereum with no background in developing smart contract in Cardano (extracted from their summarized experience). There are numerous libraries in Cardano ecosystem but not one library specifically just for NFT, Token issuance/customization and governance. However, there are a few libraries that already cover smart contracts in this specific area ( for NFT, token issuance/customization and governance) and only the introductory series of library by the team might not be sufficient for this purpose.
