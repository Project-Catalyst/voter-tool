India has 2 million Developers with only 0.25% on all the Blockchains.\u00a0", "f6_no_assessments": 10, "f6_rating": 4.666666666666666, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1713, "q0": "Yes, the proposal is in line with what we are looking for in the challenges, but some details could have been better clarified. The problem to be solved is very well explained - the shortage of developers who have the knowledge, technical preparation to work with blockchain. They are already few, and at Cardano, there are even fewer. To solve this, the proponent suggests that an investment be made so that engineering professionals in India can become aware and study about blockchain and about Cardano, so that the skilled workforce can grow in our ecosystem - which is basically what we're looking for in the challenge. As new professionals are introduced to the technologies of Plutus and Haskell, certainly topics from the summary of the challenge summary will be addressed, as the proponent himself quotes, some of the KPIs would be: \u201cHow do we attract developers from outside our current community to participate in Catalyst ? What do developers want and how do they get it from the Cardano development ecosystem? What would make you a developer motivated to wade through documents and code, no matter how difficult it is to create an app? What are corporate development managers looking for to be able to create corporate projects - internal or commercial? Talking more about the solution itself, the proponent claims that the IT market is very strong in India, arguing this through numerical data: there are 197 billion people in this market in 2021, and he also makes a projection for the coming years. . Although there are many newly formed professionals in this area, they are taught to deal with traditional programming languages \u200b\u200b(the proponent cites Java, Python, etc.). It is very difficult - I would say extremely rare - for colleges around the world to include blockchain in their curricula, usually this knowledge is sought from outside by students/professionals in the field. The problem is that Cardano is a third generation blockchain, that is, it is relatively new if we compare it to other networks that are already older and consolidated in the market, so it is natural that we need to make an extra effort so that professionals in the technology area know about our ecosystem and, above all, fill in the gaps that say about the lack of qualified labor for the development of our technologies. For example, almost all Catalyst proposals need the workforce of smart contract developers, but I've noticed that it's more common that proposals don't already have this professional defined at the time they are launched on idescale - usually the vacancy is in open. In other words, the situation is very real, and can even be perceived by the PAs themselves: there is a great need for this type of workforce. So, in theory, the proposal is excellent. Now, there are a few points I would like to comment on. In the precho \u201cMarketing and Selection: We will carry out awareness campaigns on social networks and in private groups, universities and institutes and we will invite interested freshmen to participate in this program to receive training in projects. Only serious candidates will be selected for the programs.\u201d Which social networks will they do the dissemination work on? What are the private groups, would they be from telegram, discord, etc? How would the blockchain universe be exposed and introduced to these students, who may have never heard of it? How to make them understand Cardano's differentials in relation to other networks? How will the proponent measure the seriousness of students to select the best? On the risk side, I was also doubtful about some points: \u201cWe are a well-connected network of universities / The monetary incentive to learn a new technology can compensate for this / Putting ready-made developers on live community projects\u201d. What network is this? It would be nice to have names. How much would be paid per student How do you get them into live community projects? Does the proponent already have contact with some active members of the community with whom he can partner? It would be good if these issues were clarified.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In terms of quality, the topic is similar with impact. It is possible to visualize the way in which this topic would be put into practice, however I still think it would be necessary for some more clarification to be made on some specific points. The script is well constituted, we have a lot of information passed, although none is so deeply explained. First, the proponent cites several actions that would join together to form the whole of the project, such as: \u201cMarketing and Promotion, Marketing plan to invite freshmen to participate in this program, Keep study links and learning information organized, Guided self-study, Weekly evaluation regularity of study progress\u201d, etc. This overview is useful as it allows us to have a basic view of what would be done. Afterwards, these activities are divided according to the months, and this is where I believe more detail would be needed. For example, in September the focus would be to finalize the marketing content, select 30 out of 50 program candidates, and collect self-learning resources. Each of these parts could be explained in more detail. What would the marketing content look like? Totally online, or would posters and pamphlets be distributed in selected educational institutions? What selection criteria would be used to choose the 30 selected? What would the self-learning resources look like, how to make these people really interested to the point of using the self-learning modality to get to know Cardano? Starting in November, activities are explained bimonthly. For example, in November and December what would be done is the development of \u201cProject-based learning done and completed + Live projects identified + Let's connect with the Gimbalabs project-based learning initiative\u201d; and in March and April it would be the \u201cLive project training completed + 20 new developers ready for Cardano\u201d. It would be more ideal for each of these topics to be broken down by months rather than bi-months, and that, again, we have more information about the activities. For this reason, the project development process is understandable, but not ideal. The budget division is reasonable, in the section \u201c1. Content Creator 1 \u2013 for 10 person-days x $250 per day = $2,500\u201d gets confused as to whether it would be 10 days or 10 people. What would the person responsible for the \u201ccardano tech expert\u201d part do, exactly? Would she work full-time to get paid $400 a day? It's a very high amount, most professionals ask for around 1000/1500 dollars a month, so the talk of daily work is not small here. The same could have been better clarified for developers and project managers - what would be the hourly value of work? As this information is conveyed, our understanding of using financially is just basic. The team presentation part focuses on Udai Solanki, Narendra Das and the team at eRevMax. It is said that Narendra is learning about our programming languages, but unfortunately it is not clear how Udai is related to Cardano, he has a funded proposal (travelerID) but it is not clear how he is related to Cardano technologies . Although some very relevant information and the linkedin profiles of the two professionals are included, I would like to understand this bridge better. And I also think it would be appropriate for them to include in the proposal itself information about the eRevMax members who will be directly involved in this project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The bidder informs us of various milestones that are delivered, updates that will be shared through community channels, and/or monthly reports. The phrase gets a little confusing: if the information is posted on community channels, wouldn't the frequency be monthly? So what would be periodicity? And if monthly reports were made, where would they be shared? The suggested KPIs (\"number of developers being trained + developers learning progress notes + assigned projects and progress + feedback from the community project team, where applicable\", etc) are very good, as they are not only about quantitative data, they is the most common to be provided in the proposals, but also qualitative. Thus, the only thing that would be pending would be to inform the Cardano community about the work processes behind the aforementioned KPIs, how the work routine of project managers, experts at Cardano, etc. would be. How would the duo of professionals presented, together with the company's team, have their work routines monitored, how would the processes be understood? I think this should also be included in monthly reports/updates via community communication channels (it would be important to specify which communication channels they would be, too). It is very positive as they state when they define that \u201cwe will open a dedicated Github to present the progress as well as include all relevant information in the monthly report and in the final report + at the end of the project based learning we will communicate to the community through channels social and after the city hall session on the team members available to collaborate on the projects\u201d; clearly, those involved are aware of the need to keep our community abreast of what's new, so just a few more specs would be needed for us to have perfect auditability of progress. Talking about the final success, in my view this part is not very adequate, the proponent explains that the goal is that \u201c20 freshmen become Plutus and Haskell Developers with project experience\u201d; with this, the workforce relevant to Cardano and the Catalyst projects. Furthermore, \u201csuccess will also include integrating the developer with projects and companies working on Cardano while also getting paid so that we can train and integrate more developers into the ecosystem. We want to build a successful developer training and onboarding hub.\u201d How could we see in practice these projects companies in our ecosystem that have had the developers of this project as members added to their teams? I think success is highly regarded, but in addition to understanding what it would be, it needs to become palpable for our community, for the proponent to promote research that can expose verifiable data in relation to these companies and projects. The ideal would be to promote a presentation in Townhall or a video in which company members and project teams report this experience, how this project directly contributed to such sums. That said, in my view, the proposal is very auditable, but as in the previous topics, small improvements would be needed so that we have a 100% adequate scenario here.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 8, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 743, "q0": "Yes, the proposal aims to train 20 new Plutus developers within 6 months and help integrate them into Cardano projects. This addresses the challenge objective of increasing the number of developers building on Cardano. On a personal level I see there is a lot of demand for qualified Plutus developers and for the projects that I am delivering we are always on a look up to hire new developers, so having access to additional developers would help me advance my projects. The proposal is able to scale in future iterations by tracking a large number of developers through the program. The proposer also suggests that out of the 2 million developer market in India, only about 0.25% are blockchain developers and there is the potential to attract many more with the right training and incentives for new developers. Note: The proposer has a similar proposal to \u201cAdd Senior Developers to Ecosystem\u201d. I suggest the proposer combines them to reduce the fixed costs of each and avoid having duplicated proposals. For this reason, the text of this assessment is very similar as well to my assessment of \u201cAdd Senior Developers to Ecosystem\u201d", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, the proposal provides Linkedin profiles for himself and co-proposers. Udai, the lead proposer has more than 20 years of experience in tech and has successfully established a hotel software business. This suggests that he should have no problem finding candidates for his program. The Co-poser has a similar track record and has been more involved with Cardano than Udai. The schedule is provided and is split into 3 periods of 2 months each (6 months in total) where a cohort of 30 selected devs will do self learning for 2 months, then project-based learning for 2 months, and training on live projects in collaboration with Gimbalabs. Some attrition is expected, so not all developers will reach the end of the program. The budget is reasonably set at $31k where $15k will go as a stipend to trainees and the rest spend on preparing training material ($6k), marketing and material ($2.5k), and project management and university outreach ($7.5k). Having worked with outsourcing contracts I can conclude that this is competitive for the Indian market. The timeline is realistic and logically broken down into self-learning and project-based training. The proposal is not technical in nature, as no new software will be built, at the end of it there will be 20 new junior developers ready to join Cardano projects. The key risk identified is not being able to attract the right talent and the risk that there will not be adequate projects for the new devs to join, these are reasonable risks, but given the contact network that the proposers have and the constant lack of Plutus developers in Cardano I believe these risk can be adequately managed. I do not see any problem with the team delivering this proposal. Note: The proposer has a similar proposal to \u201cAdd Senior Developers to Ecosystem\u201d.

The KPIs are thoughtful and cover the key metrics of a number of developers in training, assignment progress, and feedback from the community during the live projects. The team will keep the Cardano community updated with monthly reports and also make it available on a Github repo. At the end of the project, the team will make a formal communication with the profile of newly trained developers at the Catalyst townhall. What success looks like is well articulated and is objective: 20 new Plutus developers available to join Cardano projects. This is a good auditability section and I am comfortable that the community will be able to monitor progress and reach the members for comments should that be required.

This idea makes a lot of sense, considering the problem stated, and is indeed aligned with challenge, answering , for example, challenge guiding questions as \"How do we attract developers from outside of our current community to participate in Catalyst?\" besides potentially increasing challenge kpi of \"Number of developers actively building on top of Cardano\".\n\nRegarding the proposal itsel, it is well articulated, as the teaching and learning approach is very clearly stated and the marketing/communication with these so called freshers is put as key for it to happen, providing a clear direction on how this initial engagement will happen. I find particularly good that project based Learning and training on live project  is part of the educational process, as putting the theory in practise is the best way to consolidate knowledge.

From this, the proposer pinpoints the shortage of \u201cqualified development\u201d (with 2 examples being Plutus and Atala Prism). To solve this problem, the proposer turns to the Indian technology industry where a vast number of engineering graduates (1,5 million) hold the potential to fill in these vacancies. It is helpful that the proposer is able to point out these figures and the technical potential of India that fits with the demand of the Cardano community at this point. Their readily available scope of knowledge (Java, C++) and their young age means that they are quick to take up new technology in the Cardano blockchain. The proposal includes a plan on how to recruit and train these graduates. This plan is explained concisely but enough to what the plan will entail.

The first stage Guided Self Learning allows the developers to familiarize with the materials at their own pace but with supervision. The second stage Project Based Learning will give the proposer the opportunity to learn how to integrate what they have learnt into building projects. The final stage Training on Live Project will allow the developers to apply what they have learned on live projects.

Indian developers currently account for only 0.25% of the total membership of the blockchain. This is a very modest number. The team is looking forward to launching a project to help raise awareness about blockchain and train the knowledge of programming languages \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bPlutus and Haskell for new Indian graduates. The program is also geared towards solutions that help developers make their projects easier.\nWith the vision of the proposers, India is a potential market for blockchain expansion. This project is aimed at IT graduates. These students possess the necessary skills to develop blockchain blockchains. Through this proposal, we can see the impact of the project on these objects and the benefits that the project brings to the Cardano community. The proposal described the project implementation process very well. Project features and functions are also mentioned by the team in the proposal. The team also provides technical explanations when implementing the project. Overall, the project completely meets the challenge set out by the Challenge.\nThe team affirms that this proposal is a perfect fit for the Challenge and is the perfect answer to the questions Challenge posed. The results that the project is expected to achieve have been stated very specifically. From these results, the community can appreciate the project's impact on the Cardano ecosystem community.\nThe proposers identified two difficulties that will be encountered when implementing the project including Not being able to attract enough new people to work and Bringing ready developers into live community projects. They have also found a way to overcome these limitations and reduce the risk.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers specify the tasks to be performed for the project. These tasks are presented in great detail and are easy to follow. The proposal also offers a very reasonable project implementation plan. This roadmap is divided into 4 phases and implemented within 6 months. The proposal sets out a realistic timeline for completing work items. The requirements for the work items are also clearly stated in the proposal. The team also covers the details of the technical and technological aspects required to execute the plan. The number of personnel needed to carry out the project and the important positions of the project are also specifically determined by the team. Through the content presented in the proposal, the community can have an overview of the project implementation progress. This project implementation plan is completely consistent with the set objectives.\nThe budget spending plan has been drawn up in great detail. Items that require investment funds are specifically outlined, including paying staff salaries and paying for necessary assets that are clearly stated in the plan. The budget is broken down by category and presented in bullet form. This helps viewers easily monitor and appreciate the budget plan proposed by the project.\nHowever, the proposal should include more mention of the people leading and implementing the project. The team shows these people's profiles and how their experience and skills would fit into the project. This creates confidence that the project after being funded will develop and achieve the expected success.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Details of important milestones during the project implementation are outlined in this section. The proposal provided an insight into the achievements of the project. The community can rely on it to monitor and evaluate each step of completing the plan proposed by the proposal. These achievements promise to contribute a lot of value to the Cardano community and young programmers.\nThe KPI set by the project is to attract 20 freshers to become Plutus and Haskell Developers and bring these developers to the companies working on Cardano.
