Cardanopress is a WordPress plugin that provides a plug and plays features for WordPress developers to exploit web3 features. A few of the features being supported by the plugin are allowing for reading wallet data, performing transactions and stake pool delegation. The Github repository has five forks and active development. The current proposal is for creating more details instructions on how to implement all the features and various use cases. There is definitely a need for documentation with example projects. This will jump-start the use of the repository and lower the entry knowledge level required for the developer. WordPress is normally used by many entry-level programmers with limited experience in WordPress. It is normally said that documentation is the weakness in many open source projects, therefore there is a need to develop the documentation in terms of the video guide of this useful project to unlock its true potential. Therefore the proposal is in alignment with the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is from the team which has developed the plugin to write documentation and provide hands-on examples to improve the usability of the plugin. This is not likely to be a challenge. The team which has developed the software will surely be able to build documentation. The proposal is to take community feedback and produce videos which will guide the developers. The proposers are maintaining the software in a good state and i believe they should be able to perform this task successfully. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal bids $9K for 60 hours of content development at the rate of $150 USD per hour. This rate seems to be on the higher side. The proposal also includes 16 hours of video production. Even with this the rates are bit higher. The proposal has a clear outline and what exactly will be produced is likely to be finalised after receiving community feedback. Hoewver teh output is fairly clear and the progress can be easily monitored and audited since the complete output will be in open domain.

This will help the developer ecosystem by lowering the technical barrier for non-developers to be able to create their own platforms and projects. \n\nThe team commits to creating supporting documentation that will walk non-technical users through a step-by-step instruction of how to build a site. The replication of the WordPress approach will not only appeal to groups using this already, it will allow new users to easily learn the necessary components. \n\nAs a non-technical person myself, I am happy to see projects that cater to not only existing developers but also would-be ones too. By supporting individuals to develop their solutions themselves, with the assistance of the CardanoPress.io platform, the technology and access to it will be further decentralized. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented, it is very likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nA strong indicator for feasibility is that the team has already developed their CardanoPress.io website that provides access to the tools and plugins this project will support. Given that these are already in operation that is little doubt whether the platform itself is feasible. This is where this specific proposal picks up by taking what is already available but breaking it down even further into step-by-step instructions. This doesn't appear that it would be overly difficult since it reflect what already exists. \n\nI do think that the plan could have been elaborated a bit further. While I appreciate that the proposer has broken the plan into five phases, there are no real explanations of the activities or deliverables. Specifically, I would have liked to see a list of topics which the documentation will cover, and how many different documents will be created. They also plan to engage the community to validate the writing but who will you engage, and how? \n\nThis same comment goes for the budget. While high level categories are fine, without some details we really have no idea what to expect. For example, how many videos will be created? How long will each video take? What happens if they reach 16 hours and are not done the videos? Will it just stop? These types of gaps in the plan that would need to be addressed to get full marks. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. \n\nIn the process of creating the documentation, the team commits to engaging the community to input to the documents and test them out through implementation. I definitely welcome this outright commitment as it implies the team is open to feedback and criticism. \n\nThe commitment to also list all the documentation online and made available to everyone is also a good approach as it is likely that as anomalies come up the team will be able to receive ongoing feedback, keeping the documents iterative and evergreen. This means that as new advances are made, the team can integrate them into their existing documentation. \n\nWhat I think could use more consideration here are the success measures. It is good that the team will use use of the documentation and traffic to the site as KPIs but without thresholds of success it is difficult to know when it would be deemed a success vs. failure. Having \"more projects\" installing CardanoPress as the base of development is good, but how many projects would be deemed successful? Making these goals more tangible and measurable would certainly strengthen this section. \n\nOverall great proposal and best of luck in the next round.

The idea is to give users and projects that want to build on Cardano a tool that allows creating innovative websites through their plugin. Also creating videos as well as documentation to guide users more easily. CardanoPress's available plugins include: Adding Proposals, Installing Governance Plugin, Access By Stake Pool Delegation, etc. These plugins are quite convenient to help users build many things on their website. This creates practical support for projects on Cardano as well as positively affects the proposals submitted to Catalyst. The proposal that effectively addresses the goal posed by the challenge, is perfectly suited to this challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I agree on how to divide this project into phases. We will have 5 stages corresponding to different jobs performed. However, I think we should add timelines to do these work contents. At what time each stage will we start and how long its extension will take. I suggest that the proposer should detail information such as: how many documents are written, how many videos are created and respectively how many hours it takes to implement. This is like a plan with a specific roadmap that will help the project develop exactly the set plan, that is, a road has been built and we just need to go on that path.\nAbout budget breakdown: in my opinion, it is not reasonable. The cost of $ 150 / hour in my opinion is quite high because the proposal only mentions the information of one people who will work on the project. So I'm implicitly saying that $150/hour is for 1 person instead of a group. Therefore, they create confusion for the community as well as the voter they can get the correct information. My suggestion for the project is to clarify how many people will do it and $150/hour will be paid for how many people. In addition, add other information such as the number of videos to produce, how many minutes each video will take to make the total time to only take 16 hours? Same goes for 8 hours of Documentation outline and structure.\nThe above suggested information will help the project increase the feasibility as well as the possibility of receiving funding will be higher. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I completely agree with the auditability of the project. Proposer provides excellent evidence on how we will check the information of the member working on this project.

This proposed idea could help lead to having a positive global impact on the Cardano blockchain. I'm sure there are lots of people with great ideas they want to put on Cardano.

This could be written as Q3 or Q4 or even split up into months. Whatever seems more appropriate for the proposal. The budget breakdown is simple to read and concise. It is important to note that information is provided in regards to where the potential funds will be allocated. This helps the team be accountable to those funds. I would agree with the point that it may be more important to complete the documentation after a version of the plugin is available.

This should be easy for Pete and the team. He already has a great following on social media and his Youtube platform. This will allow him to be transparent with his audience and teach them about this proposal. Once there is interest in the community, there can be a strong form of accountability. This is because the community members will be excited for the release of this plugin. Especially if there are builders that would benefit from using these documents. Having specific timelines will allow for a more effective approach to accountability. For this reason, I have suggested including more specific dates in the roadmap.

It is super easy to install and run a plugin on WordPress. The proposer has built a plugin to integrate Cardano into WordPress.

He is now proposing to develop documentation and create tutorials to assist inexperienced developers to \u201cpick out code ot start building\u201d\n\nThis project can attract developers from other languages and current WordPress users to start building on the Cardano ecosystem.
