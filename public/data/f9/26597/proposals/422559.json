The team behind this porposal is one of the leading \u2013 if not THE leading NFT trading platform in the Cardano ecosystem - jpg.store. This is really what the Developer Ecosystem challenge is about \u2013 as it addresses the first question - What are the the tools that we need to prioritize first? Creating an open-source auction smart contract is indeed something that can then be used, reused, modified and reapplied by developers across the entire Plutus-based Cardano world. The proposed solution by the team is to develop a \u201crobust auctions smart contract\u201d that they intend to launch and utilize on their own platform AND it will be made available for any other platform in the ecosystem that wants to use or build upon it. This is critical for me as it shows \u2013 this is not a mere \u201cCatalyst pays, Proposer Gains\u201d type of proposal. This will benefit all Developers of similar and not so similar platforms. The team clearly specifies that a \u201cworking smart contract with the defined features\u201d will be made \u201cavailable to the Cardano community to use as they see fit\u201d. As regards the features, they are well-thought out \u2013 they include the option for auctioning assets with a reserve price, a starting price, a minimum increment. The smart contract itself would allow payment with diverse tokens, including: Cardano\u2019s native currency ADA, fungible tokens and currencies/tokens\u2026 And wait, that is not all \u2013 the smart contract will allow auctions in the English format and the well-known Dutch auction [An English auction is an auction in which you are attempting to be the highest bidder on a listing of which there is only a quantity of one. A Dutch auction is a unique type of auction designed for Sellers with a number of identical items to sell.]\u2026 Exciting times! Can\u2019t wait to see this deployed \u2013 perfectly aligns with Cardano\u2019s mission to become the financial operating system of the world. This will make make it much easier for new developers to build on top of Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of this proposal is very straightforward to assess due to the excellent experience of the team\u2019s already high-profile JPG Store platform \u2013 that I have had the satisfaction of trying out. I did not transact on it, but I have been following NFT listings on it previously and was pleasantly surprised with the platform\u2019s usability and speed. The team is requesting $74,000 in total costs to cover the planned development work on the auction smart contract. It would rightfully seem a large amount \u2013 even for a relatively complex smart contract \u2013 except for one thing. This team knows that these smart contracts will be deployed on their own platform \u2013 and that means their reputation and whole business will be on the line. Hence, the team has commendably included an auditing component of the Plutus contract worth $40,000. The remaining $34,000 is broken down quite reasonably to employee costs, smart contract specialist and overheads. The key human resources are identified: (a) In-house Full Stack Engineer, b. Jonathon Fischoff [Plutus Contract Specialist] and c. Runtime Verification [Auditing Firm]. Runtime Verification is a well-known auditor in the Cardano blockchain space \u2013 and kudos to the team for making this good selection \u2013 and for announcing the name of the auditor. The Overheads as specified include hosting, unexpected delays, marketing costs, tutorial development and more\u2026. I would have liked if the team specified that they would also develop documentation together with the smart contract \u2013 so that it can be easily redeployed - although this might be in the scope of the project. If this proposal is resubmitted, I would advise the team to be clearer about the documentation that could be developed \u2013 as the entire ecosystem is in a \u201clearning stage\u201d \u2013 and the more we can learn together, the better. The timeline of four weeks for development is snappy, followed by four weeks of auditing by Runtime Verification. Great. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team has done an admirable job of identifying a very important lynchpin that is necessary to develop for realizing Cardano\u2019s financial ambitions and for empowering Cardano users to trade assets in a more secure, more equitable and better way. Auctions are in the very focus of JPG store and it is no surprise that they are keen to flesh out a solution and how to achieve it. The plan is easy to follow. The four-week development of the code followed by a four-week audit will be easy to monitor. Development of the planned tutorial \u2013 plus the smart contract\u2019s ultimate deployment on the platform will be easy to verify. The team could have improved the auditability of this proposal by specifying how they intend to deliver (platform?) the entire code of the smart contract AND the results of the audit (these results are critical for the community\u2019s general confidence in the validity of the smart code and any bugs that were discovered). The team has clearly formulated what they want to resolve and how they want to resolve it. I think the solution is effective and the platform has sufficient public channels through which they can inform the community about their progress \u2013 I trust they will use them (this is clearly implied as JPG Store has no use for an auction smart contract that is not used).

This is realistic for the complexity of the task based on my experience writing smart contracts.

The suggested risk is the security of the smart contract, but no mitigating actions are provided. The team is capable of delivering complex projects as they are already running a successful business, but the proposal lacks some details of how it will be implemented and the mitigating actions on the security risk.

The auctioning is primary method by which the traditional physical art is sold by the artists and we have seen the auction houses like Sotheby's and Christie's becoming household names for art enthusiasts. In that respect, it is natural to extend the same logic to digital art for the coming years. Existing smart contract auctioning platforms for NFTs like Burnt Finance on Ethereum has attracted Millions of Dollars in investment from VCs and is constantly attracting users to the platform.\nThis shows there is a need for such platforms on Cardano to enhace the user experience and attract good artists from outside of Cardano ecosystem. The team has already developed jpg.store, one of the most successful NFT trading platform on Cardano, and adding smart contract enabled auction functionality to it will definitely attract more users and even new and famous artists which will be very beneficial for jpg.store and Cardano alike. On that front I think this is a great proposal.\n\nBut the major problem here is that the proposal is submitted under the challenge \"Developer Ecosystem\". The objective of this challenge is for \"Cardano to attract high-calibre Developers and developers have ample resources to work on platforms that suit their interests.\" \nThe project is suggesting that once they open source their platform, developers will be able to copy their code and develop their own such platform but I don't think that's the purpose of this challenge at all.  I may be wrong, but for me the the purpose under this challenge was to develop backend tools which will help new developers, specially the ones not well versed with Haskell or Plutus, create new dApps easily. If you browse the proposals under this challenge, you will realise what was the expectations to create this challenge and many technical proposals abiding to that objective are already submitted in Fund 9.\n\nFor me, this proposal is well suited for the challenge catagory \"Dapps, Products & Integrations\" which would drive the adoption of Cardano and hence will meet the objective of the challenge. It could also have been suited for \"The Great Migration (from Ethereum)\" challenge as it could bring many renoned artists, which are currently selling their art on Ethereum, to the Cardano due to higher scalability and reduced  txn fee.\n\nI hope if the team has to resubmit the proposal in the subsequent fund, they will do it in the appropriate challenge.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team has already completed the NFT marketplace on Cardano with the name jpg.store and it is one of the most popular NFT trading platform on Cardano with more than 2mn transaction already conducted through it.

Open source auction smart contract will be used in JPG Store and made available for other platforms. Besides, using this smart contract will help auction platforms more safe and transparent. Because this smart contract will be open-sourced, it can absolutely be added more functions in the future. In summary, this smart contract will be a necessary tool in the Cardano ecosystem. In particular, JPG Store is currently the largest marketplace on Cardano, so the open source auction smart contract will help JPG Store expand its development capabilities.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team that will carry out this project is the JPG team. They are a professional team of blockchain, smart contract,s and tools. The budget for the development of the auction platform is $74000. They divided the budget into four major categories: employee costs, smart contract specialist, contract audit, overheads. However, they should specifically explain the amount for each category. For example, in contract audit, how much work will they do? What duties must be fulfilled in this category? They also provide details of the amount of work. They intend to do the project in about 4 weeks however they should also give details of the work in each week.

It can be utilized for other protocols. This then can be elevated and pushed forward to something much more through the innovations and expansion of the community. Currently, there is nothing like the said function in any Smart Contacts and this would be immensely useful for all Market Places.

The idea of having an auction-based system for selling and buying NFTs is so exciting. It brings much more fun to the community and could have a great impact on the Cardano community. I also feel that an auction-based system would allow artists to get more out of their artwork and create more of a \"rarity\" for an NFT. I think that if an NFT is popular enough, having an auction instead of a flat price could potentially boost prices much more, and give people a chance to offer more if they would like. This proposal includes great details such as what is to be accomplished, a time frame, and the crew that will be working on this. I fully support jpg.store's ideas to create an auction system on their platform, as seen in the five-star rating I have given.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I strongly agree that given the experience and plan present, it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. Jpg.Store is a well-known platform, and has several great ideas to upgrade and improve their platform for Cardano users. Their proposal is very good and contains a great level of detail as to show why they should receive funding. The idea to create the ability to auction off NTFs is a fantastic idea, and I personally believe it will bring excitement to current and new NFT fans. I like how the team explained that the project will progress over the span of 4 weeks. This puts a good timeline on the project for the team and community to monitor and follow up on. As far as the details provided for who will be working on this project, I love how specific it was. There was no vagueness in this proposal to leave us questioning. I feel that this will be a strong and trustworthy team to carry out the plans of this proposal and make them a new reality.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As I had mentioned above, this team included a great amount of detail in their proposal, and I can see that it was not thrown together last minute. They put thought and effort into their ideas to create an effective proposal. I strongly agree that the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal. This is mostly because of the 4-week plan of action they discussed, and the specifics included when talking about who will be working on this project. I also appreciated how they said they will listen to the input and ideas of their users and stakeholders to ensure the final product receives approval from a vast variety of users. I feel that it is important to receive feedback from the users, as it will ensure that most are happy with the final outcome and will be excited to use the auction system being discussed, and hopefully implemented.
