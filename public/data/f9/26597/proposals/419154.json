The presented implementation schedule is very sparse, a budget breakdown is non-existent and the team is unfortunately not presented apart from the mention of the two roles that would be required by the project.\n\nPersonally, I am confident in the ability of DC Spark to deliver on the scope of the project, yet the purpose of the Catalyst process is to enable a level playing field to all proposers regardless of who they are submitted by. \n\nI really doubt that a proposal submitted by someone else, so lacking in its presentation as this one, would stand up to the scrutiny of the Catalyst PAs and voters alike.\n\nFor instance, I would have really liked to see a budget breakdown that included an estimated number of hours and an hourly rate for instance. That way the whole Cardano community could judge if the investment we are all making as ADA holders is properly managed.\n\nGiven the large investment the Cardano community is making into DC Spark, through the Catalyst process (data available on https://www.lidonation.com/en/project-catalyst/groups ) I would have really expected a more righteous presentation.\n\nThe team has also answered \u201cYes\u201d on both of the new workload-related questions, yet they have failed to provide any details as to how their team will manage the proposals. I view this as having been especially important in this case as the DC Spark team has already been funded for a large number of proposals and is also asking for additional funding in Fund 9 for a large number of new projects.\n\nI personally know that the DC spark team is now upwards of 40 individuals, yet absent such information it\u2019s difficult to properly evaluate the credibility of the assumption that all current and future projects in development will be able to be completed without problems. A clear management plan would have been required and I would have expected to see much more openness about this topic from such a trusted player in the Cardano Space.

No KPIs are given, the definitions of success are very minimally presented and no plans for appropriately presenting the progress of the project to the community is made.

However I would really like to see the team put some effort into reporting the progress of their multiple funded proposals, including potentially this one, to the Cardano community as a whole.\n\nAs important as funding the right development on Cardano is it\u2019s also important that we don\u2019t turn Catalyst into a totally nepotistic system, in which you\u2019re reputation or previous work guarantees funding regardless of the actual proposal.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2169", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 6, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 103, "q0": "Any blockchain as we know is essentially a distributed public ledger.

The team wishes to address this improvement to access of the Cardano blockchain info through the development of a new storage solution that is a thread-safe memory-efficient persistent storage product. Clearly address the challenge. The team has explained that the current state-of-play in Cardano is such that the developer community faces a bottleneck for indexing data through the querying of data from the cardano-node that was not built for this type of historical block serving. Indexers currently need more than 24 hours to finish their tasks.

We do not know who exactly (why dcSpark? It\u2019s easy to put down a name or two). The team already has experience from previous indexing work for Carp and Milkomeda. However, the lack of a budget breakdown is a problem \u2013 as it indicates that dcSpark\u2019s proposal submitters are not devoting sufficient time to writing proposals in accordance with the Catalyst rules.

The team\u2019s description of its members is way too short. It lacks necessary details like the members\u2019 name, position in the project, their related skills and expertise accompanied with a way to verify the information. This feasibility part really needs a lot more information to sound reasonable and be evaluated precisely by the community.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I have to admit that it\u2019s extremely difficult to track the project progress and development without any measuring/tracking method.  In this proposal, there is no mention of any specific KPIs to count on when it comes to the auditing work of the project. I have no idea how the team is going to keep track of their project progress and make sure their pace is fine. Which measuring tools are they going to use to do this? We just don\u2019t know. Their description of the success criteria of the project is also not specific enough. I believe much more information could be included here to clearly point out what the project success is like, and how to tell if it has obtained its objectives or not. These things need to be explained thoroughly for the purpose of auditing the project well.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_4072", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 0, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "We introduce new thread-safe memory-efficient persistent storage with indexing capabilities.
