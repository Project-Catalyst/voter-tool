While the first two stages of this process are well defined in the Catalyst process, there is a large gap in supporting projects over the long term. \n\nThis proposal aims to fill this gap by supporting teams/companies move their idea from a strictly development standpoint to a larger business focused standpoint. What is encouraging about the proposal is that they do not plan to support the teams in pursuit of profit only, but instead want to show a more holistic view by reflecting the cultural and personal settings in which these projects are created. This approach could have a broader impact by refocusing team's efforts to help them achieve broader societal goals, not just to get rich quick. I think that this perspective will not only benefit the projects involved but will likely continue to provide significant value to the users and ecosystem as a whole. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented, it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nFirst off, the team members submitting this proposal are well known in the Cardano community and have been actively participating for awhile. They continue to provide value in all spaces they are in and have built a good reputation for themselves. I also like that the team is focused on improving the Cardano system overall so that all projects can succeed, not just their own. To me, this speaks to the quality and character of the proposers. \n\nSecond, the plan is very well thought out and provides a step-by-step explanation of what is entailed. The hybrid approach of using a module-based problem-based learning and face-to-face mentoring will allow teams to identify those areas most important to their project, learn and explore additional areas of focus that they may have not considered, then having mentorship to organize and prioritize those efforts. This type of plan improves the feasibility as it will be the projects put through the programme that will do a significant portion of the work. This being done from the projects themselves and not just the proposers reduces the burden on the proposers and allows each project to expand as needed. \n\nThird, the team has developed their plan so it is iterative by default, where those that go through the programme are also the ones who can suggest changes, amend, and adapt it to their needs. This avoids the programme being run in a vacuum and instead allows it to be improved at each turn. This type of self-correcting process will also improve the feasibility by having the programme in a constant state of development. \n\nLast, for the budget requested, and the potential impact that this project could have for the community overall, it is very likely a low risk. The budget is also very modest and likely could even been increased to pay an appropriate wage/incentive to the organizers. However, as is, it looks good. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal. \n\nThe entire proposal is peppered with different ways that the team will use to measure their progress and ensure they are on track, including products and tools to be filled by teams, number of engagements, and the auditing of the programme by participants, etc... These types of feedback loops can help the proposers and the community ensure that the programme being delivered is achieving its goals. \n\nThe team commits to updating the community through its Twitter. However, it could be added about what kinds of announcements the intend on making and at what frequency? How would the team ensure that there twitter is getting out to the people it needs to? Also, I would have maybe liked to see more information on the development of the tools and products they will use to provide. Will you be using any open source material? Will you engage the community in developing any tools? \n\nThe reason why I couldn't give full marks here is that I think the measure of success could be better grounded. I understand that completing the programme is a success in itself, but if the goal is to enable participants to \"work on rather than work in their business\" then it is unclear what would actually constitute success. How would you know that they are working \"on\" vs. working \"in\"? Some additional clarity and detail here would certainly increase the points.

Typical services use case for developer, example benefit for service creator and community, \u2026)\nThe proposal clearly articulates the contest, the problem (actual difficulty in business growth Cardano building application ecosystem) and how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem and for all of the stakeholders.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal is well written and clearly demonstrate the experience and the team's commitment, guarantees solidity in deliverables, support transparency and accountability for all Cardano community: The core team consists of 2 people with several years of experience  and with proven professional skill in Linkedin throught given direct link.\nThe proposer team  is well skilled about the business context of the proposal  (business manager and coach)\nThe scope of the solution is very well explained (e.g. how the funds will be spent, what features will be implemented, and so on\u2026) and it\u2019s convincing.\nThe proposer provides a step-by-step plan for the implementation with clear milestones and a defined time horizon (14 weeks),\nThe budget is coherent with the deliverable plan that provides analisys and business mentor sessions to reach small term objective.

I think this is a grea proposal that would have an impact, but I'm not sure if the cardano impact would be that great, because it depends on a variaty of circumstances. This is a business developers course that would be sure to bring value to anyone participating and the hope is more often than not there will be people interested in developing a business in the cardano ecosystem. \nI like the approach of learning by doing, because there's no success without failure. As a developer myself i'd be interested in taking part of such an opportunity since both the creators seem really well versed in the art of starting a business although I'm no expert. I've read quite a few proposals and this one kind of stands out by the fact there are some facts and effor mixed in with all the usual words about success.\nThere's a long term vision and expectation for sure. There's no illusion of making things fast and converting all developers into successfull business owners, which is important.

I love the detail put into the miroboard linked as a resource. It's apparent that the authors know what they're doing and they've been part of this ecosystem atleast long enough to understand most of the big moving parts and players on the board. They do have sensible ideas and have the skills and mentorship quality that would bring this project to it's fruition and success over time. \nThey do seem to value peoples time which is important as they don't make empty promises and are outfront with the fact that a lot of work will need to be put into each separate developer to make him/her a successfull business owner. The authors have the experience to make that happen and all that's left is to see if the people in the ecosystem will respond to the call.\nThe budget breakdown could be better, but it's nothing unreasonable in my oppinion since I've done a couple of rough estimations as these ones here. Accross the whole proposal the budget breakdown is one of the elements that should have received a bit more attentions. I'm speaking from the position of an assessor that has read over 130+ proposals over the last 3 funding rounds and do know what a good budget breakdown and reasoning looks like.\nOverall a decent proposal, but the authors could have made a plan to not need catalyst funding for future proposals, but if this is as they say an MVP, it's understandable.

They have a great deffinition of success in my oppinion that hits the nail on the head. I'm impressed by the sdg rating, although I'm sure they're included in a couple of more categories there, but maybe they've not included them for a reason. \nAnyone interested in the project can find them on twitter and follow along with the projects success. Twitter is a great place to follow along with a project, because most companies update most often there, and you can always get a great community or at least a passionate one there.

This will contribute to bringing a better experience for developers as they will be supported to build up successful apps and grow their business faster. This proposal suggested what tools developers need to prioritize which are the business, financial and organizational tools.  This project will provide developers with a toolkit for improving the level of operation and from that can motivate them to create apps. It first analyzed the problem that most startup businesses face and it suggested a solution to fully exploit the whole potential of the business. It mentioned the benefit that it will bring to businesses. It gave details of who gets involved in this project, how it will be implemented, and its outcomes. Especially, it also highlighted how beneficial or impactful this project is to the development of the Cardano ecosystem. This proposal will help developers find ways to scale up their business faster and more effectively. It also has a Catalyst business ecosystem including case study for Cardano. This is a great point to let developers know more about the success of the Catalyst ecosystem on Cardano and attract them to join. It could say that this project will have a certain impact on the development of the Cardano ecosystem as developers will get to know more about case studies where other developers used to succeed in the Cardano ecosystem. From that developers may be encouraged to engage in Cardano. One thing this proposal could improve is to mention more clearly some challenges this project may face when executing so that everything would proceed smoothly when troubles arise.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the plan to execute this project, it first presented its approaches with two different methods and then tested those approaches in the past before coming to key milestones that are mentioned in detail. It clearly mentioned the description of what to do in each period of weeks and how to do each task. It seems that this plant is quite clear and detailed. About the budget breakdown, it listed what needed to be paid for, but it should mention how to calculate those costs. For example, if it takes $2000 to research and identifies 5 companies, how long this will take to do. About human resources, it provided great detail of important people who will mostly decide its success. Yoram Ben Zvi, a very experienced person in the field of a startup will be a key person to lead the project in the direction it should be. Especially, he used to work on some projects promoting the Catalyst and Cardano communities. This will in some way prove that he will be beneficial for executing this project successfully.

Removing this feature of blockchain technology while optimizing user experience and assisting entrepreneurs in realizing the potential of their emerging firm is precisely the type of move that will speed widespread adoption. The overall concept, project proposal, and overall outlined objectives and milestones sounded reasonable to me, not just for the targeted investment value but also for the overall project proposal. Furthermore, the concept and construction of the project look to be well-designed. A dedicated session focusing on effect is also advantageous because it clarifies the value provided.

There is a detailed explanation of how the project will be carried out, as well as the full procedure that will be followed. The proposers have provided sufficient information to evaluate the proposal's evolution and success. The roadmap will provide key performance indicators for the community to measure the success of the final product as well as checkpoints for the community to audit the proposal.
