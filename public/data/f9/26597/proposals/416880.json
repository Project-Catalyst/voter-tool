However, it doesnt ellaborate onwhat content/syllabus would be taught here, how this course would be strucutured (in terms of teaching method, exams, classes, practical projects) nor how the previous enagagement with developers community would happen, in terms of \n communication/advertisement strategy. \nThe risk managament part is also not done here. Instead, it has the project plan, the same content available in feasbility section/plan part. As suggestions here, it would be nice to include the risks of low engagement, low level of learning, not meeting the desired schedule, possible languages/cultural barries and so on, all with a mitigation plan in place.\nThe value proposition could also be better explained, stating how this course would differ from the existing ones and why having one dedicated to East Africa would be better.

Actually, the team part in the proposal repeats the content of the plan (and of the risk management). proposer only mentions that he'll working with a team of developers from the Plutus Pioneer Program in East Africa, but it doens say anything about his experience or the developers one. As recomentations for future proposals, it would be nice to see here a good description of each team meber, telling their experience, educational background and providing reference links.

His approach is to run haskell/plutus course and workshop along with the roundtable discussion.
