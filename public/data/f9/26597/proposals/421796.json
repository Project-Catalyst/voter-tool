As a developer and proposer, this project resonates with the need to train new developers. This addresses the challenge setting to attract, new developers, to Cardano and increase their number and engagement. The value added to Cardano is through projects being able to find new developers and deliver their projects faster. The program will be delivered through a recruitment platform that the proposer owns called Alkemy which prepares developers for corporations therefore the structure is in place and should the project be a success the proposers will come back for additional funding in future funding rounds, this is also a continuation of a previously funded project.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, the proposer provides Linkedin profiles of all team members. The proposer is an owner of a business that trains developers for corporations in Latin America and the project will be delivered in coordination with the veteran community advisors (Alex Pestchanker and Rodolfo Miranda), the instructors are experienced Plutus developers Sebastian Pabon and Luis Restrepo, they are both are Plutus pioneers and teachers within the community. The project plan is split into 3 phases: Setup, Recruitment, and Training, which will run over 7 months. The budget is set at $55k which will pay for a project manager at $25/h, a Teacher at $60/h, and a Mentor at $40/h. The extent of the plan is adequate and gives a solid 4 months to focus on learning Plutus with an experienced teacher. The hourly rates are competitive for Latin America. The proposers will target 100 devs to join the program and 37 to finish the program after which they will be ready to be placed into projects, the placement costs will be covered in a separate funding request. The team will also provide living assistance to the candidates accepted into the program. The proposal is not technical in nature, as no new software will be built, at the end of it there will be 37 new developers ready to join Cardano projects. The proposer considers the main risk to be dissertation (quitting) of students midway, which will be mitigated by focusing on promising candidates during recruitment into the program and potentially offering monetary recompensation to ensure the right candidates join. The proposal comes from an experienced team in delivering educational material, the project will be delivered in consultation with Veteran Community Advisors in Cardano and the instructors have experience in delivering Plutus courses. Therefore, I am confident that the team will be able to deliver the project to a high standard.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, a roadmap is provided and broken down into three logical sections: Setup, Recruiting, and Training. The KPIs are aligned to the roadman and will track the number of devs in the program, % churn rate during training, and the number of devs concluding and integrating a Catalyst project. The team will also collect feedback from the devs and project owners at the end. The success of the project will be to connect Catalys projects looking for developers with the newly trained developers, this addresses the challenge objective to increase the number of devs in the Cardano ecosystem. A dedicated project manager will track the progress and report back to the community.

As a developer I do like the idea, and I was a part of a simmilar academy, although mine was with the span of 1 year. In that regard 4 months might be a bit too quick to learn all the things, but on the other hand they will be learning speciffic languages and platforms, so that's a bit easier.\nI do think this proposal will have an impact for latin america and it seems the proposers have done the research and have previous experience doing this since 2020. By the looks of it this project is a perfect match for the developer ecosystem challenge and totally matches with the challenge settings - litteraly developing developers. The proposers have experience and outline precisely how thy will bring value to the ecosystem.\nThe key metrics like churn rate and success rate of developing starting work are all standard and I can say this with certainty having seen over 140 proposals. I didn't see anything about this project scaling and even so it's a good proposal and if they'll be commning back next funds this can be treated as a proof of concept so I believe depending on their success if funded, they'll think about scaling eventually, but it's good to keep things simple in the begining.\nThis will be an impactfull proposal for the LATAM region and I am a bit envious about the opportunity those juniour devs will have. I especially like the idea of having your living expences covered for the work you put in and getting half way.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have given all the necessary links and details about skills and experience so I was able to verify they wil have nop problem executinig the strategy described in the proposal. The only thing that's left uncertain is finding an experienced dev willing to generate the content, but given the incentives and general desire by the community to grow I don't think this will be an issue. It's a regular occurance in telegram and discord chats for people to find work or help one another.\nThe budget is outlined clearly in a more or less standardized way - hours * pay rate and a segregation in tasks measured in time so I have nothing to add there. The general roadmap containing of 3 parts - generating content, screening candidates and starting the program seems prety straightforward and having been part of something simmilar, I'm familliar with the steep learning curve and people dropping out because it's hard so it's nice that the proposers have a realistic expectation of the outcome.\nThe proposers have given a sensible plan for executing each step of the plan and given their credentials and previous experience, combined with the LATAM statistics, I don't have a doubt they'll succeed in their endeavour.\nOne thing I noticed is the project is in sync with what's already being done, because they aren't blind to the fact free resources already exist, but aren't wrong IMHO in their estimation that's not enough, because you need to have full focus for a time to get things done practically.\nI think this is entirely feasible and I'd say probably solution so I'd vote for them and wish them good luck.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The authors have a plan of having a project manager handling the coordination and any problems that might arise, which probably will. They'll also be the main gateway between the academy as I call it and the community and Alkemy.\nThe roadmap is short and clear but well broken down and I'd say quite practical for anyone wanting to follow along. I do hope the proposers create or join many of the already present discord and telegram channels to get in touch with people that can help in any way shape of form, because there are plenty of enthusiasts.\nThe Kpis are standard ones - numbers of people recruited, churn rate, successful finised devs and so on. There's a clear problem statement and an even clearer and well described and planned out solution so I see no problems in auditability or the general succes of this project. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2463", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7431, "q0": "Alkemy provides solutions for technology companies to spot the best talent and equip them with the skills they need to join the engineering team. Through this project, Alkemy aims to be more specific, getting developers involved in Catalyst and helping them connect with tech companies. With such orientation, the project is perfectly suitable for this Challenge\nWith a closed process from program design, screening and introduction. Alkemy has enough experience to create a suitable program for corporations in need of recruitment, and combined with the LATAM community attracts many developers. Regarding this part, can the project clearly state the direction of program development? What specific knowledge is included? What are the advantages and disadvantages compared to other ecosystems? How to encourage potential developers to participate? Encouraging their migration from other ecosystems is clearly not easy, there is a big barrier in terms of programming languages, habits and unfinished products.\nRegarding the design of the program to suit Catalyst, I completely agree with the presented project orientation, with prompting questions and really suitable options. At the same time, the project combines with another book proposal in this fund, helping to provide the information presented in the program is highly aggregated. I appreciate this association, it shows you are seriously committed to efficiency.\nAs for the risk, I would like to add another risk, employers are not confident enough about the developer's ability after completing the training, they are too new to Haskell/Plutus. The solution is, let's create a Haskathon contest for experienced developers to rub and show their capabilities, both helping them to have practical knowledge and helping employers choose the right candidate. member suitable for the company\nOn this part, I rate 5 points, in addition to the above sharing, all the rest convince me\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project is planned to run for 7 months with three major items: program design and setup, recruitment and training.

The total application budget is $55,950 ~ 5.6% of the full Challenge fund, a number that is appropriate for a 7-month project. At the same time, the team is too strong, with 6 key members, has a lot of experience, capacity in training, recruiting, deep understanding of the Cardano ecosystem, has experience in conducting Catalyst. Behind is a strong team of Alkemy and LATAM, ready to advise the project. Another plus point is that the project has a specific plan for a top instructor, Sebastian Pabon and Luis Restrepo are two perfect candidates, they have extensive knowledge of Haskell/Plutus.

This project effectively addresses the challenge by engaging developers outside of our ecosystem to participate in the development of projects on Catalyst. Ensuring jobs for Plutus learners is also one of the things that programmers want when participating in Cardano. This project not only provides free knowledge and skills to programmers but also helps them get a job after completing the course.
