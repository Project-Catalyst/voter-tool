That's an amazing idea and the proposal is up to par as well. Regarding the challenge, I'm not too sure it's in the right category although it does cover some of the challenge settings so I can't be too strict there.\nAs I see it it could be good marketing that would spread the word about cardano. Charles Hoskinson does say cardano has a problem with getting the message out, so I do believe this is a good idea. Besides that people love documentaries and inspiring real stories so I'm all for this experiment. \nConsidering the budget this is a no-brainer for be, because the value to cost ratio is simply too good to ignore. I have a tendancy to trust people more when they are creating content on youtube because you stand there with your name reputation and face infront of the world and that has consequences, so I respect content creators. Especially the ones boostring the cardano name and showing the world what the community has done and what can come from this community effort.\nI don't think we need to worry about scaling because documentaries are usually a one of thing, so there's not much need for thought on the scaling front. Overall I like this proposal and the probable impact it's going to have. I also Like how active the spanish speaking part of the community is, because I've already seen quite a few proposals that offer their services in spanish and english. I am sure this is one of the ways to move forward and a documentary does seem like a good idea.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have provided their credentials and links to verify all the listed skills in the proposal so I managed to verify them without an issue and can say they do have the necessary knowledge to get this done. This is benefitial because it brings the credability of the whole project and any further projects (especially if this one succeeds) up a lot. The authors of the proposal know what they need to do to get the work finished and have planned out a reasonable roadmap with specific milestones and have an hourly breakdown of work, which is proving to be the standard to all proposals because they're easy to compare and check if the hourly rate is within the recommended bounds as this one is. \nThis is really helpfull for the assessors like me, because we don't waste time calculating the hourly rate before assessing the budget, so .. thanks for that.\nThere's good plan for implementation and the timeframe of the whole project seems reasonable to me, but keep in mind I am a developer and I know nothing about these things, just logically it seems like enough time. I like the stages breakdown because it gives me a clear idea of what needs to be done, and gives me knowledge about how are things done when doing a production more or less, so I'll keep that knowledge for the next assessments, so thank you about that as well.\nThey already have all team members necessary to get things going, which is a big improvement over proposals that need to find the people right after they get the funding, which is way harder.\nOverall this seems to me like a feasible proposal and as I already mentioned the value/cost ratio is too good to pass up. Good luck and keep up the great work!\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I don't know the first thing about measuring the success of a production except for the view count and profits when thinking about movies, but the proposers have listed quite an extensive list of metrics they will follow to gage the adoption and interest so all goot metrics and KPIs wise.\nThe roadmap with milestones give a good map in the mind of any supporter of the project so they know what to expect and when exactly and thus are enabled to follow along with the project updates and timeline and eventual success.\nProposers have a good problem statement, a simple yet effective solution to build a documentary which is quite nice and the first proposal of this sort I've seen so kudos for that. By the looks of it they do know what they're doing and will involve the local community as they already have done through the hackathons.\nNothing left to do besides stating the obvious - this is an auditable proposal and I recommend voting for it since...for the third time value/cost ratio = amazing!\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2463", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 3, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6124, "q0": "The proponent raised the issue of the Cardano Community through the developers, but the world is still largely unknown. Much of the work in progress remains unseen outside of the Cardano community. The proponent set out to solve the problem: produce a TV series and documentary, telling the story of Plutus Hackaton, in Argentina, and its effect on the ecosystem, developers, connecting stories. stories of this community and tell them to the world. The proposed impact on the challenge was posed and described in rich detail. First of all, the author has posed a challenge here. Prove that the author is a competent person, knows what he will do, how to do it, and is on target to execute the project well. There will be 2 products to share Hackaton: Live Streaming and Documentary, bringing it closer to the community, driving more developers to participate in Cardano. However, there is still very little audio-visual material and no Spanish. Besides, the author has mapped the path for 7 specific phases. To create support for hackathon development: will need a document showing that the developer ecosystem in Cardano, telling the story of its network, will address concerns of new developers entering the Ecosystem. The team believes that the best tools to reach out are movies and streaming, and attract new people through video. Proposing specific solution. Besides, the team has recognized the potential risks in the proposal and has many solutions, minimizing the risks when the proposal is implemented.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal outlines a plan for this proposal very clearly and in detail. Milestones are established through 7 stages for each specific activity. The work to be done in the project is analyzed in detail and explained in detail by month and week. We know what work will be done to achieve the ultimate success of the project. Next is the budget. The proposal requires a budget of $5,780. In my opinion, this is quite a small amount of requirements for the project to do. Film production is a complex project that requires a lot of staff, tools, time, etc. A reasonable budget ensures that the work will be carried out smoothly and sustainably. In addition, the team provided a detailed and coherent breakdown of the budget for each job. We know how each budget is allocated. Specifically: the salaries of producers, directors, technicians, locations... are estimated on an hourly rate, throughout the project. Finally, about the core team members. We know the members are all people with the right skills and experience to do the work on the project. At the same time, the author also provides a text presentation about each member, and attaches a link to let us know more about the history and experience of the members that the proposal has presented. In general, the plan of the proposal is very good, the budget is transparent and the members are skilled and experienced, increasing the feasibility of the proposal.

About the end product, that's to be expected, the success of the project, the success of this video: an inspiration for developers new to Cardano. At the same time, the detailed step-by-step roadmap and broken budget make it easy to audit the successful progress of the project.

New cardano and blockchain developers looking for knowledge about the working environment and its constantly developing opportunities can use this livestream and documentary production as a resource. If executed properly, this would unquestionably be a significant revolution for the entire catalyst ecosystem. I do concur, however, that the plan successfully addresses the issue.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal includes a brief introduction to the team members, information about their varied professional backgrounds supplied through their personal LinkedIn profiles, and a published documentary that increases the possibility that the project will be implemented successfully. Additionally, it is clear that the crew is well-versed in the catalyst ecosystem and actively involved in the Cardano community. The plan also outlines a detailed roadmap for the various tasks, objectives, and deadlines it expects outcomes to be attained.\nThe proposal also highlights that the project is intended for the Cardano community and the wider world, but it omits a reference to the language that will be used in the production. The main justification for this is that majority of the references provides as attachment are in Spanish, when the cardano community and entire catalyst ecosystem is home to a wide range of people from many cultures, nationalities, and languages. Perhaps a linguistic indication and a specified target audience will help documentary and streaming production soar to incredible altitudes.\nThe proposal's budget breakdown only shows that money will be used primarily to pay crew members' salaries for shooting and transmitting the Plutus Hackathon. When it highlighted that the initiative is aimed towards the developer community, financing for advertisements, promotional materials, and equipment is not cited. However, the total budget requested for this project is extremely reasonable, and with the evidence of published work, I agree that the suggested plan can be effective.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal specifies the growth metrics for the project, which will be assessed by the number of viewers and level of interaction on visual platforms as well as participation in hackathons and ecosystem events.

If we want to grow as a Community we need to have our own story, our own experience and our own way of telling it.
