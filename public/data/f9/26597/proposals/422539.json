The proposers goal is to update an already existing library they created with the changes that came with the \"Vasil\" hardfork on cardano. I remember reviewing their poposal in fund 6 and I'm really happy it made it in and now it's evolving as and has progressed so much in the past months.\nThis proposal is definitely in the right category and covers most of the challenge settings. This library not ony will have an impact, but already has one and companies are using it already. It's done in typescript which is one of the most popular languages for development so I'd say adoption wouldn't be a problem for them. Future challenges will be met I'm sure, but I'd also would have been glad to see more people joining the team, but It may be too early for that to happen, but I'll make it a point to follow along and check on their growth from now on.\nMore libraries are always necessary in any development ecosystem and it's nice to see so many different libraries and frameworks being grown in the cardano dev ecosystem. This is one more puzzle piece thats proving to be a cornerstone. I don't see anything missing from the impact portion of the proposal although I do have some things to mention in the feasibility section. Overall an impactful proposal I'd be happy to recommend and support.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team hasn't provided their names besides @ashisherc and without names it's harder to verify their skills and credentials, but that's not as big of a concern because they already have a working library which is good enough of a validation for me that they can update their own library. Still it would have been nice to post github profiles or linkedin credentials or listed the skills to be able to check them out.\nThey have the number of members working on the update and because it's the same two developing the library I would suppose their estimation is probably quite accurate. Continuing with the timeframe wich is about a month, considering the work they've already done and provided I'd say as a developer I agree the timeframe is reasonable for a library update. Tests and heuristics might take a while though.\nThe budget breakdown is salary based, so the hourly rate is reasonable, but the milestones and tasks breakdown is lacking completely. I do realize they have a prety clear plan on what needs to be done for the udpate, but It would have made a better proposal to have milestones and separate tasks breakdown for users to follow and because it's helping the supporters of the project to have a mental picture of the work that needs to be done. Technicalities would also have been interesting for me as a  developer to have been listed.\nI do find it a bit strange the authors haven't listed any possible challenges they may face and possible solutions to them, because I always find  it a good idea to be prepared for unforseen circumstances and so forth, but it's nothing critical, just something that would make a better proposal.\nOverall the project is in sync with what's already out there and are augmenting the features. This is a feasible project with the exception of the few small caveats mentioned.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditability wise I don't see an issue, because anyone with an internet connection can open the github page and have a look at the progress during august. I didn't see any metrics, but to be honest I don't know how to measure people taking advantage of a library update, so I don't put too much emphasis on that particular subject.\nThere's a clear problem - need to update the library because of protocol changes. There's a clear solution - do the update, so it's pretty straghtforward.\nOne thing that I would have liked to see in the proposal was a possible channel for the community to provide feedback one they start using the updated library. Maybe there already is, but it wasn't mentioned in the proposal.

Is this proposal a motojos proposal or does it solve future challenges and help the Cardano community grow more and more. This solution is implemented by the author by upgrading the Typhon Js library to support the changes of the upcoming Vasil hard fork.

The risk of this challenge is completely zero as this version of the sanctuary is always being upgraded and edited.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The timeline of this project was released by the author in late August and early September. It has 3 main features: support for ref scripts, support for inline data, and support for Plutus V2. , these features should always be upgraded if it is released together and will receive maintenance updates. The progress of this project is easy to track because when we update the app on the system, we will be able to calculate the number of people who have downloaded the software to the computer, and the number of participants.

Today is July 3, which is also the launch date of Cardano\u2019s Vasil testnet. In a series of IOHK developer tweets, the team confirmed a successful testnet hard fork. I congratulate the team, this is an important step towards the mainnet upgrade set to take place at the end of July. Vasil hard fork brings some major changes to the Cardano network, improvements to the smart contract language Plutus, for dApp developers, reduce block transmission latency and introduce \u201cdiffusion pipelining\u201d to the Cardano blockchain.\nThis proposal raised an important issue and the scale of impact was relatively large. Developers will need compatibility with Vasil to create more efficient smart contracts and DApps. Typhonjs is a pure-js Cardano wallet library, a platform for Web development, dApp building, mobile apps and more.\nThe proposed solution will solve this problem. By upgrading the Typhonjs library (mainly reference scripts, supporting inline Plutus V2 and Plutus Datum) to support the changes of this Vasil hard fork. This solution will create a great experience that encourages developer adoption, increased productivity and creativity. Not only that, but it also attracts new developers working on platforms that match their interests. From the above, I see that this proposal meets the \"Developer Ecosystem\" challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The upgrade process takes place in 1 month, it will be released in late August or early September. The author has stated 3 important features as well as 3 work contents in the plan. However, to be better, the author should detail the implementation process of each of those features.\nThe proposed budget represents 4.5% of the total Challenge budget. This money is used to pay salaries for 2 Devs and 1QA. However, in order for this budget to be more complete, the author should add an explanation and a basis for calculations to make it easier for readers to understand and compare. Because I had a chance to read the proposal \"Typhon Wallet Mobile App\" by the team at Fund 9. I took an example of the salary cost of a QA engineer. The project \"Typhon Wallet Mobile App\" was developed in 6 months and the budget for a QA engineer's salary is $25,000. Meanwhile, this project develops in 1 month and a QA engineer's budget is $8,000. If calculated according to the average salary cost of 1 month, there will be a difference. Therefore, the author should add an explanation for each expense (maybe due to the nature of the job or the number of hours worked..etc).\nAs for the development team part, I found that their experience and capabilities perfectly match the goals of the proposal. The team created TyphonJs with the funding of Fund 6, experienced in wallet projects on Cardano.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The author described how to track the progress of the project. Tracked each upgrade and shared progress reports with the Catalyst team. The proposal's progress will also be seen in Github PRs for the existing library repo.

The Solution section that the proposal offers is quite detailed and explained in depth the technical field. How the project works is also specifically mentioned in the proposal.

In addition, the project implementation plan also needs to have a specific and realistic timeline to complete the given tasks. The proposal must show a reasonable plan not only in terms of what they will complete but also how it needs to be. The proposal should also include details of technical aspects such as architecture, language, and technology required to implement the plan. Moreover, The proposers should also clearly define the positions and the number of people needed to implement the proposed project. A detailed plan will help the proposal be appreciated by the community for the potential of the project.\nOverall, the total cost proposed by the team for the project is quite reasonable. However, the community needs a more specific budget plan to consider the reasonableness of the budget. The budget plan only mentions salaries for employees. Budgets should be broken down and clearly bulleted to be used for activities. The team should clearly state the cost of the required assets in the plan.\nIf possible, the team should be more specific about the profile of the project leader.
