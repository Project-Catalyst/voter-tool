This is an interesting concept. The proposers attached an example game called cryptozombies.io,  which is a game that teaches development in Solidity from the basics.  I tried the game out, and it looks really engaging, and I could definitely see myself spending a couple of days or more engaged and if I learned anything, I would probably stick with it for longer.  A similar game teaching new developers how to code in Haskell and Plutus would be a value-add for the Cardano ecosystem. The project could scale quickly as once the game is released, anyone can access and play it online. The proposals might return back for additional funding if they are not able to generate enough income from the game directly.  I think there's a lot of focus in Cardinal right now on how to create metaverse for its users; however this type of approach of creating a game to teach developers is very beneficial for the future growth of Cardano as new developers get trained while playing a game", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Two developers and a marketing person are needed to deliver the project. One of the developers and the marketing person are submitting this proposal, and they are looking to hire one other developer. The proposers provide their names, but do not provide a bio or links to social media or LinkedIn profiles. Searching for one of the proposals online leads to his LinkedIn page, which suggests some experience with development and blockchain. However, given that the main developer has been learning blockchain only for the last two years and most of it was in Solidity,  it seems insufficient to develop a platform and develop the teaching material in a programming language such as Haskell. The proposed plan comprises 6 bullet points with key things they aim to achieve and by when. There is no detailed planning about how they aim to achieve it, no mention of the technology they need, and no mention of architecture. The delivery timeline is three months and a total budget of $80,000 of which $60,000 is split between two developers at a salary of $10,000 per month and a marketing person receiving $20,000 over the same three months. There is no budget allocation to the project plan; therefore, it is impossible to determine whether the budget is reasonable for the tasks.  I can only say that $10,000 per month is a competitive rate for an experienced developer on the blockchain. I did not get the impression that the proposer is very experienced in developing on blockchains. The proposers are confident that they will be able to deliver the game but highlight that there's a risk of delays. Overall, I think that idea is good, but the proposals do not provide enough information to be confident that they can deliver this within three months", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposers aim to track KPIs based on how many people sign up and purchase in-game items. There are no intermediate KPIs to measure progress, and the measure of success would be hundreds of people playing the game. There's no mention of communicating with the Community via social channels or if the source code on GitHub. There's little information provided in the auditability section to give comfort that the project can be audited.Therefore I do not think the project can be Audited effectively. This started with a very good idea, followed by a weak implementation plan and the auditability section that is completely lacking. I recommend the proposals to persevere and improve these last two sections\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2123", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 3, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3561, "q0": "It's a good idea having a learning experience feel like a game and I've read quite a few simmilar proposals in the past 2 funds. I couldn't estimate the impact that would have on the development ecosystem because I still haven't seen such a solution in play, but I'm sure there will be candidates to learn this way. I found any specific description of the game missing in the proposal and I'd say that's important for any game. There's a clear problem that needs to be solved: more developers learning how to do cardano dapps, but the solution is unclear to me after reading the proposal, except for the notion of a game that will teach you. I did like the linked game for solidity, but I didn't understand if the proposer wants to copy the game or develop something completely different.\nIf a game is implemented I'm uncertain if it will bring value to the cardano ecosystem because I don't know what the game will be. I don't see the author considering any challenges along the way which seem unreasonable to me. There will be many challenges and having a game plan is sure to bring you to a better outcome. Prepare for the worst and hope for the best. The proposal idea matches the challenge settings, being a game to create developers, so I'd say it's in the right challenge category.\nAs an assessor with over 140 assessments behind him, I can definitely say there are a lot of details and crucial parts missing from this proposal and after reading it, I'm left with a lot of unanswered questions that I'll discuss in the feasibility section.\nOverall I'm not sure about the impact of an unknown game will have on the dev communiy.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer/s hasn't put their skills or linkedin or any kind of tech profiles up for verification, so I wasn't able to verify any of them so that brings down the feasibility of the proposal down a bit. Another thing missing is an accurate or any description of the game rules or any idea of how it's hoing to look like, what main paradigms and lessons it's going to focus on.\nThe marketing budget could use a bit of a breakdown because usually marketing budgets depend greatly on the methodologies you want to use. Be it social marketing or ad campaigns or direct marketing or videos or one of the hudred other methods to get the word out. In my experience the marketing budget can span from 1k to 50k all with reasonable arguments behind it, which are not provided, so I can't assess if it's a valid price to pay or not.\nAs a developer I'm a proponent of technical details and the fact that no framework stacks or languages or technologies are listed in the proposal is concerning to me, and makes me sceptical for the projects success. Everything I know about the game is that it's going to have a board, which I don't think is good enough for the aforementioned reasons.\nNo plan for monetization - subscription / pay to win / one time purchase was presented. There's only once centance about purchasing some unspecified game items. \nMy suggestion for the authors of the proposal is to look at another excellent proposals that have won the croud over and learn how to do it better for the next funding round.O verall I lack the information to say with any amount of certanty if this proposal is feasible or not. I wish you all good luck and urge you to come back and try again.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Not auditable, no information is provided that will enable the possible supporters of this project to follow along with the progress and implementation.

I don't know the SDGs by heart and I find a list of numbers (4,5,8,9,10) hard to understand. \nOverall there's a good problem statement and poor solution to address that problem.

As an educator myself, although focused mainly on childhood education, I have seen the vast beneification of gamified learning in certain circumstances. There is a whole generation of students who understand the basics of block based coding now, thanks to the magnificent work of MIT labs on Scratch since 2007. Hence, the value of a well implemented gaming platform to learn blockchain for adults, or possibly even older students, has the potential for success and transformative impact.\nThe proposal continues to describe the knock on effects of more people knowing blockchain, in that they in turn might create products and add future value to the Cardano ecosystem in the long run. They also caveat that some people may just be attracted to the earning potential of the game, however, they will \u2018subconsciously\u2019 be learning the content anyway.\nSome key aspects are missing from the proposal. In particular a mock-up, wireframe or even description of the game. The proposers describe that the \u2018game will be similar to Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne,\u2019 both of which I\u2019m familiar with and have a large following around the world. One would hope they don\u2019t infringe on the copyright of these games, yet they are enticing enough to attract many players into the blockchain sphere. The proposers list that the concept has been in development for a while, so it would be highly beneficial to the PAs and voters to see some sort of mockup of the game to truly see its potential impact.\nOverall, I see true value in game based learning and gamification of e-learning materials, I rate this proposal 4 stars for impact.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In terms of feasibility this project offers far less details than I\u2019d like to see to be able to confidently see this proposal as potentially successful.

Names are listed for two of the three positions, but no additional information. How do we know the background and experience of these people to attest to their potential success with this project? They provide links to the ADA makerspace, possibly the vehicle for their creation, however, it would be more confident with some biographical, background or LinkedIn information about their staff. In addition to the salaries, no money has been laid out for hosting, or infrastructure costs for the game. \nOverall, there are some concerns about the feasibility of this proposal. I feel not enough detail and time has gone into giving voters and PAs enough information to make this decision. I rate this proposal 3 stars for feasibility.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal has fairly brief details provided in terms of auditability.

This public accountability is a great step towards building voter confidence and transparent auditability. It\u2019s not specifically listed, but I\u2019m hoping the project financials and recruitment information will be publicized through this channel also.\nIn terms of the game\u2019s success they hope to see 100s of people playing specifically to learn blockchain, and thousands playing because they love the game. They\u2019ve not stated how they will collate this criteria for success, perhaps an in game survey, or a record of certain levels passed per users? This would be valid information for the further development, but is missing.\nFinally, a confidence boost is that this project is a continuation of the already successfully innovated ADA Makerspace brand and learning platform.
