Developers will aslwo be able to build on top of contracts and create their own for others to learn from. This is a proposal that would impact the community moderayely because there are places where people can learn by example like this one: https://solidity-by-example.org/. It's going to be nice if there is such an updated repository for cardano as well. \nI mentioned a moderate impact be cause I didn't find any mention of supporting version of the created contract working on different versions of the platform they run on, or at least their updades to the newest version where a different kind of features could be available, which I think is an important part of the described solution if it's going to be practical. As a developer, I can say that versioning is important since you can't learn by example if the example isn't running for you on the specific version you're using. That's a big problem that every developer faces and an educational platform should keep this problem in mind.\nThe proposal could be able to overcome this challenge, but some more thought needs to be put in for the greater impact. Currently it's certainly not a bad proposal, but the possible usability is questionalbe. I believe the proposal is mathcing the challenge settings of the developer ecosystem challenge and would definately help grow developers grow and learn. This process can be optimized even further though. \nOverall, IMHO this is a good proposal with moderate impact.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I like the timeline and roadmap of the project as it shows an iterative approach to the final solution which I can get behind. There are more than enough links left to find out more about the creator of vrooli who will be bringing this project to life and he has the necessary skills to finish this project. I do have some concerns about the time of one person as a resource and that considering there are more than one proposals, his time might be split. The budget is reasonable considering the 20 hour work week and the the whole price is definately reasonable. \nIntegrating DIDs and a place where smart cotracts can be potentially ran inside a ui instead of API calls would be great and an amazing benefit towards people learning. There's a realistic timetable for completing the work that looks good to me as a developer and can estimate the work is doable for 20 hours a week in the specified order and time.\nI think there are more risks to this project than just not having enough time to build it, because the bigger challenges to all projects usually concern adoption and I saw no mention of that in the project. This proposal is in sync with what's already been done, or in this case not done, because a repository of smart contracts and a future possible place to execute and test them out will be of great help.\nOverall this is a more or less feasible proposal for the reasons mentioned above.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Considering this is an open-soruce project I predict no problems in auditability since anyone with internet available will have access and would be able to check the progress.\nA clear problem statement - developers learn better with examples, which I totally agree with.

This could have a major impact on the developer ecosystem since it will increase development efficiency and productivity, which is directly related to Cardano and its dApps healthy growth. Moreover, the proposer pretends to develop a platform, similar to GitHub, where specifically Plutus and Solidity developers can establish contact and help each other during the early stages. If you take into account the difficulty to find information for these languages, this could be great for every single developer in the Cardano ecosystem.

He presents a detailed milestones roadmap in which every activity has a time limit but at the same time, it provides the proposer with a great level of flexibility so that any problem could be solved without interrupting the course of the project. Therefore, the road map is quite reachable and balanced. Regarding the budget and having in mind that the project is being carried out by a single person, it provides the community with enough information and a rate of 45 USD/hour could be considered reasonable. If an objection should be made, for me there is not enough information about risk management and how will the proposer deal with them.

This is because knowing the number of active users, for example, allows the proposer to track the evolution of the development community.

Many developers are plagued with different kinds of problems most especially in their early journey into coding and most times, practical examples and pre-packed codes help in such kind of situation. In the case of Cardano native Smart Contract Language (Plutus, Marlowe), there's not enough documentation from resource hubs like stackoverflow and the few we can find there, are not well documented. This is a problem that need urgent attention by the Cardano community as well as the developers.\n\nThe proposer intends to provide a solution in form of an open library for Smart Contracts. A no code prototyping and automation platform for and on Cardano. The solution will therefore make available Smart Contracts, APIs, data, interfaces among others. These will be a feature-packed open source smart contract library with advanced search functionality that will help developers to streamline the discovery of smart contracts and allow for further contributions and improvements.

Some of those KPIs are Design plan for UX, API and server (completed), API and server upgraded, search engine for smart contracts with all metrics and ability for smart contracts to be forked/upgraded, Editor with syntax highlighting (Working), stable launch,..... among others. All these metrics are especially relevant to the underlying project and most are verifiably implemented already. The budget provided is well articulated/explained and the amount requested is fair and reasonable. My only concern is the team, since according to the proposer, the project will be developed by one person whose contact details (link was provided) and considering the huge work that seem to be involved in the project, I'm  a bit concerned if he alone can implement same effectively (Although he is a fullstack developer).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Having provided a well defined realistic timeline, KPIs will be tracked automatically and freely accessible in real time.

By giving more accessibility to resources via a free open-source library service, developers can more easily find and use smart contracts for their projects resulting in a higher level of convenience and time save in development process. In my view, the project is similar to Github, but specifically for smart contracts, which as pointed by the proposal, can be really valuable to the developer ecosystem. One aspect that has not been addressed sufficiently (in my opinion) is convincing users to use the service, since the library will be pretty much empty at the start and it will depend on users writing their own smart contracts to fill up the library resulting in little incentive of using the service at the start. Regardless, I still think that the idea can provide value to the Cardano developer ecosystem, or even well outside of Cardano.

This library will be used by developers for making  smart contracts. The library will be free, open-source, and simple to use. I think this isn't a bad idea, since smart contracts are hard to find. This way people would be able to share, make and get feedbacks which is a good thing. There would be an API tool which would have a free tier and paid tier which would be used to server costs, so it's understandable. This tool will be used as a way to access contracts from your application, which is very nice. And the library will have an option to download it as a csv file, which makes it better. Having something to make smart contracts and being able to learn from examples would be a great thing, developers could really benefit from this library and learn something new.

The author aims to build an open-source library where people can search, share and get feedback on smart contracts. I think that such a product is absolutely necessary and will be a game changer for the Cardano community mainly for two reasons: first, the difficulty of Plutus Smart Contract Platform which is based on Haskell (defined by the developers community as a language by the mathematicians for the mathematicians) and the lack of documentation and community may be really intimidating and discouraging to developers to even consider the idea. However, having a platform that will concentrate all available documentation and needed support from the community in one single location will eliminate these obstacles and I see no reason why developers wouldn\u2019t want to join, especially experienced developers who can develop and test their own projects with the help of community. Secondly, and this was my favorite part, the author proposes a new method of implementation, the usage of routines. Basically, a routine is a sequence of instructions which can be called and used repeatedly while executing a task. This method makes the program shorter, much easier to write and understand. The simplicity of the routines combined with an environment where early-stage smart contracts can be developed and critiqued will draw a lot of new developers as well. In addition, the proposer has plans to develop many more features in the future which will make the developers experience even better. All things considered, I think that the impact of this project is completely aligns with the objectives of the challenge therefore it deserves maximum marks.

After researching a little deeper I can say with complete confidence that the author is more than capable to see this project through. Moreover, this proposal seems to be part of a much larger project which is called \u201cVrooli\u201d and already has an MVP up and running. As for the timeline and milestones, the proposal claims to deliver in 16 weeks, 20 hours workload per week divided in 7 parts. Each part includes the tasks that will be performed which in my opinion are realistic and achievable. In terms of the budget breakdown, the author has requested 45 USD per hour which I think is reasonable considering the deliverables.
