Additionally as the proposer has mentioned, it will likely involve immigration compliance concerns. While this is a risk to the proposal, it could also be a positive step for Cardano, as open source decentralized technology can showcase to regulators and compliance officers that we can build better alternatives too many of their existing systems. They are more likely to look deeply into this technology, only when it becomes necessary to do so, and this could be a small but significant step in that direction. The budget is also a small ask, for a project that could have a large impact. This could eventually scale up to multiple universities around the world adopting solutions like this one using rootswallet https://www.rootsid.com/ or other Cardano DID alternatives like Atala Prism or IAMX ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer is the supervisor of immigration compliance at the Univ. of Arkansas, and therefore uniquely qualified to make this proposal a reality. The proposer has also provided sufficient information about their technical skills and abilities and relevant background knowledge of this proposal.

The proposing team has the skills and resources required to implement this proposal, with a clear understanding of the technology and architecture.

In addition, the team will be providing \"contributions in both document and source code\"  provided at the end of the project, as well as setting up a discord channel. Due to the limited scope of this project, and the relatively low budget amount requested (compared to other larger catalyst projects) I do not believe monthly reporting to Catalyst is critical for this project, as the Github repository should provide enough transparency for those interested, and more documentation will be provided upon completion of this project.

This is a wonderful example of a real-world application of blockchain and a successful trial would deliver a great message to the developers\u2019 community of the capabilities of Cardano. This has the potential to onboard new developers and attract developers from other blockchains and therefore addresses the challenge setting to attract high-caliber developers. As a developer, I feel motivated to see this practical use case come to life. The use case has very a large market which is all universities in the US and worldwide.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer evidence their experience with LinkedIn profiles, Jim has an illustrious career of over two decades and Steven has been a valuable member of Cardano Catalyst since fund 6 as a CA and vCA and works at the university where the trial will be done. The budget is set at $3 900 which is very little in my view for the proposed deliverable. This is a continuation of a previously funded proposal where the budget was similarly set very low at $1 800. This is a very reasonable budget to demonstrate a use case of DID formally at a US university. The proposal plans execution conservatively to be delivered by spring of 2023 leaving ample time to plan the next steps. The proposers say they have built a front-end to process the documents, but at the time of writing (3rd July 2022), the website https://pillarwheel.io/ was not accessible. The proposers articulate the technology they will use Atala/PRISM, Root Wallet, and Angular. There is a risk of compliance that the proposers highlighted of using real immigration documents, the concern is valid and the proposer considers this in their planning.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The deliverable is to have a successful trial at the University of Arkansas for the officials to verify immigration papers using the blockchain.

Let me start of saying after reading this project that the cost to value ratio is really good. The impact might initially be limited, but would provide an invaluable precendent and serve as a proof of concept for others after that. Keep in mind that finding the initial path is really difficult work, and the proposers have almost done it and don't need much resources to do it. I really do like the proposal and feel like it's going to have a big impact long term.\nThe proposer clearly states how this project is going to bring value to the cardano ecosystem and I also really like the definition of success because it's straight to the point. I don't see the need for scaling because as the proposer mentioned this is an MVP and doesn't need to be an enterprise solution, more like a proof of concept only at this stage, that would allow others to point at it's direction and state \"it's possible, they've already done it\".\nA few things that stand out as a good and efficient path to take: 1. They're reusing and colaborating with open source solution to NOT reinvent the wheel. 2. This project definitely brings what cardano is all about to life and all the ideology attached so I do think of voting for this project. Overall I like this project and the proposers have done a great job since last round.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There are names and links provided of the two team members and I was able to verify their skillset, which is also shown by the practical details mentioned like the imigration document types and numbers. This is a way to showcase your in depth subject matter knowledge. I love the fact it's a continuation of a previous fund that started the whole thing and even more it's just the previous fund. That means people think their MVP is importand as I do and have voted for them and funded their efforts, which shows the ideology of the cardano community as well.\nThere's not much budget to speak of. As I already mentioned the cost to value ration is really big compared to many other proposals so it's a no brainer for me. Two team members are more than enough to do the necessary work, which will be more beurocracy IMHO than anything else, and I appload the patiance to do it. The knowledge of legal documents will prove to be invaluable when negotiations start I imagine.\nAnother thing I like is the definition of success which gets to the heart of the matter. At the end of the day this is a practical solution to a practical problem taking full advantage of the blockchain technology. The fact it's happening on cardano only makes me happy and proud to be a part of this community with such great inovative projects.\nOverall a decent, definitely feasible proposal. Good luck to the proposers and keep it going!\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There's a discord channel that solves so many problems with communication and asking for help. I always support a channel to the community to have constant feedback and help if necessary. An amazing amount of people are willing to help causes like that. Besides that there is an open source github repository available to anyone to follow along with the project implementation.\nThere's a clear problem - help imigration documents find their way to atala/PRISM and a few possible solutions one of them being minting NFTs. Maybe a way to measure their progress would have been nice, but I can't think of any way to do that in their particular case, so that's not so big of an issue.

Proposer also has the support of an experienced advisor. I believe with all those experiences, this follow up project will be implemented effectively. For total $1800 + $3900 budgets, proposer only mentioned those are consulting fees and also stated that \"This will be the last round of funding for this project.\" I'll make sure this next Fund.\n\nOne thing I want to note: since the budgets are not transparent, maybe next time Proposer could breakdown the budget. For example: $3900 is for 6 months consulting fees or something like that. With those budgets break down, your proposal could be a reference if another Proposer have the same idea like yours.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There's little information about a roadmap is not very much explained.

The target audience of the two challenges is completely different, and in this proposal, I have not seen the author describe the positive impact it will have on developers - what is the main audience of this Challenge. And in my opinion, to be able to receive funding in this round, besides describing what components will be upgraded in the overall product, the proponent also needs to clarify how these upgraded features will have a positive impact on the audience and Cardano compared to the previous version.
