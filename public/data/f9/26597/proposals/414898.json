As we know, Haskell is the foundation of the Cardano Smart Contract. However, there isn't many books or resources in Vietnamese regarding Haskell for developers which is a big barrier for developers in Vietnam in building Dapps on Cardano blockchain. Therefore, the proposer has the idea of translating Haskell books into Vietnamese and share it with current Developer communities in Vietnam. I think, this is a good idea which could bring valuable knowledge to the people in need, especially Vietnamese developers. With previous funded in Fund 8, the team have already finished the translation of the book \" Real World Haskell\" (2008, O'Reilly Media) into Vietnamese and shared it with developer communities in Vietnam; but this book about practical applications of Haskell which is quite difficult for who who are new to Haskell. Therefore, with the desire to bring more basic Haskell books for developers, the proposer plan to translate the second book, namely \"Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! A Beginner's Guide\" which is recommended from IOHK in the Plutus Pioneer Program. This is one of the first necessary steps to further helping developers in Vietnam to easily access to building projects on Cardano blockchain. As far as I'm concerned, current developers is familiar with imperative programming language, so they might find it hard to quickly change to Haskell, therefore, the proposer suggests making detailed video tutorials of Haskell on Youtube for developers which I am very appreciated. In short, this is a project with good will in supporting Vietnamese developers in conquering the Haskell world and Cardano blockchain. I fully support their idea and would like to give them full mark for this part. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\"I think the proposal script is quite simple and very detailed to understand. For the roadmap, the plan is devided into 3 month, we know the activity that will be implemented each month. It would be more interesting to know how many translators are involved in translating this book and how many hours per day, or how many estimated pages the proposer could translate per day? Besides that, I don't think more detail would be needed in the case of this proposal. \nRegarding the requested budget of $8,080, I think the amount is fair value with the proposal. The total amount is based on $20 per page and 404 pages in total, leaving nothing to comment about this part. \nAbout the team, there is a lot of confidence in each of the professionals involved. We know their names, position, years of experience in related field with Github, Telegram, Youtube for community reference. Moreover, those team members are also very active within the Cardano community and this proposal is the ongoing of the previous funded proposal, so I believe it is possible for them to carry out this proposal well. Therefore, I will give maximum score for this part. \n\"", "q1r": 5, "q2": "It is very easy for the proposer to monitor the implementation of the work based on their targeted goals in the roadmap for the 3 months. Besides, the completion of translation of the book will be uploaded in Google Drive in pdf for public community sharing; therefore, it is not difficult to check the number of downloads. In addition, to know the number of developers joining in the Plutus Pioneer course, the proposer could easily measure by the number of registration forms. Also, by asking \"Has someone referred you to become a proposer\", we could know the number of proposals submitted on Catalyst. Moreover, I am appreciated that the proposer provide a very detailed and clear goals after this Phrase on: completion of the book, reach 500 downloads, 10 developers join Plutus Pioneer Program, 5 proposals from Vietnam submitted to Catalyst.

Doctors used to learn Latin to communicate in scientific circles, and I assumed that most people nowadays would learn some basic English to share scientific content online (or at least \"Globish\", the grammar-free little sibling of English). I have actually witnessed Dutch and Arabic computer scientists talk in English to other Dutch and Arabic computer scientists about programming concepts and they claimed that this was much easier! However, the claims that the proposers make about the Vietnamese talent pool of programmers willing but unable to learn Haskell, with poor English skills and eager to join the Cardano ecosystem, sounds like an amazing use of $8080 funding.

To provide easier access for developers in Vietnam to the process of constructing projects on Cardano, one of the first steps that has to be taken is the creation of translated documentation for a programming language that is not particularly common in Vietnamese.

It is about translating a book teaching about Haskell for Vietnamese developers whose name is  \u201cLearn You A Haskell For Great Good! A Beginner\u2019s Guide\u201d. The justification for such a project is vital as this kind of document is lacking for the non-native English developers like Vietnam, and in fact, it is just available in English language only. I think the problem statement of the proponent is very realistic, he states \u201c No book or document about Haskell for developers in Vietnamese\u201d, which makes me think that it somehow prevents the talented developers from approaching our Cardano blockchain as it is built based on Haskell. Consequently, just like his opinion, I think it\u2019s a huge barrier for Vietnamese developers to build dApps on our blockchain, slowens the development speed of the whole ecosystem. There is also the fact that Haskell is not such an accessible language for people who know how to program in other languages, this makes it even more important that this book is translated. Bringing Haskell knowledge to Vietnamese developers helps them approach more opportunities within the Cardano ecosystem; encouraging them will lead to increased developer adoption, productivity, and creativity for Cardano. In addition to the above to  assess the level of this proposal, I think it can also be a muse to have it translated to other languages and other related Haskell articles so I believe the full impact is not small at all. The other positive point is that the proponent outlines the Vietnamese developer\u2019s difficulties with both quantitative and qualitative data, which I found very convincing and provides us a full understanding about the background for this proposal. He is also able to state the risk might occur during the process. In addition, it is also very thoughtful how the proponent intends to make tutorials to help even more readers in possible difficulties that they may face only in asynchronous moments. For this, I think he has done serious research about his project and has a deep understanding about it.  I just have an observation about quality management for the translated book. In order to deliver it in an understandable and simple way, having moderators who are expert about Haskell, Vietnamese language could be useful. Besides, although having tutorial videos, the self-learning ability is not the same among people. Therefore I suggest a group chat to discuss and explain some difficult content together.

The KPIs are described not only with quantitative data but also qualitative explanations which I find easy to understand and track. The process of it is also published transparently to Google Drive, according to the proponents.  Now talking to the budget, the requested amount of $8 080 accounted for 0.8% of the total challenge. The price of $20/page/404 pages which is quite expensive compared to other proposals with similar activities, I think. However, I can understand that the Haskell translation requires excellent translators who have a deep profession in Haskell and Vietnamese language to handle the unique difficulties in translation specialized documents like this. I just have an observation like this: the proposer said the team could create tutorial videos so how this category could be calculated. I expect a specific short explanation about this so that I could have particular advice on this budget part. We shall continue with the project\u2019s members. They have experience in the Haskell programming language as teachers and developers. They were also translators and Cardano admin for years. Specifically, I think more information is provided about some members (Mrs Hannah for example) than others (Mr Curtis D'Alves for example). Ideally, the same level of detail would be available on both. However, analyzing the trust that is passed on to the team, I think they seem to be well qualified people, we have all the necessary functions so that this team is complete and well qualified for the respective tasks of the project. Moreover, this is a continuous part of the funded Haskell projects in Fund 8, I think the proposer commitment with this project is quite high and we can consider investing in the long term. I want to add a point that it would be more perfect to clarify the role of each member. We know that from editing to publishing there are many small tasks to do, for example: translating, editing, modifying; we even have video producing so who will create and edit videos mentioned above? If these points were clearer, I assumed this part would be perfect.

I'm not sure how this translated book encourages individuals to enroll in the Plutus course, though, in terms of \"The number of developers participating in the Plutus Pioneer course.\" Therefore, I think it would be simpler to imagine if there were a brief explanation of this. Finally, I'll discuss the project's success scenario. It is obvious and pertinent how this could indicate success.

Since, in this day and age, there is a growing demand for Vietnamese people to learn the programming language Haskell. It could be challenging for developers to research/access it for their coding tasks. On the market, there are many books that talk about coding by Haskell but unfortunately, there is a rare number of them that are translated into Vietnamese since Haskell is completely different and difficult for developers as well as programmers. Perspectively, this is a meaningful proposal for Vietnamese programmers in particular and for the growth of the Cardano inhabitant in general. It would attract more users and web developers as well as programmers to join the Catalyst and contribute their products by using Haskell. Thereby diversifying our Cardano community.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In feasibility, this group has provided a detailed 3-month plan with their goal setting for each month. They also provided their achievements in fund 8 in order to prove their ability and the successful proportion of this proposal. The supporters will be given a base for making comparison to the ability/possibility of the proposal. Honestly, I do expect this would be another success after the success of their previous participating proposal in the fund. On the other hand, their teammates are all experts in studying Haskell and have 5 - year experience and above. One of them is an English teacher and Translator in Vietnam who has 7-year experience. There is also the attached link to their profiles for verifying or identifying who they are. Last but not least, I think Haskell is not an understandable programming language, so the proposer offered $20 for each translating page that is reasonable and acceptable. There would be a lot of specialized terms that cannot be found easily in an ordinary dictionary. Hence, it would take a lot of time in figuring out the suitable Vietnamese vocabulary in order to make sure that it is a condensed content but understandable.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In auditability, the proposer has given his definition toward \u201csuccess\u201d in this proposal by the targeted number attached in the answer for example reaching 500 downloads in the first 3 months, or there would be new 10 developers joining Plutus Pioneer Program, etc. This is visible for people or for experts to keep track of this proposal and evaluate whether it reaches those numbers or not and is it successful or failed. This approach is absolutely a simple one for the Cardano community to verify the successful possibility and the progress of translating tasks.

A Beginner's Guide is a great book that I read when I wanted to learn about Haskell. Why am I learning about Haskell? Because Cardano's Smart Contract is built using Plutus. And Plutus is a programming language that is 90% similar to Haskell. Plutus is a new programming language so learning material about it is rare. Therefore, Haskell is a perfect choice for developers to get acquainted with Plutus.\nBooks like these are a must-have so that those who don't know anything about Haskell can start learning Haskell and become a Cardano developer in the future.\nThis book is also recommended by IOHK when you want to join the Plutus Pioneer Program. You'd be crazy if you didn't learn Haskell before joining the Plutus Pioneer Program.\nTherefore, translating this book into Vietnamese will be of great help to Vietnamese developers who can participate in building projects on Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Proposal's team has a proposal on translating Haskell books into Vietnamese, which is a pretty good experience to demonstrate the team's ability to implement this proposal.\nProposal's team has finished translating the book Real World Haskell (2008, O'Reilly Media) within the first month of making the proposal at fund 8 which is a great demonstration to demonstrate the team's ability to implement this proposal.\nThe team has 3 people with Haskell experience from 5-11 years, 1 translator with 7 years of experience, 1 community admin. All team members have experience related to the work in the proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The book will be uploaded to the drive as a very clear way to audit the results of this proposal. Besides, the proposal's team also sets out very specific goals that can be achieved by the proposal\n- Reached 500 downloads in the first 3 months\n- 10 developers join the Plutus Pioneer Program\n- 5 proposals from developers in Vietnam submitted to Catalyst\nAll of these goals of the proposal are verifiable through the download check on google drive, the number of developers joining the Plutus Pionner Program can be checked through the registration forms. Proposal from developers in Vietnam can also be checked by \"Has someone referred you to become a proposer?\" by Catalyst.\nTherefore, this proposal is completely auditable", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_4100", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14797, "q0": "- Cardano Smart Contracts and dapps are all written in Plutus (we can build projects on Cardano with solidity or other programming languages \u200b\u200bthanks to EVM. But these programming languages \u200b\u200bdon't work as good as Plutus.)\n- Plutus is built on top of Haskell, so programming in Plutus is not much different from Haskell (they are almost 95% similar). In addition, there is not much documentation about Plutus because Plutus is still in the development stage. Therefore, Haskell documents are the most optimal documents today for developers to start building projects and Smart Contracts on Cardano.\n- IOHK's Plutus Pioneer Program is a Plutus program for developers who want to build projects on Cardano in the future. This program is not for coding beginners. Some prior knowledge of Haskell or functional programming is recommended, as Plutus is heavily based on Haskell and includes advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level programming, and effect systems. IOHK recommend that you read the book \"Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! A Beginner's Guide\" before taking the course. Therefore, the book \"Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! A Beginner's Guide\" is very important for developers who want to learn Haskell\n- Documents about Haskell in Vietnam are currently very lacking (when I search with the keyword \"Haskell programming books\" in Vietnamese, I only see google recommend books on Python and C++ programming, not Haskell books. ). Vietnam scored 486/800 points, ranking 66/112 countries and territories on the adult English proficiency index. So it is a huge barrier for developers in Vietnam who want to become Haskell developers.\n- Therefore, this Proposal wants to translate the book \"Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! A Beginner's Guide\" into Vietnamese to help developers in Vietnam with Vietnamese documents to learn Haskell. I think this is a proposal that can develop a large number of developers in Vietnam who want to participate in building projects on Cardano.\n- This book will help developers in Vietnam not face language barriers when learning Haskell anymore. Currently, Haskell is an uncommon programming language in Vietnam possibly because of the lack of such documents.\n- If this book can be translated into more languages \u200b\u200bthen that would be a great thing for developer development on Cardano in the future.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "- In the detailed plan of the team, the team has come up with a plan to translate the proposal in the first month and a marketing plan in the second and third months.\n- In fund 8 the team, there is also a proposal to translate Haskell book into Vietnamese (Real World Haskell book) and the team finished translating that book (650 pages) in the first month (book download link is attached in detailed plan section). So I believe the team was able to execute the proposal as planned without any problems as the book \"Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! A Beginner's Guide\" is only 404 pages.\n- The team also has 2 Haskell proposals funded at fund 8 and they are also about 60% completed (checkable in the team's youtube and github links). This helps further demonstrate the probability of success of this proposal.\n- In fund 9, the team also submitted 3 proposals. The total execution time of the other 2 proposals is also listed in the detailed plan of the proposal. With a total implementation time of 2 proposals which is about 68 hours/month, the team has enough time to implement all 5 proposals at once if all 3 proposals in this fund 9 of the team are funded. I don't see the team overload in this detailed plan.\n- The team is also the admin of 2 facebook groups with more than 50,000 members and 1 telegram group with more than 1,000 members. So the marketing plan of the team is completely feasible.\n- The budget breakdown of the proposal calculated based on the number of pages of the book is also very reasonable. It is a common way to calculate the cost of translation services in the market.\n- Proposal's team has 3 members, Haskell developer and Haskell teacher with 5 - 11 years of experience and an English teacher, translator in Vietnam with 7 years of experience. These experiences are all proven by each member's github and youtube channel. So I believe that with this experience of the team, this proposal is completely feasible.\n- The book that the team wants to translate does not have copyright issues, so copyright is not a barrier for the proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "- The metrics of the proposal are easy to measure and check the implementation process.\n- We can check the implementation of the proposal right in the team's first monthly report (because the book was translated in the first month)\n- The number of document downloads is completely measurable.\n- The team also set very specific goals in the 2nd and 3rd months in the detailed plan (achieved 200 downloads in the 2nd month, 500 downloads in the 3rd month).\n- \"10 developers join the Plutus Pioneer Program and 5 proposals from developers in Vietnam submitted to Catalyst\" are goals that demonstrate the direct impact of the proposal. This objective also highlights the proposal's ability to solve the challenge.\n\n- Proposal's team can conduct a few survey forms to check the interest of developers after reading this document, which is also a way to measure the success of the proposal.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_4101", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "We will translate the book \"Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!
