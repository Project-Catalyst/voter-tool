The popular Ogmios protocol acts as a go between for those uncomfortable interacting at the Cardano base layer in Haskell, instead working in websockets and JSON.  Kogmios (Kotlin) and others like Ogmigo (Go) expand the options even further.\n\nPrimarily for projects that are building close to the blockchain itself, or who are customizing from the ground up, projects and labs like blockfrost, eternl, gimbalabs and Mlabs have and are using it, Ogmios has had key impact in the ecosystem, so it can be expected that this added accessibility for developers will be impactful as well.  \n\nWith the intention to finalize an already in development opensource library for a project facilitating a lot of innovation, I believe this project merits the full 5 stars for Impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is definitely a lack of detail here, though if you know how to parse a repo you can see what has been created to date and also a lot of the initial commits on work still to come, mostly the mini-protocols.  Not an ideal roadmap, for sure, but when added to the provided, short \"task list\" (which includes create documentation, support) you get some idea of the amount of work left to do.\n\nLikewise the budget isn't very granular, assigning 10K apiece to the deliverables of the library, the documentation, and ongoing support.  This introduces the issue of not providing anywhere an idea of the funding timeline.  Is this a one month project?  3?  6?  The ongoing support suggests a 6+ timeline, but there really isn't any way to know.\n\nThe proposer does include links to his previous work (and as mentioned, the Kogmios repo is well underway already) and there is clearly a strong understanding of the work needed and architecture required.  However the lack of key budget insight and especially the lack of a timeline reduces the feasibility by 2 stars, for a rating of 3 stars for Feasibility.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The lack of a timeline returns to haunt us here as well.  On its face this should be an easy project to follow:  the repo is opensource, the proposer's projectNEWM will be using the libraries so they will get a test run, and there will be a github project board for pushing it over the finish line.\n\nThe question is, where is the finish line?  Or more particularly, when?  This looks like a 3 month project to me, call it 6 to cover support under the funding umbrella, but what does the proposer think?  It would be nice to know, especially for establishing the funding tranches that will be distributed by month.\n\nBecause this opensource project from an experienced developer seems to have quite clear and measurable objectives, it has a strong auditability component, however, the lack of timeline to establish funding tranches at the very least forces me to knock it down by one star.  4 Stars for auditability.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3538, "q0": "The proposer wants to build an open source library capable of high-performance integration with the cardano blockchain, but as a developer I really struggle to understand the meaning of high performannce, since haskell has the higherst performance with the blockcnain because it was made to be, unlike kotlin. I do like the idea of having a kotlin framework and I agree with the listed benefits, but I wouldn't call kotlin a first class citizen.\nThere clearly will be a positive impact over the environment and the more languages are involved the better so each developer can find his or her way to contribute on a language already known to them. It's good the authors have already thought about integrations with other dapps that are already existing. I don't know the meaning of mini-protocols and I didn't find anything online so it would have been a good idea to elaborate on that. My suggestion when writing a proposal would be to keep the assumptions to a minimum, because you never know who is going to read and asses your proposal. If it's going to be someone with technical ability or not. The fact that the proposal is in the developer ecosystem, unfortunately doesn't mean only developers are going to asses the proposal. I am a developer, but I still don't know many things about the cardano tools and ecosystem, and a proposal is a good place to educate people while scimultaneously explain your solution to a problem.\nI do think this proposal is in line with the challenge settings and will benefit the cardano development ecosystem. I have assessed proposals for the last 3 funds and I find this one to lack details.\nOverall this should be a somewhat impactfull proposal if it gets implemented, with the few caveats I mentioned.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I do really appreciate the credentials listed in the proposal. I've listed through the repositories linked, and can verify the skills necessary to undertake this project are present, no doubt. The milestones are sufficient, but there's no timeframe given so it's hard to do any estimation on the feasibility of the given tasks and prices for each given item. Looking at the proposal in it's current state, it's hard to have a definite answer if it's feasible or not. On the one hand you have a really experienced developer, but just one that needs to do quite a lot of developing. There's no mention of a team so I don't know if one or 10 people are going to work on this library. On the other hand you can't argue with previous work. It's obvious things get done, but for all the other tooling there were more than one people developing it. \nAfter reading the proposal I've been left with more questions than answers so I lean towards the uncertanty. The truth is I don't know if this project is feasible or not. If there were more detailed explanation about if it's a team or an individual workin on this, and some kind of a timeframe I would be able to better advise the voters, but as it stands now, I simply can't say.\nThere's no description of any technicalities except for the language that's going to be used, which is unfortunate. I understand the end goal, but I don't see the road of getting there step by step and the milestones are not enough to give me that picture. Overall a good idea, but the proposal could use some polish. I'd advise the proposers to take a look at excellent proposals from previous funds and check out their structure and try to learn from it. There are many people willing to help in the telegram and discord goups so maybe you can contact some of them to help you with the formulation and aforementioned details.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Since the project is going to be open source I don't imagine anyone having problems with following along with the implementation. By the look of the previous projects that were don't the documentation and involvement is good enough that any member in the community that's interested in helping out or finding out more information would be able to do so. I would have liked to seen some kind of a feedback channel, because any framework that's new usually needs beta testers and constant feedback to make it better.\nI didn't find a roadmap, but there were some milestones listed without a timeframe. \nI would have liked to see more metrics that can measure adoption, because that would allow the authors to see if they have a positive adoption or not. Metrics are often underestimated, but a process that's not monitored can't be optimized so that's a bit of a hit and miss.\nThere's a clear description of the problem and a clear solution, of that there's no doubt. I'd suggest for the authors to put on the non-technical voter shoes on and read though their proposals again, and see that a lot of things aren't explained good enough for anyone to understand. Overall an auditable proposal with a few caveats mentioned.

Development can only be verified against github channel updates. The KPIs proposed by the proposal are still quite sketchy, so it is recommended to add KPIs such as the number of library usage, the number of errors of the library warehouse. The cost justification is also not reasonable for the amount of 30,000 USD. The project development fee may be charged by the hour, for example. The evaluation of the success of the proposal is also not reasonable.

The project creates a library where open-source code can make it easier for developers to access and implement their plans and products on the Cardano platform, certainly a Very realistic and promising idea. Simplifying the developer's work benefits them, but it also benefits Cardano in having more new, exciting things.
