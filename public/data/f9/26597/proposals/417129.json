It's a god idea that would have an impact if implemented successfully, because that would bring the scams of people taking advantage of developers to a minimum as well as the otherway arround. The main goal of this proposal would be to cover all financial relations between people that don't know eachother and that would bring trust after several payouts have been done and both sides are happy. \nConflict resolution is a big problem though and the plan is to keep to hard dates and as simple as possible deliverable action items. There is a mention of an escrow, but it's not specified if this is a smart contract that wouldn't rely on subjective information or not. I don't know how will conflict resolution be done. There is a mention of a jury, and that would mean people which would mean a person could decide to execute the smart contract or not, which defeats the point of trusting code instead of people. These problems are no detailed in the proposal so I have a problem estimating the impact.\nThis proposals is matching the challenge settings and the developer ecosystem is the right place for it. It will bring value only if there's a planned out conflict resolution for specific scenarios that have definite results that can be verified by smart contracts independently. I'll explain more in the feasibility section.\nCurretly I see a part of the puzzle missing in the proposal which is the conflict resolution that would be executed entirely automatically.\nAs a developer I'd suggest for the authors to have a serious think about elaborating on if for the next proposals related to that topic. Nevertheless if this proposal is successfuly implemented it would have some impact over the community.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team members linkedin accounts and credentials are listed and I was able to verify and match the listed skills in the proposal with the necessary skill they would need to have a successful implementation. The budget for the team members is reasonable for the work that would need to be done as is the timetable for the actual development. The have some links listed in the proposal that points to the possible site enabling ease of usage. \nOne big chunk missing in the proposal is the smart contract conflict resolution that doesn't rely on a person or persons to make the final call. Imagine the scenario where a developer full stack is looking for work and he has the skills necessary for making a site for selling shoes where the only payment method would be cash on delivery. And there's a shoe business owner that wants a site exactly like this one to be done. They enter a smart contract agreement that states that if this site is \"done\" the business owner would pay the developer X for the work. After a while the site is done, and the developer asks the business owner to release the money from the smart contract escrow by verifying infront of the smart contract escrow that the work is done. But if the business owner doesn't do that for one reson or another the payment doesn't get released and the developer doesn't get the money for the work done. Here comes the conflict resolution. If you rely on a \"jury\" as is stated in the proposal to subjectively state if the work is done as it's supposed to and decide to pay the developer and then a person could release the money from that smart contract, that means 2 things:\n1. that person in question (we'll call him admin) will have the power to decide and execute the smart contract or not, and the trust stays with him/her which brings me to my second point\n2. the process will not be automated\nThat's why there's a mention in the proposal of keeping things as simple as possible, but the fact remains that no matter how simple things are, as long as the owner can say \"no that's not done\" we're going to have a conflict resolution that will not be done by code, therefore trustworthy, and will not be automated so I see no benefit of using a smart contract if you're not relying on it and using it as intended.\nSmart contracts can be automated with factual data and oracles can provide that factual data reliably, but none of this was mentioned in the proposal. Because of this I think this proposal still needs work in order to present a solution where the conflict resolution of any sort is done entirely automatically, without relying on any kind of jury and no admin is able to control the executino of the smart contract. For those reasons I disagree with the feasibility of this proposal and would recommend of just using a lawyer or a legal entity for an escrow as is the practice right now.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Considering there's an open source github link, I have no worries about the aurditabiltiy of the project. I do also like the KPIs and metrics for this proposal and I think they are relevant for accurate measurement of usage and adoption.\nThere's a clear problem stated, but not a clear solution to it unfortunately. I'd suggest for the proposer to put themselves in the shoes of the voter and realize they will not be able to trust the code, because at the end of the day, the code will not hold the decision, but a human will just as things are now. \nNever the less this is the auditability section and I agree this proposal is auditable, because it would be open-source.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2463", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 5, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5268, "q0": "The smart contract job facilitation proposal will align project creators to locate the right team members who can perform as per requirement from the project.

More technical information related to the process in which this solution is operated should be mentioned too. Another point this proposal should add-in is why this project should be built on the Cardano ecosystem, and how it will contribute to the whole development of the Cardano. The result of this solution should be described as well to help people visualize what is outcome and how impactful it is to the target audience and the  Cardano blockchain system.

For example, when will you start and finish the first milestone? The second and the third one? If you are able to do that, your work plan will be much more detailed and clearly expressed.

You can add more detail about the main activities of this process, including its expenses. Do the same to the whole list so that it will be more transparent and the investors could trust your project implementation more.

Now I and the community acknowledge what your team will measure so as to track the progress of the project, but there is no indication of any measuring tools. I wonder after finishing measuring, where would you publish the data? Take the amount of times the smart contract has been used to the amount of successful, disputed, or incomplete transactions, where do you intend to show these numbers for the community to be conscious of? In terms of your definition of success, it also asks for more evidence. Like the idea: having developer buy-in to the effectiveness of the tool, can you explain a bit about that effectiveness.

The details outline a portal for job postings and smart extract to work as an escrow.The proposer has mentioned that in this solution the funds will be released as and when requirements are met. The most important aspect in this true case is dispute resolution. Disputes can be subjective and resolution may need third party inferrention.\nWhile the proposer identifies these aspects and also calls it out as a risk I find it concerning that the proposal does not delve into the details of how disputes will be handled or resolved. I say this because leaving aside dispute resolution this use case is a sample one of having an  escrow smart contract set up with the front end. While an incentive model for community members to act as 'jury' is suggested for the future in the proposal, I would have liked to see that accompanied with a clear outline of how dispute revolution will take place. Think about it, without a dispute revolution this solution would be equivalent to how employees and workers interact today.\nThe budget breakdown is vague.The estimate of 14k  for 3 months development for the escrow, smart contract, especially since it's tagged as MVP is quite high in my opinion.\nIf the team experts achieve widespread use of their tool for fund dispersal it would be good if they had included an audit of their smart contract before launch.This is important as flows in the smart contracts can result in cases like once getting locked at the contract or being vulnerable to hacks. Both can result in loss of funds. For the reasons enumerated above I see risks in this being a successful solution that achieves the intended outcome for the problem statement.Hence I rate this 2 stars.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Auditability for the solution would depend on adoption and community feedback,which is after the completion.

The money (or any on-chain collateral) is subsequently transferred to an escrow account until the conditions are satisfied. The proposer states the purpose of the project, and explains how it works, but does not provide a clear technical description and does not provide specific case studies.\nThe primary danger is the scope expansion of the parties' agreement, which could result in a conflict. One of the parties may fail to uphold their end of the bargain if the employer's standards are overly flexible or altered in the middle of the process.
