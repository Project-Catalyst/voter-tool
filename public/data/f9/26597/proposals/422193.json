This problem is specific to Cardano as the smart contracts are close and it is not possible to query them outside without a specific endpoint that is rarely made available. This is different from Ethereum and other EVM-based blockchains where the solidity smart contact code is viewable and because the majority of DEXs are forks of Uniswap which by default has an endpoint that lets developers query useful information. Creating an API standard and engaging leading DEXs and Lending platforms to adopt this standard would permit developers to access the information of liquidity pools and lending amounts. This would create a familiar environment for developers from EVM blockchains to migrate to Cardano and utilize this functionality. As a developer, I have a project in mind that aggregates the info across DEXs, and having this functionality would certainly help me. The project would scale if major DEXs came on board.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind the proposal also built Muesliswap, which was one of the DEXs on Cardano. The proposer does not provide information on the individual who would deliver the project, but rather rely on an existing pool of developers who currently maintain muesliswap. I would have preferred if the proposer listed the individual who would work on it to judge their merits to deliver the project. The delivery schedule is split into Research and Development with subtasks within each of these sections. The budget is set at just under $8k which is competitive for this type of deliverable at an hourly rate of around $70/h. The team is not planning to come back for additional funding to Catalyst and any overruns will be funded by the muesliswap team. The funding is quite small for this undertaking, but the proposal makes clear that they will deliver an API for their own DEX and design the spec of the API for others to implement and outreach to other protocols. They plan to complete the work in just over a month which I think given their experience with DeFi is realistic. I would expect the embedding of the API standard with other DEXs to take a little longer and allowing more time for integrations would be more realistic. The technology used to implement the solution is not discussed (e.g. will the API be RETS, os Websocket, and will it run on Node, or other) and it would be nice to see this. Also, there is no detail on how the API will read data from the smart contract, it would be good to know if a new smart contract needs to be launched, and if not how will the data be exposed. The proposer considers that there are no material risks because the technology is well understood. I would hover consider that there are risks that the API would not be adopted by the competing platforms and having a standard of an API running only on one DEX is not very useful, so would have liked some detail on how the team would plan to overcome the risk of low adoption.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, a roadman with the deliverable is provided for the technical part of the proposal. I would however consider that the outreach portion is lacking in detail. The team is committed to being transparent throughout and publishing their API standard. The information on KPI is missing, however, given the project\u2019s short nature, just over 1 month, there would not be much time to review any intermediate KPIs. The success is stated as delivering the API standard document and having it implemented in Muesliswap. I would have liked there to have been a mention of the success metric based on the number of users of the API and adoption by other DEXs. I think it will be possible to audit the project give the objective deliverable, however I feel the metrics fall short of validating the return on intention of making the API useful to a broad range of developers unless there is wider adoption by other DEXs", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2123", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 4, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 968, "q0": "The MuesliSwap team aims to create an open standard and the accompanying tooling required in the hopes that all DEXs on Cardano provide data endpoints to developers in a standardised way.\n\nThis would represent a step in the right direction as it could make it easier for developers looking to compile and use data from multiple DEXs in their workflows. As such this initiative is a very good fit for the Developer Ecosystem challenge on multiple fronts as it not only seeks to create a standard but also the necessary tooling for its implementation.\n\nGiven that MuesliSwap is already an established player in the space they have a very good chance at actually convincing the other major DEXs on Cardano to adhere to the standard that they are developing. This is crucial, as there\u2019s little point in developing a standard that no one adopts.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The implementation plan is adequately presented and paints the picture of a straightforward project without too many complications or dependencies. 1 week is allocated to research and communication with other players in the DeFi space and 1 month is the length of time estimated for developing the API.\n\nThe budget matches these estimations and is reasonably calculated at a total of 85 hours. It\u2019s my assessment that this estimation is very conservative and there is a very high likelihood that the team will actually end up spending a lot more than 15 hours on the initial stage of the project, especially if they plan to contact and coordinate with all the other major players in the Cardano DeFi space. However, the team has indicated that if the project goes over budget any extra costs will be covered by them.\n\nThe fact that the proposal comes from the developers of one of the major DeFi dApps on our blockchain does a lot to bolster the image of the team and their competence. This is especially important as unfortunately, the team does not provide any information about the exact people that will be working on this project, their credentials or any links to professional profiles (LinkedIn) or examples of previous work that could otherwise demonstrate their competence and inspire trust in their ability to deliver the project if funded. However, I do recommend that in the future the team includes such information as not all PAs or voters may be aware of their past accomplishments. The Cardano community is growing daily.\n\nThe MuesliSwap team has not been funded by Catalyst previously, Fund 9 being the first time they have submitted proposals. They have submitted 9 proposals.\nSource: https://www.lidonation.com/en/project-catalyst/users/2032 \n\nGiven this, I really would have liked to see a description of how they plan to manage the workload if all projects are funded.  Especially because this is now a requirement of the newly introduced workload questions in Fund 9. They did answer \u201cYes\u201d to the question of other Fund 9 proposals but unfortunately failed to provide additional details in the Feasibility section as requested in the question description on the submission form. The proposal does say that they are a team of 9 people, so I\u2019m not suggesting that they won\u2019t be able to manage the workload if all proposals are funded but it would have been helpful to voters to have a clear plan of how they plan to manage that situation in case it comes to pass. This is why I strongly recommend that they do include such a plan in the future.  As this was a new requirement that unfortunately very few proposals actually met I will not be lowering my Feasibility score for this omission at this time. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is very clear on what it plans to deliver and the timeframe it plans to deliver it in, there is very little ambiguity which will help a lot when community members conduct audits on the deliverables of this project. Having said that I do wish that the MuesliSwap team would have clearly indicated what communication channels can the Cardano community use to stay up to date with the progress on the project and where they plan to publish and make the results of their work public, be it GitHub or any other relevant platform.\n\nThe definition of success is in-line with the goals of the project and as they state, the results of this proposal are guaranteed to be adopted by at least one major DeFi platform in the Cardano space, theirs. Though I sincerely hope that this won't be the outcome, and what they are developing will indeed become the standard for the whole space going forward.\n\nMy assessment of this proposal in the Developer Ecosystem challenge is based on my experience as a project manager working directly with Cardano developers since July 2021. I have participated in almost all roles in Project Catalyst since February 2021, including as a previously funded proposer, and I\u2019ve been involved with the Cardano development community and NFT community for about a year and a half.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2169", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 5, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5113, "q0": "The author has identified a critical problem with the current API protocol on DeFi applications: DeFi applications do not follow any standard on how API endpoints should provide data. This proposal addresses the challenge by creating a standard for DeFi dApps API. This project could unify the data communication across dApps using DeFi protocols if carried out successfully. This standard benefits Cardano developers, building a new application on top of existing DeFi applications by creating an open, shared convention on how data should be sent and read. This project would then be implemented by MuesliSwap, the team that would be working on the project itself. It would ensure that this project is implemented on one of the most significant DeFi protocol in the Cardano ecosystem. However, for the standard to be massively adopted, it needs a way to be recognized and published. This proposal still lacks that. To further improve this proposal, the author could specify how the standard would be published and receive continuous feedback from the community.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team working on this proposal are the same people building one of the most significant DeFi protocol on the Cardano Ecosystem, MuesliSwap. This team consists of nine people with experience in different fields. This fact gives the team significant leverage for the feasibility of this project. They are also the right people for the job as they deal practically with this problem. The team behind the proposal, in this case, MuesliSwap, also stated that it would adopt the proposed standard. This fact gives the team more incentive to carry out this project successfully. It is also stated that every budget deficit will be the team\u2019s liability; this eliminates any budget-related risks. Moreover, the author said that the team already has a general idea of how the API endpoints could be standardized. The team plans to finish this project in a month and a week.
