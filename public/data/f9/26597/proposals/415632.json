The proposal is scalable, creating more clubs at universities, attracting more IT students to participate in research activities on Plutus/Haskell, Smartcontract, building Dapps, etc. The goal of the proposal is to bring potential development to IT students (future developers) to help build more applications for the Cardano ecosystem. The proposed challenge creates a club featuring cardano laboratories, developing test-net testing environments, Plutus/Haskell, etc. Addressing the challenge of the proposal makes sense when it comes to facilitating IT students, blockchain event organizers, and hackathon competitions. the risks of the proposal put forward in terms of facilities conditions have an impact on the development of the club.

First, there is a lack of a test environment in the University for developers to write blockchain applications. Second, lack of encouragement, encouraging students to pursue their passions. Third, students often learn about ETH / Polkadot / Near / Solana / Cosmos because these platforms have great promotions. Besides, students who are interested in blockchain lack friends to share ideas and work together on big projects. Finally, students do not know much about Catalyst and often apply for funding according to the traditional model\nFor the above reasons, Cardano developer club in Uni will create Cardano labs. It is a place where blockchain enthusiasts can find friends with similar passions and interests. In addition, this project not only regularly organizes seminars to share knowledge, but also organizes hackathon events to encourage the students to continue to grow.\t\nRegarding the risks of the project, they have come up with appropriate solutions.

It is also a place where students and faculty can be considered developers, and it is a place where you can find people who share the same level of enthusiasm as you.

Nevertheless, in this potentially hazardous section, I have one modest proposal to make: The fact that students and teachers are involved in, and sometimes overly involved in, the investigation and development of Dapps can have a negative impact, not only on their capacity to learn, but also on their ability to advance. The teaching ability of the teachers is reduced (because learning in school will include a lot of subjects and teachers will have to teach different classes), which means that the issue with your school is still the primary problem, and the research and development of the Cardano ecosystem in general and the development of Dapps is just a side issue. It is not possible to study with one hundred percent of one's attention.

Blockchain technology and crypto money are becoming more and more popular in Vietnam after the breakthrough of Bitcoin in recent years. The need to learn and learn about becoming a blockchain developer like a professional Cardano developer is increasing in Vietnam. According to statistics, Vietnam has 460 universities and colleges and each year the number of information technology graduates is up to 55,000 students. The demand is great and the supply is very rare. About specialized training institutions or clubs for blockchain enthusiasts, especially Cardano, there are almost no or very few in Vietnam. Almost all blockchain developers in Vietnam today self-study, research, and knowledge through the internet and self-study with English documents. That leads to many consequences that cause many knowledge gaps, consumes a lot of time and effort, and is invisible in general, making the Cardano developer community in Vietnam in particular and the Cardano developer community take longer to complete development. Because of all the above reasons, creating a Cardano developer club in universities in Vietnam is extremely practical and necessary. It not only helps students who are passionate about blockchain programming, specifically Cardano but has a professional environment fully equipped to easily learn, improve knowledge, and practice a practical application. but also helps to expand and develop the Developer Ecosystem effectively, long term, and sustainably. Under the guidance of those who have many years of experience in training and teaching, high expertise in blockchain technology, especially Cardano, and direct support from universities will help students have a where you can discuss, share and practice programming skills in the most comprehensive and effective way.\n\nThis proposal is really good, practical, and meaningful, has a great impact on Cardano Developer Ecosystem in Vietnam, contributes to the common development of the community, and helps all students who are passionate about Cardano have a good environment for perfect training, and learning.

The proposer addresses this challenge by providing a learning environment for students via the creation of a Cardano Developers Club at university that will host activities such as lab exercises to let students gain experience on making blockchain applications and other events (e.g. seminars, hackathon). By having these clubs, university students can gain learning and hands-on experience by attending seminars and building dApps with other students, which can be the catalyst of discovering new talents that can contribute to the Cardano developer ecosystem.

The budgeting was laid out into (1) the first month of lab designing, content planning, getting approval, and creating SOP for club operations; (2) the second month of creating exercises and learning materials for lab activities, promotion and member selection, as well as preparation for other activities (i.e. seminar and hackathon); (3) the third to fifth month of lab equipment procurement (5 laptops. furniture, internet, projector, etc.), securing a VPS (virtual private server), hosting 3 seminars, organizing hackathon, etc. The roadmap has been laid out clearly for a 5 months target that will include building a lab, creating exercises and leaning materials, hosting 3 seminars and a hackathon, etc. that has its respective milestone as stated above.
