The problem raised is that currently in Vietnam, many developers are interested in building projects on Cardano but do not have any Haskell courses in Vietnamese. This issue is currently a hot topic in the Vietnamese Cardano community. Everyone knows, that Cardano uses the Programming language, Haskell. This is a programming language that is considered difficult by the community, therefore, creating a programming course in Haskell in Vietnamese is essential because the Vietnamese Cardano community can thus access and learn this kind of programming language. The proposal has indirectly added value to the Cardano ecosystem because when implemented in practice it makes more people aware of Cardano, easier to access the programming language used in Cardano. From there will arise ideas and create opportunities for many people to contribute to the Cardano ecosystem. This proposal is fully scalable to address future challenges. I am very excited because this proposal has had a great impact on the Cardano Vietnam community, a community with many members who are eager to learn and have a passion for Cardano. I strongly agree with the strong impact of the proposal. I vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has a favorable experience in proposal writing as two members are Haskell developers with 5 years of Haskell programming experience, a Haskell teacher with 11 years of Haskell programming experience, and a community administrator Cardano. What's even more amazing is that the team presented documents related to writing proposals and related to the Haskell language. Most of the team members have a public link on social networks (if you add more about Linkedin, Facebook is great). This makes the community more confidence in the team and increases the feasibility of the proposal. The budget of the proposal is mainly allocated to making videos and doing Haskell exercises. This is reasonable given that the required level in chemistry is basic Haskell - for beginners. The team has outlined the plan and how to implement it in detail. However, I have a question regarding the budget, if it is not funded by Catalyst in Fund 9, does the team intend to continue with this proposal? Or is there another source of funding besides waiting for funds from Catalyst? The reason I ask this is that I want to confirm the feasibility of the proposal, which is also the question of many PAs and many people in the Cardano Vietnam community. In terms of technology, it bears the imprint of Haskell experts and the English translation ability of team members - how to bring to the Vietnamese community meaningful videos. most accurate and easiest to understand. I am very pleased with the risk that the team has raised in the proposal because Haskell is one of the most difficult programming languages \u200b\u200btoday, but with such a solution (making Zoom discussions) plus with the unanimity of the Cardano Vietnamese community. I believe, Haskell will become less difficult and more and more Vietnamese people are proficient in Haskell programming language and can program useful applications in the Cardano ecosystem. In short, the team can add social networking links to further reveal the identity (increasing transparency in front of the community) and make it more clear to the community about the human resources needed to implement the proposal. I always like to give positive feedback to the team and I agree with the feasibility of this proposal. I vote 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "To be clear about transparency and auditability, first, we need to look at the roadmap and milestones the team has outlined to get the job done. The roadmap is very clear with the work spread over 6 months, if the team can tie the milestones and roadmaps to specific months of the year, it will be great for the community to easily audit. and evaluate the transparency of the proposal. The team has a very specific definition of what success looks like in terms of numbers that are considered after-effects of the Haskell course implemented. I very much agree with this opinion. However, it's a pity that I can't see the KPIs and key metrics. These are two quite important indicators to evaluate the auditability and transparency of the proposal. I hope the team will make specific additions so that the community can see it more clearly. Throughout the proposal, the problem is clearly and concisely described with the solution. I was very impressed with the way the team presented the proposal, it showed the professionalism and focus the team put on this proposal. This is a highly practical proposal, meeting the needs of the community in practice. I am extremely hopeful about the success of the proposal.

This course is not for coding beginners. Some prior knowledge of Haskell or functional programming is recommended, as Plutus is heavily based on Haskell and includes advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level programming, and effect systems. IOHK recommend that you read the book \"\"Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! A Beginner's Guide\"\" before taking the course. Therefore, Haskell courses like these are extremely important for developer development for Cardano.\n- In Vietnam, Haskell is an uncommon programming language. When I search Google and Youtube for Haskell courses and resources in Vietnamese, there are few results. This shows that Haskell courses like this for Vietnamese developers are essential.\n- Besides, English is a huge barrier for developers in Vietnam. Most developers in Vietnam can only work in the country with popular programming languages \u200b\u200b(there are many Vietnamese documents). So, learning materials and videos about Haskell in Vietnamese is a necessity for developers in Vietnam to be able to participate in Cardano.\n- The Haskell course in this proposal builds on the book \"\"Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! A Beginner's Guide\"\" which makes sense because it is the book recommended by IOHK in the Plutus Pioneer Program. This is a very basic book about Haskell so most people even those who don't know anything about programming can learn it.\n- I really like the idea of \u200b\u200bthe team with appropriate exercises for each video lesson so developers can practice what they've learned.

These groups can help make this course accessible to a large number of people interested in Cardano and can help them become developers for Cardano.\n- Creating Zoom Q&A sessions is a great way to answer learners' questions through their comments on lesson videos.\n\n- To make an even bigger and longer lasting impact on Cardano's developer development through this Haskell course, the team can think about collaborating with universities to make this course a subject in university. It can help grow the developer force for Cardano a lot.\n- In the future, the team should build this course in more languages. This will make it possible for more non-English speaking communities to access Haskell and become a developer for Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "- Proposer has shown very clearly the content of the videos that the team will make in this proposal.

Therefore, it is not difficult for the team to take the content of the book to make the videos.\n- On average, the team will make 2 video lessons, 1 exercise and 2 solution videos every month. Total implementation time is 34 hours per month (just one person to do it with an average time of more than 1 hour per day). With such working time, the team is fully capable of implementing this proposal successfully without any problem of workload.\n- The team has 2 funded proposals at fund 8 and is still in the process of being implemented. But the team has also demonstrated the ability to implement this proposal through the first month report that the team has completed 60% of the work of a proposal and completed a translation of a 650-page book in fund 8.\n- In addition, the team also submitted 2 other proposals in fund 9 about the Haskell course for developers (total working time in a month: about 40 hours) and translated Haskell books into Vietnamese (400 pages).\n- The total working time of the whole team if all 3 proposals of the team in fund 9 are funded is about 150 hours/month (5 hours/day). The team has 4 members with Haskell experience performing these tasks. So the ability to implement all of the team's proposals according to the detailed plan is completely feasible.\n- Because the team has shown the proposal implementation plan in a very detailed way about the time to perform specific tasks. So the budget breakdown of the proposal is also very clear with the cost calculated by the hour.\n- All team members have many years of experience in programming and teaching Haskell (5 - 11 years).\n- The experiences of team members are clearly shown in Github and their youtube channel.\n- To develop the course in Vietnamese, Mr. Quang Daniel has 7 experiences in teaching and translating English. So there is no problem with building the course in Vietnamese.\n- Ms. Hannah is an admin of Cardano communities in Vietnam, so marketing this course is not difficult.\n\n- Monad and Monoid are two quite difficult knowledge for those who are new to Haskell. The team may consider creating a more advanced course to teach these subjects more in depth. I'm also looking forward to the team's advanced course to help learners deepen their understanding of Haskell.\n- In the team's future advanced courses, I think the team should have lessons related to Plutus and Cardano's Smart Contract. This will help developers see the Haskell application in Plutus and Cardano's Smart Contract", "q1r": 5, "q2": "- Measuring the process and results of implementing this proposal is easy to do through video lessons and solution videos on Youtube. We can completely check through metrics such as view, like, share, comment, subscriber, ...\n- The proposed exercises can also be easily measured through the team's Github\n- The team also showed the success of the proposal very clearly with the following goals:\nAt least 50 people join the Plutus Pioneer Program course and 10 proposals submitted on Catalyst through Vietnamese Haskell Course\nYoutube channel got 500 subscribers\nEach video has more than 100 views, 20 likes and comments\n- Metrics of subscriber, like, share, comment, ... can show how learners feel about the course (satisfied or not).\n- Views can show the effectiveness of marketing and how many people get value from these lessons\n- The number of people participating in the Plutus Pioneer Program and the number of proposals submitted on Catalyst are indicators of the impact on developer development on Cardano.\n\n- The team should design a competency test of learners after completing the course and issue certificates to them. This certificate can also be a good metric to measure the effectiveness of a course. In addition, this certification also gives learners an extra proof of their Haskell programming experience. The reliability of this certificate may not be high and it is not valid for use by other individuals and organizations. But it's also a pretty interesting goal for learners motivated to complete this course. This is my idea that the team can refer to and develop in the future. But in this proposal, for me, the metrics that the team gave are very complete and meet all the necessary requirements for the auditability of the proposal.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_4101", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 3, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you for taking the time to assess our proposal."}, {"id": 14825, "q0": "As a Vietnamese who is having to learn about blockchain, this project completely meets the needs of a customer. Currently, the Cardano ecosystem has not really been noticed by many users in Vietnam, because most of the content is in English, providing a Haskell course is an excellent choice. We can see the content that will appear in videos on YouTube, such as Type in Haskell, Modules or Monoids, and on and on. The majority of the content is essential knowledge for customers who want to join the Haskell community, and the proposer even allows participants to participate in practice exercises on Github - a feature that is fully aligned with the Challenge's Key Metrics. Furthermore, I like the idea of using Zoom Q&A sessions to answer learners' questions in order to help users understand Haskell thoroughly. A clever way to tackle the challenge. Overall, the project performed admirably in this area.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Within 6 months, the project will complete a large amount of work, and instead of remaining constant, the difficulty level of knowledge and topics will be increased and changed over time to ensure that people's knowledge is not limited, as well as to motivate learners to participate from the beginning if they do not want to lose basic knowledge. I especially like how the author will release video tutorials, exercises, and exercise solutions every month to help users learn more easily. The staff even has Haskell Book Vietnamese Translation to help students stay on track with the course. I'm also completely satisfied with the budget and the team of this proposal. The amount of sponsorship will be calculated based on the number of videos produced during the exercise and the number of working hours. Furthermore, the staff consists of individuals with the appropriate experience, knowledge, and skills for the project. However, I see that there is currently only one Vietnamese person in the team in charge of translation, so the work will be quite difficult in general, especially since that person does not have experience translating in the technology industry. As a result, try to hire one more person to assist and ensure that the quality of knowledge is conveyed in the most literal sense.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Congratulations to the entire team for preparing so thoroughly for this section. We have detailed metrics demonstrating the benefits to Cardano and users. All the successes that the project expects, I believe, will be realized. However, it would be favorable if the author could provide specific timelines for each activity when measuring project progress. How long, for example, will it take to begin tracking views, likes, and comments under each video? This is critical because it will greatly assist investors in closely monitoring and evaluating the project's outcomes.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_4104", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 2, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you for taking the time to assess our proposal."}], "solution": "We created a Haskell course in Vietnamese to help Vietnamese developers build projects on Cardano.
