As a developer I can verify this is a more secure approach than writing your spending password or 12/24 words and it's closer to how hardware ledger work.\nI really like this proposal and it would enable developers to give an easier and more secure way to sign transactions on your mobile phone. The authors clearly show how they will add value to the cardano ecosystem, by helping more developers provide a better service to their users. I didn't see any key metrics to monitor the projects' success and there's one KPI that is to see if the integration is done or not. I would recommend to the proposers to add those in their next proposals because metrics help with optimizations.\nSince it's a no-code integration project, i guess the scaling would be much easier but my experience has taught me there's no way to assume that before the actual work starts, so I'd have a buffer of 10% total time just to be safe.\nConsidering the challenges, regarding the deep links: the android and ios can both have custom schemes which can be modeled to serve your needs whatever URL you decide to use, so that's not a concern you should have.\nOverall this is an impactfull solution that would bring more usability to the dapps and more security as well. It's aligned with the challenge settings and will help developers in various ways.

This brings the credibility up in my eyes as an assessor and I believe in the eyes of the voters as well. \nThe proposer knows how many people will be necessary to complete these integrations and work, and the type of skillset they need to have to get things done.\nThe roadmap is a bit simple, but considering the work that needs doing, it has no reason to be much more complex than this. Even so the proposers could have done a bit better with the technical explanations for non-tech readers to understand. I do believe the timetable specified in the proposal is realistic and time would be sufficient to implement all the tasks mentioned.\nThe tech that will be used is more or less specified - integration with ios and android. The considered risks to the implementation doesn't seem ideal to me, because I can think of a few bigger risks like not being able to find an open source wallet that could accomodate your security needs, but the second concern is legit, no doubt. The project is in sync with what's already been done in the environment and we need people to make those mentioned integrations because the usability of all daps would improve if they use this integration if it gets done.\nAll and all this is a feasible proposal and I hope it gets voted in and implemented. Good luck.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Since the proposers will be contributing to an open source project, I see no problems for anyone to follow the implementation once a wallet is found. What worries me is I didn't see any way to get possible community feedback or let people know what's hapening or at least such communication channels weren't mentioned in the proposal. In this case I don't know how will the proposers let the people know about their product and possibilities for integration with it alongside the benefits of doing so. I hope you work on that because it will help with auditability greatly.\nThe problem mentioned is valid and well described technically, but the non-technical description isn't great. I'm not sure if non-technical people would be able to understand what the point of this proposal is and why this is an important problem that needs solving. The solution is solid and wouldn't require too much effort compared with other purely implementational proposals like SDKs and so on.\nOverall a somewhat auditable proposal, because it says the progress will be reported to the community but it doesn't say where, when or how.

The current state means that developers who want to leverage the mobile device need to code the basics just to get started with their project.  I'm currently working on a mobile app that interacts with the cardano-wallet service and recognize the lack of libraries that could help developers manage the connections between mobile device and wallet back-end service running on a server.  The proposers want to add a deep linking functionality that pops up a mobile app and requests the user to sign some message when they click on a link. This is potentially a very useful functionality as it could allow shops to place links with payment instructions which, after the user clicking, could direct them to a payment screen to transfer some money to the business to pay for that service. This would provide better integration between web applications and mobile devices and allow Cardano users to pay for services using their mobile phones. It addresses the challenge by providing a better development experience and potentially attracting new developers to the Cardano ecosystem who want to use this functionality. The deliverable is scalable as it will be released as open-source on Github for anyone to use. I would certainly look into it when it is delivered.

The second month on implementation of a patch on a wallet to support the new functionality. And the third month piloting the real project and releasing final protocol specs and open-source examples. I would suggest the proposers take a look at the cardano-wallet gitrepo when selecting the wallet to patch, this is the backend wallet service that is used by the majority of the project on Cardano and patching it would lead to greatest adoption by the community.  The budget is set at $18,000  and works out to be $6,000 per month for development which is a competitive rate for development on Cardano. The budget is also split by key deliverables. The proposals do not describe which language will be used to develop on Android and iOS, and I would suggest that they use React Native if possible as it is a popular framework among developers. There are a number of projects developing their apps using this framework (e.g. Yoroi). The proposers highlight the risks in implementing the deeplinking and proposed pragmatic mitigants that might require additional work, but are more likely to succeed.

This will help the developer ecosystem by increasing the functionality of dApps by more easily connecting to mobile wallets. \n\nAs the Cardano ecosystem continues to evolve there is a need for innovative and smart solutions that can improve or automate existing processes. This proposal is one of this smart solutions as it removes the necessity for each dApp to also create a mobile version (if necessary) and instead allows them to use the open protocol to query the wallet without needing to build out the entire mobile side. This will likely appeal to a broad array of developers who may only need the mobile wallet for signing/rejecting transactions. \n\nThere will also be an impact on the general dApp user as they will not need to stress about finding a desktop every time they need to approve a transaction, which will likely further drive scalability and adoption of Cardano. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented, it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\n\nThe ProofSpace.id platform is already operational and providing benefit to the Cardano community, which implies in part that this project will be done successfully, as they will not be contingent on getting the site up and running first. However, what I would have liked to see here is how they plan to develop the protocol itself. While they do mention that it could be an analog version of CIP30, that reflects the wallet-connect protocol on Ethereum, it is not clear what steps are required to actually build the protocol. Given that this is essentially THE major part of the proposal a bit more explanation would have been desirable. For this reason I feel a star rating needs to be reduced. \n\nThe plan itself is quite short and straightforward, which suggests that there isn't much work to be completed. Once the protocol is drafted, it becomes an issue of integrating with an existing wallet - since there are many excellent open source wallets to choose from in Cardano, it is likely they will find a willing partner to test this out helping with the feasibility. \n\nThe ProofSpace team has a bunch of very well credentialed experts which gives confidence that they can complete the proposal successfully.

In the plan, the team lists their set of deliverables which they will be aiming for over the course of their project which can be used by the community to audit progress. Did they deliver the protocol specs? Was it integrated into an open source wallet? did they provide all necessary documentation and an explainer video? \n\nWhat is sticking out here is that the plan, KPIs and success measures are all the same. While this isn't bad on its face, I would encourage the team to think about how they connect, rather than relisting what is already stated. We know what success looks like, but besides the yes/no results, what will be shared with the community. The team could have provided more detail on what the reports to the community would actually include, what kinds of information will you be presenting? Will there be opportunities for feedback along the way? If the integration of the protocol will be with an open source wallet does that mean that the protocol itself will be open source?
