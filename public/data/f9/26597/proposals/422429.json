In general, the idea is to continue the work of the Catalyst School, which is a place aimed at increasing the impact of Catalyst as a whole (as they well define), this is done through teachings to different actors of the catalyst (either a evaluator, tenderer, etc.). The group works by teaching new people who arrive at Catalyst how to insert themselves and how to act in a correct and impactful way, and with that it increases the number of active members of our community and helps people to develop their tasks properly. This fits the proposed challenge because, among the types of people that the School will help are developers: as much as this group is used to dealing with the technological world, as is well stated here, Catalyst is a very unique and that works under its own rules, so that everyone needs a light, a help to understand what this project is and how to embark on it. With that, the two KPIs cited by the proponents (number of developers actively building on top of Cardano + a sense of community and conversations. Having people around to talk to) are well addressed through this proposal. It is positive how they explain the main topics covered by the School (introduction to Catalyst, bidding on Catalyst, how to be a bid evaluator and how to be a Veteran Bid Evaluator); and we also know how these teachings would be passed on (live sessions and workshops, 1-to-1 and group support in many different languages, interactive website and other Catalyst-related workshops). Total confidence is conveyed in the impact that this project will generate, since the group has been operating since fund 6 and already has a lot of experience in the activities that are mentioned here, they already have an idea of \u200b\u200btheir mistakes and successes and how to mitigate situations that by chance come to appear. In addition, they have several established partnerships, some examples cited are the groups Gimbalabs, WADA, Prefecture of the East, Sustainable ADA, among others; such groups themselves are already well established in the ecosystem as well, having funded proposals and proven work. Another positive point is that they attach various media to prove the works that are cited, so that those evaluators who are unaware of the project can find out about the situation and have a guarantee of the seriousness of the School's work, seeing in practice some things that have already been made. A comment I would like to make, which is not a criticism, it is more a question: in what way did they improve the marketing so that the group could have more engagement, more people participating in their sessions, etc? Apart from this small question that was raised to me, the proposal is without a doubt totally positive and impactful for Cardano and also fits the scope of the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is entirely viable. We know in great detail all the necessary information regarding how the project would be put into practice. Starting with the script, the proponents explain exactly what would be done and why. As they already have a lot of experience in relation to the practice of the project, they realized that it is more productive to have fewer sessions, but that they are better designed and have more people participating. And the sessions are split based on which stage Catalyst would currently be in. For example, the first week the session would be for the introduction to Catalyst only, as we would be in the insights sharing phase. In the second week, when the submission of proposals was opened, there will be a session to introduce Catalyst and also two sessions on how to propose, how to submit proposals in the best possible way. This logic follows the timeline, for example, when opening to evaluate the proposals, a session would be held addressing this topic, and so on. A comment that I think is pertinent to make would be in relation to the 1 to 1 support sessions: in which languages \u200b\u200bwould they be provided? How would the people to be taught be selected? How would these meetings take place, how many would they be, how would they be held (through calls, probably). It would be interesting to have more details about this part. Moving on to the next topic of analysis, when it comes to cost management, the group is quite conscious when it says that they realized in practice that some activities that they developed in previous funds took less time than what was planned, so they reserved fewer hours (and as a result, they asked for less funding for those parts). It is also very positive as they claim that there are 2 thousand dollars left over from what was requested in the previous fund and that is why they discounted the amount in relation to the current financing. In general, we understand very well how the money would be spent, since we know the hourly value of the professionals involved (50 dollars per hour), we know what activities would be done and how many hours they would take, approximately (for example: representing the project externally (eg TH and Community Initiatives - 10h/fund; manage project funding - 4h/fund; fill in any role if needed - 5h/fund) They separate activities into some categories, such as the management part , document creation, gitbook maintenance, etc. With this, in addition to understanding the whole, it is possible to know how it is categorized, so our understanding could not be more solid. Finally, analyzing the team part, it is passed an instant trust in them as they are already quite experienced developing the activities of the School (they are already working on it for several funds) Not enough, they attach short descriptions about each member involved, so we know their names, areas of activity and some projects in which they have already been involved.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is highly auditable, but I would like to make some suggestions as well. Talking about the auditability of the process, it is said that progress reports will be made, which would likely contain data not only on what was delivered but also on the work behind such partial results. Would it be possible for the community to also have access to such information, how has the team been organized to keep the project in full operation, if there were problems and challenges along the way, how were they overcome, etc? Regarding the partial results, we undoubtedly have a lot of material that can be analyzed here, because, as the proponents report, the workshops are always uploaded to youtube (so that we could see in practice the products that would be generated by the initiative); written content would be available on the site; and a list of members requesting individual follow-up would be provided - this way we could contact him directly, if desired, to understand how these follow-up sessions were going, if they were being done as promised and in a proper manner. Talking about the final success, this could be measured by some metrics, like the number of workshop participants (maximum and average) + 1 to 1 support sessions provided + views on our YouTube videos + hits on our website. In addition to these quantitative data, I think it would be interesting for the School team, at the end of fund 10, to collect qualitative information that would allow us to understand the practical impacts of the project. For example, some new members could be gathered, who were introduced through the help of the School's activities, and it could be said how each would be acting in our community now. For example, who would have become a bid evaluator; who became a proponent: what projects would they be looking to develop and what proposals would they be creating to submit to fund 11; if suddenly they brought other people into the community themselves (they commented with acquaintances about Catalyst and its opportunities; etc. That way we would have a very complete understanding of the impacts generated by the proposal. However, I believe that the idea is fully auditable, not only by the information provided but also for the various ways that the community itself could monitor whether the work was being done (in addition to participating in the workshops, we can check what is being posted on youtube, the new content on the site, etc.) With that, this topic It also deserves top marks, in my opinion.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 9, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3489, "q0": "Proposal is for keeping the operation of Catalyst school, which has been running since past funds.

They include everything that is related to each budget line and the necessary hours to perfom them.

I am so grateful for them and their work and I can see their work has payed off and the impact they have is immence.\nI'd say this proposal is covering some of the basic challenge settings like onboarding developers into the cardano family, although I might feel this project could be suited in other challenges equaly well. This is an integral part of the cardano community and one of the most critical onces, since it's taking the introduction to anyone new to the entire ecosystem, showing them the ropes and opportinities for them.\nThey have proven to be able to scale with scaling of the ecosystem, so I'm not worried about that. I don't see anything missing from this proposal as they are veterans, and have done many proposals that were funded prior to this one, just as important.

The proposers have great ideas and have been implementing them for the last 9 months by my accounts, probably beyond that timeframe as well. The time table seems reasonable for the work they want to do and I really like the workshops idea because I've been part of 1 or 2 and it has brought me great value for the time I invested in them.\nThese are known members of the community now only by me but anyone in the telgram channel knows Lucio is the main figurehead when it comes to support tooling like the pa and vpa tools along with the proposer-tool any many others that help the community be more efficient.\nI also like the youtube content, because that's one of the ways to show you're serious about your work and any voter can quickly check the quality and content being provided.

The solution is straightforward - helping all people understand and integrate into the environment.\nSo far they're doing a great job, and I'm sure they will continue to do so over the course of project catalyst evolution. The proposers have a knack for knowing what new members of the community don't grasp and what is important for them to understand now and what can come later, so that kind of prioritizing is very important when there are such vasat amounts of information available.\nOverall an auditable proposal.

As a new member in this community, I found that the flow for the whole Project Catalyst process is a bit confusing to learn alone, and by providing free sessions / workshops to introduce Catalyst, not only will it help new members to understand the process of each funding, but also helps to understand how to do the role they\u2019re interested in (PA, VPA, Proposers).\n\nThe proposer also mentions the proposal\u2019s alignment with the challenge\u2019s KPI, including helping developers (proposers) to create a proper proposal. This proposal mentions trackable success metrics such as participants and video views. The proposer knows the risk (outreach) and learning from their previous projects, they managed to grow their existence in the community and improve their marketing strategy. The proposer also stated that this project will most likely return to Catalyst in the future, as they believe that the project should be free for everyone with continuously growing partnerships.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provides details about this project implementation in previous funding, indicating that this project already has been carried out well and will be successfully implemented with improvements from previous evaluations. The proposer provides brief detail about the team members with experience in Catalyst community, although giving LinkedIn page would provide more general background information for each member. This proposal has a clear roadmap and milestones by providing sessions following Project Catalyst phases in each week. The budget breakdown is listed well too, with estimated cost per hour as the base calculation, following by each required role and their workload, complete with estimated hours of work for each point. The proposer also states about budget comparison with previous funding by recalculating their estimation for some workloads. Overall, this proposal provides detailed information about the project details and improvements from previous funding.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As stated before, the proposer provides a clear roadmap and milestones, with trackable success metrics, such as number of participants and video views. Although, there is no metric that measures user impressions/opinions of the product\u2019s quality. Receiving feedbacks from workshop and 1-to-1 participants would provide user involvement to evaluate the product, and might help the auditing process. Showing brief statistics of the project implementation would also give transparency about the project growth over time. The proposer describes about providing progress report in meetings and workshops recordings in their YouTube channel to track the project\u2019s progress. This is good because auditors can check the workshop quality in each week. The Catalyst School also provides Telegram and Discord as public channel to give their project updates.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3296", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 13860, "q0": "Learning about how Catalyst works might bring newcomers and improve the dynamic within the community. The Catalyst School is a basic need in Cardano Catalyst in order to put some clarity in its functioning. This proposal effectively addresses the challenge of improving the Developer Ecosystem right away. For every role to be played correctly and to enhance the general dynamic of the community it might be super useful to have a digestible platform to put everybody together and help newcomers understand the Cardano method of working and funding. If Cardano Community wants to consolidate and expand not only as a community of developers but an inclusive one, its rules must be really clear for everybody. Without clear and accessible information we are losing a wide range of newcomers and might be allowing old members to misunderstand their roles. This can only lead to loss of effectiveness.

This type of flow communication with the community is guaranteed success of exchange and dynamic. 1 to 1 sessions are the best way to assure real educational improvement in the different members of the community. The sharing of the listing may be sufficient for auditing but it can also be interesting to share impressions and key doubts in students so all the community can enhance.

This proposal stems from the insufficient understanding of how Catalyst works and the roles involved that are happening in the community. Catalyst school as a solution will onboard new members and provide them the skills to interact with the Catalyst community as a proposer, assessor and many more. Better training will allow for better contribution made by these members, which altogether facilitates the fullest growth of the Catalyst community. The proposer goes on to list out all the activities they will conduct to support the learning process. There will be live sessions, workshops, 1-1 and group meetings (in different languages) and interactive websites. A table of contents is also given to see what topic the proposal will be delivering. The proposal has already been in progress since F6 and has several deliverables in the form of workshops in previous rounds. The proposer is able to specify the necessity of Catalyst school on the premises of Catalyst different methods of funding compared to conventional funding platforms. This highlights how useful it is for there to be a platform such as Catalyst school where information and knowledge about how Catalyst works and how to succeed is provided in a convenient way and provide connection to other community members for knowledge exchange. Partnerships are also formed with other educational stakeholders in the Catalyst community, which can help diversify Catalyst school while expanding its impact. The overall impact of this project will be to create a welcoming, open environment for anyone who wants to join the Catalyst. The proposer is also able to point out how this will align with the goal of getting more people to contribute to the Cardano community. The main risk is identified as outreach with a low attendance rate, which has happened in their F7 and therefore, they have developed a mitigating measure in the form of marketing strategies to attract more participants. The results of this is reported by the proposer as an increase in the number of people going to workshops and support sessions, which is a good indicator of how the proposer will overcome this risk.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility is positive. The roadmap and milestones are presented clearly with elaboration of what they plan to do and its correlation to their proposal in F10. The F9 proposal will be conducted in 6 weeks, with clear activities accompanied during each week. The budget breakdown is another strong point of the proposal. The key items are clearly listed in different sectors (Project Lead and Management, Documentation & Auditability, Core Content, Website, Marketing/Media). This is a really exhaustive listing covered in a well-rounded way). The proposer also accounts for each expense. Money will be paid according to working hours and the proposer specifies working hours for each of the small key items, which clarifies the budget breakdown. Activities in each sector are also clearly presented so we can understand how the proposal will be built step-by-step. The proposer also points out how the budget has lowered compared to their previous proposals and gives an explanation of how they manage tasks more effectively and cut down working hours, eventually saving some expenses. Therefore, although the budget will need $11,250, they will only ask for $9,250. Information about the team members are provided and it shows that they have the relevant experiences to work on this project (web development, community member of Cardano and Catalyst, proposal mentor and veteran assessor,...). The proposer will need more funding in later rounds and give a suitable explanation: the Catalyst school will be a free service. As it is an educational platform to improve human resources of Catalyst, it is reasonable that this project is subsidized by the Catalyst treasury.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability is good as meetings will be conducted to report progress to IOG while other external audits such as posting contents from workshops to Youtube and their website.
