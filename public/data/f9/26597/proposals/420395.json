It is about hosting meetings to bring proposers together so that their ideas will be presented to the community and get critical advice. The problem statement points out an obvious situation through this excerpt: \u201cMany developers have high-value ideas but aren't good at building them or promoting them to the community, so their proposals don't receive high PA scores and are not being funded.\u201d We all know that, Catalyst Funding receives many good ideas however they are imperfect at some points so they miss the opportunities to be funded. Obviously, Ideas that do not meet the standards will be filled-out but this proposal is suggesting a chance for those ideas to be better by the way that can\u2019t be more practical. Thanks to the helpful advice of the community\u2019s experts, the developers\u2019 ideas are given an opportunity to be useful for the Cardano ecosystem. To me, this initiative is not only unique but also positive, fitting for sure with the objectives of the challenge. We know that, to attract the developers to build successful apps, we consider creating a friendly and constructive environment where they feel they can have their idea fixed to be more suitable for the whole community. For that, they feel connected with the ecosystem and want to contribute more to help our community. Talking about the impact, the proposers outline this part in a systematic and logical way. I first know briefly about the project, that it is a series of meetups held by a community called TIGER View and its purpose is also clarified. Through this part, I gain more knowledge about how this program is organized and there will be specific participants for example: proposers, PA, media team, community and so on. They are the one who directly join to make it fulfilling and useful for the related people. There is one excellent part that these meetups are not only for the host-country (Vietnam) but also globally organized to reach international ideas. Reading down the proposal, the workflow is also described in rich detail from which I can understand the process of this program. PA will register for the proposals they want to listen to, then the proposers will be contacted and met with everyone via Meet. I found this part is outstanding when there is a session called \u201cAfter meet\u201d. In this session, the reward will be given for high-value feedback from the community and PA. I believe this is a smart way to motivate the participants to give constructive and helpful advice for the proposers.The proponents also state that this program has been in pilot phase since 3 months ago; I have confirmed it and been quite impressed by the program itself. One of the most interesting pieces of information is that the proposers are able to point out every single benefit gained by every participant. Not just so, they state out risks might occur during the program and give it a reasonable solution. From the above, they show me that they have researched their project in a meticulous manner and have deep understanding about it to find better ways to implement. The proponents, throughout the impact, explain in detail how this project would be constituted, by which parts and what each one of them will generate for the total process, demonstrating a lot of mastery and clarity about the entire extension of the project and making its characteristics understood by the proposal readers. For these reasons, I believe that this proposal deserves the maximum score in impact, its premise is extremely useful for Cardano and it can achieve the specific objectives of this challenge. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the feasibility. I can see that the information given is extremely rich and explained in a precise and detailed way. They first explain the brief introduction with a timeline and milestones about its activities. I know the program will be organized from Aug 11 and last until Oct 29 with a total of 12 weeks. With the above timeline, It\u2019s suitable to host meetups as Fund 10 is expected to start on Oct 10 as well so it will be convenient for proposers to receive advice through meetings and have time to edit their ideas better. Now talk deep into the activities.  It is very rich in detail, but it lacked a sense of temporality and understanding what is behind the events. The activities to be carried out during the entire process are enumerated and richly detailed, so that we understand quite clearly what would need to be done and how. However, to me it's more like an agenda mixed with targets and KPIs rather than a detailed plan. In my view, a detailed plan should contain this information: what will be done by who, how and when; I haven't been clear with the \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwho\u201d in here. For example, I expect the proposers clarify how they set up the Media team, recruit the members from where and based on what criterias? I would also like to know what job each role takes over and so on. Therefore, I think the script is accurate in terms of making us understand what events would be, but not what would happen behind them or how long each thing would take to be developed. Speaking now of the budget, I believe that the asking amount, approximately 50 thousand dollars, is very fair. Several meetings will be held, many things would have to be worked on before and some after, this generates a lot of expense. Regarding the explanations of this funding, we have some main points (reward, host Meet, Zoom payment, editing, Marketing, project management, reserve for ADA slippage, v.v). The first three points are divided into small parts, so we understand very well the reason for the asking price for each. My only observation is regarding the 3rd point, the program is hosted via Meet so I am not clear with the reason for including Zoom payment here. Now talking to the project\u2019s members. There are 3 members, 1 team of more than 20 PAs, . This part is excellent, we know who the professionals involved are, what their professional areas are and it is also explained a little about their social media accounts, so that we can check all the information that is said. There is a lot of confidence in them, mainly because they are from the Cardano Catalyst community under many roles, which indicates that they would have a good idea of \u200b\u200bhow to imagine and dialogue with the target audience. There is an interesting point I highly appreciate that some project members  used to propose proposals and got 4 funded from Fund 6 to Fund 8, which shows their high commitment with contributing to the Cardano ecosystem. That is, I believe that the feasibility is good, with only a few points to clarify. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The four ways this project will be tracked for progress during its development are clearly outlined by its proposers. These include the creation of a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as: Number of Proposers registered to present at MeetProposer, Number of new PAs participating in Meet sessions, Number of valuable critical questions from PAs and Communities, Number of high value advisors voted by Proposer. They explain to me the goals and the signal when those goals are attained. In other words, all the methods for measuring, analyzing, and reformulating the project are described, making it crystal evident to the Cardano Community what should be prioritized as each project phase advances. Now that we have the results, they provide a more thorough explanation of what would have to be achieved, we are also told exactly what to expect. I think that just like the other topics, the auditability is very accurate and gives us all the information we need safely.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3750", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 4, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 685, "q0": "Look at the videos, I've found the meetings have helped developers greatly improve their projects. For example, the project \"Cardano Forest In Vietnam\" [https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396832] has been funded since Fund8, which has been upgraded into a bigger project named Blocktree [https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414457] by the advice of Mr. Duc Tiger (https://youtu.be/RPNYfcr2Ijo). Another example is the project ADACHEEM (https://youtu.be/4b4a09rfHtk) has grown into a better project https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414059 by the advisement of Mr. Do Manh Hung, a very high-level of expertise of blockchain and Cardano. I think, this is a very impact project not only for the developer in Vietnam but also for the developer community in over the world.\nEven better, this seems to be operating as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). If this project is funded, this could extend to the entire Catalyst ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The detailed plan with specific steps and clear goals within 8 months to conduct 50 Meet proves that the MeetProposer implementation team has prepared thoroughly.

However, there are many developers who have high-value ideas but are limited in building them or promoting them to the community, so their proposal does not receive a high PA score and is not funded. Therefore, the purpose of this proposal is to connect people with good ideas and people who are looking to learn about technology projects to increase their knowledge and find investment opportunities from many people. Soon. The solution was to organize a series of proponent meetups, for developers to present their ideas to the community and receive key questions and advice from experts around the world. the world before the Completion period ends. Meetings organized by the TIGER View community on a weekly basis are arranged and fixed. The target audience of the proposal is people with valuable ideas for the Cardano ecosystem who are planning to submit funding proposals for the next Catalyst Fund, and PAs who are looking for information about other projects. projects to serve the evaluation of proposals in Catalyst Funds, or investors from the community, they hope to find early investment opportunities from high-quality and profitable projects. sustainable development trend. The scale of this project is a global scale. So it has the opportunity to develop widely in the world community if it is funded.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team also raised a possible risk of the proposal being a loss of connection during the meeting due to poor internet connection quality or a server outage, but the team should offer more than remedial measures for these problems. this risk. Does the proposal provide a detailed plan, including progress and milestones for implementing the proposal. The group has a clear assignment of work for members with the core team of the proposal consisting of 3 people: Mr. Duc TIGER is the Project Manager. He has been working on the Cardano blockchain technology and the Catalyst ecosystem for many years; Participated in Catalyst to evaluate proposals as CA (Community Advisor) from Fund4 and vCA (Veteran Community Advisor) in Fund6. He also founded and co-founded several sponsored projects: 2MIN and BWORK. In this proposal, he will oversee all processes of the MeetProposer project, connecting community members to work together to make the project of high value. Mie Tran is a global host, she has a very good command of English. She has extensive experience in translating and hosting the Cardano Catalyst TV show. Quynh Anh is a native Vietnamese host, she has been researching Cardano blockchain technology and the Catalyst ecosystem for many years; Participated in Catalyst to evaluate proposals as CA (Community Advisor) from Fund7. There is also the support of the excellent PA team and the TIGER Media Team: a group of people with social media marketing and communication skills. So looking at the experience and expertise of the members we see that the team is fully capable of ensuring a successful project launch. Currently, the proposal does not generate profit and only serves to spread Catalyst to the community and support developers to engage in this productive activity themselves. However when the project is strongly developed with a channel on youtube has a significant increase in the number of viewers, the group should pay attention to the fees collected from advertising activities.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The total required budget is $49892, which is an adequate budget to develop an improvement project for the Catalyst ecosystem. In addition, the budget is explained in detail, specifically for each project item, showing that the proposed calculation group is very close to reality. The team has also clearly outlined metrics to track their project progress and explained what each of them means.

To remove this barrier, the proposal team held meetings for the PA community and proponents, exchanging community feedback with developers, to help the community understand the project. What problems does the lab solve, and also helps developers research more input from the community, in general the main work that this proposal group identifies is communication and referral, so it can be seen that this proposal only solves part of the challenge, why say it has partial impact, because now the Catalyst facilities are working so meticulously, they won't give up miss it. any proposal does not have a review PA because through the PA phase there will be statistics for the evaluations of each proposal for the vPA phase, if so they will resubmit those proposals for addition co-reevaluation. and according to the latest statistics of the 8th round, there are very few topics without reviewers, but there are articles with more than 10 reviewers, and the time factor for PA is now raised to 2 weeks, and No. the number of protected areas is increasing with each funding round, I think the number of proposals without reviewers will be very small and the % very low. Sponsored or not is still largely determined by the quality of the proposal's ideas, not by much the number of reviews. Why are there still proposals over 10 reviews and still not funded? The layout for conducting the meetings is fully provided by the team and explains what each person will be like and what role they will play in the meeting, with examples and evidence for that. In addition, the reward organization to attract the community to participate in interaction, clearly present and explain the reward mechanism, and what is especially interesting about this proposal is that anyone can use it proficiently. These two languages \u200b\u200bcan participate: English and Vietnamese. * However, I have a few questions I'd like to suggest to the proposed team: - the team claims to have successfully held meetings before this funding deadline, but the team doesn't say how many people are in the group. community has participated in the interaction, and has not made any commitments What is involved in ensuring the number of participants in each meeting, as the key to the success of this proposal will be interactive participation community, especially the Protected Area community.

It doesn't matter, along with that needing to specify how much reward is expected for each meeting is, for example, the total number determines the team will hold 26 meetings, domestic and foreign, so b How much reward is expected to be spent? for the community, also, what is the difference between national and global meetings?. Domestic meeting, foreigners are not allowed to attend? In my opinion, the group should not be divided like that, once the team has a member with experience in interpreting, because the first group mentioned will be the global meeting, and the content of the meeting with the developer will be alike.

The team identified the problem to be solved very clearly. I appreciate the team's idea because it is necessary for the present and long term for the Cardano ecosystem. Specifically, it adds value to the Cardano ecosystem. All of the famous projects in the current Cardano blockchain come from a developer's idea. Good ideas are considered seeds that need to be cared for and nurtured to grow into big trees in the Cardano ecosystem forest. And \"Meet Proposer\" is considered the ideal nurturing environment for seed ideas like the one I just mentioned. \"Meet Proposer\" is good for both idea proponents and PAs. It's great that this is a program that benefits everyone involved. The team is also very enthusiastic when intending to expand the initial scale from Vietnam to the international level.

One more thing that makes me very satisfied about the disclosure of the identities of the team members is that they have presented the link of each member on social networks for the convenience of the community to look up. This greatly increases the feasibility of the proposal and the credibility of the team. I like the breakdown of the budget by items, it is reasonable with the set goals and convenient for the audit. This is an important factor to increase the feasibility of the proposal. I have a small question for the team: In this Fund 9, if the fund has not been funded, will the team continue to do Meet Proposer programs as they have piloted some programs? I highly encourage you to keep working with or without funding. Because it's a great program, very important for the proponent and PA and the whole Cardano Vietnam community (later on an international scale). I believe that the team's efforts will always be rewarded. In the proposal, the plan and implementation are presented. This includes the resources needed to make it happen. I understand, in addition to the key members of the team, that some collaborators are the core PAs, they are all good people. But I learned that some members also participated in developing other proposals at Fund 9. After all, does the team have enough human resources to implement the proposal? I believe with your professionalism and expertise, this shouldn't be a problem - you guys can do it easily. But that's from my perspective, and from the perspective of some people who have never known anything about the team before, I recommend that the team have a specific explanation to demonstrate the feasibility of ensuring resources. human resources to implement the proposal (this is especially good, needed for brand new members of the community). That's my advice, I hope you take it. On the technical side, with highly skilled people like team members, it is not difficult to deploy techniques and technology with languages \u200b\u200bused in Vietnam and internationally. I strongly believe in the success of this. Given the risks and challenges involved in implementing the proposal, do you think the challenge is insufficient funding? (I mean the case where funding from Catalyst is not yet available.) Another idea, with the participation of talented and enthusiastic members - the program is definitely of good quality, but in terms of promotional images, how to increase the visual appeal to the community (apart from digital marketing solutions and group chat announcements)? I think that for the program to have a strong spread and be known by many people (both inside and outside Vietnam), the team should specifically assign a small group specializing in communication and promotion of the program, to gradually Build a brand that only Meet Proposer owns.

Your review of the metrics shown in each program is great for the community to rely on for audits and increases the transparency of the proposal (number of registered proponents, number of New PAs, number of review questions, number of high-value advisors voted by Proposer) - these numbers are as important as KPIs.

It is suggested that the team should also mention the Global Host role profile as it is one of the risks also mentioned above in Impact. \nThe milestones are broken down based on the timing of the Catalyst Fund 10 & Fund 11 roadmap. It is really impressive that the team has the track record of Fund 9 MeetProposer with more than 10 Proposers attending. There is an overlap between Native Meet and Global Meet which would be greater if the proposer can show a separate calendar view for the voters, and proposers to see more clearly. The budget is broken down into each task of the proposer. It is recommended that the budget for Core PA and Community feedback mechanism. The PA had a look at the reward mechanisms and it was a blank sheet at the moment. Digital marketing is also shared but it would be greater if the how is elaborated clearer. And as per the mention of the Global Host, the cost for a qualified candidate should be included.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Regarding the auditability, what makes the first impression is the clear KPI/OKR indicators defined by the team from PRE: Number of Proposers registered to present at MeetProposer DURING: Number of new PAs participating in Meet sessions/ Number of valuable critical questions from PAs and Communities/and Number of high value advisors voted by Proposer.\nWhat could be improved is the POST meeting feedback and also the tracking of the funded proposers (who joined the MeetProposer sessions.)\nThere is a problem with the top relevant link  http://meetproposer.ivote.space/ of this proposal thus making it hard to be tracked. The PA guess that the link will go live after this proposal got funded. However, the team compensates for this with proven records of the 10 Meet Proposer playlist in Fund 9. The success picture is really brightened up as the name of the proposal itself for the multi-audiences including Proposers/ PAs and d-Reps and also Voters at the Voting stage.

If this proposal is funded, I firmly believe that it will bring added value as well as have a positive impact on Cardano and Catatlyst as it will encourage developers with many viable projects to contribute to Cardano, and will create a team of core, experienced PAs along with a large number of visitors on social sites.\nThe KPIs satisfy the elements of this challenge (Increase number of developers actively building on top of Cardano), by periodically giving meetings with project owners, they will thoroughly explain their project and the PA, vPA have the opportunity to give questions and suggestions to help project owners better complete the project.
