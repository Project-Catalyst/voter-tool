However, in my opinion, KPIs for this proposal has not achieved a certain level of clarity because I do not see any approximate number for KPIs such as number of dApps and Projects using this integration, which can be improved when things are clearer. Another excellent point of this proposal that enhance the proposal\u2019s attainability is that the team can prove they have enough human resources and partnerships to pull this proposal off. They even build up a committed team of full-timers who can dedicate even 6 days a week, 12 hour a day to get things done, which can show how determined they are.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I must say that the clarity of the road map and how carefully it is constructed by the team can enable supporters to easily keep track on the progress. Especially, OpenSource MetaMask<=>\u20b3 Integration will be open-source on Github, so that everyone can check up on the project at any time. From what I see, all key daily metrics and KPIs are identified to ensure the success in the developmental progress. What I love more is that once to twice a month, the proposers will host a Snapbrilia Demo and Progress After Town halls, where everyone can give feedback and play an important role in the achievability of the proposal.

With the usage of WalletConnect, now any dev, dApp, or builder on Cardano can increase their chance of being successful because of the access to a bigger potential user base. Moreover, the team intends to make developers' life easier by giving them the power to transit from Ethereum to Cardono without losing any small percentage of their user base, which can be considered a crucial and essential feature. The stake board explains and gives out a comprehensive target and vision, from which we can clearly see how this project can make a great impact on the Cardano ecosystem. To sum up, I truly believe that this solution can greatly reduce the stress of developers as well as make dApps built on Cardono access to a higher chance of success.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In my opinion, the most fundamental key point that contributes to the success or failure of this project is human resources. As I can see from the proposal, the team includes many talents from different backgrounds and rich experience, which can increase the likelihood of its success. The budget for the whole team is clearly defined by the market rate, which is quite reliable and supporters can even request that real-time salary data when the project kicks in by requesting through the team\u2019s communication channel. The way the proposal team builds partnerships with a variety of different tech teams is another assurance of the success of this project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I must say that the auditability was really well done by the proposers. Not only any supporter can give their feedback from Snabrillia Demo and Town Halls, a virtual event that the team host to have a chat with the community, but also every important key metric and KPI are thoroughly given out. The proposal\u2019s makers are experienced and have been around in the tech industry long enough to understand what they have to face in the way to achieve their target; hence, their description of issues, their solutions, and their expected results are precisely and concisely presented, in a way that supporters can easily understand and follow the developing process.
