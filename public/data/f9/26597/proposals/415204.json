Many want to learn but are severely limited by time, resources, and willpower.", "f6_no_assessments": 10, "f6_rating": 4.4, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 949, "q0": "The proposal aims to set up an incentivised learning platform for Cardano developers. Initially, I had some scepticism about the efficiency of the described incentivised teaching method, given that students might just be engaged for rewards and not have an actual interest in the topic, but ultimately, even if a small percentage of those that enrol ultimately become professional Cardano developers that could still be a win for our blockchain. Given the relatively small cost I think it's an experiment worth running and analysing the results after a first cohort of graduates complete the program.\n\nI particularly liked the emphasis on the peer to peer approach to teaching which would encourage past graduates of the course to take on a teaching role for the current cohort. Although this is presented as optional for the moment, personally I think it would produce great results if implemented.\n\nThe Developer Ecosystem challenge calls for the creation of support structures for the dev community. It is my view that education is a key part of that. This in turn means that the proposal is a perfect fit for this challenge. Education is crucial to the health of any developer community, and this is especially true in the case of Cardano. It's not only a new developer community, but it also operates differently from many others in the blockchain space given it\u2019s eUTxo model and Haskell based programming, so a lot of the knowledge shared will be new.\n\nThe risks are very well identified and addressed demonstrating that the proposals have given the project a lot of thought. I particularly appreciated the variety of solutions provided to the risk that students might copy during exams to earn incentives without actually having mastered the subjects. \n\nI am basing my review of this proposal on the over 5 years of experience I have in managing a mobile app studio and the fact that I have been involved in the Cardano developer community since March 2021. Since July of last year, I have project-managed and worked with Cardano developers directly.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan presented covers the first year of activity for the project but reads more like a list of KPIs than an implementation plan. It's very good at providing a clear description of what the team wants to achieve, but it doesn't paint a clear picture of how those goals will be achieved. This is the only aspect of the proposal where I wish the team would have taken a bit more time to refine in their submission. \n\nThe overall requested budget is of $30K which in my view constitutes a rather small risk to take for potentially huge benefits. The budget breakdown is very descriptive and easy to follow. More than half of the requested budget will go towards the incentives. Given the length of the course and the estimated time it will take to prepare the teaching materials, I think the overall budget requested amount is very fair.\n\nThe proposal provides a detailed overview of the team's qualifications. After reading their credentials, and verifying them I agree that they have a good chance of successfully implementing this project.\n\nThe proposers have selected \u201cYes\u201d as the answer to the new questions related to work on previously funded Catalyst proposals and planned work on Fund 9 proposals. As such, one item that is missing from the proposal currently, is the description of the exact commitment required by all the projects they are working on that have been funded by Project Catalyst plus the ones they have submitted in Fund 9. This should have come with a plan on how they plan to manage the workload. These are elements that are now requested when submitting proposals. However, since the questions have just been introduced in Fund 9 I will not be deducting any points from my rating because of this. The proposers may have not fully understood what is being requested of them, but, I do advise the team include an actual description in future submissions.\n\nThat being said I have tried to look at the profile of the proposer on the Lido Nation website (Catalyst data aggregator page) and have not found any info about previously funded proposals or other Fund 9 proposals except for this one.\n\nhttps://www.lidonation.com/en/project-catalyst/users/205 ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The KPIs provided in the auditability section make a lot of sense given the educational nature of the project. They would be easy for the community to verify. The only thing that I think is missing from this section at the moment is a clear description of how this information will be made public to the community. Monthly reports are mentioned but it\u2019s not exactly clear where these reports would be published. I assumed that the very least progress will be recorded in the Catalyst monthly report. This is however not a large enough issue to justify the ducting a point from the final auditability rating.\n\nThe definitions of success further emphasise what could be achieved by this learning initiative.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2169", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 3, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1279, "q0": "A big mountain of information awaits a newbie coming to Cardano. And for new developers, Cardano's programming language (Plutus, Haskell) is regarded as being quite challenging to master. However, it is fantastic to have Catalyst Fund in our ecosystem, all we need now are good ideas to start solving our problems. And the Learn to Earn program is a fantastic way to inspire and draw new developers to Cardano, particularly those from low-income nations.\n\nCardano is currently in the growth stage of development; as its ecosystem expands rapidly in the coming years, it will undoubtedly require an increasing amount of manpower. Therefore, the proposal is very significant for spreading knowledge about Cardano, writing smart contracts, and developing Dapps on the Cardano platform.\n\nI'm hoping the project will be a success and attract a new development community to Cardano. In that instance, the project development team will be given a sizable resource to realize their future ideas.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A similar course is being offered and developed by several team members: BDU L-EARN, which has over 100 members in its Telegram group and a decent amount of interaction in its Discord channel. There are now 8 Beginner Lessons in this course, which gives the team valuable experience as they develop the Cardano-L-EARN project. Two team members have taken part in community projects like LATAM Cardano Community, Bitcoin Bay, and Cardano Hub Buenos Aires. These community groups will be good places to introduce and promote the project when it starts. The project team is thus entirely qualified and experienced to carry out the project.\n\nThe specifics of the project's milestones are provided. The desired number of community members, in my opinion, is a little bit high, particularly given that people's interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchains is diminishing due to the current weak market. To reach that target quantity, the team must effectively implement the marketing strategy and produce high-quality lessons.\n\nThe budget is quite reasonable, but there are a few minor inaccuracies in the budget calculations for Lesson Creators, and Test Administrators. In addition, the cost of hiring Cardano developers or students to audit lessons was not included in the budget.\n\nPeer-to-peer education, which enables students to instruct and assess new students after passing a lesson, greatly interests me. What a great idea, teaching is the best way to learn. I suggest the team take into account a mechanism that rewards students for their efforts in the process of imparting what they have learned and motivates them to conduct in-depth study in order to update outdated lessons or develop brand-new and more depth lessons. The community of former students can peer-review these new lessons for quality and potential inclusion in the course. If so, we can create a learning system that reinforces itself.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Quantitative data provided by the team in the monthly reports, coupled with the findings of the audit of the lessons, provide a sufficient basis for assessing the project's quality, development, and completion.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2220", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3445, "q0": "The idea of creating a reward mechanism for people to learn blockchain and earn is very valid and aligns with challenge as new people will have the developers skills and strenghts the ecosystem. \nHowever, I have some doubts on the sustainability of the solution. First, what will happen if there's a higher demand for lessons than there's fund available to pay? Would this mechanism simply stop or is tehre any plan to continue in other way?\nAlso, is there a way to prevent people who already know the content to keep creating accounts and doing the lessons just to earn the money? These could be 2 extra challenges to consider in risk analyis.\nMoreover, proposer could provide here more information on course formulation and syllabus just as an advertising strategy, considering the potential target audience he mentions (low income countries).\n\nAll in all, the idea is good here but there are more challenges to be considered than the ones mentioned.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan provided is fair, has relevant milestones and is time-framed.

The proposal has considered the challenge and risks and has approaches in place to mitigate the risks. Good examples of this mitigation are proof of person (BrightID to prevent sybil attack).

That will be a testament to their efforts and efforts, they can use it to apply for jobs in some projects in the Cardano ecosystem.\nThis project brings a significant impact to the programmers in particular and the Cardano ecosystem in general.

The metrics and goals of the proposal also align with the goal of increased developer adoption of challenge setting.\n\nI've looked through the team's \"Intro to Ethereum\" and \"Intro to Cardano L-EARN\" lessons on GitHub, and in general, the lessons only cover the concept in a basic and simple way but do not go into detailed explanations. The content of the lesson is not as good as I expected. Therefore, I suggest that this project should clearly state the content of the courses that the team will create so that the voter can clearly see what the developer will learn when completing the course, or in other words what value will these lessons bring to learners.

I suggest that the proposer should add Jose's information so that people can better understand his ability to create Cardano lessons.\n\nThe project's budget has been broken down into definable items, spending $12,200 to create, update, test for 35 lessons and $15,300 for learner rewards makes sense to me. The given timetable has clear milestones with realistic time periods.\n\nThe team has foreseen possible risks such as sybil attackers, outdated course content due to Cardano improvements, and students copying answers to receive rewards. However, in my opinion, there is another risk that the team needs to consider, that is, the reward is not attractive enough for learners, leading to the number of participants not meeting the set target.\n\nRegarding the implementation plan, I hope the proposer can detail what the topic of each lesson is, for example, the first lesson introduces 3 generations of blockchain, and the second lesson introduces Cardano, for example.

The proposer has already assessed the risk of reward exploitation by participants by requiring unique ID via BrightID or video call, though the latter options might be more easily exploitable (i.e. asking other people to show up, etc.). I personally am a bit lukewarm to the idea of using Github as the learning platform since while it does allow the project to be open-source, Github isn\u2019t much of a user-facing platform and at the moment, the open-source aspect is only beneficial if someone does voluntarily contribute to the project. The goal of this proposal is aligned with challenge setting objective of \u201cmore developers would be drawn into Cardano\u201d.
