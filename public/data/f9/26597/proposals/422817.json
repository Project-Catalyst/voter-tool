It proposes to create a centalized project management tool to record the contributions from the challenge team members and ensure it is fair and transparent. It plans to help run proof-of-life sessions so as to avoid having the proposers go through multiple POL sessions. From personal experience, a funded proposer in more than one challenge setting needs to conduct as many POL sessions as the number of challenge settings they were funded in - this is repetitive. Unifying the POL into one sessions will save every proposer who was funded in multiple challenges will save at least 1 hour of his time. The benefits will flow primarily to the challenge teams and improve their experience, the Cardano developer community will benefit as a result, but as a secondary effect and will not directly increase the number of developers, therefore I agree that the answer covers most of the criteria", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Yes, the proposer has provided links to their LinkedIn profiles, they are coordinators of the Eastern Hemisphere townhall and have technical backgrounds, some with more than 10 years of experience. The budget is provided with a reasonable amount of detail, broken down into main categories of design costs, development, marketing, and infrastructure costs. The suggested remuneration rate is at $60/h which is below the market rate in the US, and quite reasonable for East Asia. The proposers suggest 3.5 months to deliver at a budget of $28k across a team of 3. The proposer explains that it will be a web-based app and provided print screens of a prototype in excel, it will run on the Amazon cloud. My recommendation to the proposer is that the infrastructure costs are a little high for the number of users that this service would receive - 4000 for 15 months is a very high-end service, I would suggest researching some around the $100/month range. The proposer does not provide the technical details of the solution such as the framework for the front end that they will use (e.g., React, Vue, Angular, PHP), the proposer also doesn\u2019t state the backend database that will be used.  The proposers do not detail any meaningful risks. Therefore I agree that given their experience and plan presented they will be to deliver the proposal but might face challenges in the choice and design of all the components they have set out, and the considerations of risks could have been given more thought. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, the proposers set out a roadman with milestones that coincide with their delivery plan in the previous section. The KPI metric against which to track progress is however not provided. I would suggest for the proposer to include measurable KPIs that can be tracked month and month and give comfort to the community that the project is progressing as planned. The proposers provide what success looks like, however, it would be very helpful if it included statements on the number of potential users and adoption across the community. I, therefore, agree that the proposal has enough information to audit the progress, but it would benefit from a more structured and quantitative set of KPIs", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2123", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 1, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 975, "q0": "This proposal aims to create a tool that would simplify the life of Catalyst challenge teams by automating a lot of the tasks that they have to deal with. It\u2019s a great suggestion, except for the fact that challenge teams are not a part of the developer ecosystem of Cardano and as such the placement of this proposal in this challenge is questionable.\n\nThe answer given to why this proposal fits the challenge is a description of the deliverables of this project, and they do very little to convince us that the Developer Ecosystem challenge is appropriately chosen.\n\nBesides this, the description of the proposed tool itself is a bit unclear. It\u2019s difficult to visualise from the proposal\u2019s text what exactly it will do and what this web portal will offer to challenge teams. General claims are made such as \u201ca record-keeping and management service\u201d, but almost no specific functions are described, besides the ability to more easily distribute payments to challenge team members based on contributions. Some ideas of the planned features can be deduced from the implementation plan, but they are just bullet points, without too many details about their functionality.\n\nMost of the Impact section of the proposal is dedicated to describing how Challenge teams currently work.\n\nThe risks section is left practically empty, with the proposer opting instead to point out that there won\u2019t be any problems and if there will be they will hire additional team members.\n\nMy assessment of this Developer Ecosystem proposal is based on my experience as a project manager working directly with Cardano developers since July 2021. I have participated in almost all roles in Catalyst since February 2021, including as a Challenge Team member, and I\u2019ve been involved with the Cardano development and NFT communities for about a year and a half.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The implementation plan covers the first 12 months of operation of the project, but the service is planned to be released after 3.5 months of development. The plan is logically structured and frankly provides the most detail about what the actual deliverables of the proposal will be, though it still doesn\u2019t offer a complete picture about what exactly the portal will offer.\n\nThe budget breakdown offers a complete picture of the project\u2019s cash flows and everything seems to be reasonably estimated at a cost of $60/h.\n\nThe proposal provides a thorough description of each of the 3 team members with links to the LinkedIn profiles of two of the members that support the info in the proposal. They seem more than capable of delivering on a high quality technical project.\n\nI would have given the proposal a score of 5 for the Feasibility section, except for the fact that it\u2019s unclear what exactly will be the deliverables of the project. As such it\u2019s difficult to judge exactly if the team is or isn\u2019t able to produce them.\n\nOne last note about the Feasibility section, \u201cYes\u201d is selected as the answer to both multi-project workload questions, but no additional details are provided in the detailed plan part of the Feasibility section as specified in the detailed description of the questions on the proposal submission form. I will not be lovering my feasibility score because of this as the questions are new to Fund 9. As such the proposers might have not clearly understood that a detailed presentation of all the proposals they are currently working on is requested as well as a plan for how they will manage the workload required by each of them. But I recommend that the team includes a detailed answer in future submissions.\n\nThe main proposer appears to have only submitted two proposals in Fund9 and does not have any other previous submissions. This is exactly why a clearer picture of all team members would have been needed.\nSource: https://www.lidonation.com/en/project-catalyst/users/2041 ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability section contains a copy of the implementation plan, which I\u2019m not sure is needed. As previously funded proposers the team seem to be familiar with the current auditing requirements, but I would have liked to see a bit more emphasis placed on what exactly it is they intend to provide as auditing material, and perhaps even suggestions on how the auditing process could be improved. As already funded proposers they have a front-row seat to the process. IOG is guiding and managing the process for now but let us not forget that the funds come from the community treasury, from the 20% tax on our rewards we all pay each epoch as ADA holders, and hopefully, eventually, the entire process will be handed over and managed by the community relatively soon.\n\nThe definition of success for the project actually does more to give a good overview of what we can expect the project to deliver. I only wish the rest of the proposal would have expanded more on these details.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that a tool for Challenge Teams would definitely be needed to assist with the Catalyst process, though the placement of this proposal in the Developer Ecosystem challenge seems unjustified and I really would have liked to see more clarity about the features that such a tool/portal would have.

By having a one-stop-shop for teams to submit their proof of life requirements, will not only improve the proposer's experience but will allow the CTs to function better across the ecosystem. The existing methods are often disparate, non aligned in their function, and subject to serious version control issues. By putting these processes into a web-based portal, the existing challenges can be easily overcome. \n\nWhile I have not participated on a CT, I have been a member of the community for a long time and it is clear that on any team, some people do much more work than others. This portal will also allow the CTs to allocate the $5k available to pay them appropriately along the lines of who contributed what, when, and how. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented, it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nGiven that these are CTs submitting the proposal it is clear that they know what to do. The plan is very well articulated at a granular level that makes their intent, activities, and deliverables very clear. The level of detail provided implies that the team well understands the required steps and has a plan to address each of them. \n\nIn addition, since the CTs are largely a creation of IOG in F7, there is a likelihood that there is a broader incentive to get such a system up and running. Based on the credentials provided of the specific team members, this proposal appears to fall very much within their capacity to deliver. \n\nAs funded proposals coming from Catalyst move from the hundreds to thousands, this type of tool will be necessary to manage all of the information. Getting this project funded now would allow the community test and optimize it before we reach the impending tidal wave of proposals that we can expect to arrive each fund. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. \n\nAs mentioned under feasibility, the granularity of the plan and expected deliverables after each month make it very clear for the community to audit the proposal. Since the end result will also be used by all CTs, the team commits to testing their solution with existing teams to ensure the effectiveness and experience of the dApp. This will certainly result in direct auditing by the community. \n\nI do think that there should be some delineation between the plan, KPIs, and success measures. Simply repeating the plan in the KPI section is not really sufficient. For example, if the success measure is to provide \"a closer to one stop shop\" how will you measure that has actually done this? Will you use the # of challenge teams using the portal? The percentage of teams using it month over month? Adoption by IOG as the standard for CTs doing PoL? Having something tangible removes the guesswork for voters on what you actually mean. \n\nOverall an excellent and exciting proposal. Best of luck in the next stage.

This is definately important for the ecosystem, because the challenge team is a great help through the process phases of the project catalyst. I didn't know this problem existed, because I've never been in a challenge team, but it's nice to see there are people actively working on a solution in order to better the process and make it more fair and reliable.\nThe project is in the right category helping the development environment be more friendly and reliable, purging fears of not getting payed for your work. It's aligned with the challenge settings as well and will be benefitial for the challenge team to use.\nBy the looks of it the metrics seem relevant to the work being done, considering I know only what the proposal state, but as a developer I do find it logical. The process will be reletively simple but even so good enough for the task at hand.

The number and necessary skills for each team members is clear and as I mentioned they are qualified for each specific task. \nThe proposal offers a precise budget breakdown a very good roadmap and specific milestones and tasks to follow accompanied by a timetable that ties it all up. The budget seems reasonable for the work that needs to be done, although as a developer my knowlede on marketing funding isn't reliable, but I can speak to the weekly meetings and cost for webside development and design as I do have some expertise there.\nI think the tasks are iterative and build on top of eachother and the plan for implementation is sensible and somewhat optimized. The proposal clearly articulates the relevant technical aspects that will be used and explains the algorythm if it can be called that, quite well.\nOverall this is a decent and most of all feasible proposal and will help out in future funds to minimize the friction in challenge teams.

It contributes to the development of the Cardano ecosystem. The problem to be solved here is to streamline the POL process, which involves keeping records for every single task, resulting in fairer payments and increased productivity for each CT member. I cannot deny the practicality that day-to-day topics bring not only in the present but also in the future. This proposal also brings long-term benefits at work - specifically, it helps to perform work quickly, and shorten unnecessary operations, thereby increasing labor productivity for members and employees. The team identified the problem to be solved very clearly, adding value to the Cardano ecosystem. I especially love the convenience it brings to the community, especially for members and CT. If this proposal is successfully applied in practice, members will be able to do a lot of work with high volume quickly (increasing labor productivity) and still have accurate work efficiency. It is especially necessary for the current era - an age involving digital technology and AI - which presents people with a huge amount of work - to keep up with and respond to social progress.

What I strongly agree with is that the team has submitted many documents related to the proposal to further clarify to the community the feasibility. An equally important thing to strengthen the credibility of the team is to link to the demonstrated social network (Discord, Facebook, etc...) to publicize the identity of each member. You did this well. Thereby, the community can see the prestige and trust in the team. Regarding the details of the allocated budget, based on the analysis, I find it reasonable. I strongly agree that the team charges based on the hours worked by each member. This is a common and fairly accurate costing method today. I have a question to further confirm the feasibility of the proposal: If it has not been funded by Catalyst at Fund 9, will the team continue to implement the proposal? Does the team currently have any other financial resources? My question is positive to help the community better understand the feasibility of the proposal, not to criticize the bad things about the proposal. The plan and implementation method were presented by the team throughout the proposal. This shows the professionalism of those who have worked for many years in the blockchain field. Regarding the resources needed to implement, I found that the team is quite full of necessary resources (only lacking financial resources), and fully staffed with good professionals. However, I know that the team has members who are working on other proposals in parallel with this proposal at Fund 9, will this affect the quality of implementation when this proposal is granted quarterly? What do you use to prove that the proposal still retains the effectiveness and quality of the work performed? That's what I think the team needs to make clear to the community to increase the feasibility of the proposal. In terms of technology, I agree that the proposal is made on the Cardano blockchain platform, submitting the POL database, the Cardano blockchain is essentially a blockchain platform that is highly complete and very easy to manipulate ( except for the native programming language Haskell/Plutus). In terms of risks when implementing the proposal, the team came up with a solution to find more members when necessary to meet the distribution target for Fund 10 POL. So do you think finding this member will be difficult? I ask this because high-quality human resources in the blockchain market are scarce. I would like to propose the solution that is, the team can contact specialized intermediary companies that provide high-quality human resources in information technology, even experts so that the team can well implement the proposal. . Contact with experts that the team outsources has a very clear advantage that we have contact with the best people in the field they undertake, we have the conditions to learn the beauty of their knowledge.

If this is done, it will be very convenient for the community to evaluate the transparency of the proposal. The definition of success given by the team is quite clear and realistic. I very much agree because based on that the community can evaluate success when applied in practice through such a definition. For a more accurate assessment, we need to rely on specific numbers, I regret that the team's proposal does not have KPIs and key metrics. Considering the auditability of a proposal, these two indicators play a rather important role. So my advice to demonstrate transparency and auditability is for the team to quickly add KPIs and key metrics.
