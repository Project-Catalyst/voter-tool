It would take less time for readers to quickly scan through the Team's proposal if their problem statements and solutions are shown with better structure and bullet points.\n\nThe Team does not describe how their project can add value to Cardano's ecosystem. I can see that the Team's solution to Cardano's high carbon consumption does not add monetary value to Cardano, but cost Cardano's ecosystem money (via the paying of Moss token to Moss. Earth). Their proposal, if approved, will not attract additional users to the Cardano ecosystem.\nThe Team's proposal is asking Cardano to pay for the Carbon emitted by Cardano's ecosystem to the environment. This is a cost to Cardano's ecosystem, and if approved, is not likely to be adopted by other Ecosystems whose focus is more on profits and gains.

Earth. This raises a lot of questions for the audience. Why don't they keep their Trader options open? Is there any particular reason for selecting Moss. Earth? Are they, and why are they better than any other Carbon Offset Trader? Is there any conflict of interest that needs to be disclosed? Does any of the Team members have shares/benefits from Moss.Earth?

The listings of cost items in percentage make their Proposal not trustworthy and potential investors question the Team\u2019s devotion. The high audit cost of 20% total budget shows that the Team is not capable of budgeting and controlling their budget.

Proof of stake (Cardano) uses much less energy than proof of work.Now, the goal of the Dcspark team is to create a dapp that will estimate the carbon emission level of Cardano which they will offset by burning moss tokens.

So 40% will be allocated to the development, deployment and bridge coordination. They also decided to put 20% into auditing the code. Smart contract audit is a must for all dapp because any vulnerability can cause major harm to users. 20% of the budget will serve as liquidity for carbon credit for Cardano and Mikomeda. I\u2019m not convinced of the sustainability of this solution. What will happen when the liquidity dries out? Are they relying on Catalyst to get liquidity everytime? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s sustainable and maybe the team can find a solution to make the dapp self-sustaining. 15% of the budget will be dedicated to the management and 5% for catalyst project management.

If funded, I believe the group should hire more people who specialize in professionally presenting and editing ideas in order to respect the community. \nBack to the point. To improve transparency, I believe the team should detail the expenses and whether they are calculated in USD or working time. The metrics are irrelevant to the challenge and no one can measure the project's success, I give this section 3 points.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3250", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 13611, "q0": "About the idea of \u200b\u200breducing carbon consumption in the environment it is a very good idea and has a lot of value in terms of environmental protection.\nI have met many projects with the same goal such as KlimaDao on Polygon but now it is alive and well.\nIf I look at the requirements set by the Challenge, I think this proposal will very well address the requirements set by the Challenge.\nBut if I look at it from the user's perspective, I see that the feasibility and applicability of this dApp will not be high and few people will pay attention and use it.\nAs the end problem this dApp creates is to buy back Moss tokens and burn this token. This means reducing the amount of Cardano in the environment. The problem here is who will buy this token and burn it.\nIf you create a dApp that is highly functional and generates revenue from transaction fees. You use that money to buy Moss code to reduce the amount of Cardano, it will be much more reasonable. When you build a dApp to measure Carbon emissions from Cardano and Milkomeda C1. So where will you get the money to buy the Moss code and burn it. This issue I see the author has not mentioned.\nSo if the assessment of this proposal effectively solves the Challenge I think Yes Still this proposal creates an effective and sustainable product I think No", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I have been following the dcSpark team for a long time and I know that they are a very competent team. Their team has talented members who have worked for EMUGRO for a long time, so the issue of expertise I don't think is the problem.\nIn this proposal, they are very detailed compared to other proposals they have written in Fund9. It is possible that the author and the team have high hopes for this proposal to be funded. So information about team members is introduced in much more detail. Interested voters can check out their chief technology officer here: https://twitter.com/SebastienGllmt.\nSince they are celebrities, they don't need to give links to prove their competence. That's the note I wanted to send to new voters who don't know dcSpark.\nIn the proposal, the author has detailed the implementation plan of this proposal, although it is still quite sketchy compared to other proposals. But this is the most detailed plan their team has written in Fund9.\nWith a team that has good capabilities and has worked on other products that have been very successful, I believe this proposal will not be too difficult for them.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The information provided by the author is sufficient for me to see the success of the proposal. I hope the other proposals they write should be more detailed, out of respect for the reviewers and the voters who voted for them.\nEven though they have good abilities, they should still do it more carefully and with more care.\nLooking at the work history and implementing the recommendations along with the information provided by the author I see they will complete the proposal excellently. I'm just concerned about the effectiveness of this dApp once it's up and running. That's who will use it and how does this dApp generate revenue and cash flow for the Moss token acquisition.

Yet, the problem is very subjectively with energy consumption. However, the solution is very much only at conceptual level with Moss.earth via a Smart Contract token. It would be controversial how much this solution can help to reduce the energy consumption level from Cardano Blockchain technology consumption. The chosen of Moss.Earth and the cooperation with Mikomeda Devs also posed a challenge of transparency. It is also no risks involved in this project thus pose a sense of complacency of the proposers. What could been done better is that there should be more well-researched for alternative providers as well as a demo for this proposal. The detail of the partnership between Moss team and dcSpark team would also need to be highlighted as this is the core successful factor of this proposal.

There is no milestone attached to this project for the community to know when will it be finished and monitored. Some of the core team who worked on this project would also need to be shared here for either is it a vacant position (to be hired) or a verifiable account of current team member.\nThe only great thing about this project is the team dcSpark which is very well-known a reliable  the Cardano Community. However, they applied  10 proposals this Catalyst Fund 9 with the same project lead is Sebastien Guillemot. The PA is a huge fan of dcSpark and have lots of respect for Sebastien, however it would be a concern for the feasibility of delivery of 10 proposal all get funded. It would be much more for the team to complete all 10 proposals. It is a suggestion from the PA to show a more updated frequently milestones and team resources allocation so that the Cardano Community can keep track and follow through this proposal.

The ambition is very inspirational however the how to get there by milestones is missing, moreover, the adoption of this even after the team finish  the smart contract for mco2 token is highly recommended for the real migration to happen. What is the Migration plan is highly recommended for the current Ethereum users. What also needs to be highlighted is the Sustainable Development Goals in relation to the new aim of Cardano Catalyst this Fund.
