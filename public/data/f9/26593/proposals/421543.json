I am not as confident that they've done adequate research and scope of what it will take to build this on Cardano. I am mentioning this because a key metric of the challenge is \"Number of projects that migrate\" and without a full scope of what it takes to \"migrate\" risks its ability to meet the challenge desired impact. I know this because I myself am a developer in the cardano ecosystem, acutely aware of the talent pool and robustness of developer tooling. \n\nA five star proposal would sit longer with the question that asks about risks.

The 15k for 1 full stack developer full time to do blockchain integration and tokenization seems unreasonable low to complete this work. I am an unusual 'full stack' dev with loads of experience DevOps and system architecture. Devops work, secure server and key management and processes alone would easily consume that 15k budget (for European markets). \n\nWhat about smart contract integration work?

However, the project itself doesn't add to the migration of ETH projects to the Cardano ecosystem outside of migrating themselves. The impact of the proposal itself is quite large due to converting loyalty points into sustainable products and services purchases. This could potentially onboard a lot of users but not necessarily from Ethereum but the general public to Cardano some of which can be ETH users. However they will be using the Floras token instead of ADA. I am assuming Floras is native Cardano token since this token is posted in this challenge. Something that could be improved is open sourcing this so that other ETH projects that want to do the same can do the same quicker and provide a platform of sustainable loyalty token as a service instead of just Floras reward currency.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team is strong and seems like it has the chops to pull this off, however, building tokenomics and smart contracts requires Haskell/Plutus knowledge that the team is missing at the moment. The plan doesn't mention that they are going to hire a Plutus developer but others. Additionally, the CTO who is paid, and by the looks of it from their LinkedIn profile they are only a fractional CTO. The team was indeed part of the Skydeck with Aeros in Spring 2020 but that was 2 years ago and the website http://aerosnetwork.com/ doesn't lead anywhere, unfortunately. This is a mixed bag because the team is strong but leaves something to be desired. With all this, nothing is wrong but it's not strongly agreed upon from the feasibility side.

The Proposal is really suitable for the Challenge.\nI was really intrigued by the definition of a \u201cCarbon credit,\u201d a permit that certifies that 1 ton of carbon dioxide has been removed from the atmosphere, helping to quantify efforts to clean up the atmosphere. Users have just bought products, accumulated Floras money, then donated to the project of afforestation, helping to improve the environment. A humanistic circle. The circle is a collection of small, highly automated transactions that require traceability to trace. From there, we can see that the Cardano ecosystem can completely provide a full range of tools for developers to build dApps, the cost is very cheap, many jobs can be processed in 1 transaction.\nRisks have been planned and mitigation plans are provided, proving that the project team has extensive and in-depth expertise from many sides.
