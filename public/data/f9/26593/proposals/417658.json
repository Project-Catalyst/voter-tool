So it makes 3 to 12 Mondays, where the proposer intends to be a partner host. By becoming the partner host, they will provide support with venue and arrangements, offer onboarding materials and coordinate in-person seminars. Regarding the content, the they plan to address the low recognition of Cardano within NYC (information, guidelines, and hopefully redirect the new inflow from ETH to Cardano) via these meetings, which we can categorize to the form of marketing and providing information source. About risks \u2013 I completely agree that the most significant risk will be rejection from ETH maxis, good luck tackling that one. Since the goal is to migrate these ETH users to Cardano, it would be nice to know how many participants are actually coming to these CryptoMondays, how many are actual users of ETH, or just visitors (or at least rough estimation, what the outreach will be). I have found, that there is 9k members of CryptoMondays, and selecting a random meeting, it appears that the attendance is approx. 100 people, then I have checked another, and there were 1k attended, so I selected the third, and there was 200 attendees\u2026from that, it is unclear to me how many people proposers plan to outreach, which is posing the question how impactful it will be.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The roadmap is set for three months starting in September, and the content of these meeting is to show cardano ecosystem, networking sessions, chats with devs or project founds and eventually on-boarding of new members.

Cardano material \u2013 what exactly it will be? Some work in process to display props, or what is expected to be delivered? Or at least list of possible items e.g. posters, flyers etc. 2. Food and beverages could have been set per meeting, not per month. (since the number of meetings is 1-4 per month, the calculation for food and beverages could have been as well).

Regarding KPIs, there are responses from ETH to Cardano events, new Cardano wallets created during meetups (but I am not sure if it is a reliable metric, unless you plan to track on-chain activity for these wallets too), and the number of participants on these events. I suggest to provide some posts(articles, blogs), records and pictures from meetings. That is the best and easiest way how to allow community to track it. Maybe set up a twitter/IG account, and make a live videos, stories. Regarding the success of the project, the first two metrics are not really helpful, only the third one \u2013 participation \u2013 is a relevant metric that can be tracked.

Pay money to an existing and successful 50 or so franchise Crypto Networking business - Crypto Monday, hand out merch, free drinks and food and get the Cardano name exposed to those attending and some press.

If the proposal already has a plan, please specify. I think the first thing to suggest should focus on giving the practical benefits that CryptoMondays need and make them enjoy, in addition to sponsoring the costs of the events. For example, presenting two leading ecosystems that will join hands to help blockchain develop, CryptoMondays has more meetings, more loyal members from both groups, is a place to exchange quality technology, build a construction community for the world\nAs for the risk, and lack of cooperation from the people of Ethereum Maxis, I have an option as follows. Always listen to them, because they represent a miniature ETH society. At the same time, the Cardano community must have veteran programmers, developers, and investors, deeply knowledgeable about the technology, about the Cardano ecosystem. From there, it will create a balance, respect each other, and listen to each other. After many times of contact and interaction, if it is true that the Cardano ecosystem is better than the ETH ecosystem, for the common good and personal benefit, they will immediately realize and change themselves, because they are knowledgeable people, knowledgeable about the industry and also want to optimize their work or investments\nProposing a specific, highly impactful solution, I hope the above comments will help improve the proposal.
