Then the proposer claims that he created a cyber nations \u2013 which is a space where the domains can be accommodated, and allows only subnets owners to make transaction within that space. The specific goal of these transaction is then crypto commerce (crypto marketing). Then owners of domains accommodated within \u201cCyber Nations\u201d can post ads about stuff they want to buy or sell. Actually, this is the most tangible information \u2013 you can post your ad, you can get in contact, you can buy and you can sell\u2026.using crypto. To somehow wrap my head around that, it appears that it will serve as a free-accessible marketplace where people can advertise anything they want, and then these items can be bought/sold using cryptocurrencies. Other than that, many is remaining unclear, such as \u2013 what does it has to do with migration? How is it related to Cardano? Except you can use for paying. Also, there was no connect-wallet button on the website, so how this will work. Will the Cyber nation also be able to perform transactions, or it will just serve for reaching out and advertisement? The thing I am missing the most, is a practical example, but as for now, I failed to see the connection to Cardano, migration, and why is this even needed. I have tried to play with the website for a while, and then it was something with parcels\u2026which was evoking METAVERSE, and then there were pictures of spaces for rent - offices, \u2026maybe the idea is that if you will want to post advertisement to that specific website, you will have to rent a place there, and then you can post advertisements.

Knowledge in Solidity, Haskell or Plutus would be much more applicable for developing or migrating any solution in Cardano.

There is no implementation plan, no working tasks, no milestones, no roles, nothing relevant mentioned anywhere.\nThe budget also covers only some fixed and operational costs for the hardware and yet another surprise is the point of an ICO token generation. The proposal confirms that it will request further funding in the future to maintain the servers, nothing is stated about EVM migration and Cardano.\nAs a summary, the big question is how the hardware infrastructure is related to the proposed solution and further on to the specific challenge?", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proposal does not provide any roadmap, milestones and criteria to measure its progress, so there is no way to track it by the community.

James claims that everything the \"code is written and ready to be rolled out\", but there is very little reputation to check if that were true.

The cost breakdown seem fair and with the 19,000 categorized for just servers and internet which should last them a good couple of years (assuming it does not scale too high too soon), but if they do plan on coming back at a later Fund then there is no need to request such a high amount for just running servers and internet. It would be in the benefit for the team and the community to first run the project and test its use cases and then get a good estimate of whether this is a feasible project.
