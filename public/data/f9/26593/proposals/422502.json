As right now, if a DAO would like to migrate from EVM to Cardano, they would need to develop their own smart contracts for activities and processes within dao \u2013 which are in general \u2013 proposing (working grups, norms and standards within DAO, projects), voting or staking. It is important to state, that the proposal is going to be open-sourced, which is increasing the outreach of its audience. In short, the aim is to develop set of tools which are currently not existing, do it open-sourced, and therefore induce the migration of EVM DAOs to Cardano, by offering these solutions. The catch phrase supporting the impact of this proposal could be \u201cWe are expanding the information architecture of DAOs beyond what is typical and ordinary.\u201d, which I find very attractive. Regarding risks, the proposer state that the most anticipated risks will be the ones of technical character, and to tackle them they will be having a support of DoneCollectively technical staff. Nevertheless, DAOs are experiencing the downtrend (according to googletrends), thus additional risk might actually be the interest of these features.

Each of these period are having the details of tasks and action items to be performed, and also the time dotation with the respective position (there are three positions \u2013 full stack blockchain engineer, advisors and project manager). The roadmap with the time schedule and budget preparation appears to be well thought and prepared in a detail, containing all the necessary information. The total budget requested is 95 320 USD, and the calculations are provided. I would say that the amounts are slightly stretched, and the source of the hourly wages was not disclosed, but it is not affecting the feasibility assessment. Regarding the team, we have the list of team members (5), with provided github profile and keybase profile. To evaluate developer skills, github are sufficient, but in respect to project manager or advisor, additional information would increase the confidence, where some previous jobs, or previous projects would be displayed.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The problem of lacking governance smart contracts for EVM DAOs, and to implement them on Cardano is logical and clear. At the same time, the code will be open source, thus we can monitor and track the process of the development. The proposer also state, that it will be possible to track the process on the Done Collectively discord server, because they plan to post there reports. Regarding the success of the proposal, the proposer state that it will be able to verify via DAOs from other chains have on boarded done collectively and bridged/transferred their tokens into Milkomeda smart contracts. I think it requires more information how exactly we will be able to track and monitor these data e.g. number of discord members raised, or if we are able to see how many of these smart contracts were executed (so it means they are being used), volume of transacions etc. I am taking one star down because from the proposal it was not apparent how we will measure the success of the proposal.

How many DAOs migrated?)", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2222", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 4, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "thank you for taking the time to thoughtfully review"}, {"id": 5571, "q0": "The problem raised with this proposal is that DAOs that operate on dozens of existing Ethereum Virtual Machine-based networks, using Ethereum-based tools, have no ramp for their DAOs to migrate to the Cardano ecosystem.

This is a great idea and solution that fits this challenge, it provides a clear path for people to get comfortable with EVM blockchains working on Milkomeda, move their ETH/native currency into Milkomeda, and use them in the Done Collectively DAO management ecosystem. I believe it will attract the community of users and projects on Ethereum interested in joining the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposed team provided a detailed plan, including progress and milestones, each of 2 months starting from June 2022 and ending in January 2023. Although the team just started fund 9 in June, the team has already done the first work on the project's plan (OpenZeppelin contracts are working on the Milkomeda testnet). The work contents of each milestone are very clear with detailed calculations of resources and construction time, which helps us to believe that the project will be implemented on schedule until 1-2023 (Contract contract). deployed on the Milkomeda manner). In terms of the suggested budget that provides hourly unit pricing information ($150 per hour for a full blockchain engineer / $120 per hour for a project manager), this cost is high compared to an average of $80/hour. $40k for smart contract testing (based on ~800 lines of code to test), this budget would be clearer if broken down and detailed. The group provides detailed information about the team members such as (identity, skills, expertise, and social networking links). The team also plans to continue participating in the fund later, if it is provided with some more information about the plan for the following fund, it will be great. The team also identifies the risk challenge and offers solutions to minimize the risk.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As outlined in the previous section, the proposal provided a roadmap with clear milestones and 7-month timelines for achievement. Metrics are hard to measure but verifiable and controllable (progress reporting in public channels in the Complete Discord/measurement server sets an admin token to support recommendations of the Project and the Done Collectively/Workgroup/Done Collectively dashboard, showing the aggregate level of activities).

I can say this challenge is the most difficult part in technical side. WHY? because Integration part could create huge efforts to do. BUT proposer seems describing the solution is in a good way. I can say the research to get Integration working smoothly is the key to answer the challenge. And I see that the proposer and team doing it well. I hope this could be done smoothly with all supports proposer can get from this Project Catalysts. Please do remember Integration is the most difficult part in the technical side, because It's like marriage, you have to make agree and win in both side. Good Luck!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As I mentioned in the assessment note for Addressing Solution for Challenge. I said the Integration is the most difficult part in the technical POV. This means that it's supposed to be doing some testing. So I can give you some suggestions here. please also considering SIT (System Integration Testing) intensively with whatever third parties you connected to. And there must be UAT (User Accepted Testing) after that to ensure that all data Mapping in both side can be synced and working correctly. Besides that SIT and UAT, I think the milestone of the plans are good to go. But since you'll bring Integration part, please consider SIT and UAT on your timeline / milestone. This could be helpful for the dev team before doing Production release. Again I'll say Good Luck with Integration guys!", "q1r": 4, "q2": "From the Auditability perspective, I could see some progress on Github. But again I'll raise what's important in the Integration side. you guys might be providing Sandbox account to do Integration with other parties. This could be very helpful when you have client / another party using your product. Besides when you have Sandbox and providing Sandbox account, 50% of work visibility revealed and some work progress can be simulated in the Sandbox.

I think one of the biggest disconnects for most other blockchains onboarding to cardano is the fact that our code and smart contracts are so far off of what they are used to building in. That being said, we need projects like this to help bridge that gap. I would like to see those people you incentivize to migrate over to milkomedia eventually bridge the chain to Cardano main net dapps.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Your team is absolutely impressive in scope and skills. I would like to see more people bridging from other EVM chains to cardano, and I feel like this would be a great approach to achieving that. DAO's seem to be an attractor for most hardcore enthusiasts, so I believe we can help facilitate adoption simply by creating a platform that helps streamline the onboarding process. I am a little worried that this will take a bit longer than estimated, but that seems to be the deal with almost anything on Cardano. I wish your team the best and hope you get the funding you deserve!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "It seems you have the technical side of this project proposal down to a T. I would like to see more social media engagement to help bring a wider awareness to the rest of the Cardano ecosystem. Twitter comes to mind when keeping people updated on your progress, and doing a youtube video of your team introducing themselves may make voters more comfortable giving you the thumbs up for funding. Having social media to engage the people that are not as tech savvy as the programmers will greatly help your auditability. I can foresee this project being extremely successful, but that won't matter very much if you can't get the exposure you need to have people use it! Bridges are one of the best points for attack in the blockchain space as a whole, so I would like to see your smart contracts audited and displayed for people to see in order to make sure that there is no way that user funds will get lost. Since bridges are so dangerous, it may drive people away from using this project altogether. So, having that transparency may help ease fears of any issues arising from using your bridge.
