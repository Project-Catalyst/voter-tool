You may already argue, that we have policy ID to verify whether it is an original or a fake NFT, but as explained by proposer, this works only within one chain e.g. you can check policies within Cardano, but what if there is another project e.g. or solana chain, the impostor launches the exact copy on Cardano? Well in that case, it will appear as original collection on Cardano, and this is when the proposal come into play \u2013 it will allow cross-chain verification (currently it appears that integration from ETH is proposed). Since there is too many projects launched all over blockchains, to be actually able to spot these cross-chain copies, you would have to know all of them. As the term \u201ccross-chain\u201d was mentioned many times already, makes me wonder whether this proposal would not be a better fit for cross chain collaboration. I think the proposer is trying to distinguish it by the reasoning, that it will be marketed to Ethereum users primarily, and thus it would be a better fit for the challenge goal. We can look at it that way, since Ethereum is having the largest NFT market, that the majority of users will come from this chain, and that the other chains projects is just another positive outcome. The proposers are also elaborating the potential risks, and I dare to agree, that adoption (whether due to marketing, or lack of interest due to market conditions) is the major issue. To solve these, possible partnerships regarding marketing with the largest NFT marketplaces could be established. \"Avoid copies, verify on Argus\" banners etc. But what will make ETH projects/artist make to migrate? Aegis will. What is Aegis? Well, it is a service built on the Argus, which will be notifying artists and projects when copies of their art will occur. This will be (as it appears) paid service for non-Cardano projects, thus it can serve as a motivation for non-Cardano projects to be actually launched on Cardano blockchain. Advise for proposers: it took me a while to actually understand the connection between the proposal (nft originality check) and motivation to switch from ETH to Cardano. The link between argus->aegis and the reasoning should be KPI 1, not 2, and emphasized more. Because there is no need to switch from ETH to ADA if you can check any NFT for free, without any chain restrictions.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap is having 5 months in total, whilst only the high level description is provided (some subtasks of each category could have been outlined, atleast for the first three steps). The first part, which is estimated for 5 weeks is ongoing, and the proposer state that it is 70% completed, regarding research and review of Ethereum APIs. Another step, which is also ongoing is focusing on PoC (proof of concept) and the remaining three steps is to create a data storage, upgrade ArgusNFT by blockchain data and implement integration between database and argusNFT.  Regarding the budget, the total amount is 51 250 USD, that is divided into multiple (7) items. The largest items are Research and Integration for 12k, PoC for 7,5k, argus/eth integration for 17,5k,  and Argus upgrade for 10k. For more clarity, the funds requested could have been paired with the roadmap steps, and also with people involved e.g. step 1, 3 people involved, xx USD hourly rate = xxx USD. Regarding the team, currently it appears that there are 5 members, their bio + linked in profiles/git links are provided, and their skills and experience is matching the requirements. Also, the website ArgusNFT is already working, so I tested some NFTs, which returned a results, and a working demo is increasing the confidence that they are capable of delivering the outcome.

As for metrics which are evaluating the success of the proposal, the reduction of copies sold (based on jpg.store cooperation at first) and a partnership with NFT marketplace are stated. The latter makes me wonder, whether the team will have a strong leverage to actually convince ETH marketplace to make a partnership with a service, that is aiming to reduce the number of ETH launched projects. I guess it will depend on how they manage to sell the service \ud83d\ude0a Another metrics that are stated are related to the product itself, and its capabilities e.g. the uptime of the service. Regarding the migration from ETH, they plan to onboard 12 (respected) eth artists till 1.12.2022, and regarding the twitter followers \u2013 4 k followers till January 2023 (currently 119). So far, stated metrics seems to be very challenging, but what is unclear, is that they consider as a success of the proposal \u201cSignificantly increasing volume of NFTs traded on Cardano\u201d which I am not really sure if we can make a connection between the proposal and volume.

The fact that this project is being built on Cardano and making it interoperable with the Ethereum Community by promoting these services with or no cost to them especially for Ethereum community is definitely a path for Cardano to showcase its cost/benefit advantage, trust and security to Ethereum Community, and also an avenue to ensure the influx of NFT Artists and Collectors to Cardano.

"}, {"id": 3226, "q0": "I think the impact of this proposal will vary in relationship with the final product features, as of now this isn't a popular or useful product because it is redundant with other services providers, like the NFTs marketplaces themselves which show verified projects, furthermore, it would be more useful to know if a project is original or a copy before the minting event. A product which can verify the project originality in a trustless manner checking on-chain data on different blockchains anyway, is revolutionary and as a CNFT enthusiast I would appreciate the service, I also think major NFTs marketplaces would like to integrate Argus service, that's almost impossible to manually check all NFTs projects on different blockchains one by one. Cardano NFTs are gaining bigger attention every day and the traded volumes confirm this trend, one of the problems is the lack of integration from multichain NFTs sale trackers (things are getting better), Cardano blockchain is optimal for NFTs creators and collectors, because of its features, this has been proved by the vast majority of projects on Cardano being NFT, so a complete set of NFT tools are essential.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I think that, if developed the right way, this proposal has high probabilities to be successful, major concerns highlighted from Argos team are the lack of adoption from NFT marketplace stakeholders, which seems not the case, at least in the Cardano environment, where integration and partnerships are welcome and there is a spirit of collaboration and community between most of the projects, or problems because of adverse NFTs market conditions which will probably always come and leave in the time, but a solid team with strong fundamentals and economical funds shouldn\u2019t fear volatility. Regarding the technical side they have a solid road map, already in progress, a detailed budget breakdown and a skilled team which seems to have all the requisites to achieve great goals with a long-term view and possible future proposals to expand and improve their protocol in other funding rounds.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Provided information are more than enough to audit the progress and the success of the proposal, and they focus both on its partnerships and protocol integrations, and on the final user experience.

And this demand for our solution is evident in recent events. Opensea.io recently launched a limited beta on their marketplace of a similar, ML-powered solution. Deviant art has a similar solution protecting its users from art theft on a select few Ethereum marketplaces. And our recently announced partnership with JPG Store is another indicator that there's a need for our solution even with manual verification protocols in place.\n\nThat said, this assessment is on point for the most part, so I think it's appropriate to consider it in the evaluation, with the above caviat."}, {"id": 4770, "q0": "In its proposal, the team presents the problem of Fake NFTs on the market and explains in detail how it will tackle this problem.

Progressively with the help of the challenge, Cardano ecosystem is already beginning to have ethereum based projects started on Cardano and just as the proposer has stated in the problem statement, there are issues of counterfeits, plagiarism etc of ethereum native NFTs and if care is not taken, those issues might want to occur in cardano based NFTs. So therefore the problem described here tackles the pain points of the challenge. Since the project seeks to protect Cardano NFTs from plagiarism and counterfeiting then NFT developers on Cardano blockchain would not have to fear that their NFTs would be manipulated. This would make the cardano NFT space more secure. Motivating respected NFT artists to migrate from Ethereum to Cardano, having prominent NFT artists bring a comparatively large number of smaller projects to cardano amongst other key metrics align with migrating projects from Ethereum to Cardano. The goal of the proposal are in alignment with the challenge. Argus NFT appears to be viable hence I believe that in the long term, the project can be manipulated into another kind of a project to suit into other challenges since it\u2019s mainly concerned with pulling projects from Ethereum to Cardano.\nThe proposer has stated that the sustainability of the project would depend on catalyst funding when the need arises.

The roadmap is simply brief but understandable. I like how the timeline has been presented because it appears to be technical but yet simple to understand. \nThe project is generally technical, however it would also help if some explanation of API-centric explorers and NFT metadata was given since it\u2019s a major item in the timetable.\nHowever, it\u2019s good effort that the proposer has foreseen some risks/challenges that may arise during the implementation of the project.\nI will conclude by saying that the project is feasible.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap presented here is clear as stated in the feasibility section above.

There is clarity in the problem described and I believe that the proposed solution is effective to address it.\nThe information about how the progress of the project would be shared to Cardano/Catalyst community have been well outlined seeing that the team would make use of social media platforms consisting of monthly reports.\nHaving said all these, I believe this project is auditable.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2713", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Overall, a very solid proposal.

This should solve the problem that has been created by sellers offering the same NFT but minted on a different chain for either the same or a different amount of money, thereby essentially cheating or misleading the buyer. The buyer thinks he owns a rare NFT but only owns a copy from another chain. This platform maps the date, string and address of the NFT and itself indicates what is a copy and what is an original. The proposal in my opinion will definitely add value not only to Cardan but to all ecosystems as it will eliminate plagiarism, if implemented in NFT stores it would make it much easier for buyers in the NFT market. This proposal already implicitly has scalability in it as it maps to other chains. The project is designed in such a way that on the Cardano network this service will be implemented automatically and there will be no need for users on the Cardano network to pay for it; on the other hand, as far as the other networks are concerned, users on them will have to pay for this service, which represents a strong marketing move and added value for Cardano.

But unfortunately, it doesn't specify how many people and who specifically will be working on certain parts of the project, how much each person involved costs per hour, and how they arrived at the given amounts within the budget. I would ask the proposer if he would elaborate on this in the comments. As for the team, the proposal makes the work history of the members clear enough to look at on Linked-In and on Git.

It is commendable that the team is planning to integrate [1] Cardano's cheap mints and transaction costs as a selling point for potential migrations, [2]and  the likelihood of the Aegis image registry and notification service issued as free service for prominent Ethereum artists willing to migrate.
