I'm in agreement that start-ups need to be incentivized and incubated to onboard them onto Cardano-funded solutions. However, I'm not certain that the proposer effectively addresses the challenge. \n\nThe proposer explains that they received 60+ proposals yet only funded five proposals. It's not clear what the gap in quality between those that were funded and not funded is, but this is something that should be remedied by revamping the accelerator process. \n\nThe proposer goes on to explain that once Catalyst funds are used to incentivize developers, other monies from Dlabs can be used to further fund projects that the team vets and selects. Therefore the proposer currently has access to fund more developers. \nFinally, as important as it is to support start-ups, the proposer identifies a fundamental problem that they have experienced: \"The main risk is to not have enough good quality startups applying for the program.\"\n\nI'm not convinced that offering more funding or even more support solves this fundamental problem. If I could, I would encourage the proposer and team to come up with more innovative approaches to attracting the quality developers they would like instead of focusing on the known classes of developers. If that new and innovative approach is their partnership with SOSV then that should be emphasized and elaborated upon.

However, the proposer does not explicitly provide for these skills. \n\nAdditionally, the team only allots for one month to interview potential start-ups, and for activities to begin two to three weeks after selecting start-ups. It is my belief that this is not an adequate enough time period for the relevant skills of SOSV to be leveraged. SOSV would seemingly not have enough time to scout quality projects, coach them, and guide them. The accelerator program does not necessarily have to imply that it is on an accelerated timeline. \n\nThe dcSpark team has the technical know-how, but the team has not provided enough evidence to show that they also know how to  single out projects that can provide real utility and growth to the ecosystem. \n\nFor these reasons, I disagree that the budget and plan are feasible to deliver on the project goals.

Going further the proposer describes a measure based on the number of \"quality\" applicants; however, there is no description of how I am to objectively measure quality applicants. \n\nGiven that the team is looking to select the same number of start-ups with double the funding this time around, they could have used the previously funded start-ups (and measures used to audit their progress) as some sort of benchmark. Of course, this assumes that they continue to evaluate already funded projects in an objective way. If that is the case, the proposer should have leveraged that structure for the next round of start-ups, and committed to making such information accessible via public channel to the Cardano community.

There are also acceleration programs in Vietnam which I find very helpful to young entrepreneurs and start-ups. These programs equip Vietnamese start-ups with the basic skills and knowledge to carry out their new ideas and correct their business plans if there are deadly flaws that need to be addressed. Most of the start-ups chosen to be in these programs are doing well in the Vietnamese market.\nThe Team has a good idea to attract start-ups to migrate to Cardano Eco-system from Ethereum, it does not only bring start-up users to Cardano but also promotes Cardano as a platform that is active in encouraging, facilitating, and coaching start-ups to be better funded, better planned, and better executing their ideas and inspiration.

The Team has not stated how they would pay these costs. What kinds/standards of the venues that they are going to use? How are they going to compensate their mentors/speakers? This important information is not shown in their proposal.\nThe team has put good effort into preparing their proposal. with The live streaming of their Accelerator program is daring, yet effective to promote the Project and the Cardano Eco-system in return.\nThe proposed idea is not tech-related, hence the proposed Team of famous social figures is appropriate. In addition, I believe the Team would be able to attract a lot more attention once they have got funded by Cardano Catalyst Fund Program.\nI agree with the Team on their assessment of the biggest execution risk, which is the inability to attract quality start-ups to the program. I suppose they also look beyond the UK's borders to search for the best start-ups in the world to be admitted to their program. There is no reason for the Team to be bounded within the country's border.\nThe Team seems to be experienced in social media and business consultation.

The proposal have to also specify the difference between each batch to ensure that their goal is cleared. This happens since the project could repeativly be executed after receiving funds, with the same goals but what Catalyst want to sponsor for these pariticularly continous projects are their purpose after each fund. If there are positive, innovative and scalability proven for the batch, the project will be more capability of funding.

Transitioning from Ethereum to Cardano will be difficult for lots of developers, due to differences in code, infrastructure etc and having a dedicated company that has already proven itself on this blockchain to support you with the transition would be extremely valuable.\nThe main risk that the proposers identified is the fact that not enough good quality startups might apply to the program.

The main goal of this challenge is to facilitate the migration of Ethereum dapp to the Cardano ecosystem. The team has partnered with an early stage startup investor organization, to launch an accelerator program for Ethereum startups. This is because building in a new ecosystem can be hard and overwhelming and startups may need mentorship and guidance to be able to properly build on Cardano. That\u2019s why an accelerator program makes sense and should be very useful and add value to the Cardano ecosystem. The chosen startups will also receive great benefits ranging from funding to support from top Cardano developers. In fact each startup will get 20k usdc and 6+ weeks of technical support from the Dcspark team. I think that this is great but, it will only make sense if the projects that get chosen are high quality with awesome potential of growth. There are also other benefits for the startups that will join the accelerator program. They will be promoted through Milkomeda communication channels which is a great marketing opportunity.

There is a partnership with an organization that invests in early stage startups. Now I don\u2019t know what role they have on the program as it seems that the startups are funded from the budget. I suggest to the proposers to add details to the partnership and explain in detail how they will benefit the project. Other than that, the proposers have identified the number of team members that will be working on this project. The team has asked for 120000 usd which is broken down like this: each project will get 20000 usdc and 20k for 3 months of work. I think that it\u2019s pretty fair as people working on the project have to get compensated. The startups need seed funds to run their operations also. So the budget sounds reasonable and If additional funding is needed, they plan to return to catalyst to get the funds needed. I\u2019m an advocate of finding ways to self-sustain a business rather than relying on Catalyst everytime. The problem is that, since funding depends on the community vote, there is never a guarantee to get fundings. If all your business relies on that, the risk of losing it is pretty high.

Lastly there will be a demo presentation which is great for the startup because they will have the opportunity to showcase their product and attract potential users and investors. The team has also added metrics that they will use to measure the success of this proposal. The first metric is the number of applications to the accelerator program. This number should indicate clearly the demand level of the program. The community should be able to estimate the future of this concept based on the number of startups trying to join the program. There is also the number of good quality projects that join that program. If high quality projects are not willing to join the program, we can consider the project not successful.
