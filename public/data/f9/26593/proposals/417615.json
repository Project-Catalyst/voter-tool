Incentivising Ethereum artists to use Cardano is key.", "f6_no_assessments": 20, "f6_rating": 4.366666666666667, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 624, "q0": "One of the ways to migrate developers from Ethereum to Cardano is to migrate their customers. This is what the current proposal is aiming for. Instead of creating assets to facilitate the migration of developers directly, the goal of this proposal is to bring artists from Ethereum to Cardano. The problem stated by this proposal is very important: the cost of minting and everything else involved in Ethereum is prohibitive for many, and on top of that, all the environmental issues of Ethereum make it a very costly platform to mint and market NFTs. As stated, many artists even give up on minting their work because of the environmental impact, for example. And since artists are not usually tech people, information about other options don\u2019t naturally reach them. The goal of this proposal is to host events and workshops to create awareness about the qualities of Cardano to artists that are interested in minting their work but are currently using Ethereum or not minting at all due to the mentioned down sides. During these events, a comparison between Cardano and Ethereum would be made, and all the benefits of using Cardano would be presented, which would definitely be enough to convince NFT artists to use Cardano instead of Ethereum. This way, the demand for NFT marketplaces and platforms in Cardano would increase, and consequently the number of projects and developers that would tend to migrate from Ethereum as well. This is a very good way to indirectly meet the challenge\u2019s goals. The proposal added some KPIs that track the success of the proposal: number of workshops, attendees, artists from Ethereum and artists opening Cardano wallets. I believe this proposal is very well aligned with the challenge, the impact might be high depending on participating on these workshops, and the ways to measure the success based on the KPIs mentioned previously is good.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind this proposal has already delivered a workshop previously, as mentioned in the proposal, and the feedback they received was very good. Therefore, they know how to organize and execute such an event. The team has also provided their bios and verifiable links, such as their LinkedIn pages, and they seem to have the necessary background to make these events successful: in the team, they have very seasoned Cardano community members, experts in finance, technology and education, besides other areas. The team will still look for a workshop coordinator, so I believe the mentioned team will be supporting the initiative, but most of the work will be done by this individual who is yet to be found, which is not ideal, but they\u2019ve set the first step of their roadmap to look for the ideal person for the job. The budget of the proposal is good and based on the cost of the workshop that already took place, seems to be appropriate. Although, I believe there\u2019s a small imbalance in the costs related to the coordinator and the events themselves. The coordinator is more expensive than the workshops. I don\u2019t believe that the budget allocated to the coordinator should be lower, but maybe increasing the budget of the workshops to make them better could be a good cost/benefit for the project, without increasing its cost to much, proportionally. Also, the proposal misses some budget for marketing. They mention that they would partner up with some existing workshops, but it\u2019s important to also create marketing specifically related to what\u2019s going to be presented regarding Cardano, so not only people who would already attend to these workshops would see the presentation about Cardano, but also people who would like to go to these events specifically for that. The execution of this proposal is divided in 3 phases: 1st phase lasts for 4 weeks and will be dedicated to find the coordinator, 2nd phase lasts for 2 weeks and will be for planning the workshops, and 3rd phase is the execution of workshops. Since there\u2019s no budget for the planning, I believe it will be done voluntarily by the team members, as well as the work to find a coordinator. The timeline seems realistic and feasible. The only things missing is how long it would take to host the 12 workshops, but I assumed it would be 1 year, since the salary of the coordinator was budget for 1 year. The proposing team says that the risks of this project are very low, since they already delivered one session successfully, but I think that there\u2019s a risk of the coordinator disengaging from the project during this year. Unfortunately, this is something that has happened to some of the projects in Catalyst. Nevertheless, I believe that this proposal is highly feasible.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap presented in this proposal might give enough information for the community to keep track of the execution of this proposal. Since it is quite simple, the proposers could easily report, for example, when they find out a coordinator, share the plan for the workshops and later share evidence that these workshops took place. Even though this is not stated in the right entry in the proposal form, these can be easily tracked. The definition of success presented in the proposal is quite subjective, since they want to see the enthusiasm of artists who attend to these workshops. This is not easily measurable, and therefore I believe some goals for the KPIs presented previously, i.e., number of participants, Cardano wallets created, etc., should be used to measure the success of the proposal. Overall, the auditability of the proposal is good, but there\u2019s information lacking from the proposers on this regard, and this is why I\u2019m not giving a 5 rating for auditability here.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2110", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 8, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12750, "q0": "The NFT ecosystem of Etherium is by far bigger than the CNFT ecosystem. The problem is clearly stated and the main goal of the proposal is to poach NFT creators from Etherium with workshops and bring them to Cardano. The creation of these workshops shows Cardanos technical features and helps the creators to deploy their project on the Cardarno blockchain by teaching them how they do it . By this the proposal could bring many new projects to Cardano because the Etherium Blockchain has some technical problems/ shortcomings and creators search for an alternative. The team has provided some proof for the last statement in the proposal. This pushes Cardano with its better feature directly in their mind. Therefore this higher the chance of changing the blockchain. \nThus there is a strong match between the proposal and the challenge.

By creating a live event where artists can make connections, view Cardano NFT price and climate footprint superiority, and get hands-on \u201chow to create Cardano NFT\u201d, proposer will create a space for growth of blockchain and NFT community, this will eventually help The Great Migration. The proposal is able to scale by creating more events in different cities. There is not so much detailed plan for future self-sustainability. As a general idea, the proposal's claim that it will reach a select group of influential individuals who will disseminate it to others and increase its impact is accurate, but it is highly speculative to build project success on targeting small audience with assumption of them reaching larger audience and creating chain reaction.

What I rate as positive is that the argument is carried in the spirit of an invitation to Cardano with an emphasis on the positives and not as an attack on Ethereum. The proponent wants to focus mainly on individuals in terms of artists and their creations, which I believe will yield more satisfactory results than if they were to focus on quantum of artists. Of course, success depends on artists embracing the idea of creating content at Cardano and as for artists who are not yet doing NFT, they will have the opportunity to see and learn about the process, so there may be a benefit of new artists overall to the creation of NFT. This project, if successful, can be scaled up to a global level and does not have to be organised only in Europe.

At the same time, it is quite difficult to track the creation of new wallets on the blockchain and then matching them with specific people, this obstacle can be solved by either making a record of the workshop or writing down the newly created wallets somewhere to achieve transparency and better control.
