This solution is great for the challenge.\nSo Cardano will be extended to 2 more audiences: already know about cryptocurrencies and don't know about cryptocurrencies.\nI don't see any potential risk of stopping the project from growing because the new that grows out of the old will always be accepted by the people who love it.\nI am very excited about this project", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Reading the detailed plan sheet, I can easily imagine the implementation process of the proposal with clear and specific steps.\nTarget time 6 months with 1,000 decks released.\nBut with a detailed budget for support: $42,999, the value of creating Ada's Tarot deck as a gift is about $43.

It says the cards will have energy with a \u2018purpose to facilitate Ethereum\u2019s transaction\u2019 and also this \u2018Tarot deck will provide personal guidance\u2019. As can be seen from here science or technology are not used in the proposal at all. The Catalyst project does not need some energy but need realistic solutions and implementations.

They claim that specific energy will be put into the cards with the purpose to facilitate Ethereum\u2019s transition to the Cardano ecosystem, but then goes on to explain how the deck will facilitate migration by everyone using the deck for their own personal fulfillment.  \n\nI struggle to see how this tarot deck will be better than any other tarot deck for fulfilling the goals of challenge of onboarding users and developers from Ethereum to Cardano.  The only thing that makes this slightly fit the challenge is the plan to put energy into the cards with the purpose of facilitating the migration from Ethereum to Cardano, but the proposal doesn\u2019t make it clear what that actually means or why that energy is useful over other tarot decks without that energy.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer provides evidence that they have illustrated a tarot deck dedicated to Pamela \u201cPixie\u201d Smith in under 3 months so it seems likely they would be able to do it again but with a Cardano theme. \n\nThe proposal provides a 6 month roadmap that includes all steps of the process from illustrating  all 78 cards to sending the deck to print and distributing it to the Cardano community. Based on their claim of illustrating a tarot deck before in under 3 months, this seems like a reasonable timeframe.\n\nWhen it comes to the budget breakdown given by the proposal, I find myself a bit confused because they don\u2019t actually break it down all the way.  The first three items listed in the breakdown use up the entire budget and the four remaining items listed state their budget is \u201cincluded in the total.\u201d  This is a bit vague and makes me wonder where the money is gonna be cut from in the first three items on the list. \n\nRegardless of that, l still believe it is likely the proposer will fulfill their promises given their previous experience making tarot cards and their reasonable 6 month time frame.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer states they plan to livestream the making of each tarot card but don\u2019t explain where they plan to livestream.

This provides an easy way for anyone to check on the proposer\u2019s progress as they are illustrating the cards, which makes the first 3 months of the roadmap easily auditable.\n\nThe next steps would be migrating the physical sketches onto the computer for post production and then sending them to a printing specialist.

The Great Migration fund is about pulling new people from Ethereum to Cardano, and I just do not see where Tarot could bridge this gap. While I personally love Tarot and the history behind it, I just do not see where it will help our ecosystem to give away over 40,000$ worth of catalyst funding to give these away free. You seem very well intentioned, but this may be the wrong fund for you to request funds in.

The set you did for Pixie Smith shows that you have to knowledge base and artist skills to be able to deliver a good product. As far as auditability goes, I would like to see more social media engagement for you. Maybe a twitter or youtube account of you actually designing the Tarot cards and showing the world how it is coming along. I understand some of this has to be under wraps for revealing purposes down the line but showing your progress would really help out with being transparent as far as use of funds go. I see that you stated that this could be a very rare collectable, and that could be the case. However, I think it would really only appeal to Cardano maximalists and I do not think it will have much of an impact on people coming over to the chain. I simply think this is the wrong fund for your artistic talents. I would be willing to fund a proposal like this, but it needs to be under \"dapps, products, integration\" to be viable for funding. I think spending a little more time building out more metrics for success and writing about connections tarot could have to Cardano may help your proposal also.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Something like this seems hard to audit without regular updates of artwork, and if you want to keep the allure of the set you may not want to show your finished product. I think your \"auditability\" could use some more fleshing out in your proposal. For almost $50,000 I would expect a proposal that has quite a bit more research and work put into it. Your line \"Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.\" - I do not see where Tarot cards would help promote us as a chain. This is a really cool idea. I just don't think being funded through this part of catalyst is the right move. I hope you do not get discouraged! As you said, I think this could be a rare collectable one day... I just think you should try to get commissioned or sponsored through another project to get it off the ground.

I'm not sure if creating tarot cards solves any problem within the migration from Ethereum. If it does solve it, there is no need to create new tarot cards, but to purchase already made ones and build further activities based on them. I don't see a clear added value to the Cardano ecosystem by creating cards and sending them out to members of the Cardano community. They may have nice cards, but that has nothing to do with increased adoption, easing migration from Ethereum, or improving certain Cardano features. I don't even think it has anything to do with the challenges in question. Let's say that tarot can help Cardano team members in some way, is it necessary to create new cards based on that, or is it more efficient to subscribe to tarot services already with existing suppliers of those services?

At the same time, NFTs will be distributed, and it is not specified what kind of NFTs. As for the budget, how did the $500 figure for drawing one card come about? I find that a rather inadequate amount for drawing one card. The other items, like the deck design and the printing cost, seem adequate to me. The proposal implies that all the work will be done by the designer and by one person. It is clear from the description that the proposer is involved with and \"resonates\" with the Tarot issue. The description indicates that in addition to the cards being in physical form, there is an interest in making them as NFTs created on Cardano, which would theoretically increase their value. Overall, this proposal strikes me as admittedly thoughtful but in no way related to Cardano.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Success, according to the proponent, looks like that these cards are created and the KPI is that one card is created \"per time\". We create cards in order to create cards, in other words, it's self-serving. There is no community, ecosystem, or Ehtereum-Cardano relationship impact described in the proposal that can be measured. The proposal only contains a plan for how to create the cards, time periods that must be met and that can be monitored. Nowhere is it written where the results will be posted or if they will be public. It is not clear to whom the cards will be sent and based on what criteria.
