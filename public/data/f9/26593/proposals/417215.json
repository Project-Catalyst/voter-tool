Even though, it\u2019s not just a matter of syntax, but also programming paradigm since the functionality of Cardano is in many aspects different from how Ethereum works. Such dictionary should provide this kind of explanations as well, instead of simply matching the syntax of both programming languages. In relation to challenge alignment, this proposal very well fits The Great Migration (from Ethereum) Challenge, since this dictionary aims at facilitating the learning of Plutus for Ethereum developers. This proposal also has the capacity of scaling, but that depends on community engagement. It is mentioned in the proposal that there will be a group to manage and check the changes that are being done to the dictionaries, and it will be voluntary work, it seems.

Also on this topic, the budget is broken down in an understandable and good way. I believe that the amount allocated for each area is good and reasonable, and specially the marketing budget, which is something very important that most proposers forget about, since a good project without tracking doesn\u2019t have a really high impact. The roadmap is presented as milestones for each quarter until the proposal in finished. The planning seems reasonable, and I believe the team will be able to deliver it in time.

The definition of success is subjective, because the proposing team says that they will consider it successful if they see a real engagement with the community and usage of the dictionary. While that\u2019s a fair goal, it would be good to have a way to measure the success, like number of visualizations, download, contributions, etc. The proposing team could add some KPIs for these numbers to increase the auditability of the proposal as a whole.

Therefore, it cannot be evaluated if budget is reasonable. Making this product open source is nice idea to be able to solve further funding needs, also here some reward system could be beneficial. Technical aspects of this proposal are missing, web technologies etc. Risk of dictionary accuracy and adoption is noted in proposal, but there is no provided solution except for allocated funds for marketing.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Metrics for success are analytics of webpage that hosts dictionary which indirectly translates to projects that migrate from Ethereum to Cardano, as mentioned in proposal.

Providing details that support the project like the difficulty of terminology between chains is addressing the challenge at its core. Words and ideas drive the online world and this would be a massive push for adoption and clarity. Creating an open-source project also ushers in more adoption and collaboration, furthering the ecosystem, and that this will be fact-checked and driven with good intent. This proposal surely addresses the challenge with knowledge and understanding of the community involved.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The implementation of this proposal alongside the utility it provides to the community can be highly successful and very beneficial to the ecosystem if funded. Providing a clear, intelligent, and direct path to the goals they are ready to achieve is strong proof the proposers know they can take on this challenge. The combined experience of proposers exceeds the amount of funds they are requesting, and are credible, having immersed themselves within the community. Bringing forth a vetted service with up-to-date information that promotes adoption of the Cardano blockchain has so much potential to expand the community. With this given information it would be very likely this proposal will be successful.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposers have done a great job of laying out their overall mindset. With a roadmap for the next year they give good examples for metrics and ways to stay on top of growth and success. Utility and expansion of this project by the proposers and the community is sufficient to measure, and the traffic from GitHub gives clear insight to the level of adoption. With that the roadmap includes campaigns to push adoption even further using social media and press announcements.

The impact of this proposal on the Cardano community is given in three main points: 1) enrich Cardano\u2019s documentation resources, 2) a guide for those migrating from Ethereum and create connection between two communities, 3) a contributable, open-source that could constantly grow through people\u2019s contribution. All of these encourage users to migrate to Cardano by clearing possible hesitation due to technical differences between Cardano and Ethereum, possibly other chains as well in the future. The necessity for this dictionary is well-explained, drawing the difference in complexity levels between Cardano and Ethereum as well as the growing needs from developers to migrate to Cardano. Publishing this dictionary also removes confusion and the trouble many people have to go through while searching for Cardano technicalities little by little as they learn. Composing all the necessary information into one dictionary is useful and welcoming. As with any other dictionary, accuracy and changes through time is also a concern that Cardano dictionary should take notice of. The risks with accuracy and volume have already been tackled by the decentralized nature of this dictionary where everyone could view, comment and make amendments to the contents. Therefore, the main risk is fairly addressed. However, the proposer may also take the risk of the lack of contribution and mitigate it by creating incentives, motivation for contributors through little digital rewards, or create an enthusiastic community in building the foundation of this dictionary.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The timeline is clearly presented from Q2/2022 to Q1/2023 with clear milestones of what needs to be done and their progress status (done/doing/\u2026). The activities are easy to track and follow up until the marketing campaign and launching of the dictionary, reflecting the long-term feasibility of the project. A budget breakdown is given with a clear amount. However, I believe it is necessary for the proposer to elaborate further about the expenses incurred rather than generalize them under a big sector. For example, 500usd for branding can be broken down into what the branding will be comprised of and what activities the branding will involve and how much of 500 usd will go into them. Similarly, for marketing plans, it should be listed what strategies will be used (advertisements, billboards, Facebook ads, \u2026.). Budgets for the development and building parts are also encouraged to be disclosed more openly, such as how much money will be paid to developers/UI/UX designers per hour/ hardwares\u2026This helps improve feasibility so it is quite necessary that the budget breakdown could be more transparent and systematic. The profiles of the team members, on the other hand, are very clear and informative. The human resources working on this proposal are abundant with relevant experiences with the blockchain technology, NFTs, computing, UI/UX. Legal advisor is also included which is really appreciated. The credentials of the team members are a good indicator of the feasibility. Once the problem with budget breakdown is tackled, the feasibility of this proposal will be very positive.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The quantifiable key metrics of this proposal are the use and traffic which is displayed on Github so it is open to external audit and easy to track. More key metrics can be introduced for better and fairer assessment of the progress and quality of the project through more perspectives (reception, publicity, good reviews/inspiration/\u2026). However, for users\u2019 experience and the community\u2019s attitude, the proposer could also make a survey or questionnaire to gather feedback for clear auditability. The vision of success is the willingness of people to participate in growing this dictionary, aside from using it. This is reasonable and crucial for any given open source whether people of the community are eager to contribute their part for building more resources for their community. But as the objective of the dictionary also include helping people who migrate from Ethereum, a survey should also be carried out among the builders from Ehtereum and other chains to see whether the dictionary is helpful for them/how the dictionary is able to showcase the strong points of Cardano over other chains in terms of utilization and development.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_4055", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14918, "q0": "Marvelously, this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. A quick examination of international sources shows that developers and investors do not fully understand the opportunity presented by the crypto space, so I commend the proposer on the idea to develop a framework within the languages to help address this disparity. The development of such a framework in this context could have a significant impact depending on how comprehensive it is and through which avenues it unwraps the linguistics domain. I appreciate that the proposer has identified a specific semasiology to ground the proposal and the resulting legal framework. Doing so in this way helps developers and users better understand the expectations and also the limitations of the proposal. If the proposal is successful, and the proposer can get it to the proper tables and representatives, this project will likely have a significant impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has indicated, to some degree, sufficiently the necessary information to facilitate insight into Feasibility. There is a link from Tangent Press Announcement where anyone can get informed about the team also in the proposal we can find a link to a website that gives us a clear insight into the team and gives us confidence that the team has the skills and experience and that eventually this project will be realized. We can easily see that this is a well-coordinated team of people who show their work transparently. The budget is reasonable to achieve the set goals and it\u2019s distinctively broken down into identifiable items. The total hourly rate and hourly wage were missing but it\u2019s trivial. It would be good to see a little more detailed view of how the funds would be allocated. The team does not require additional funds, so a verifiable plan is not required. The proposal lists the development steps through which we can see a detailed implementable plan. Very professional approach and transparency. Without exaggeration in the proposal, we can fully find all the necessary parameters that clearly explain the technical aspect such as the terminology of Cardano ecosystems, and all the resources necessary to implement the proposal. And yes, the time frame for the completion and full implementation of the project is presented. In the proposal, there is no mention of risks and thus the possibility of risk and how to deal with them if they show up but I do believe with the team experience in this domain, that will be a cake.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In order for the project to receive funding, it is necessary to have a roadmap with milestones and KPIs and it is a pity that they are not listed in this proposal. As we do not have the parameters that can give us an insight into the realization of this idea, the community cannot monitor how the project is progressing. Too bad! But the idea is certainly great and will interest anyone who cares about his money. Another way to increase the score next time could be to consider outlining what work has been done to explore the willingness of governments or academic institutions to move in this direction and also provide a tangible scheme of further usage of time and money.
