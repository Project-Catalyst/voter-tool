As a strong advocate for mobile first development, I find this to be an extremely interesting proposition! I'm unfamiliar with the landscape of watch apps today, but this could be a powerful way to increase usage and adoption of wallets, and Cardano more generally. This speaks to an important element of the challenge brief - attract new users to the ecosystem - and thus this proposal adequately addresses the challenge. The team proposes to integrate an impressive number of features into their application. It raises questions of how they might incorporate these features in a user friendly way in the limited context of a watch, but the team explicitly addresses this risk in the proposal. In taking on such a difficult task, the team may offer future builders frameworks for approaching watch based wallet development, while showcasing what's possible building on top of blockfrost.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposed solution will be complex and challenging to execute, but the team appears to have the right mix of skills - product design, a range of development experience, and an enthusiasm for blockchain. \n\nTo provide greater credibility, I would've liked to see more links to github or other portfolios of work (especially for the developers).

The problem is that there is no Cardano watch wallet and open UI kit for developed mobile and watch wallets to help build applications on Blockfrost. This proposal wants to solve by providing easy access and track balance and token prices at any time anywhere.; provide staking and earning ADA with a couple of clicks. The tool that is being provided is called BlueSea which helps expand applications on Blockfrost. BlueSea will address Cardano portfolio, stake to earn; NFT gallery; decentralized exchange, etc.\nIn addressing the challenge, this proposal seeks to analyze and select useful and simple features for users; design an impressive user interface and make the user have the best experience on the watch, which are the main objectives of the challenge. It will also help to grow the Cardano ecosystem and support pools and projects in Cardano, and bring more benefits to users in the ecosystem.\nThe main risks mentioned are to do with policy, ADA coin going down and technology not yet supported. Mitigating measures were explained such as always update the latest SDKs and Dev tools to mitigate policy risk.\nWith all this said, this proposal has addressed the challenge very well. My rating is 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is a comprehensive plan presented in this proposal which shows a specific timeline and milestones to implement the project.\nThe roadmap is divided into 3 quarterly periods: Q3 2022, Q4 2022 and Q1 2023, which will be handled by scheduled teams. For instance, in Q3/2022, there will be the BlueSea App user experience analysis and others mentioned. \nThe budget requested is $12584, which is within the limits of the challenge budget. It has been broken down into detailed smaller budget for activities such as the cost of backend API development, cost of UI watch apps development, cost of QA/QC work, taking the hours of work into consideration.\nThe team comprises of 9 experts in different fields of information technology, blockchain, software development, etc. which skills are very relevant to this proposal. Links to LinkedIn to check profiles have been provided in the proposal.\nIt is mentioned in the proposal that the team will return to Catalyst for another funding to keep expanding the features for BlueSea wallet like a cold wallet. It is said in the proposal that the team is involved with other proposals in Fund9. I conclude that the experience of the team and the comprehensive plan and budget presented will lead to successful implementation of this proposal.

All that has been proposed within the software is already available in other dApps and platforms. A Cardano portfolio, staking your cryptocurrency, an NFT gallery and accessing a decentralized exchange, among others, is already available. Maybe not in the form of a software for smart watches but in my opinion the gain is marginal. The metrics used are very project-oriented instead of challenge-oriented. The team is only focusing in measuring if the project will be completed (for example they are tracking number of tasks considered done) and not if the project will have a positive impact. As a suggestion they could focus on number of contributions generated from the project and number of newly acquired developers, for instance.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer has provided a description of the experiences of each of the nine members of the team and also posted links to LinkedIn and related pages to support that information. In the budget section, even though it is stated which types of work will be required, it is not clear which members of the team will be responsible for each part. The amounts requested are reasonable given the overload of work estimated. However, it is not discussed how the team will deal if additional funding is necessary. The timeline of the proposal is well constructed and the tasks planned are realistic for each stage. The only doubt aroused in the timeline is if there is a typo and the last stage is supposed to happen in Q2/2023 or if it is correctly written and those tasks are supposed to happen in Q1/2023. If the latter is the case, then why did the proposer break this quarter into two separate sections? Finally, within the risks described the volatility of ADA price should not be one as the project catalyst adjusts the amount of ADA granted based on the price of the USD on the day the payment is made. Additionally, I would add possible litigation risks (which would require legal advice) and operational risks (turnover of developers or late deliveries).", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The roadmap provided is consistent but has the issue mentioned previously. I am not sure if they made a typo and the last stage is supposed to happen in Q2/2023 or if it is supposed to happen in Q1/2023 and they split this quarter for some unknown reason. If it is the former the time horizons seem realistic but if it is the latter there seems to be a lot of tasks to be done in Q1/2023. The KPIs could have been more precisely defined, as number of users of the product or grade of users' feedback, for example.

But, Not to mention the impact of the project without analyzing all aspects of your idea. I have read through this entire proposal and see a lot of inadequacies and inconsistencies in what the proponent wrote. After it was reported that your team violated community guidelines, one part copied almost the entire risk management section in another project: I can quote the part you copied from another proposal by the more senior members of the Catalyst funding community. This is the part you copy \u201c===== Risk management, solutions and awareness =====\nPolicy:\nApple and Google policies change affecting the deployment of apps to their stores causing time delays for app release to end-users. With many years of experience in developing mobile applications, we understand this, that's why we always update the frequently changing policies of those platforms. We will apply it to building the BlueSea application using the latest versions they provide. We always update the latest SDKs and Dev tools as well as the OS that they apply for product development and minimize errors during app deployment.\nADA Coin Down:\nWhen the crypto market goes down, it affects the price of ADA coin, causing the investment value in project development to decrease, which is inevitable in many projects on Catalyst. We will request a 10% portion of the total project budget for project risk management, and will immediately cash out staff salaries, and expenses for key parts of the project. This ensures that we are not affected much by the price of ADA coins. The rest of the ADA we spend on the project's ADA payments, for telnet or main-net or product listing.\nTechnology not yet supported:\nBecause we are pioneers in watch wallet development, we can get unpredicted risk in development, but our team has many experiments with the developer in mobile and web applications we can pass through this risk.\u201d\n\nAnd here is the full part of the project that you took from them: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/420202\n\u201c===== Risk management, solutions and awareness =====\nPolicy:\nApple and Google policies change affecting the deployment of apps to their stores causing time delays for app release to end-users. With many years of experience in developing mobile applications, we understand this, that's why we always update the frequently changing policies of those platforms. We will apply it to building the ADABET application using the latest versions they provide. We always update the latest SDKs and Dev tools as well as the OS that they apply for product development and minimize errors during app deployment.\n\nTechnology not yet supported:\nThe ADABET is designed with many technical pieces deeply involved in the Cardano blockchain technology, which is not easy for new entrants and can make their project look fuzzy. We built our own Cardano Nodes to delve into blockchain engineering and attended IOG Plutus, Marlow, and Haskell courses to keep up to date with the advancement of the Cardano platform. We have a team of 7 software engineers working with blockchain in ADABoys LAB. With the experience from 2 previous funds F7 and F8 we have worked a lot of hours with Cardano, which helps to accumulate a lot of experience. experience correctly identifying the techniques needed to develop this project.\n\nADA Coin Down:\n (As with many of the projects we are developing, concerns about the falling value of ADA) When the crypto market goes down, it affects the price of ADA coin, causing the investment value in project development to decrease, which is inevitable in many projects on Catalyst. With experience from previous Funded when we were funded. We always request a 10% portion of the total project budget for project risk management, and will immediately cash out staff salaries, and expenses for key parts of the project. This ensures that we are not affected much by the price of ADA coins. The rest of the ADA we spend on the project's ADA payments, for testnet or main-net or product listing.\n\nInternal team:\nMany projects cannot build their own development team, nor do they have long-term partners because the project does not guarantee large financial resources for outsourcing, which makes many projects on Catalyst develop slowly, it is potentially risky. We are well aware of that and from the moment the proposal was written, it was clearly planned. We build an in-house development team and are always ready for resources to participate in the development of new projects.\u201d\nYou only changed the words BlueSea, the name of your project, what you are doing is not encouraged in the Catalyst community, you are not aware of the importance of risk management in the project and the work you are doing. I don't agree with the way you guys participate in the Catalyst fund so dishonestly, please do it on the things that need improvement for your project.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "In this section, you do not give short-term and long-term plans, have no defined goals to do, and project members do not have much experience in working with Cardano blockchain technology. In my opinion, a project that deeply interacts with Cardano technology is very difficult such as programming smart contracts with Haskell, Plutus, and even swapping ADA assets, things without a year of experience with Cardano will be very difficult to do. In addition, the group did not offer any form of cooperation to support the implementation of the project.\nI also discovered that, in addition to the copy in the project's risk section, this proposer had completely copied many of the items in the Roadmap of the ADABET Betting MobileApp project (https://cardano.ideascale.com/ c/idea/420202) There are parts where they change the name ADABET to BlueSea and there are parts where they leave ADABET, even though the author and these two projects are completely unrelated.
