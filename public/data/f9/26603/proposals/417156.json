The proposal is aware of multiple risks and has well-thought out solutions to mitigate them.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Deliverables and milestone over a three months period are well detailed in the proposal.

The suggestion to create search engine optimized content is not terribly original, but if executed well, has the potential to drive the outcomes suggested in the proposal. The idea to piggyback on popular search queries for related but different products (eg Infura) is quite interesting. As someone that has done web dev and search engine marketing in the past, this indicates to me that the proposers have a strong understanding of the craft, and have likely already done keyword research to justify their approach. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team appears well equipped to execute this proposal given related experience in technical writing and entrepreneurship. The 3 month proposal seems to be paced reasonably.

These are key foundations for proper execution. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team provides clear milestones and KPIs they intend to track. As someone with experience managing delivery of projects and measuring ROI, I would've liked to see specific targets on what the team hopes to accomplish (going beyond just listing measurements).

The team has identified the problem of lack of visibility of Blackfrost by developers in general and has proposed an effective solution to it. They have articulated in a clear manner how their proposal will add value to the Cardano ecosystem; by disseminating the different uses and qualities of Blockfrost through articles and tutorials they will end up attracting new developers and developers from the crypto space that have not joined the Cardano environment yet. The metrics they are using, number of accesses to their content, number of articles produced per month and number of forks and downloads on GitHub align to the challenge as they translate a successful implementation.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has provided enough evidence of their experience. Links to their LinkedIn profiles were given in the proposal together with descriptions of past experiences and their history with Cardano. They have also been previously funded in former campaigns which is valuable experience. The number of required members to implement the idea is basically the two proposers and they have the skills needed to do it (digital marketing, Cardano-related experience and translation). The budget requested is reasonable, it is clear what the funds will be used for and it aligns with the goals they have set. Mainly the resources will be directed to research, strategy and content creation. The time horizons they have defined are realistic, in total it will take three months to complete the project and each month there are objectively measurable deliverables. Finally, the three main risks they have raised are relevant and the proposed mitigating solutions effective. Technical questions could delay the production of the articles, the performance of SEO could not reach what they were expecting and the blog might not be able to be implemented. Their solutions may result in additional spending or depending on the assistance of Blockfrost but they are valid workarounds.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap traced has clear milestones and achievable time horizons. The project has been divided into three phases each one with deliverables. Each phase lasts one month and at the end of month one, for example, there will be 2 articles produced, a persona characterized, and the platforms for which the content will be created delineated. The team has specified precise metrics, number of accesses to published content, articles produced, and number of forks, downloads and stars on GitHub. These are all objective, easy-to-measure KPIs that clearly indicate if the proposal has been successful or not. Additionally, the targeted problem, Blockfrost's lack of visibility, was precisely described throughout the proposal which shows a thorough understanding of the problem. The only point the proposal missed was providing, in a clear manner, a public channel to post regular updates on the progress of the plan.

The first is  creating  a library of search terms to use in articles about Blockfrost.

The proess of growing SEO through content creation is not a one to one activity. There are elements of this process that the team cannot control. The goal is admirable, however, and the process of creating good content that people consume does indeed have a strong correlation to increased SEO. But, in this case, the content numbers also seem a little low. Their goal is only a total of ten articles over the next three months. That seems a bit too few to really drive SEO numbers up by much.
