This is what is being addressed. \nThis proposal wants to provide a solution where users can be paid for creating meaningful content.\nThe proposer is saying that Blockfrost has the potential to create freedom on blockchain where one cannot be banned simply because people do not like the content. Users would need to be paid out for contributing after an amount of time, and receive an amount of positive votes. \nIn addressing the challenge, which is partly about APIs , this proposal will create this API tool  which will bring freedom to people; the system can be adopted for nay system that requires to verify any piece of data, thus making it more  decentralized. \nThe proposer mentioned a risk as how to sty plugged in may be an issue, but mitigating by following up on updates may help. \nWith this information, I believe this proposal has effectively addressed the challenge.

On the other hand, the budget is clearly stated and the total amount is reasonable overall (I'm assuming the cost of labor corresponds to only one developer as Kevin was the only one described as the people who would work on the project).

This is all too familiar and obvious across web2 platforms, as you say, some people can be banned from content creation and often the payments they receive are deducted, but this helps prevent Block nonsense and non-constructive content. As a youtube channel with content about children cannot pay them like other channels, the problem here is that it is pointless to collect children's information, not only that, but also illegal. Youtube is doing a great job on this and I hope you will have a concrete example of a solution for a similar situation. It would be interesting if proponents compare and contrast existing web2 platforms and determine how Cardano is uniquely suited to provide a better user experience. I advise proponents to share any successes they may have had related to building such platforms. I am still very supportive of this project as it has great potential because making money is always the top driving force behind creativity and development.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Thank you for providing detailed information about who is leading the project and their qualifications and experience.

This is not a bad project idea but I think it has to do quite a lot of tasks that the human resources of the team are quite meager, as you can see such monetization platforms always have a great attraction for people. management is very difficult. Another thing is that I see you haven't focused on advertising, which is indispensable for such platforms, I think you need more help to do all of this.

It's proposed to create using API keys and Policy ID's system to pay x token /coin to user for authentic work based on x, y and x adjustable factors, 'a system of verifying and rewarding users for positive engagement is essential for mass adoption of API key on Blockfrost'. \n\nThe proposal team consists of 2 members, one with 3 years IT and 3 years development experience whilst the other has 5 years building systems of aggregating information, 2 years paralegal, 2 years journalism 2 years West Point (army school) and 2 years UCLA (academic, as student?) \n\nThe proposers think that this tool, being created, can be adopted for use to verify any piece of data. \n\nThe risks as identified are \nKeep up to date with the plugin.

I am wondering, though it is not largely affecting my assessment, why their plan does not include testing.

Although the proposers do not clearly state how they would report this, I believe they should at least report their work against each deadline by which they complete each change of  Plugin as pointed out in their plan.
