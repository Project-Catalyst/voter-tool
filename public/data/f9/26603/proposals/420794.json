The proposer will create a community driven and easy to use Unreal plugin powered by Blockfrost. This will make it easier to integrate Cardano into Unreal applications and bring new developers to Blockfrost as well as Cardano. Providing this plugin to the Unreal and Blockfrost community aligns with the challenge in bringing more developers to blockfrost and Cardano. There are a couple of things that makes this product able to scale and address future challenges. It will be community driven as it will have developers from Blockfrost and Unreal using and improving it. It aims to be user friendly and there is a growing interest in both these technologies.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provides a high level view of what needs to be done and how it will be done. The Favro board mentions C++, but other than that he doesn't go into too much technical detail but he does however provide GitHub links to his personal repos as well as a repo he intends to collaborate with. According to the proposer this is a pretty straightforward project and looking at the links he provided it looks like he has the necessary skills to complete this project if he collaborates with CardanoSharp and their cross platform light wallet that is built specifically for Gaming. Looking at the Favro cards he has broken the project up into hours. I don't see a total number of hours anywhere, but that could be because I am not familiar with Favro. The project board is helpful, but it would have been great to see the hourly rate and total hours or any details on how he charges for specific tasks in the proposal on Ideascale. The budget seems very reasonable though. They won't require further funding unless more features are required like Milkomeda integration. The Favro board that is synced with GitHub provides a lot of detail on the different tasks that needs to be completed and when they will be completed. He also provided pictures explaining what is needed for this plugin and how the different parts are connected and work. Most of the parts are Blockfrost focused and there is a part where he will add a feature for secrets management for users that aren't familiar with working with API keys. This will make the onboarding process for new developers easier. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The Favro board he provided shows exactly what tasks are planned for specific dates. Each task has a certain amount of hours allocated to them, the hours are even broken down into subtasks. This shows some serious commitment and clarity on the workflow of the proposer. This Favro board is also available to the public to track the progress of this project. The success of this project is quite simple. Just being completed, uploaded on Unreal marketplace and on Blockfrost GitHub and used by both communities. The proposer said answering the communities' questions after all this is completed will mean the project is a success to him. Would have been great to mention engagements with the plugin and ways to measure that, but I think there will be a demand for this plugin at the moment and in the future, so a complete version of this is a success in itself.

The idea is to create an Unreal Engine plugin powered by Blockfrost, something that has not been successfully implemented yet. Such an integration would expand the possibilities of development in the Cardano ecosystem, increase the use of Blockfrost and attract more developers to the environment. These in turn strongly correlate with the challenge goals. On the other hand, I see two limitations of the project. First, the proposer has decided not to include the wallet functionality integration in the scope for some reason. I believe the whole integration would add way more value to Cardano than just two thirds of it. Second, there is no discussion on scalability in the proposal. It would be nice to see some thoughts on the robustness of the integration and behavior if future adoption sharply increases.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has provided enough evidence of his skills and experiences. He has added LinkedIn, GitHub, discord and twitter links and he has a lot of experience with Unreal which is the focus of the project. He also has experience with Blockfrost which is very helpful. The budget, on the other hand, is not that clear. There is not a lot of information on the link provided (I visited the page on the 4th of July) regarding budget and the screenshot on the proposal shows only the breakdown of hours per task. Because there is no total amount of hours required or cost per hour, I had to do the math myself. The tasks on the list sum to a total of 266 hours and with a total budget of USD 13,500 that means approximately USD 50.75 per hour. He mentions he is planning on working 10 hours a week on this project, so that would mean he would take around 6 months plus 2 and half weeks to complete the proposal. On the Favro page there are cards going until the beginning of May so it is more or less in line with these calculations. Considering that, the amount required is reasonable and the timetable realistic. Finally, the proposer has not considered a lot of risks but I would add to the list a few of them. For instance, the fact that he is the only developer of the project which makes him extremely hard to be replaced (in case he gets sick or prioritizes other activities). Also, there is the risk of bugs or technical difficulties delaying the deliveries expected.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap provided is very detailed and has clear milestones. Additionally, the time horizons appear to be consistent with the tasks outlined. However, the metrics defined are not well designed in terms of the challenge. It would be more desirable if the proposer had defined KPIs aligned with the campaign. For example, number of new developers in the Cardano ecosystem and number of contributions would be better than design finalized or project complete. On the other hand, the proposer did a good job making available and announcing his Favro board where users can closely watch the progress of the project and keep up to date with any news.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2513", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 2, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Hey there!

Nearing 100,000 users & growing fast.\", \"Created & Growing an active Developer Community\", and has \"Blockfrost API experience\". This I would normally add in the feasibility section but with deep experience and achievement I trust that the proposer has a good pulse not only on what the developers need but also what to build to get them onboard. Expanding on the unreal engine on Cardano makes games and upcoming Metaverse games relying on Unreal engine more feasible and potentially if a great game comes around that's really fun that could bring a lot of users on Cardano as long as the system is built on Cardano. The only thing that would be more effective is probably building similar proposal for Unity engine because it's simply more popular with more users. Nonetheless, it's a strong proposal that would impact Cardano gaming ecosystem positively.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility is very well put together. The proposer included timeline and since he is a developer who will complete this project himself it's fully in control. The lists clearly his credentials and many links to what is being done and what needs to be done task by task which not many other proposals do in a clear manner in a picture. He also has experience working with the Blockfrost API which makes this proposal a smooth sailing. I strongly believe this proposal can be successfully delivered if funded. The budget corresponds to the tasks and length and requirements to complete this project. It also helps that the proposer is a highly rated seller on the unreal enginer marketplace for unreal engine educational courses which makes me believe he has the capability to execute on at the very least Unreal Engine. One critical feedbak I can provide is that this needs to be open source because it's funded by the Treasury and it would be good to have a GitHub repository at that. One can wish and hope. The proposer however did include a proof of concept which means they have put a lot of thought into this already. I am confident this is a very good feasibility proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability of this proposal is indeed clear with the 5 step task and goals. The community, however, needs to have a way to be more proactively informed about the projects progress. A Favro board which is similar to a Miro board that many of the community is familiar with could be enough. However, it is not a project management tool like a Trello is. I would suggest the proposer to adopt those for a better actual tracking of completed tasks and progress of the project. It is better than most other proposals that don't have much of auditability in the first place. I wish to also have a bit more detail in the auditability sections in the proposal itself and not outside in Favro, but upon checking the tool and its content voters can clearly see that it's quite deeply developed and planned and clearly auditable.
