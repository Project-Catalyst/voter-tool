Personal DataWallets on Cardano are the basis of this solution..", "f6_no_assessments": 5, "f6_rating": 2.9333333333333336, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 9527, "q0": "For quantifiable impacts, innovative advancement of real-world application of blockchain and a clear articulation of logistical dApp processes, I rank this section a 4. There are a few rough edges of this proposal that could improve voter experience. For starters, the problem statement doesn\u2019t hold of lot of weight without context and articulation for urgency. When it starts with the information projecting that \u201c75% of trials will be patient-centric, decentralized clinical trials\u201d within 3 years, this makes me think there is less of a need for this platform. I think this information needs to be contextualized and cited to help voters understand what this statistic means. If I were to draft some possibilities, I would suggest this statistic shows trajectory based on clinical trials that are already patient-centric and decentralized because of a preexisting infrastructure/platform. The problem statement doesn\u2019t encourage the sense of urgency in a need for this platform, which can be accomplished by market research, analysis of the status quo, and the uniqueness that this platform brings to the table. Beyond this minor obscurity, this section of the proposal does provide magnitude to its impacts by quantifying the number of users targeted in the early stages of the platform, which is nice because we can calculate the $87k to breakdown to $6.96 per person (in the short-term targeted 12,500 users). Despite being a much larger than average amount of requested funds in Catalyst proposals, this seems like a worthwhile investment for Catalyst impact. It might seem much more worthwhile if there was a more clearly articulated link to the impact to the Cardano ecosystem in this section (instead of just in the auditibility section). ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "While this section is a little unorganized, I think there\u2019s enough substance here to show capability and a planned timeframe to achieve completion of this proposal, so I rank this section a 4. I let this proposal get away with only listing \u201cBioDao\u201d and \u201cAsobria LifeSciences\u201d instead of the specific team members and their professional experience, like most voters expect to see. The given website for BioDao and a quick google search on Asobria reveals a list of highly educated scientists, entrepreneurs, and tech specialists.  Where I do raise some concern is the roadmap planning only indicating actionable steps geared towards completion of the platform, without any preliminary steps on marketing, onboarding, and/or negotiating. Throughout this proposal I feel like I\u2019m missing a sense of partnership with the clinical scientists/doctors that will be utilizing this platform. As someone who works in the health insurance industry, I\u2019ve seen how difficult and time consuming it can be to get doctors/HMOs/health administrators to change their existing processes. There\u2019s a lot of complication with consistency in patient healthcare, back office solution agreements, and difficulties in the politics of people that are making money from the current system as it is. These are especially difficult obstacles for areas that are especially busy/overworked because they have 0 time to put in the effort to facilitate those kinds of transatitions. This could also be addressed with some disclosure of someone that has already expressed/comitted interest and identifying how much exposure those offices have. Then, the budget is not aligned with the total cost of the requested funds but there might be enough information here to deduce the breakdown. The given budget only lists $30,375 of expenses that are entirely allocated to external expenses like hardware, freelance auditing, and miscellaneous expenses (which I would also like to see further broken down to justify those costs). With $56,625 remaining and 825 hours of labor allocated over a 16 week period, I assume the rest is going to labor at a rate of $68/hr. This is not that wildly expensive or inefficient but I do wish I didn\u2019t have to do the work to try and make those guesses, and voters might not appreciate it either. In the end, I rank this section positively because I determine rather reasonable feasibility here. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "While this section does not contain all of the elements I (and voters) expect to see provided, I still lean positive because there is information throughout the proposal that leads me to rank this section a 4. The quantified impacts provided at the beginning of the proposal should be reiterated here to demonstrate the goals for an expected end result. If we cross reference the impacts section, we can see that the projected target of progress/performance is 12500 users (timeframe uncertain). This section of the proposal does not provide a public resource for community information feeds and accountability, nor does it include additional KPIs that would directly link to impacts of this proposal. There\u2019s room to list the number of clinical trials conducted, the number of offices onboarded, the amount of rewards distributed, and a wide variety of metrics that would demonstrate this proposal as a worthwhile endeavor. I rank it positively because there is the minimal expected substance to see an objective positive outcome.

The challenge is focused around DAOs and supporting their activity. It is possible this health system could assist DAOs but it seems to me this proposal would make more sense in an alternative challenge such as Product, Dapps, and Integrations. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The relevant experience portion of the proposal suggests a qualified team with experience on Cardano based projects. That being said in the details of people working on the project there isn't any individuals mentioned. Just 3.5 full time programmers/engineers. It would be great to see exactly who these individuals are, their experience, along with a URL to something like a linkedin.\n\nThe proposed portion of this proposal uses Healthnexxus as a refrence for what the product will be like. Unfortunately there isn't any explination of what Healthnexxus is or how this solution will be different beyond being \"Web3\".\n\nAt the end of the proposed solution the proposer describes that separate proposals will be needed for future steps of the project. This is concerining as it could impact the potential success of the proposal if these other proposals are not funded.\n\nThe detailed plan section states that a crypto wallet in the Cardano ecosystem that doesn't use SQL, has mobile functionality, and a crypto escrow function would be necessary. If a wallet is not around to support these 3 needs I am worried that this proposal will not be able to achieve the deliverables set out for it. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposed solution is lacking a bit of detail as to how exactly an end user would utilize this project. How will they update their health information into it? How will emergency and health services access this information in a safe and legal way? Answers to these questions would be very helpful to feel confident in this proposals set of detail. \n\nThe detailed plan section offers a bit more information on how the project will take shape but it also creates more questions. I am confused as to how test data will be moved on-chain without potential for privacy issues. I am also confused on the idea of a biosensor. How will this be built into the IHW wallet if it leans on an existing Cardano based wallet?", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2070", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 3, "ng": 10, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1476, "q0": "For your perusal is a project that requests funding for a Self Sovereign Health Wallet that plans to integrate with Atala Prism. Complete control of medical data by the individual is the end goal described by the proposal. An earlier iteration of this project written in C++ is attempting to be translated into Haskell for use on the Cardano Blockchain. Adoption by the current legacy system is suggested through BioDao, an entity involved with the C++ predecessor. Inukshuk alignment with the DAO challenge setting is misplaces as they are not seeking to create a DAO. Other strategic goals are met, such as DiD adoption, tool creation, etc. In the future I would suggest the proposer work with Catalyst assessors and advisors to help craft a proposal that correctly aligns with the challenge setting.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Project feasibility is difficult to assess as the development team has not been identified. There is mention of BioDao and Asobria LIfeSciences sharing resources, but none of the team is doxed, and none of their skills and level of experience are contained in the proposal. Budgetary concerns also exist as the request is for $87,000 but only $30,375 is allocated. Total time of 825 is listed, and the assumption is that is in hours of developer time, but it is not specified, nor is the rate of pay. Deliverables also fall into question as there is no track record for the proposers of prior Catalyst projects being funded or completed. A check of the BioDao website revealed a broken discord link an some other operational concerns.

A five element series of metrics combine with seven measurable performance indicators give a fairly thorough set of data in which completed actions can be verified.

According to the proposal, BioDao will work with the engineers and programmers of Asobria LifeSciences team, but they do not list the information and experience of each member. Although I visited the website: https://biodao.io/, I couldn't find any information relating to BioDao team or Asobria LifeSciences team. BioDao team should add it to the proposal.

The problem statement is not clear, making it difficult for the reader to identify the problem, thereby making it difficult to evaluate aspects of the project. How should the proponent explain the current state of the platform, or if there is not, what specific reasons such a platform is needed, etc. The proposal also offers a solution, however, with a unclear problem, it is difficult to judge whether this solution is appropriate or not. The proposal then mentions a relationship with the Cardano blockchain, but I don't see how that relationship currently exists and will look like, nor is there any word on how the proposal could help strengthen the value for Cardano. All that aside, health-related proposals have great potential to scale and solve other problems. Rating: 3 points.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal provided a timeline for project activities. But I wonder if the intervals for some activities are rather short. For example, when the IHW wallet is developed in just 1 month (4 weeks), is this time enough for the implementation team to perfect their product? Next comes the budget allocation, I see the proposal already calculates the hours worked, but the amount for the total hours worked is not available. It is recommended that this information be added. Regarding the project team, I don't see any information or evidence of their qualifications or knowledge, I suggest that the proposers add information about their education, or link to LinkedIn to provide information whether the people implementing this proposal can bring the project to success. Next, there is no specific plan if more funding is needed. Finally, the proposal outlines the main risk and ways to mitigate it.

I think that although the report will be made every Monday, KPIs or Milestones still need to be included in the proposal so that the community has a basis on which to evaluate the progress of the proposal.
