The proposal clearly shows the use case for this tool which would allow users to fractionalize NFT assets.\n\nThis may be more of a tool for investments and could possibly be applied to fractionalizing real property. The part of the challenge this does not address is how the tool will be used for widespread adoption of DAOs. \n\nFractionalizing assets can be done for any investment, and can be done with other legal structures, such as partnerships or corporations. \n\nCreating this tool also may increase centralization as it pools money to buy assets. That pooled money can drive asset prices up, thus making it more difficult for individuals to participate. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team has relevant, detailed experience working in this area.

In order to attract more people to DAOs on Cardano I believe that innovative tools such as this are necessary for the ecosystem.  This addresses the challenge as a potential way to solidify the innovation taking place in DAOs on Cardano.  \n\nAs a proposer I will admit that I have spent most of my three years in crypto as a Cardano student, after coming over from Ethereum.  So as far as my education reaches here, I am familiar with something like Consitution DAO, but I am not familiar how a project like that would ever fractionalize a Constitution.  I am saying this as I have nothing to compare this new concept to on a different blockchain that may have already experienced success or failure on something like this.  \n\nThis all being said, I strongly agree that this addresses our challenge of being prepared to prove why DAOs on Cardano operate at the highest capacity as other blockchains migrate over.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In terms of the experience, I see at the beginning of the proposal under \"relevant experience\" that it mentions just one person which looks to be Bob that will be working on the project.  Then when I look at the bottom of the proposal it appears that states who will be working on the project it appears that TCT from the ADAO community will be helping as well.  I am familiar with some of the work that ADAO has done in the community to make DAO tooling easier for everyone.  Additionally I do know some of the work that Bob has done working for the team at Rats Dao and also being an active ADAO community member.  This seems to check the experience box for me.  \n\nLastly I would add that in terms of a great plan, its good to see that ADAO has already contributed DAO tools such as Roundtable dApp, so I believe in the implementation of this project. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As a proposer I would state that the formula is complex and that the tools created to do this can be easily measured for security and durability once built.   There are two very clear metrics as stated in the proposal of how the success is measured.  How many DAOs use this feature, and how many other use cases would this provide.  One can only assume that this will be tested heavily before someone decides to fractionalize a high value NFT like a Berry, so I believe their is sufficient info to measure and audit the proposal.

The proposal makes no mention of Fracada by dcSpark, funded by Project Catalyst, which was built specifically for NFT fractionalization. https://medium.com/dcspark/fracada-a-protocol-for-fractionalizing-nfts-14b9017b3d91\nThis tool might have lack of functionality when it comes to intended gating or voting authorization for DAO members, but the proposers should at least have considered and mentioned this protocol in their proposal and maybe explore building on the existing code-base, for example to work with dcSpark to audit the on-chain programmability and behavior more efficiently. Apart from this note about possible duplicate effort, I fully agree that the ability to generate a derivative token asset to represent DAO treasury NFTs does add to the stack of tools that would enable Cardano to service DAOs with a competitive advantage, or close the gap to Ethereum tooling, as the Challenge Setting calls for. What this system provides that is very likely unique and poweful is the distribution mechanism for fair treatment of DAO members according to the proposer's formula (x = ((R / Su) \u00d7 n) / t - see inline) as described. Overall, a possibly elegant and novel solution that directly addresses DAO tooling, which very closely matches the Challenge brief and may constitute an impactful addition to the Cardano DAO stack.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The two main proposers have provided their background in sufficient detail and we are also assured that core contributors of the ADAO community will be working on the core smart contract programming, which is often a bottleneck for ambitious Cardano project requiring on-chain programmability.

The portfolio of contributions and previous work provided through the proposer's websites is also impressive and reassuring, and should ensure a good user experience, technical feasibility and relevance to the pain points of Cardano DAOs.\nFor my personal taste, the budget breakdown and timeline are quite tentative, providing wide ranges (like 10k-20k, 2-4 weeks etc) that I would have preferred to be either narrowed own, or discussed for their risk factors in the risk section. This is, however, mere \"nit-picking\" (or you can call it friendly advice) and should not affect the feasibility and likelihood of success, which are high, in any way.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The sole success goal and supporting quantitative measures are stated as the number of DAOs and non-DAOs that use the system to create derivative tokens of the treasury NFT. \nThe websites provided for ADAO and RatsDAO include links to Github, where this project can hopefully be tracked and audited sufficiently, and the team apparently uses social media like Twitter, Discord, Medium to  good effect, so it is ensured that the community will be able to follow the progress of the the proposal.\nI would have preferred to see more of the Impact section like mechanics and specification of the proposed system, shown on an external website, versus getting much more audit and roadmap detail within the proposal on IdeaScale for the sake of auditability, but this is only my personal preference.
