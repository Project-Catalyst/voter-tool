It is said that currently at Cardano there are no tools that allow people to create and manage DAOs in a simple and already forwarded way, so the objective of this proposal is precisely to build tools that help people not so experienced in our community, so that they can found their groups more easily, so that they have one and are initially boosted. With this, the proposal would be directly reaching the specific objectives of the challenge, present in its description: to create tools that provide superior resources offered in other networks, as well as effective management and collaboration platforms (to organize DAOs) and additional tools that still did not exist on our blockchain. Proponents explain well what these tools would be, both off-chain and \u201cbuilding tools that will allow people to manage the DAO Framework, Treasury and Voting. This would be considered an off-chain dao as this iteration will not use smart contracts. This will help reduce fees for DAO members using this approach\u201d; and on-chain: \u201c.NET libraries that can be consumed to perform the various functionality needed to create and manage a DAO + command line interface that will leverage .net tools. Users familiar with cli will be able to create and manage a DAO + a ready-to-use DAO community from the command line interface and provide quick feedback for continuous iteration.\u201d I think this proposal is very interesting because once all these tools are available, those who have a cause and people around it will not be dependent on technical knowledge to be able to organize their DAOs, I believe that with this initial help, so it can be said, more DAOs would be properly founded and maintained. This would greatly contribute to the engagement of our community members and could also be a differentiator to attract new active members. In my view, Cardano is a blockchain that offers many opportunities because of the catalyst project, and certainly people from all over the world are attracted to our community because of the financial support that is made available by IOG, but it is up to the community itself to becoming more self-sustaining and helping each other, in the sense that everyone can have the same opportunities to develop, and this proposal works exactly at this point when it provides a necessary technical apparatus for the foundation of new DAOs. Nothing guarantees that these newly formed groups will develop well and be successful in their goals, but certainly providing these tools is an important step to be taken initially.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The script is good, but not perfect. The biggest problem that I identify here is the absence of a well-established temporal notion, from what I understood each phase would last 1 month, so the total duration of this project would be 3 months (but it would be important for this information to be better confirmed) . Each phase could have its activities better explained, for example: how would the treasury be formed and what does the modification of the treasury mean? What would treasury expenditures be as a proposal process? That last part is still pretty abstract. Regarding the activities arranged in the second phase, these already have a better level of detail, so that we can better understand the processes that will be developed in this stage. For example, from community members' prior knowledge, we know that these would be \u201chow SharpDAO CLI tools are built and DAO decision-making processes\u201d; and as a developer contribution \u201chow to contribute to the SharpDAO project and how to build your own modules\u201d. So my opinion is that the script is satisfactory in general, as we have basic information about each of the phases, with some parts being more detailed than others, and ideally we would have the same level of detail as a whole. Regarding the costs, the asking value is quite high, at 56 thousand dollars (approximately), and it is explained in a way that is not so ideal. Basically, a value is assigned per hour of work (50 dollars) and some activities are listed and how long they would last, but in this way not all activities are well understood. Why does registering a DAO take 20 hours, and how would the proposal results be displayed, why would it take 40 hours? It would be important for us to know why each part had such amounts of delegated hours, and also that the activities were better divided (eg which would make up each phase - I believe we have this clarity only in relation to phase 1); and also that they were explained in more detail (not all, but some could be more explicit, in addition to the examples I cited, it could also be explained why creating a treasury would take 160 hours and also what CLI implementation would be, for example) . Finally, the team is not presented properly because the same information is passed to members (\"Fund3 CardanoSharp Contributor, Serialization and Transaction .NET build library.\") - except for James Dunseith. It would be necessary for us to have a better detail about each in the proposal itself, understanding what their areas of training, some projects that have already involved until today outside the project in question, how they are active members of our community and so on; in addition to their linkedin profiles, such information would also need to be provided in the scope of the proposal. That said, I believe we have a viable proposal, but some details, as I suggested, should be better explained, especially the way this team is presented to us.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal is very complex and multifaceted, that is, many activities are being developed in parallel, so that it is not an easy task to audit progress. Proponents suggest some metrics to measure partial successes, namely: \u201cGithub activity - we will be able to track various development metrics such as github commits and PRs + documentation - as we build the tools and cli we will document how to use each piece \u201d. However, in addition to the partial results, these achievements that would be periodically observed, it is necessary that we make a precise follow-up of the work routines that would be behind this, that would be responsible for such advances. With the establishment of the script and also with the amount of hours delegated for each activity (description in the part of the budget explanation), we have good material to carry out this follow-up. So the question here would be how such information would be collected and passed on to our community, my suggestion is that some member of the team be responsible for this follow-up and make direct contact with our community at least once a month, exposing such information. As it is a project that is very community-oriented, I believe that they will establish some active communication channel, even to make community members aware of the advances and tools that would be available according to the passage of the phases. So this channel (discord, for example) could also be used for posting monthly reports, for example, or short videos commenting on that month's progress and updates. Unfortunately, about success, past information is quite shallow: \u201ca community is able to collectively manage treasury funds and vote on what to do with those funds, I would consider this a success\u201d. Okay, but how can this be realized in practice? How could the Cardano community find out if the new DAOs are really finding it easier to establish themselves after this project, if both on-chain and off-chain tools are being made available and used as expected? It would be necessary for the proponents to carry out research, exposing examples of DAOs that were developed from the new technologies available or even from DAOs that pre-existed the project but which would have their activities improved through what was created here. I believe that the overall success can be proven through examples, testimonials from members of the DAOs, this should all be exposed to our community in a kind of final survey/general overview of the situation, which I believe is more suitable in the form of a meeting with the community, for example at some point after Town Hall. Therefore, I think that auditability was the part that most wanted to be desired in the proposal, needing some improvements to make it adequate.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 6, "q0": "Hard to not agree with proposer that currently the Cardano community has a lack of tools that help people create and manage DAOs.

Especially Gimbalabs, their founder James was recently featured in many videos on IOG channel and visited Consensus in Texas. I think this team will be able to build tooling and an interface for the Cardano community and will be able to provide both off-chain and on-chain tools.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The budget is reasonable and the breakdown of budget is detailed. The progress would be possible to track by Github Activity -(various development metrics like Commits and PRs) and Documentation. After the release, I agree with proposer that main metrics will be the number of DAOs Registered and the number of how many successful proposals are recorded on the chain", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2028", "no_vca": 30, "ne": 2, "ng": 17, "nfo": 11, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6105, "q0": "The author raised the issue that the Cardano community currently lacks tools to help people create and manage DAOs. Therefore, the authors of the proposal set out to solve the problem: CardanoSharp and Gimbalabs wanted to build tools and interfaces for the Cardano community. The goal is to provide both off-chain and on-chain tools. The proposal is suitable for the challenge posed and is described in detail. The author gives the idea of \u200b\u200bnot using smart contracts. This will help reduce fees for DAO members. Also, Leverage crypto, json-ld and decentralized storage to provide an off-chain solution. The project aims to provide: .NET libraries; the command line interface will make use of the .net engine; The DAO community is open to using a command line interface and providing quick feedback. In my opinion, the proposal is specific. However, the solution is lacking in detail. At the same time, the author also recognizes the risk that; \"Range creeps. We're starting small and are thinking about how to build.\" This is a key risk and also an important risk that deserves attention and needs an active solution. However, the solution to reduce the risk has not been presented here. In my opinion, the probability of successful implementation of the proposal is not high, the impact is not great.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Regarding the plan of the proposal, the author provides a roadmap for the project which is very good. We have the information we need to evaluate this section. The first is the roadmap, the proponent leads the goals to be achieved in three stages. In phase 1. The team will spend time on board development. In phase 2: PBL module development. And in phase 3: Exploring additional features of DAO Tooling. The author has presented each work in each stage very specifically and explained in detail. We know what work will be done to make the project successful. Next is the budget. The proposal requires a budget of $56,250. In my opinion, the required budget range is quite suitable for the work in the project. At the same time, the author has provided a budget bamngr broken down for each specific job. We know what and how the funding will be used, and are estimated at an hourly rate for each job on the project. Finally, about the core team members. We know the members are all people with the right skills and experience to do the work on the project. At the same time, the author also provides a text presentation about each member, and attaches a link to let us know more about the history and experience of the members that the proposal has presented. In general, the plan of the proposal is very good, the budget is transparent and the members are skilled and experienced, increasing the feasibility of the proposal. Proposal is highly feasible.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Proposed plan to execute, successfully the project, in a feasible manner.

The team of members has enough experience, and skills and expertise, increasing the sustainable strength for the project. The author provides us with metrics to measure projects on Github Activity; Document; Registered DAO; Successful proposal. Since we have a lot of information provided, in my opinion the information is satisfactory has been established, easily audited in a transparent manner. Regarding the final product which is to be expected, the success of the project is that the community can collectively manage treasury funds and voting.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2786", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6752, "q0": "The team behind this proposal acknowledges that there is currently a lack of tooling available for managing DAOs on Cardano. To solve this, they want to build both on-chain and off-chain tools to help people manage DAO structures, treasuries, and voting.  They explain that this would provide a basic infrastructure for building DAOs on Cardano which I believe would provide a lot of value to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nIn its most basic form the team plans to create tools for a multisig treasury controlled by the CardanoSharp wallet (and also a CLI), and they plan to create a CIP for off-chain DAO metadata which will allow for an off-chain voting system.  These two things are essentially all you would need to manage a basic DAO, and therefore directly align with the challenge goals.\n\nThe team also explains that they would be able to track the amount of DAOs created using their tooling, which is also a KPI that aligns with this challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "One of the teams behind this proposal, Gimbalabs, have been building on Cardano since the Mary Era.  They also have created courses to teach others about how Cardano works on their website. This proves to me they have a good amount of relevant experience that will come in handy when developing the tools laid out in this proposal.  The other team is CardanoSharp who actually built the CardanoSharp wallet on Cardano, which was funded in a previous Catalyst fund.  This is definitely relevant experience because they plan to add multisig features to the CardanoSharp wallet in this proposal. It shows they\u2019ve delivered on a previous catalyst proposal, which I believe increases the likelihood of them delivering on this proposal if funded.\n\nIn its most basic form the team plans to create tools for a multisig treasury using the CardanoSharp wallet (and also the CLI) and they plan to create a CIP for off-chain DAO metadata which will allow for an off-chain voting system.  These two things are essentially all you would need to manage a basic DAO.\n\nThe team lays out a detailed roadmap containing 3 phases.  They also provide concise descriptions of what they plan to build in each phase. For example, phase 1 is titled, \u201cInitial Development,\u201d and one of the bullet points under it is \u201cTreasury Spending as Proposal Process.\u201d  Then there are more bullet points under that one breaking it down into further detail.  This demonstrates to me that the team has put a good amount of time into defining each milestone of the roadmap, and therefore likely understand the steps that need to be taken to achieve each milestone.\n\nUnder the budget breakdown they provide estimates for how long they expect each step in the roadmap to take, and then multiply the total hours by $50 to get the amount of funds that they requested in this proposal.  It\u2019s good that they showed this calculation, because it shows there was clear reasoning behind the amount of money requested and leaves no question about why they requested the sum that they did.\n\nThe last thing I\u2019d like to point out is neither team involved in this proposal is currently working on any other proposal from this fund or previous funds.  This increases the likelihood of success for this proposal, because there is no other proposal that would take away the team's attention from this one. All things considered, it seems highly likely this proposal would be implemented successfully if funded.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team states that while developing the tools laid out in this proposal, all progress can be followed along and tracked on Github using metrics like number of commits.  They provide a Github link in relevant links for an organization with the name of SharpDao. I assume this is where they plan to be developing and also where the public can follow along to track any progress.  Considering the name of the proposal is also SharpDao, I think that\u2019s a safe assumption.  \n\nSome milestones to watch for are the creation of tools that would allow for treasury creation, modification, and spending as a proposal process.  These are the first three points in Phase 1 of the roadmap, and I believe are good measures of success, at least for Phase 1.\n\nAfter the tooling from this proposal is fully developed, the team plans to track how many DAOs register using their tools and how many successful proposals from those DAOs are recorded on-chain.  These KPIs make sense because they would show if their tooling is actually helping DAOs be created on Cardano. Also, since the data is on-chain, anyone can track it if they know what to look for.\n\nTo summarize, the KPIs provided are for when the tooling is finished, and the Github and milestones from the roadmap are for when the tooling is still in development.  Therefore, I believe that sufficient information has been provided to track the progress of this proposal at any stage in the development process.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2826", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 13372, "q0": "The content of the proposal was very well explained and the proposal was a perfect fit for the challenge.
