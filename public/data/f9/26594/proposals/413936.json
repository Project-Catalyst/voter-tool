The proposal intends to: 1) establish a DAO for the proposing organization; 2) document their journey in establishing and governing through a DAO; 3) help prospective clients and partners establish DAOs and governance models on Cardano; and 4) leverage software solutions created by other organizations (e.g., DAOs) in order to experiment with governance models. Unfortunately, the information given is not fluid, nor is it clearly relatable to the campaign objectives. \n\nI do think the team can achieve their goal of forming their own DAO, shaping a governance model for their DAO, and finding partners to do the same on Cardano. However, to better align with my understanding of the campaign objectives the proposal may have better served the campaign by putting more emphasis on: 1) adequately explaining why the incubator/accelerator model should be categorized within the solutions envisioned by this campaign brief; 2) adequately explaining the type of information and resources that they intend to document in their development toolkit,, and how that information will solve or satisfy specific campaign objectives around DAO-tooling infrastructure; and 2)  introducing the voting software that is vaguely referenced in their white paper, and explaining how this \u201cDAO governance-creation tool\u201d will be a part of the parcel solutions that will together satisfy campaign objectives. \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Based on my understanding of the goals the proposer has identified there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the proposer\u2019s executive and advisory team possess relevant academic and professional experiences needed to manage the successful implementation of the proposal. However, per the budget sheet, these executives and advisory board members do not have a clear role in steering the day-to-day of this particular project. Instead, most of the work seems to rely on in-house, entry level staff, and/or contracted software engineers. \n\nThe proposal does not offer any information on the qualifications of staff persons identified in the budget sheet, but only their profile pictures. Additionally, the budget sheet has several line items that would suggest that the team will need to collaborate with outside entities and pay them from their Catalyst funds in order to deliver \u201cCardano and Plutus\u201d blockchain code and applications. \n\nTherefore, it is not sufficiently evidenced that:: \n1) the proposer has appropriate (staff-level) human resources to fulfill the project deliverables; and\n2) the proposer knows in an identifiable manner who will be contracted to develop \u201cblockchain code\u201d, the type and number of Plutus engineers required to implement this proposal; nor an account for time needed to complete software development. It is my belief that these details are needed to properly inform the budget amount, and to ensure that Catalyst funds are used prudently. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Although the proposer indicates that they will provide monthly reports on their website (as required in order to release Catalyst funding tranches), the proposal unfortunately does not provide a roadmap with clear milestones that I consider to be important to include in all monthly reports. Instead, the proposer seems to leave room for the likelihood that the approaches they may need to course correct over the six month project period if the approaches they take don't allow for the results that the project desires. This gives little assurance that the proposer has a clear and fully vetted  design framework for the solutions. \n \nThe proposer provides solid and well thought out qualitative and quantitative metrics to measure utility for the proposal, and presents them in a fair and balanced way. The proposer also commits to creating a \u201ccommunity feedback\u201d portal for regular QAs that would be in addition to open-sourcing their project. Taken together, there is reason to expect that the community will be able to access the team and receive regular updates on performance and utilization. \n \nTo the best of my knowledge, the proposer\u2019s vision of success does not demonstrate an appropriate understanding of the solutions that the campaign brief wishes to empower. To my knowledge, the intent to support the creation of DAO tools is not to add new ways to increase transactions and increase payment to Catalyst treasury. In fact, the campaign brief clearly expresses the belief that DAOs and governance will advance the blockchain space beyond currency, DeFi and NFTs. The disconnect between the proposer's vision of success and the campaign brief's vision is of concern. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2358", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 1, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "I respectively disagree with your interpretation, as do others I am talking to, the information you suggest is missing in the \"Proposal\" are actually the elements to be delivered in the proposal period.\nI would also direct you to the initial slide read out in every Catalyst Town Hall, I believe it addresses most of your concerns."}, {"id": 2899, "q0": "DAOs are a new way of human collaboration and organization.
