It will result in producing a tool indirectly, through secondary effect. Connecting to physical communities in Amazon and measuring impact directly is something DAOs really need. What is missing is more detailed information about the tool, the issue itself is a complex one and more information about the components of the tool would be good, to better estimate the impact.\nThe risks and mitigation strategies should be better defined.

A more details of the idea would be needed to estimate its feasibility. It's understandable that a fine-grain design of the tool is the purpose of the proposal, but nevertheless it would be more convincing if certain details about the proposed solution would be given. For example: Have any local communities been contacted or a list prepared? What projects that the tool would be used for? What kind of functionalities are expected from the tool? (What use cases are envisioned?)", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The measurement of the project progress and its results is lacking. A pitch deck and a token are not enough of deliverables. What about the design and implementation of the tool? There are no mentions of reports, documentation, etc. Considering the budget for the proposal, maybe that's why they are missing? If so it would be best to somewhat increase funds in order to provide deliverables that would help in building tools for DAOs on Cardano, which is the main goal of this challenge.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2125", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2103, "q0": "According to the proponent, there should be a platform of initiatives that encourage projects for the community in Colombia. So this proposal wants to implement a social DAO for the Cardano community to vote on social and environmental projects, which will later be funded for their development. I believe this proposal is a smart fit for the goals of the challenge. One problem, however, is that even though the solution description fits the challenge, it makes sense in terms of the idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal, the absence of a blueprint greatly affects the testability of the proposal. So even though the idea is good and can be successfully implemented, we cannot know how it will be implemented. The proponent should be more explicit about how the project will bring value to the Cardano ecosystem and how it is sustainable or how it can grow in the future, once funded and after the funding is spent. In addition, the challenges and risks that may be encountered during the implementation of the project are very poorly described, the main risk here is that the author is not a developer and he thinks he can get support from people in the community who can solve this problem. What if in the course of the project he does not find support? I think it is more convincing if you have a qualified team to work on the project before proposing it, unfortunately, there is no certainty in this proposal.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The project plan is not convincing what is presented: \"In Q2 2022 join the Milkomeda hackathon\nCreate a Cardano token at Cardano-native-token.com and add liquidity\nMarketing project to create community discord, telegram, and other networks based on the initiative\"\nPerhaps there is confusion about the author's timing, as it is currently Q3 2022, it can be seen that the author plans to list some of the work he plans to do. We don't know exactly when these activities will take place, how long each activity will last, or how and who will do it? Next is the budget, the proposed request is quite modest: $3000 and explained to be used for the creation of advertising and marketing tokens. Although the required budget is low, we also need to be explained exactly how this money will be allocated to the activities. We couldn't figure out what the author's advertising strategy was, how long it took, and how much it cost. And finally, about the team, recommendation writer Sergio Gonzalez is an active member of the almagua foundation and also provides his LinkedIn profile. As mentioned since the author is not a developer he is looking for people with Haskell skills with a particular focus on DAO architecture and implementation.

This looks more like the author's intention than how people can track the progress of the project. Actually, without a concrete roadmap, we cannot visualize the process of the project, so my suggestion is that this roadmap is elaborated in detail, then the proponent and future team will give an overview of how activities are going each month, not only of the partial results obtained but also of how they work hours, whether everything is going according to plan or not?
