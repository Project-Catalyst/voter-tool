The objective of this proposal is to promote the governance of your DA group, in turn, to promote the partnership between different projects, DeFi, projects and etc, as the NFT project and etc. This aligns very harmoniously with the objectives of the challenge, as it would benefit management and collaboration between community actions and a hub through governance features. An idea can be well defined by excerpts \u201cThe CNFT Alliance for the project of a DAO CNFT Alliance built to allow governance over a CN FT Alliance, which will partner with many different NFT projects, DeFi, games and other projects. This solution will create a Community DAO2 for the governance of the working phase of the CNFT Alliance, most important of the Alliance building for NFT projects, which is important for the construction of projects and NFT From Build Purpose in Games and NFT.\u201d In other words, the idea is, necessarily, that everything is challenging, as we necessarily seek the development of thematic groups that come together around a common environment, promoting the expansion and strengthening of the Cardano ecosystem. The problems that I indicate in relation to the project, however, are some. by the following preposition: the proponent states that he would, in this DAO, \u201cprovide a method of growing the Cardano Ecosystem for projects and users\u201d. What method would that be, how could this be visualized in practice? He also states that he would build a solid foundation with \u201ca strong business model and sustainability that would ensure the successful development of this [project]\u201d. What development model would this be, how would it be sustainable and guarantee the success achieved? I believe it lacked a bit of detail regarding the actions he intends to take. We know its goals and which paths it will take, but not how these concepts would be seen in practice. In order to have the intention, of course, that their impact would be important, that it would be important, as they would be planned as work routines, that they would be planned as such, (even if they would think) that they would be part of the proposal. it would be necessary for the proponent to detail very perfectly what would be done and how it would be done so that the specific objectives of the challenge Projects carried out, for example, mentioned in the project scope: \u201cSimilar tools that offer complementary tools still offered to the projects proposed in other non-community collaboration management initiatives example for additional partners a proposal and existing management projects for non-community collaboration example example organizer a different additional challenge + Tools for potential organizations to use in the evaluation of the resources available in Cardano DAO\u201d. That said, he told me, in the arguments cited, that a proposal has great potential, but it lacks the techniques and practices to better understand the whole, as theories and based on reality, etc. it's ok, because although I think that this proposal is totally compatible with the challenge, the absence of difficulties greatly compromising the project's impact.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Yes, the proposal is viable, but some improvements could be made. Speaking of the script, the proponents could have been more specific. The development process is divided into quarters, and the activities relevant to each are not well explained, as we can see in the following excerpt: \u201c4th quarter of 2022: Finish Token Distribution + Finish DAO platform and UI and 1st and 2nd quarters 2023: Continue to develop DAO UI/UX + Have the first projects voted on and funded through the launchpad platform.\u201d An example of this is Q3 2022, activities would be: \u201cImplement CNFT Alliance Tokenomics, Initiate Public Token Sale and Initiate Development of DAO Governance Functionalities/Agreements\u201d. How would the tokens be implemented, and how would their public sale be developed? In what ways would governance features and contracts be produced and established? We know what would happen, but not how, similarly to what is said in the first analysis topic, in impact. It would be positive if there were a greater degree of detail for each single action. Also, within that 3-month interval, we don't know when one thing would end to give way to the next one, or if it would happen in parallel, for example. That said, a little more time specificity would also be welcome. When we turn our attention to the $35,000 funding, important explanations are also missing. Each part is superficially divided, and there is no explanation as to why each would cost what it asks (\"Concept Art: $1,000 + Web Page Development: $4,500 + Encoding: $21,000 (210 @ $100/h) + Marketing: $5,500 + Legal: $3,000\u201d). Not that the values \u200b\u200bare exaggerated and incompatible with the market, but not well argued. Why would the concept art cost 1000 dollars, how long would the designer work on it? How would the marketing campaign be carried out, would it be through the communication channels already well established in the community and events such as the Townhalls, or in other ways? More explanations would be important here, so that we have confidence that the requested amount is indeed necessary and would be put to good use. Regarding the team, this part is very good, a lot of information is given about the participants involved. We know their names, we are told a little about what they have done before in their careers, we know whether or not they have some kind of relationship with Cardano, their linkedin profiles\u2026 In short, we have a very satisfactory level of detail, which allows we have the necessary knowledge to trust the preparation of this team for this project. Undoubtedly, if the other topics had as much detail as this one, the grade for the topic would be maximum, because here we have a lot of information and details. Finally, the feasibility is good, with only a few points to be worked on.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Proponents provide some numerical data (numbers of CNFT Alliance DAO participants + CNFT Alliance Governance Token holders + funded projects and number of completed projects) that would serve as ways for us to monitor this process. In addition, it would be important for us to understand what is behind such partial results. How would the DAO be being developed, how would the meetings be taking place, how many people would be participating in them, how often would they be happening... achievements, how exactly methods and support would be playing an important role here. That said, I think what's suggested is great, but not enough. It would be positive to have a broader view of the development process, with quantitative and qualitative insights. And all this should be within easy reach of the Cardano community, whether through written reports, online monitoring on any content sharing platform (whether it's a social network or interfaces like Miro, Notion, etc.). As a measure of ultimate success, it can be well defined from the existence of \u201ca sustainable DAO, with a governance token that is valued and, ultimately, a launch pad capable of funding projects in which the community votes\u201d . However, I still think that this scenario is quite broad and abstract. How could this be proved in practice? It would be important to know, in detail, how such a scenario would be palpable on the part of the Cardano community. In this sense, it is necessary for proponents to carry out research, gather verifiable data and present to our community what the daily life of this DAO is like, how its governance token relates to other parts of the Cardano community, in which way we can prove that this alliance was important for the growth of the projects involved and so on. It is also essential that such a successful scenario is exposed in a direct, verifiable and simple way to the Cardano community, so that we can all see in practice how this project would have corresponded to what is sought in the challenge and how our ecosystem would be being fostered. through the structuring of new DAOs/orientation of those that already exist. In general, the auditability is satisfactory, but this information that I commented would complete it even more, making it more consistent and more comprehensive, in the way (in my view) it should be.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 7, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 5, "q0": "I agree with proposers that there isn't a DAO or launchpad that covers a sector of the ecosystem in Cardano.

How will the CNFT alliance be governed? it will be difficult to imagine how this project develops and what benefits it brings to the participants.

The impact of this proposal depends on the full development of the CNFT Alliance. The only challenge the proponent mentioned was \"budget\". This is the only challenge and also a big one. The proposal will only work when it is funded and the risk is sizable. I hope that the group's proposal will be implemented.

Regarding the roadmap, the proponent provided information on the project implementation progress from the third quarter of 2022 to the second quarter of 2023. This is quite a long time. The proponent provided a quarterly work plan, but in my opinion, it should be broken down into monthly. There should be a detailed plan, set milestones, along with a timetable in parallel with the work to be done in the project. The detailed roadmap facilitates the monitoring of progress, ensuring the success of the project.\nIn terms of budget, the proposal needs $35,000. We know how the value of the grant will be used. However, the budget can be broken down and explained in more detail to increase the reliability and sustainability of the project. Example marketing cost $ 5,500: how will you use the marketing strategy, and how long will it take? Who will do this work, the more detailed it is, the easier it will be for us to audit whether this budget amount is appropriate or not.\nThe strength of the project is having a team of qualified and experienced members suitable to perform the tasks in the project. At the same time, the team provides introductory texts about each member, their role in this project, and attached links so that we can learn more about each member, and what has been covered.

I think what is suggested is good, but not enough. It would be nice to have a broader view of the development process with quantitative and qualitative insights. At the same time, in my opinion, the proponent needs to collect verifiable data and present to the community how the development of this Dao is, and how its governance token is related to other parts related to the Cardano community, which in turn will demonstrate the importance of this alliance for the development of related projects. The success of the project is the successful and seamless implementation of the CNFT Alliance token. Overall, from what the proponent has provided, it should be easy to check.
