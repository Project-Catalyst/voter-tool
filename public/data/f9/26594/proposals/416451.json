The proposer will need to explain the revenue model clearer as obviously the grant itself is not purposefully to channel back to DAO and it makes the whole DAO structure become more like a shell for projects (accelerators) even though DAO should not aim to be an accelerator but more like decentralized in power and autonomous in its own form.
