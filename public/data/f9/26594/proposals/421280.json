The team completed a Fund7 proposal to build out the PoC for this, and in the course of that research they identified that to balance scaling and voter fatigue DAOs needed tools to support delegated subgroups and their decision-making capabilities.\n\nThe PoC for this looks fantastic, and it is meant to fit into the space between analysis for governance token-holders and actual task completion and incentivization (so between tools like Tally and Dework).  This often-overlooked governance layer is where the scaling protocols for DAOs live, so the impact is readily measured not only for the DAO ecosystem that might adopt this, but for Catalyst and even Cardano, where DAO characteristics are going to continue to become more and more apparent (Charles' recent whiteboard described the process by which subgroups are forming below the foundation entity level, which is the very process being described here and in side treasuries in the community).\n\nBecause the tools here are desperately needed for the Voltaire era to deliver on its promise, the impact of this proposal is a full 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "With the proof of concept in hand, the roadmap for this project is solidly rooted in work done and problems to solve.  They already have first DAO to onboard to the protocol as it goes live (the 15k+ singularityNET community), which is a critical factor to help with success.\n\nTheir vision for how the dashboard integrates during this rollout was presented with clarity, separating out the initial deliverables as data that then drives the integration of the rest of the dashboard buildout.  This challenging component of emergent design has been handled well, IMO.  Likewise, the timeline is very granular early, where the monthly milestones are packed with activity, while the last 3 months of the timeline are more sparse, with space to absorb any pivots from the data, and to thoroughly test the implementation in real conditions.\n\nThe budget over that time period is broken down by high-level concepts such as R&D and UI/UX, but each concept is also shared as a component of the monthly budget, which helps with the auditability alignment.\n\nBecause the project created a thorough roadmap with clear milestones, and has adopted data-driven decision methodologies here and over the past two funds as well, I believe there is a strong Feasibility basis for this proposal,  5 Stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "While the dashboard itself will be capturing useful metrics and KPIs for the proposal, they helpfully included some early KPIs to measure progress before the dashboard is fully integrated, basically participation metrics (and the onboarding of another DAO in the community).\n\nIn the area of team availability and transparency, there is a unique angle included here in auditability, which I would describe under the principle of \"User centered UI/UX\"...  basically they will be leaning into the DAO here to help define the experience of the dashboard for themselves.  If this methodology can be well documented and duplicated, this will be an enormous deliverable for the community as well, since this type of human-based governance is the beating heart of decentralization (the irony that this is coming from a dedicated AI space is not lost on me).\n\nBecause the team is hyper engaged with the communities they are serving, as well as having previous experience with funding through Catalyst (up to date on all proposals and Complete on another), and because the metrics they have laid out are achievable and measurable, I believe this project will be accountable to the community and able to track its progress effectively,  5 Stars for auditability.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1799, "q0": "This project aims to develop a delegation dashboard to track governance activities within a DAO that are delegated to individuals or workgroups.\nIn the presence of a large amount of work delegated to intentionally anonymous or credentialless groups, monitoring the quality of this work is difficult on a large scale.\nThe proposed dashboard is a tool to facilitate this supervision within a DAO, and therefore corresponds perfectly to the objectives of the \"DAOs <3 Cardano\" challenge.\nThe tool will be developed on the basis of GOV3, formerly \"DAO Job\", which is a proof of concept from the Catalyst Fund7.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal does not lack evidence regarding the ability of the authors to carry out the project.

UX/UI 3kUSD/months * 2 months) but it would require clarification, in particular on the number of development hours planned and the hourly rate.\nThe risk analysis is precise, and mitigation measures are detailed. For example, a possible change in governance process from fungible tokens to role-based NFTs.
