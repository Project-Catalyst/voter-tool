The proposal suggests several different ways that they can promote education throughout this industry. My only concern would be gaining a following.

However the problem statement described by the proposer is contradicting in some areas.

The team also provides additional milestones to be expected and some realistic timelines (with monthly targets). Some implementation plans mentioned include regrouping and staffing, collab outreach etc. However, i don't see much emphasis in the proposal about providing mainstream Cardano Education (I suppose the learning curve will be biased and focus more on providing Cardano blockchain knowledge), how decentralized the platform will be and what region it will cover first as an experiment. Team should consider to provide a product as an experiment to cover a small area at first and build on the success/failure of the experimented project as some of the approach to execution does not seem to be realizable although the idea is unique.

There should have been ample time to develop a givernencaand incentivization plan during the last funding window, but there is no specific plan laid out here. The team is surely capable of achieving the goal that they have in mind, but it is unclear to the assessor what that goal is.
