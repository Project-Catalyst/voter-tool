I find the issues raised to be well-suited to the challenge. This proposal, if successful, is needed to scale up.\n\n   - Besides, the group has also proposed solutions to solve the problems mentioned above. will make the DAO platform available with open source code, the latest techniques adopted by the participating community, Cardano DAO's will set the web3 standard. I found the solutions above to be suitable for solving the problems in the Challenge.\n\n   - The team has also pointed out the risks that the project may face such as Dependence on external software, and Community participation may be lower than expected. however, the proposed topic has also outlined options to limit those risks in a very reasonable way as stated in the proposal.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "  -  In the section provide a detailed plan, including progress and milestones. I see the proposed topic has identified a timeline that is to start planning in Q3 2022 independent of Catalyst funding. and will complete the plan in a period of 12 months. The success of the project is divided into 3 phases as mentioned above. I find the above timeline to be reasonable to complete the set tasks. goals were also very clearly defined like, after 3 months Launched Collaborative Plaform, after 6 months completed Collaborative Knowledge Library. and after 12 months the Community can regularly participate in the Collaboration Platform.\n\n   - With a section that provides detailed budget analysis. with a total budget of $60,000 and has been divided into many different amounts. I find such splits to be reasonable. However, the group should have a backup plan in case of budget shortage, it will be more proactive.\n\n  - About providing details about the people who will work on the project. I see the group has listed 11 members. There were specific tasks assigned to each member. Through the review, I found the experience and capacity of the members to be quite good. However, the identity of the group members is not easy for the community to verify.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "   -   About the description of what you will measure to track your project progress. Here I see the group has come up with a lot of indicators. I would like to summarize a few important indicators that are. more than 15 hours of paid contributions, more than 50 hours of paid contributions, number of reports generated during workgroup calls, and Community designed Campaigns -> paid contributions in 15 hours. I find the indicators outlined to be very clear. However, it is not easy to measure and test these indicators.\n\n    - What does the Success section of this project look like? There have been many successes outlined in this section of which short-term successes will be the evaluation of completed research, initial natural language support, and reports submitted for public review. . The long-term successes will be the implementation of the active establishment of groups and the active submission of the highest quality proposals to the Cardano voters. I find the successes mentioned above to be very relevant to the challenge. and the proposal is waiting for funding to be put into trial run.\n\n    - In the funding section. This is a continuation of the project in FUND 7. However, the project has not been funded. I hope that the proposal will be successful in this FUND.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2856", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 15035, "q0": "This proposal is about creating a collaborative platform for DAO activity. aims to provide open source knowledge, community insights, new techniques,... related to DAO's Cardano. so that Cardano DAO's members have easy access to sources of knowledge and thus be more involved in meaningful decision-making by the community. apparently this proposal is aimed at developing our Cardano DAOs. So this proposal is suitable for the challenge", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponent said that the proposed implementation plan begins in the third quarter of 2022. it will not depend on catalyst funding. This is a positive thing. they also listed deliverables and initiatives and had targets to be achieved in 4, 6, and 12 months. however here I have no information this project is not really clear, how long it will do. If possible I ask the proponent to provide a more specific plan. For example, what work will you do in the first month? there will be periodic reports to report to the IOG as well as to the community. then the 2nd, 3rd, 4th month, ... and finally the closing date to close the project is ever. Closing a project here can be understood as without the direct work of the proponent, but the community can still maintain itself in the spirit of DAO. Next is the team budget asking for $60000 for 750 hours of work which equates to $80 an hour. As mentioned above, the job contents that have not been clearly explained are just the job contents corresponding to the number of hours. However, with the above information, I do not have enough information to evaluate whether the number of working hours for each work item is really appropriate or not. so I suggest the proponent should provide more clear explanations. finally the implementation team they have 8 key members and 3 advisors. Most of them have complete information and links to prove it, but there are also some members who don't provide links for reference. I suggest they provide enough links of all team members for full feasibility. From the above information, although the plan and budget have been provided, it is not really clear, so I neither agree nor oppose the feasibility of this proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proponent provided information to track progress and define the success of the proposal. However, this information I think is not really complete. I recommend the proponent to provide more specific quantitative information for each period for example in the first 1 month there will be 5 contributors with the amount of contribution is paid on 15 hours,... next in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th month what achievements will it achieve. and most importantly, where will these indicators be checked by the community, I don't have information yet. it could be \"on the 24th of every month we will publish reports on performance, uncompleted actions, solutions to report to IOG and to the community on the web. society of the proposal or report on Townhall,.... with the information provided I have no objection but since it is not really clear, I also disagree about the auditability of this proposal.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2323", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 15037, "q0": "The proposal wants to enable many different colaborators and cardano community members to coordinate and solve problems of any kind as far as I understood the proposal. The idea is to create a world class data program designed for continuous collaboration.\nThe proposal is in the right category and I'd say it's aligned with the challenge settings and would bring value to the ecosystem if implemented. Therefore there will be a positive impact over the community.\nThere are some risks considered but after reading the proposal I was left with a lot of questions which I'll mention in the feasibility section.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has all the necessary credentials and I was able to verify their skills with the provided links so they do bring credibility to the project. I'm not sure how will the problem of massive ammounts of people colaborating would be resolved practically, because all mentioned tasks and topics were abstract about creating an interactive platform, but there's no specifics like design or how will it be different than a regular issue tracking system, which I could argue is the regular way of massive groups of people colaborating. As a developer I can't agree with the statement that face to face is the \"regular\" way of doing collaboration.\nThe budget breakdown is good and I do like the segregation of tasks by hours. I don't agree with all tasks having the same hourly rate which is quite high for any kind of labor. 80$ per hour for accounting and 80$ per hour for community sessions, really doesn't seem regular to me compared to many other proposals and the provided salary guides.\nEven so I do believe the project is relatively feasible, with those few mentioned caveats.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The kpis and metrics seem relevant and could be used to measure the success of the project and used for future optimization of the process. The problem statement is a bit vague and the solution needs a bit more details as well, but it's overall a good proposal needing some polish.\nThere's a good roadmap although stretched a bit IMHO.\nAuditability shouldn't be an issue with the mentioned sites, feedback should be given easily.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2463", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 15111, "q0": "Undoubtedly, the proposal is very well aligned with the challenge. It's about creating a platform that connects different groups; Currently our community is very diverse and complex, so it is very difficult to manage and coordinate the activities and projects being carried out through traditional means. It is necessary that a site be specifically targeted to form such bridges, and as mentioned here, several products will be targeted, such as those referring to \u201cknowledge related to open source DAO are made available\u201d, for example. The project also seeks to refine techniques, host testimonies, reports, and various files in a common library that will be a source of consultation for all members of the community. The idea is complex, but it is certainly within what we are looking for in the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Although the script is not organized in the way I think is ideal (monthly, with each activity well detailed), we are still richly informed about what would happen, when and how. We know what is expected for specific times, such as 4, 6 and 12 months. We also know about a number of activities that would be done including the total amount of hours to be devoted to each (\u201c60 hours Proof of Concept for Natural Language using Concept Net SDK + 60 hours Collaborative Session Design\u201d, etc). So I think this part of the project is quite satisfactory. The budget is explained based on the hourly rate of work for each obligation to be performed; that way we can have a very clear view of how the requested money would be used. Finally, speaking of the team: the members are properly introduced, it is very positive as they are people well involved in Cardano, providing an interesting amount of information about their CVs.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Many KPIs are reported, for example the \u201cnumbers of contributors with >15 hours of paid contribution and the number of composite service models created by key contributors [roles]\u201d and so on. In my view, proponents are more concerned with the fruits than with the process, it would be important for us to monitor the activities mentioned in the budget explanation. It is necessary for the team to make summaries for each \u201cX\u201d period of time and make them available to our community. As with the auditability of progress, the auditability of success is good, we know a lot of data about what would be considered a success in both the short and long term. The only question that needed to be clarified would be how this would all be made public and reachable for the Cardano community.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 15200, "q0": "From my point of view the proposer didn't present well what is the problem that is to be solved and it seems that he is aiming to create a platform to facilitate the collaboration for development for different kind of community members. A DAO system has the following particularities: a token to measure the voting power of the members, smart contracts for the voting process, and the governing code publicly disclosed.\n\nReading the proposal I can't find any reference about what I stated above, so I think that this proposal doesn't align well with the Challenge settings. It seems that the platform is more like a place for communicating among different members of the community. The Challenge brief states: \"What tools can we provide to enable effective DAO's Creation & Operation?\" The output of this proposal should be more close to what a DAO system is and how to operate it, than to a community HUB.\n\nThe impact to the Cardano ecosystem of this project is difficult to assess, as it seems that the project is somehow tangential with the DAO operations. The proposal doesn't have a plan for the project's future sustainability (this proposal is stage 1 from 3).\n\nI rate this section with 2 stars", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The roadmap of this project is set to start in Q3 (independent of this proposal funding), but is unclear when precisely, and will last for about 12 months.

The proposer should make a clear statement about how many people are working for this proposal, thus having a better view for the funds that are to be spent.\n\nThe solutions to the challenges and risks (2 of them) are presented in a vague manner (what are \u00a3additional communities\"? are they related to Cardano?)\n\nI rate this section with 3 stars.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The roadmap does not have clear milestones (Engagement with Cardano Communities - what is to be done and what is the output of this engagement?) and a clear time horizon for achievement (4 months to complete this part of the entire project - but when are the intermediary specific time periods? weekly, monthly)\n\nThere is a list of KPIs/metrics that are to measure the success of this proposal but some of them are difficult to understand (what is a composite service template? how many are expected to be created in a month by a contributor and overall?)\n\nThe proposer should set a publicly available channel for the community to measure the progress of this proposal (Discord, Twitter ec.)\n\nI rate this section with 2 stars.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2336", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 15289, "q0": "The proposal is a to crack the problem of community engagement within the challenge of Bringing DAOs into DAO <3 Cardano.

Yet, the team seems already well-thought about the Catalyst project support as per thinking until Fund 10 and Fund 11.  What could be even better is the monthly or weekly breakdown for Fund 9 (as the team already stated that the first phase will be in 16 weeks.)
