The videos produced can be a tool or platform for Cardano community and crypto community to get their knowledge of DAOs in English and Spanish. Their target audience is for native Spanish and English speakers which is quite a huge part of the world speaks those two languages.

The team have mentioned creating a website for these educational contents.

One more metric is their engagement and willingness to listen to what people want in their discord server and share it to the community by updating to the community via AMAs or in the Town Halls.

The proposers plan to achieve this by creating an educational web platform where the participants can access audiovisual educational content along with a discord server for support. Or as described in the proposal: Laying down important infrastructure for the future. \n\u2028The proposal is not about creating a new DAO, operating an existing one or governance. In my understanding, the value lie within creating a solid foundation for users who are not yet experienced with the knowledge, structure or common practices of participating in Decentralized Autonomous organizations. Even though the proposal doesn\u2019t address the challenge literally, I would (judging from my experience as a recurring PA since Fund6) say that this proposal addresses all of it, with the possibility of both improving the user experience and development for everyone. \nAs a teacher and researcher I am slightly biased toward educating people maximize efficiency, experience and performance; but it also means I have ample experience of situations where this has proven to be true. \u2028In short, the proposal addresses a clearly formulated need within the ecosystem, and the proposed solution is directly addressing it effectively. The goal to create a base of educational content (10 hours of material with added resources) will be intense at first, but will after that manage itself leaving the project open to add further content, or focus more on supporting and building the user base (or spread the resources). Scalability won\u2019t be an issue if it is focused on after the intended content for this proposal is finished first. The content can also be updated with little effort (especially with input from the community), in order to ensure the relevancy of the material. \u2028\u2028I would have liked to see more mentions on how this proposal aims to give value to DAOs on the Cardano blockchain specifically, but I understand that this is (as of now, at least) meant to address a broader scope. Within the challenge brief, it has the potential to affect the number of communities engaged into using (Cardano?) DAOs, and might be incentivized by choosing Cardano (due to the lowered on-boarding threshold created by the extra educational content). Overall, I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "We are provided with a roadmap that includes milestones on an estimated timeline (great to include estimated deadline dates), divided in 4 different stages. The timeline goes on until the end of November, which seems realistic based on the estimated workload, and since the project is already on good way. \nI really like that we already can follow the development on the first phase, since the Syllabus is already provided in the proposal (in the process of getting feedback from the community and then finalizing it). As an educator I couldn\u2019t be more happy to see examples of any educational material, it gives insight into the plan and the understanding of the team, but also the level of the material. The 5 planned modules provided is structured and has a nice progression of topics relevant to understanding DAOs. I know the proposal is at an early stage, but I would love to see some graphs included, even if it just examples (Gotta love those Venn-diagrams!). I especially appreciate the topic under module no.4: \u2019Culture and Community\u2019 since it is a huuuuuuuuge part of the overall operation and structure. Compared to legacy organizational structures, how many would include company culture? \n\nThe budget breakdown included in the proposal is clearly presented with an estimate of hourly wage, and the estimated time for each responsibility area (much appreciated). \nConsidering that almost half of the total budget (8k/20k) is allocated to Discord support, it lends me to believe that the team has great understanding of the value of communication when operating this kind of project. \nWhat I would have liked to see included in the budget is a clarification on how many people will be working on each responsibility area (in order to estimate the workload for each team member). Will there be only one web designer during the development process? Will the team need to hire additional members, or will it be done by the three people listed? \u2028There is certainly a great level of experience and knowledge present within the team, and this knowledge can be validated through visiting the numerous DAO-projects linked in the proposal (mClubDAO, Boske Web3, RatsDAO, etc). A suggestion would also be to further include links to the expertise of the individual team members (LinkedIn?), in order to further validate the competency of the proposers. \n\nAccording to the proposer, this is meant as a one off educational program, but the proposer leaves the door open to further expand on the project (and also returning to apply for funding through Catalyst) should the community and ecosystem demand it. They also addresses the risk of the continuation of the project should the team disband or disappear, but intends to leave all the course material open for anyone to take over if it would come to it. Due to the reasons listed above, I agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As stated under \u2019feasibility\u2019, the roadmap leaves not much room for additional questions regarding the progress of development. As a means to measure the success after implementing the proposal, the proposer aims to share feedback surveys related to each module (in order to assess the quality of the educational material), and track participation/engagement by tracking number of people enrolled and community activity. In order to increase the transparency of the project, I would like to have seen an estimation of (for example) number of people that the proposer hopes to enroll (target numbers). That will let the community track how closely the idea correlates to reality, and how the team acts upon that information. Furthermore, there are no links or mention to where the team will communicate with its community, although I am assuming this will happen on their Discord server or social media platform. It would be highly beneficial if the proposal would include where the interaction with the community would happen, especially since such a large portion of the budget is dedicated to interacting with the community. As a whole, the listed KPIs seems fitting to measure the success of the project, even though additional details could be added (as explained above).
