Since it is historical, it has enormous potential in capturing a market segment that for many years was excluded from the benefits of a healthy and exploited financial system. The team behind this proposal, wants to carry out a project called - JUS - which is planned to be a person to person marketplace that will allow the exchange of crypto / fiat currency in its first version, and in a second version is proposed to incorporate the possibility of lending - borrowing. By utilizing Cardano and Atala PRISM as alternatives, a proposed solution aims to target the \"mobile money market\", which, according to a market report by the GSMA is worth US$1.35 billion. Without a doubt, if the implementation of this solution is successful, it has a great potential not only from the point of view of users in the Sub Saharan Africa area, but it can be a precedent of success that would not only be useful not only for that area, but for many developing areas worldwide, and of course for Cardano as the skeleton of the solution. Now, a problem that I find in the proposal is that this is 1 of 3 proposals raised by this team, that although there is no problem with this, when analyzing the core of the proposal the only argument that is presented is that for DAOs to have a massive adoption it is necessary that there is a massive adoption of DIDs. However, when contrasting the deliverables, actions and impact metrics presented in the proposal, I do not find a clear alignment with this challenge. Since what is proposed is to use ATALA to link the biometric data of users with a DID that allows them to use the platform. The challenge setting in this case seeks the proliferation of tools that help the creation, maintenance and improvement of DAOs in Cardano. Now, considering the possibilities of impact of this project as a medium term vision and not only this proposal, and in addition to the amount requested in this challenge I have decided to assign a score of 4", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Overall, and after verifying the online presence of the team members, I can confirm that there is enough evidence to provide confidence to the community, as they are household names within the community. Not only from a technical standpoint, but also from experience in the Sub Saharan Africa region, which is particularly important for this type of project. When it comes to the budget, I find it confusing, since they presented the same budget structure in three different challenges. Ideally, It  would have presented a budget that is limited to how this proposal is being proposed, explaining both what the overall vision is, as well as the items within the budget that, in the opinion of the team, justify the budget request in this category. Three potential risks are identified, all of which I consider appropriate, but mitigation countermeasures are not included, particularly for the issue involving the ATALA PRISM release delay, which is integral to the proposed solution.  ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding the clear description of the problem and the solution, the team does a great job, explaining the problem, the target audience, and the flow that would add value to the end users. This results in greater clarity and therefore increases the auditability of the proposal. There is no doubt that the roadmap is clear and concise in the sense that it presents the work packages for the MVP at a high level, however, following the argument made in the previous section, it was necessary to indicate the expected milestones of this proposal and, as a recommendation (although not strictly necessary), to explain the relationship between these deliverables and those in the other three proposals. As far as the general metrics of the MVP presented are concerned, they seem straightforward and easy to measure, however, understanding that they are based on the concept of \"active users,\" it would have been interesting to understand what this actually means for the team. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2142", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5125, "q0": "The proposal tries to create JUS, a decentralized marketplace and mobile wallets where users can swaps crypto and facilitate stable coin lending/borrowing.

The proposal outlines potential risks but did not provide a mitigation plan to overcome those.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The milestones and timelines the proposal provides are clear and sensible. The proposal gives budget information for each milestone. However, it will be better if proposers also provide the cost per hour of development, so the community can assess if the requested budget is reasonable or not.

The platform will utilize the 'Atala Prism' DID solutions to authenticate the new users of the platform. The argument of the proposer for why this proposal is submitted under DAOs is that the platform he is building will push Atala Prism DIDs use and thus provide the ground for DAOs creation. As for any DAOs, verification of the identity of the 'participants in Governance' is required; this proposed solution will help. Hence this proposal is aligned with this Challenge in that respect. Moreover, the platform to be constructed under this proposal will be governed by a DAO.\n\nThe proposer is eyeing the remittance market in Subsaharan Africa. Suppose the platform can solve the inherent problems in the field. In that case, it will provide value, provide the banking facilities to the unbanked, and onboard the untouched chunk of the population to the Cardano Ecosystem.\n\nI agree with the proposer that more usage of the Atala Prism DIDs will smoothen the way for more DAO creations. However, the participants run the DAOs, who are required to stay honest and thus need to be verified.\n\nThe proposer did mention the three risks he may face in the execution of the proposal: lack of funding, marketing & Atala Prism release delay. But I feel the main risk the proposer will face from the regulatory bodies as the platform involves fiat/crypto swaps and fiat lending. Unfortunately, the proposer did not provide his ideas on how he will tackle the regulatory hurdles. Because of this, I rated it four stars. \n\nThe proposer is initially looking to provide solutions to the remittance market.

Hence the team is capable of implementing the proposal.\n\nThe proposer provided step-by-step details on how the platform will work after the launch and how he will utilize the Atala Prism, a third-party biometric authentication service, stablecoin, and mobile money services in Africa. This approach reflects the proposer is clear about how the platform will operate on swaps.\n\nBut the proposer did not mention how he would provide the non-collateralized lending. Moreover, the provided technical details of the platform's plan are limited; only brief details are listed under the plan and timeline. \n\nThe proposer needs $500k to build the Minimum Viable Product. Since he does not need all the money, he submitted the same proposal under three Challenges and asked for $350k in total. In this proposal, the proposer requested $50k; in DApps Challenge, he asked for $250k; in Grow Africa Challenge, he asked for $50k. This makes sense from the point he does not need all the money here, and he does not want to take a big chunk of the Challenge allocated amount. But I was expecting more details on how this $50k will be used in the proposal. It seems more appropriate to mention specific information or at least provide the points on which stages of the development will be prioritized and allocated the total $350k.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer mentioned that to track the proposal's progress; he will post the development updates and keep the interested parties engaged on Social Media. However, the proposer did not mention on which platform he will post the updates like GitHub or Jira. \n\n As mentioned above, the proposer did not provide more details on the technical development; only brief details are stated. This omission will hamper the auditors or interested people from tracking the progress. \n\nRegarding the budget, as I mentioned above, more specific details are required being the proposer is not asking for the total required amount of $500k in this fund 9. Instead, he asked for a fund of $350k in total, $50k here, and the remaining $300k in two other challenges. \n\nThe timeline and milestones are stated in detail. The total duration mentioned is 50 weeks, divided into five stages based on the tasks to be achieved in each stage. \n\nThe success metrics as per the Challenge applied here can be 'amount of ADA coming from DAO transaction fees' and 'number of DAOs that use Cardano as a governance chain.' As this platform will be governed by a DAO that can be considered at least one DAO using Cardano for governance, the proposer did not reflect on the fees.
