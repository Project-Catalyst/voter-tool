From the regulatory perspective as well, it is very important to have a well defined structure for deccetralized governance to avoid the token or coin associated with the project being dubbed as a security by the regulators. But the rise of DAOs has also given the rise to the manipulation of such projects especially where the voting power is proportional to the number of Tokens you hold. We have seen such scenarios where large holders of the project\u2019s token have tried to pass the governance proposals which would benefit them, recently episode with Celsius network being one such example.\n\nThis proposal is trying to create an Open Source Plug-n-Play Quadratic Pural Voting DOA tooling which any DAO on Cardano can use and benefit from. The plug-n-play system will have 3 aspects viz Reputation, Identity & Technical Systems Design. Using this DAO tooling technique coupled with Quadratic Plural Voting logic, the DAOs will be able to use the verifiable credentials to build an organization-specific Proof of Reputation.\n\nThis will create new ways of Governance and we can use these tools to create different types of DAOs suiting to the specific needs of different projects, corporate and even Governments. This experiment with the decentralized decision making, if successful, can open new doors for the adoption of Cardano and can bring institutional interest to the ecosystem. In addition to this, DeFI projects can design their own governance structures around this concept to have a more robust decision making system through DAOs which is inclusive and is manipulation resistant by big players.\n\nThis perfectly aligns with the objectives of the challenge and will help immensely in adoption of Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The detailed roadmap of the proposal is provided by the team which is to be completed by Q1 2023.
