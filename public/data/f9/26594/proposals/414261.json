Here, the goal is to create an incubator that helps new DAOs develop, in a nutshell. This would be done through various aids, such as teaching on \u201cDistributed Team Recognition, Token Design, Marketing, and more\u201d. By providing useful knowledge and tools, the proponents aim to guide these new DAOs to success. What I found positive here is that it is not only said what would be done, but how. We know exactly what kind of actions this mentoring, we might call it, would be provided. For example, services would be done regarding NFT minting, using the incubator's CNFT generation bot to randomize the art in layers, CNFTs would be uploaded to Cardano blockchain, teaching how to take care of CNFTs from any website, and much more . The proponents, in addition, define what instructions would be given according to the week, for example: \u201cWeek 1: Vision and Mission Workshop / Week 2: Community Building / Week 3: Ideation and market problem\u201d. In other words, we have lots and lots of information relevant to what would be done in practice. A characteristic that I notice in some proposals is that, sometimes, the ideas are very good and make a lot of sense with the scope of the challenge, but it is not clear how such concepts, such theories would become reality from a work routine. And that doesn't happen here, as I mentioned earlier, we have a lot of detail regarding how this incubator would help new DAOs to develop and achieve their goals. With this, the specific objectives of the challenge would be fully contemplated, as the authors well cite, some of them being present in the challenge summary: \u201cbuild and develop \u201csimilar tools that offer superior features to those offered in other effective collaboration management chains / platforms to organize community intentions and actions / additional tools not yet in place to give Cardano a distinct edge / tools for potential organizations to use in evaluating the resources available in Cardano DAO. Some of them would be, for example, increasing the number of communities involved using Cardano's technologies; increase the number of ADA and transaction fees running on DAOs; increase the number of DAOs that use Cardano as a governance and management chair\u201d and so on. Therefore, in my view, this proposal will bring many benefits to Cardano, after all, founding a DAO is not something simple, and we have several experienced people here (as I will comment further on the topic of feasibility), who have already had projects financed before, helping these novice people. This is the crux of the matter for Cardano to become a prominent blockchain and have its potential properly harnessed.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the script, I think the explanations given are almost perfect. I say this because we know a lot of information about how the project development process would take place in practice, for example, we know the objectives of a certain range of months (example: from month 3 to 5 the objectives would be to Launch Clarity Community NFT for allow community members to vote on who wins the pitch competition / Start biweekly DAO pitch competitions, allowing incubator participants and external participants to present / etc). My suggestion would be for proponents to divide the timeline into months, rather than into phases corresponding to each month. I think that because we have a lot of information being given, and in a way we don't know when each one would develop, for example. From month 2 to 5 we have a very interesting level of detail, because we know what the goals would be per week (from week 1 to 8). This is very rich for us to understand what would happen and when, so in my opinion it would be interesting for such detailing to be done every month. However, the way the information is presented, it is possible to have a good understanding of the process. When it comes to financing, the asking amount is high (50 thousand dollars), and it is divided into 3 large parts. In my view, it would be interesting for each of these parts to be better broken down. For example: $20 would be \u201cEqually distributed to incubation participants to promote their progress. We plan to limit the incubator to 10. The Clarity Community will strategically award each incubator participant approximately $2,000. The spending plan for each of these grants will be public to the community.\u201d Okay, each professional would be earning an average of $2,000, but would that be a monthly payment? How much time would these professionals dedicate to the project, so that we can understand if the hourly rate would be fair? Another 20,000 would be earmarked for various actions such as \u201cSourcing and recruiting DAO projects, Planning educational content, hiring guest speakers, Scheduling and logistics, Product iterations of primitive DAO tools based on feedback from incubator participants\u201d. How much would each cost approximately? I believe the financial breakdown here could be a little more work. Finally, speaking as a team, this proposal is certainly in good hands. Starting with the fact that the team already has two other previously funded proposals, from what I understand. From there we are sure that some people already have a good understanding of how Catalyst works. In addition, a lot of information is provided about each professional involved, we have an idea of \u200b\u200btheir resumes, what they have done so far, so a lot of trust is passed on the team. In general, the proposal is quite viable, with only a few points to be improved.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability is very good, the proponents provide us with many KPIs that would serve to monitor the progress of the phases, and also a good detail of what the success framework would look like. For example, some metrics would be analyzing the number of NFT holders (\"we will measure the progress and development of the project based on the number of people who own the governance of the DAO NFT pitch competition\") + voters (for this KPI, we will measure the progress and project development based on the amount of active voters we have participating in the DAO pitch competition votes)\u201d. Looking first at the progress audit, some qualitative KPIs are presented, as well as some quantitative data, for example, what would need to be ready in \u201d1 month: KPI: incubator participants / Target: 10 participants. Incubator Months 2-5: KPI: Industry Experts Scheduled for Incubator Calls / Target: 7 Industry Experts Scheduled\u201d). I think it's very positive how the proponents make a broad, deep and diversified analysis of what would need to be accomplished on a regular basis for the proposal to progress as planned. We do not have such a vision focused on numbers, as in most proposals. My only caveat would be: I would like it to be clearer how all these KPIs and analytics would come to the attention of the Cardano community. What would our communication bridge be? It is a very complex project, so I suggest that some online platform, such as Miro Board, be used. Or, some communication channels that are already well used by members in our community could be used, such as the discord servers or the telegram group \u201cThe Project Catalyst\u201d. Speaking now of final results, as I mentioned, we have very well broken down what would be considered success, in general it would be \u201cto create a lightweight incubator structure that increases collaboration, growth and knowledge of all incubator participants\u201d. Proponents explain further how this could be perceived, that is, we do not only know what must be achieved, but what type of verifiable data would serve to make such a reality palpable. Thus, the only comment would be, again, to clarify a little about how such a scenario could be perceived. It would be very positive if the proponents carried out a broad survey and demonstrated the achievements of this project so that we could understand whether the objectives of the challenge would be achieved, such as increasing the \u201cnumber of communities involved in collaboration using the Cardano DAO creation tools and DAOs that use Cardano as governance/management chain in 6 months. + amount of ADA coming from DAOs transaction fees after implementing the solutions in this challenge (> than the amount of the challenge allocated fund)\u201d, and etc. Even so, the project is very simple to audit and this part of the proposal is very adequate.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 7, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1178, "q0": "\"Proposed Project Provide an incubator for the integration of initial DAOs on the cardano-based DAO-powered DAO engine.\nThe proposal will provide access to a set of primitive DAO tools that will allow creators and the community on Cardano to build new, viable Daos on-chain.\nThis proposal is a great idea to build a community with highly effective ready-made solutions that have addressed the challenges and acceptance of the community.\nRegarding the proposed risk, there should also be plans to reduce the risk when implementing, increase the presence in the community to share what is being provided / built.\nThis part I rate the project 4 points, wish you success", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project roadmap is organized in phases each month and the tasks in each phase are also clearly listed.

The advantage is that this project is a continuation of two previously funded proposals. A budget plan is included in the proposal. It is good to invest in 10 incubators and spend part of their budget here to motivate them (2000 dollars per participant). The budget plan would be a little more comprehensive. It would be useful to include working hours in the proposal. A subdivision could also be made with what each person on the team earns.

Competitions and financial incentives lower the threshold for many. At the same time there is immediate feedback available to meet and adjust to varying requirements on real world use of the infrastructure.\n\nThere are synergistic benefits between this proposal and Clarity DAO infrastructure proposal.

This proposal made an important point: \"Creating and managing a DAO requires a wide variety of expertise ranging from distributed team management, tokenomics design, marketing, and more. This expertise is not easily accessible to new DAOs\". By providing an incubation program to equip early-stage DAOs with the knowledge and tools they need to build their communities and projects. I think this is a smart solution because it can save time and effort, especially for new, inexperienced individuals and backgrounds, and help increase diversity and influence as well as the adoption of DAPPS around the Cardano ecosystem, bringing new audiences to Cardano, helping to bring creators and want to participate in the Cardano ecosystem into DAOs. The proponent has laid out the services they will provide in a very straightforward and clear way, and they also hold biweekly incubation calls with industry experts to share knowledge and ask questions related to topics which last for 8 weeks with different issues, this makes the popularity of the idea even more enhanced and widely communicated to many people. To administer the pitch contest and select the contest winners and cash prizes, the project team will issue an administrative NFT where the owners of the NFT have access to vote on the contest winners. To conduct this vote, the project team will use the discord bot Clarity DAO. I find this to be very fair and transparent. I found the solution proposed by the proponent and identified most of the problems of the challenge and the logical argument. They give specific examples and indicators to show the impact of the problem. They describe the solution in detail, and clearly, and the topics to be covered are relatively complete. To successfully execute the project, they assessed and anticipated the possible risks. There are 2 main risks outlined here, the first is the ability to find enough creators and the community that wants to become DAOs on Cardano; the second is the delayed development time due to technical bottlenecks around the chain infrastructure. Faced with these risks, the proponent has also outlined solutions to overcome them. However, I find that in incubation calls, simply sharing knowledge and asking relevant questions is boring and distracting. To increase excitement about information exchange as well as more effective sharing, the team should organize mini-games in each incubation the questions are in the knowledge section that has been shared before or will reward people with great questions, people with great answers.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In the \u201cFeasibility\u201d section, I found that the proponent also presented all the information related to the timeline, budget as well as the team involved. About the timeline: this proposal also presented the main tasks to be implemented, the timelines, and the work to be completed in each of those stages. The plus point here is that the proponent has broken down the work into 8 weeks for easy tracking and control. However, to be more convincing, in my opinion, I should explain in more detail the work of each stage, who is responsible for completing each task, and the actual results achieved to determine the completion rate component of each piece of work. In terms of budget, it is also allocated differently in detail, clearly separating different purposes, which is also quite reasonable. However, I think the proponent should, if possible, attach more detailed spreadsheets to control costs, such as at the incubator operations stage, sourcing and recruiting projects DAO; planning educational content and sourcing guest speakers, etc budget fees. Information about the people who will work on the project is fully listed by the proponent, detailed name information as well as information through LinkedIn to make it easier for the community to check and track.

I find that reviewing and tracking through these metrics, helps to make the audit process clearer and more transparent.
