I think that DAOs will be an important part of the next blockchain adoption cycle and governance tools are very much needed on Cardano, however, this proposal is limited to voting and doesn't include treasury management using smart contracts. TosiDrop is on Ergo and Cardano, and this added functionality will help strengthen the bridge between both communities. The cTOSI token is going to be 90% distributed to the public, so I'm happy to support community projects.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Tosidrop has successfully launched their token claiming machine on mainnet. They have a very strong team with a proven track record. Tosidrop is from the team which is building anetaBTC on Cardano and Ergo.

The deliverable should be scalable and I see no reason why it shouldn't be aligned with the challenge.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There is no real explanation of the Budget other than monthly rates (try adding some hours to each task), and the implementation plan is, as also mentioned in the auditability section, quite top-level and could be more detailed. Like formulating concrete, actionable tasks. It can be seen that the team consists of some stakepool operators and has generated a faucet where SPOs can provide incentives for staking with their pools. While this is something that could easily be made based on other Open Source scripts, the implementation clearly shows some skills. There have however only been shared some handles of the team members and not much more info. Some kind of risk discussion has been done but no real mitigation strategy provided. The github shows some coding skills.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A roadmap has been provided.

The team\u2019s proposal on how the governance in Cardano and Ergo blockchain could be improved by using their cTOSI and eTOSI tokens for other projects to vote using their platform. This is a brilliant idea for the use case of the TOSI tokens use as voting. However, I believe for majority of projects (DAOs, PFPs & Metaverses) that have their own fungible tokens, the TosiDrop platform could integrate using their fungible tokens to vote as many DAOs, PFPs and Metaverse projects have their fungible tokens as governance tokens. Thus, increasing more utility of the TosiDrop platform as this is a one-stop platform for voting and governance. The TOSI team can earn revenue from charging slight fees as stated in their proposal. Since this platform can be connected to any Cardano & Ergo wallets around the world, this project can slowly scale globally. The team have stated the risk of running out of funds to complete the project. However, I believe the main risk is the security of the smart contracts they build on Cardano and Ergo. There were many hacks happening in the Ethereum, Binance and Solana blockchains, it is important to have solid security on the platform\u2019s smart contracts for people to trust using this platform.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team of developers are from Cardano SPOs who have been supporting and building on the Cardano ecosystem. They have the relevant experience to build for the Cardano and Ergo blockchains. However, they did not provide their full profile details of experience which makes it difficult to properly evaluate this proposal. The project timeline seems reasonable and achievable as the team have related experiences to execute this project. However, there is some confusion with the project timeline and the requested budget. The project timeline is from Q3 2022 to Q3 2023 (about 12 months), but the requested budget is for 5 months only. Another confusion is they have a team of 8 which require $2,000/month (which will be $80,000 for 5 months), but the team requested a budget of $70,000. The budget requested is considered high because the team is also working on other projects and not enough budget breakdown such as how many hours per week in a month to justify the $2,000/month for 5 months or 12 months period, which affects the scoring for this section. Since the team is also working on other projects, there could be delay delivering this project. Due to the confusion between the timeline and budget, it is difficult to justify the success of this project.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The team have provided very little details to audit them. Suggestions for the team to be better audited by the community are 1) metric for number of projects used their platform for voting using TOSI tokens. Will be better if the team integrate for other projects to use their own fungible tokens to vote in Tosi platform 2) no. of wallets voting from their platform 3) no. of return projects, users/wallets using their platform 4) open source their coding and documents in github and/or google sheets and updating them constantly (the team already have a github) 5) having third parties to audit their smart contracts for security purpose 6) provide updates to the community weekly/bi-weekly/monthly on the progress of the development of their project with data via Twitter spaces, Youtube videos, Twitter or Discord announcements 7) engagement and activity between the team and the Cardano and Ergo communities.

This helps the proposers to understand exactly what the proposal is intended for. I would agree that a DAO Governance Platform in Tosidrop would be huge. The project already has a healthy ecosystem and lots of people that are big followers of the project. The proposal describes how they were able to airdrop Tosi tokens to lots of early supporters of their project. With a large distribution of their tokens to lots of different people, it creates a great community where a DAO would be extremely important. This gives all users of Tosi the opportunity to vote, and it promotes decentralization.

In this example, this proposal has a very descriptive review of where all of the funds will go and how that will be necessary for the building of the DAO. In their description it shows that it will take around 5 months to complete. A timeline is also very important because it gives the project a deadline. Sure this can be changed, but this will influence the team to make sure it gets done because they will have their community and others helping them to stay accountable.
