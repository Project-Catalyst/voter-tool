The process for DAO development and evolution appears to be well thought out and structured to facilitate a wholly decentralized process that is well-incentivized. However, there is a lack of substance in impact articulation when the proposal spends more time explaining HOW they\u2019re going to do the proposal than they are explaining WHAT the proposal is going to do. Starting with the problem statement, there has to be some tangible information that makes the voters care about the need to solve the problem. The lack of a DAO for services and physical products might be true but what is the problem with the antithesis. These proposals are structured very much like a competitive debate format (which I was a competitor in college) and, as such, we would criticize proposition statements like this one both for and against the theoretical actionable plan. As a stock issue, a lot of debates are lost because the opposition argues that there is no need for the given plan because the problem statement doesn\u2019t have the magnitude to be a considerable problem. If we could see market research, data, and examples of tangible problems that occur in non-DAO goods and services, voters would be more likely to find worth in the given cost of the requested funds. Furthermore, these same elements of tangiblity could be provided to explain what the benefits of such a DAO would be in terms of magnitude of impact. In debate, the winners are usually the ones that prove the most deaths in the other positions advocacy (there is/was a problem with overly catastrophic thinking in competitive debate). The concept of quantifiability is helpful here because it gives voters a sense of how many people could be impacted (and in what ways), how much money could flow into the Cardano ecosystem, or other measurable outcomes that makes this proposal seem more desirable. As it stands right now, I feel like I have a process framework for a new business model that I can only guess at why businesses would adopt it. There\u2019s obvious appeal for voters to participate with tokenized incentivization but there\u2019s also not really any examples for what kind of products/services will be produced or what propositions they would be voting on within this DAO (which can help proposal voters formulate impact visions of the types of decisions that DAO voters would be given to vote on).

Starting with the capability of the team, there might not be direct expert experience in running highly successful businesses at large scales but there is business experience in developing companies (plural)  that are based in production. What would likely appeal to a lot of voters with environmental concerns is the fact that these are all highly-educated environmental scientists that are acutely aware of sustainable and environmentally friendly practices. The question is whether or not this team could reasonably get businesses to adopt this model, process, and platform. Based on the process articulation and the scale at which this DAO has voting control over, this model comes with  a large scale of transformation that I expect will require large scale testing. My biggest concern in feasibility is that this proposal only lays out the plan to build the Dapp that would facilitate this DAO process with software testing but there is no roadmapped testing of practical implementation. From this proposal, I don\u2019t get an indication if this DAO would be deployed on an existing business or if there is an intention to build a business from the ground up that is built on this foundation. As far as the budgeting goes, the spending efficiency appears to be pretty confidently on the side of cost effectiveness. With a vast majority of the allocated hours at a pay rate of $40/hr and a lower than average overall budget, I have no concerns about this proposal aiming at any exorbitant spending.
