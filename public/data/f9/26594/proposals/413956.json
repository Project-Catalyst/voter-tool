The proposal does address the challenge on creating collaboration management platform for DAOs. It will be more transparent if the team include who are the 10 sub DAOs under them stated in their proposal. The team wants to bridge DAOs using tools for newcomers to the DAO and the details of such tools is not well defined. There is insufficient information on what the tools going to be built and how it will help the Cardano ecosystem. It will be beneficial for the team to give few examples of the bridge tools and how it will influence the Cardano community. The risks mentioned in this proposal is not enough funding. However, the main risk that I see is security for this DAO and trust among other DAO projects to use this as a collaboration platform.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team gave a decent timeline of 6 months for their project. The team seem to have the necessary experience to run this project. However, none of the team seem to have knowledge about Haskell programming language based on their LinkedIn profiles. Security is important in the entire crypto space and having a team with knowledge with Haskell is beneficial for the Cardano and crypto ecosystem. In addition, if the team includes having tests and third party auditing their code creates trust for the Cardano community to use their platform. The breakdown of the budget is quite brief. It will be beneficial for the voters know where the funds go to. If the team breakdowns who and how many people will be working on the designing, development, no. of hours per week per worker, how the treasury is going to be used, etc., then there will be better understanding for the voters how the fund is distributed among the team and the DAO.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The auditing is quite sensible by on boarding the number of DAOs to their platform. The team have a target to on-board 2 DAOs per month and subsequent 5 DAOs periodically. The community can monitor by the announcements provided by the team in 6 months (as mentioned in their proposal) if this proposal is funded. It will be more transparent if the team updates their on-boarding progress or having announcements or AMAs once or twice a month to keep the community updated. Besides that, the DAOs they on-board must have a certain criterion in their list so that the DAOs are quality ones and not scammer types. Another suggestion is to have a github for the community to check any templates produced if the team is serious on building this tool for the Cardano community.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2274", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "- Each department of Konma is an autonomous entity solely responsible for its own tasks and goals, as mentioned in the proposal, these (inhouse) entities will be the SubDAOs, this will also include external DAOs that wish to be a part of Konma and not just exist as an isolated DAO (for which we will also provide assistance). another assessment literally rated us high for this very point \n- Our team includes students from Chennai Mathematical Institute who learn Haskell as part of their undergraduate, a Plutus pioneer pass out from IOG, and an in-house Haskell expert (Santhanu) who has around 10+ years of experience in developing industry-level applications with Haskell, this team is then supported by members of the Cardano Defi alliance and the developer community, this also includes some of the major organizations within Cardano to assist and guide\n- As we are purely a community-driven entity, we welcome anyone and everyone to Konma united through our socials to join in for our weekly AMA, where each department (SubDAO) provides updates of the week, this includes updates for catalyst funds, programs currently running and general updates, this is also then made as a recording and available on our platform (Konmahood)"}, {"id": 2045, "q0": "This ambitious proposal seeks to create the technical infrastructure for social life. This project is aiming to create one of the larger Knives on the Cardano Blockchain. Konma is a decentralized autonomous organization that manages the various factions of koma and other partnerships. They plan to make every faction of Konma a sub-DAO under the main Konma DAO. The ambition and intensity of this project are huge and could pave the way for mass adoption in the fields of activity, pushing forward the Cardano Blockchain. All of this will start with the successful implementation of this DAO. Therefore, it must be recognized that the potential impact of this proposal is large.\nThe minus point of this proposal is that it introduces the two biggest risks that can be encountered: 1. Insufficient finance will not participate in the DAO and 2. The Cardano ecosystem is not well equipped to support the DAO there. I know that all projects come with certain challenges, especially for an ambitious project like this. However, the proposed team has not foreseen solutions to deal with those risks, so it will worry us about your ability to carry out this project. What if those risks do happen? We need fallback methods to ensure that the project will be successfully implemented by the proposed team.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is average, for an ambitious proposal like this, I think we need a lot more information to be able to determine the feasibility of the project. The first is about the roadmap, the author briefly introduces the tasks and goals he needs to achieve, then gives us a 5-month roadmap. We know the main tasks for each month, as well as the amount to use in those months. What we need in that roadmap, however, is execution, not results. For example: \"Month 1: Designing and developing the standard template and tools: $20000\" we know the first month's task is to design and develop the template but who will do it, and how many the person in charge of this role, how many hours are they working, how can I determine if the $20,000 claim is reasonable??? The same goes for the next few months, we need to know more details about the roadmap of this project\nNext comes the budget, the $100,000 proposal, and the very superficial explanation. That is, we know that the money will be spent on things like Design, treasury, marketing, and development... it would be better if you broke these costs down into possible small items that can be determined. For example, the marketing cost why is $10,000 what marketing strategy will be used, how to reach the target audience, how long will this process take, and who will implement it?\nAnd finally about the team, right after this proposal is an extremely powerful team in both quantity and quality. However, the information provided is not enough to make a comprehensive assessment of this team, we know their names, their expertise, and affiliation profiles. We need more information on what their role is in this project. Therefore, I think that the feasibility of the proposal is not good, so it is better to develop all topics about the script, team, and budget.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal provides two easily measurable KPIs:\n-Number of DAO tools deployed\n-Number of DAOs included in the chain\nAnd the success of the project is said to be that the more DAOs are managed, the greater the success. As more and more DAOs seek engagement, community engagement and projects have the potential to increase, thus improving and allowing Cardano and the Konma ecosystem to grow. In short, this is what we are capable of testing. It's not bad, but it's superficial, again. I would like a monthly report to be prepared at the end of each cycle of the total time so that we can evaluate how the professionals involved have performed and also the partial results, based on the KPIs provided", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2299", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "PA has some understanding of Konma and its products (sub DAOs), but does not see it as an ecosystem.
