When a vote concludes in the tool, this smartcontract will unlock funds set aside in the escrow and release them according to the results of the vote.\n\nWhile there are a few questions related to the voting service in general (fees?  when will the ability to create ballots be live? will the contract be able to release tokens and NFTs as well as ADA? will the API allow embedding into sites and other webapps, or with a white-label option?) the intent of this proposal is laid out pretty clearly as a front and back end development for the voting app to add this smart contract.  If successful, the tool would allow anyone in the Cardano ecosystem to create ballots (including ballots requiring tokens to participate) and then release funding based on the vote, which is often a last mile issue for many tools in the ecosystem such as Tally or Dework.   Typically DAOs are left with having to combine multiple tools to get the onchain results, and then turn treasury keys manually for fund distribution.\n\nBecause this proposal addresses a real and present need of DAO communities (and many other collaborative efforts in the ecosystem as well), and because the risks associated are negligible, I believe that the proposal merits a full 5 stars for impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap breaks the project down into phases with each one consisting of milestones and architecture descriptions.  All except for one area, which is the actual smartcontract development.  While they do indicate they have Plutus developers for the team, the lack of details for the smart contract development stands out.  It may be because several relevant items were included in a different initial design phase, but that seems more relevant to seeing what is out there to work with.  On that note, it end up being an irrelevant issue since many escrow contracts have been developed in the community, including some by DAOs, so forking one of those, or collaborating across projects may be the best way forward there anyways.\n\nThe budget isn't very well described.  It is presented as a weekly budget across 7 roles, but no indication of overlap or instances of the roles where some are working and others are waiting.  Correlating the weekly or monthly budget to developer hours on the timeline could be a way to improve this section, which would account for role overlap of the scrum approach.\n\nThough the team has described pretty well the approach and the architecture, as well as their qualifications and some proof of work done, the issue of the lack of details for the budget requires that I lower the rating by 1 star, for a 4 star rating for Feasibility.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "For their progress metrics they plan to use basic software development reporting, primarily %complete from sprint burndowns.  For their completion metrics, they wish to count users and funds locked, as well as adoption by DAOs.  The DAO metric nicely captures data for the challenge setting, but unless they intend a release as they go schedule, that data won't roll in until after project completion.  If they restructured their timeline to include the rollout phase, either by adding it to a testing phase or adding more time to the proposal, then they could better bring this metric within scope.  Part of the issue is that for the completion points to be audited, there needs to be a set time for them to occur, and completion funding remains locked until that happens.  So for TVL, the number will be $0 at completion of the project, how long does the proposer want to wait for the data to come in?  1 month?  3?  A further problem is that the numbers aren't provided for context.  What amount of TVL would be considered a success?  $5?  $5m?\n\nThe best number for the proposer to lean into here would be to set a goal for the numbers of groups creating ballots over something like a few weeks or month, and to be marketing and getting participants \"signed up\" (perhaps by getting the ballot creation protocols up and letting teams create placeholders to indicate interest and readiness), or any other commitment of interest in using the tools.  Alongside a functioning tool, such a metric would allow for closeout and final funding (and the community would love to be kept up to date on the success of the tool no matter how much time has passed since funding.)  On that same note, I would have liked to have seen more information about how the proposer was going to keep the community apprised.  The social platforms appear underutilized and the repo is currently quiet.  Not a downgrading issue, due to contact information being available, but would be nice to have in the future.\n\nBecause the team has provided basic availability and good progress metrics, there is basic auditability here.  But because several of the completion metrics are misaligned and lacking context for evaluation, I am deducting 1 star for a 4 star rating.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 4, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 659, "q0": "This proposal clearly addresses the challenge by providing a tool which would be useful for almost any DAO. What the tool is and how it would work has been clearly articulated. The focus of the challenge is providing tools for DAOs that would make them more competitive and the tool in question is a critical one for true decentralization. I have significant experience running members based organizations and from my experience I can safely say that financial decisions are generally the most scrutinized and the one that require the most transparency. A tool such as the one suggested in this proposal could be the difference for many DAOs in being able to truly operate in a decentralized fashion and therefore has significant value. The cost of the proposal is not insignificant however because of the value, both intrinsic and in potential volume of transactions, I believe this proposal is a significant benefit to the community. I was unable to give a 5 star rating to this proposal however since after reviewing the Votaire website and license agreement I believe the software would be proprietary. This would still make it very useful as an app but it limits the benefit to the community. Having the smart contracts available in open source would broaden the potential use cases for the community and improve scalability. If the intent is in fact to have this be open source then I would recommend highlighting that fact in the proposal in future. Therefore I agree the answer covers most of the criteria and that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has clearly outlined the team that will be required and has provided adequate information to show the relevant experience and skills of this team.

Time for implementation and completion of the proposal has not been specified. And if referenced in the budget breakdown, the proposed implementation time can be predicted to be 10 weeks. I consider this to be the proponent's mistake, based on the capacity of the proposing team, writing a more detailed plan is completely feasible.\nBudget breakdowns are allocated in units of weeks all of which will be allocated to labor costs. I consider this to be an unreasonable point, this fund allocation is quite sketchy and will not really convince the community about the proposed budget that accounts for nearly 10% of the total budget of the entire challenge.
