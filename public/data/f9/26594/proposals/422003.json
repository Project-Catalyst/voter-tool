There isn't a project that is currently able to monitor this. This tool would benefit developers and users of the ecosystem. The developers would be able to manage their own DAO for their own project and make decisions based on the rating of decentralization from this tool. Whereas users of these projects can look into their favorite projects DAOs and determine if it is decentralized and safe. This has potential to add great value to the entire Cardano ecosystem. There would come a time where most projects that have their own DAO will be able to see what the community decides for their projects and what changes need to be made to their protocol. This can have a global impact and will be able to scale overtime as more DAOs are created. I find this proposal to be extremely interesting and can add lots of value to Cardano. For these reasons, I give this section 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "When monitoring the likelihood of the proposal being implemented successfully, I first look at the team and their experience. It is a good sign that most of the team for this proposal are identified along with their individual experience and expertise. The proposal includes a great deal of information about their roadmap. There could be a little more information included in the roadmap that could help readers of this proposal to access how likely it will be successful. But there is still lots of information included throughout the proposal to suggest the likelihood of success. In the detailed budget breakdown, there is lots of information that details the amount of requested funds. It is stated where all of the funds will be allocated and how that will help them to create the DAO Dashboard. It is stated that they will be monitoring their process by amount of people vising their website. This can be a good indicator to show growth and sustainability in different periods of their growth. They have identified risks and have solutions for the worst-case scenario. This is great for a project to recognize because things aren't always going to go as planned. For these reasons, I give this section 4 out of 5 stars. I agree that this proposal will likely be implemented successfully. However, there could be a little more information included on the roadmap. Make it more detailed and give more room for accountability by setting certain dates for each piece of information. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The information provided is likely sufficient to audit the success of the proposal. As stated before, I would include more information in the roadmap. This is due to two important principles. These principles will help audit the progression of the proposal. The first being transparency. The proposal should include specific dates and times for completion. As the team is open about their proposal and receives help and guidance from the community, they are likely to build trust in their project and ultimately gain a larger following of people who would love to utilize this DAO Dashboard. The second principle works simultaneously with the first principle. That is accountability. It has been mentioned before. That is because it is extremely important in auditing proposal. When there is a loyal community to the project, there is a direct form of accountability. As the team is open and transparent about their project, there will be more room for improvement. This concept of accountability will ensure that the team meets the dates provided in the proposal and builds trust within the community. For these reasons, I believe that the provided information is sufficient and that there will likely be large success if these two principles can be implemented. For these reasons, I give this section 4 out of 5 stars as there is still room for slight improvement in the roadmap.

The example of these data points are total assets under management, governance token holders, active voters, etc. It is admirable project since the community would surely want to know how decentralized the DAO they are involved with by using the index but the Clear Contracts will have to disclose how they come up with the formula and the weighing between factors as the index will be a comparison among DAO community members and the community member would prefer to engage with protocols that rank better on these indices. The dashboard will increase number of communities engaged and in particular for the DAOs in Cardano to compare against their peers on Ethereum and other chains. The Clear Contracts team mentions risk as  creating and connecting to the APIs to query correct data on the chain but they will communicate quite close with Clarity engineers.  I have mentioned another risk that they will have to explain how they come up with various index figures - decentralization ratio, automation index, governance index and decision made as these figures will be the main feature on the dashboard.

They plan and research to have on chain data and the next 5 weeks on the user friendly dashboard. I can notice in their people section on their DeepDao website and I reckon this will be part of team as they would like to see the community contribution (mostly with ETH extension). It is quite odd that the pay rate in each stage are all at $50 as I will assume different responsibilities so not sure why it is fixed rate across 3 roles. However, with a very strong team, I would give the full ranking in this case. It is likely that this project will be completed successfully with the contribution from community members. As they will return to Catalyst for further funding, the feasibility will be complete with the linkedin profile of team members and the explanation of pay rate.

The timeline is not aligned between feasibility and auditability sections. Although their milestone numbers are very precise such as #community members, APIs integrating with, #DAOs, Dashboard visits. The KPIs to measure progress are also reasonable and similar to their milestones. The Clear Contracts will need to create a tab in DeepDAO for the community to track project progress and success. The team understand that the community will need DAO dashboard to measure state of Cardano DAO and how decentralized and autonomous each protocol is. By providing the online link to help community to track project progress, it will be the best approach to improve auditability.

The solution provided is to build a dashboard that will display key metrics about each DAO that it pulls from on chain data.  This is somewhat related to the project's goals, considering the proposer wants to build an informative tool centered around DAOs on Cardano.  However it\u2019s not directly related to the challenge's goals because it doesn\u2019t create any tooling that would aid in the creation of DAOs on Cardano.  \n\nNevertheless, it is a DAO information product that would give Cardano a competitor to all of the similar information products that operate on Ethereum.  This would help legitimize Cardano as a place for DAOs to be built.\n\nThe KPI that is the most relevant to the challenge this was submitted in is probably the number of DAOs they collect data from.  The other KPIs, such as dashboard visits, are good indicators of success of the project, but they are not as aligned with the KPIs of the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team described in this proposal consists of software engineers and computer scientists with some having 10+ years experience in various IT roles.  Most of the team has experience with Haskell and building successful projects in the Cardano ecosystem, such as MLabs and Agora.  This will definitely be helpful when designing APIs for reading on chain data that this dashboard plans to use.\n\nThe proposer is asking for a relatively small budget, only $12,500, and also gives themselves a relatively small timeline of 10 weeks.  It\u2019s great that they are confident that they can complete this project in 10 weeks, but it seems like a quick turn around to me. I think I feel this way because there is not a lot of detail given about each step in the roadmap, so it is hard to evaluate how well thought out their plan for development is. \n\nAlso it seems they plan to incentivize members of the community to help contribute to this project.  It is unclear if they believe the success of the proposal relies on the help of community members or if it would just be a nice bonus to their current team of developers.\n\nMainly due to the people behind this team and their previous success in helping other projects on Cardano, I believe it\u2019s likely this proposal would be successful if funded, although I could see it taking longer than the timeline given in the proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal clearly defines metrics that would indicate the project's success, as well goals for those metrics for 1-3 months and 4-6 months after completion of the dashboard. For example, given the metric of number of dashboard visits, the proposer states that 200 visits per month in the first 3 months would be a success, and that 1,000 visits per month in the next 3 months would be a success.\n\nThe only thing missing in terms of auditability is a public channel where the team could provide updates on development.  Not having this makes it difficult for the public to assess the progress of the project as it is developing.  I imagine they have a place they plan to provide updates to, considering they want community members involved in the development.
