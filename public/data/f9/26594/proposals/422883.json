The suggested solution to run weekly interviews  sounds brilliant as it can attract users, developers and members from other DAOs to learn and understand what Cardano can offer in the DAO space. Sharing knowledge and experiences in this yet undiscovered DAO area will enable Cardano as the go-to platform for DAO tools, communities and dApps.\nThe proposal clearly articulates how it will add value in Cardano by providing very well-defined answers to specific questions set by the challenge.  Additionally, the proposer has identified a few possible risks and provided some mitigations that make good sense. This fact raises the level of confidence that the proposal will succeed and any possible risks will be minimized.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind this project is the proposer himself.

The provided hourly rates are reasonable so it is the whole budget for the project.\nThe project's roadmap includes a well-defined and realistic timeline, a description of all project activities and the time duration in months to complete them. Although the plan is sufficient it would be nice to describe the key milestones for the project. Based on a potential success the \"What The DAO\" proposal may continue expanding and scale its success to other regions in the world.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal will measure the active listeners both for each space and sum them up for all spaces.

The timetable for the investigative and administrative work seems to be quite optimistic. The proposer is the only person involved, which limits the financial risk and additional effort that might have to be invested. Time will tell if the planned time is going to meet the estimated effort.\n\nThe assessment of the risks could be wider as aspects of e.g. dependency on Twitter spaces (the could be a change in the way the service is provided), promotion channels (all selected channels are quite \"noisy\"), and personal availability (due to illness) have not been considered.\nIt might be helpful to think about technical alternatives (if required) like YouTube, promotions during Project Catalyst \"After Townhall\" meetings, or the mitigation of unavailability of the host through co-hosts just to name a few.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Generally, the proposal is providing a good roadmap and milestones to measure the delivery of intent in an effective way. The only concerns are around the total number of 10K listeners as there is a big gap between the assumed live listeners on Twitter spaces and the total number of listens for the complete period of 4 months (30 listeners per the first-month per show, 50 for the second month and 100 in month three) which equals 720 live listenings vs. 10K listeners over 4 months. Furthermore, there is no clear indication, of how the listening will be reported. A bespoke webpage or a Gitbook page should be considered to report the KPIs.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2586", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5083, "q0": "(Will address the proposer as \u201cthe proposer\u201d, \u201cthey\u201d, and \u201cyou\u201d, and I use \u201c///\u201d to indicate paragraphs.) ///\n\nThis proposal fits good into its challenge. It helps with some marketing, and also education. The idea is to hold Twitter Spaces every week over a four-month period of time \u2013 the Spaces will contain a 45mins interview and a 15min Q&A for the listeners to ask their questions. ///\n\nNow, I see several potential disadvantages that are not addressed sufficiently in the proposal. ///\n\nFirst of all, Twitter is the end boss of bubble-creation \u2013 there is hardly any outreach to people outside of your bubble (sometimes not even for inside). The proposer wants to use their personal Twitter Account, which is very unfortunate regarding this issue, because nobody will just go onto your Account and just find your project randomly. My advice would be to make a totally new Account for your project, even make a new email address to use for that new Account; then also upload on YouTube, Spotify, and Anchor.fm, etc. The main reason is because Twitter is not good to re-find stuff again and it\u2019s not good to search through. And regarding that, make sure to create a (pinned) thread where you collect your episodes, so people find it at least when they visit your (new) profile. ///\n\nThen, the proposer suggests finding more audience in some Discord Servers or Telegram channels. This pro-active style of reaching-out is not exactly the most efficient way to gain a lot of traffic (rather just specific traffic), especially because these Social Medias only reach these people that are in the specific group \u2013 and then there\u2019s also the question whether they will see the message and interact with it. Therefore, I hope that the \u201cadmin work on web presence\u201d (quoted from the budget breakdown) maybe even goes into having a webpage, because content for inside the bubble is great, but it needs also to be accessible from the outside alone. ///\n\nIf you don\u2019t gain further reach than your own bubble on Twitter, I feel like this proposed project will only add more value to the echo-chamber the proposer is in, rather than being a well-organized and well-marketed interactive podcast. For that echo-chamber, it will be good content, but that does not make \u201cCardano the go-to choice for building DAOs\u201d (quoted from the Challenge), because the listeners are those who already consider Cardano to be the go-to place for building their DAO. ///\n\n\u201cTo spread awareness and bring new creators and operators to the space\u201d (quoted from the proposal), I\u2019d advise you to get a deeper understanding of the Social Medias, and how they work. And also have a look into podcast-specific tools! Because an interview alone can be a bit overwhelming for both interviewee and interviewer, and a public Twitter Space is then an additional layer to that. ///\n\nThe proposer certainly knows much about interviewing, and I am sure these will be of good quality, and the proposer knows what they do with interviews. However, I am not sure whether Twitter Spaces are the best format to execute these skills. The idea mixes two very different styles of content: One is a journalistic, organized, pre-planned 1:1 one; and the other is an interactive Q&A part that wants to include a yet-to-be-established community. Twitter Spaces are good for also-interactive conversations, but the idea is to wait with the the questions until the end \u2013 which is counterintuitive to the podcast-aspect of the idea. This is exactly the mixing of styles I mean. MAYBE it works for this event, but I just wanted to raise this point. ///\n\nAnother aspect of this problem is, that the interactive part requires people to attend, while a podcast is something you want to listen to whenever you got time and feel like listening to a podcast \u2013 it\u2019s not necessarily something you would attend like a regular meeting. And with a regular meeting, you only get people who got exactly this time-slot free and are willing (and free) to participate. ///\n\nThe proposer identifies three risks that are related to this \u2013 but their solutions are in my understanding rather ideas than solutions. The first risk is, that the audience does not grow, and the solution is the mentioning of going into some Discord and Telegram channels. The second risk is that guests are not attending, and the solution is to invite all the guests to come and listen to every Space. The third risk is that the Q&A part does not roll, and the solution is to provide more interview questions. ///\n\nWhy not differentiate the two styles? Why not make a solid nice podcast AS a podcast, and then also hold an interactive space? With that, you don\u2019t have as much pressure \u2013 and you can fully enjoy the interactive sessions as interactive sessions, and your listeners can enjoy your podcasts fully as podcasts. Additionally, you could also provide your new email address for them to send questions whenever they want to \u2013 or let them slide into the DMs of your new Twitter Account. ///\n\nThe penultimate problem I would like to address is the timeframe. Four months are not very much to build a regularly attending community and to get the word spread out. Content relies much on consistency \u2013 but you, as the content creator, also need to be able to hold that consistency up. If you start with one interview every week, that will/may drain you \u2013 because it does not only mean you are holding spaces, but you also want to do all the research and prepare with high-level interview skills. (AND if you got a certain schedule, you already put that time-slot in stone also for your interviewees (especially for them).) Again. Social Media and journalism are two different things, and I would suggest staying mindful of their differences. Especially if you take my advice and expand onto other platforms as well. Find out what they live of, how they function, how people interact with content \u2013 and let it inspire you. (And look into podcast tools!) ///\n\nAnd the last problem I want to address here: Someone who just wants to know what Cardano DAOs are and whether Cardano is the \u201cgo-to choice for building [their] DAOs\u201d will not listen to a podcast every week. Maybe you can also create a little FAQ or some other resource with your newly-gained community? \u2013 Yes, you mention that later in the proposal, but I wanted to emphasize it (to hopefully become more than a document and video for Catalyst). ///\n\nAnd as a little disclaimer (at the end, wohoo) \u2013 maybe I am wrong about the concern with high-level interviews on Twitter Spaces and only such a short time frame for interaction. Maybe you should totally go for it and try it out! But still, collect the recordings in- and outside of Twitter! ///\n\n(OH, and my very last idea would be, that you could maybe also connect with already existing podcasts/Twitter Spaces and make a special series in THEIR show \u2013 as a kinda bootstrap of audience participation \u2013 but then you\u2019d not have your own project, so I totally understand it if you want to build your own podcast! (You could also just go randomly into other Twitter Spaces as your New Account (build/connect community), which gives you some visibility)) ///\n\n((And please don\u2019t forget to let people have their open questions where they can just talk openly about their stuff, these are the absolute best parts in podcast IMO!))\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Yes, this proposal is feasible. My already stated concern is about the attendance and the interaction \u2013 but as advised, there are Social Medias which do not require listeners to be listening LIVE (apart from the recording being on Twitter, but again \u2013 Twitter is not the best platform for reach, nor for archiving/collecting). ///\n\nThe budget breakdown does not really go into why these numbers that are chosen are chosen, but instead says that \u201c[t]he prices above reflect rates charged to recent customers for similar work.\u201d What is meant with \u201crecent customers\u201d? And what about the time, how are the hours calculated? ///\n\nSpeaking of time, I do not know whether a one-week interval is a good choice to prepare the interviews and host them and everything; my first strong impression is that it will be very stressful and that I should advise a more chill, but also more thought-through approach. Maybe I totally underestimate the interviewing skills of the proposer, then I would advise this only because of the Social Media aspects mentioned \u2013 and to first get to know everything. Hosting is quite a challenge, especially with live stuff. (Again: Look into podcast tools!) ///\n\nAlso, a note about what is written in the timeline/roadmap: The proposal for the next iteration will not be due in 4 months, but in less. ///\n\nThe idea is, that this project can evolve into something bigger \u2013 and I feel like this pilot is feasible, but the proposer will learn a lot about how Social Media and podcasts work. And how people actually and truly engage with content. I very much wish them that their path of learning will be a fulfilling and nice one! ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal is quite auditable, because anyone can just join the Spaces or listen to the recordings. ///\nI feel like the measurements of success are too arbitrary though (and with that also not really understandable why you chose them) \u2013 the proposal suggests counting the attendees. This was a big indicator for me that the proposer needs to get to know better how Social Media interaction works and what they live off \u2013 these numbers suggested are just what the podcast also kinda relies on (because of the interactive part). Here, I am again uncertain whether I underestimate the fitting of the two styles (journalistic and interactive in one), but I\u2019d like to emphasize that your content needs to appear on other platforms as well. And there, you can count numbers too, but they will be different and do not rely on joining LIVE. (Maybe you can do something like a Linktree to collect all the upload-places in one spot.) ///\nAnd then there\u2019s a small contradiction I see: \u201cThe more people contributing to the conversion and engaged in concrete experience, the better.\u201d (quoted from the proposal) Yes, this makes sense in case you rely on them to carry the Q&A part \u2013 but that only is for 15 minutes. I do not really see a fastly growing audience to contribute 15 minutes after listening 45 minutes. If you want more people contributing, you will probably need to leave the space open \u2013 else I feel like you will be cutting off many conversations, since people need to acclimate to the setting as well \u2013 and 15 minutes are just enough to acclimate. (OR, as suggested already, differentiate them and make the interactive conversations as interactive as they can get! \u2013 or invent a whole new model of holding the spaces, idk :) Wish you all da best!)\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2670", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6084, "q0": "The name is snazzy.
