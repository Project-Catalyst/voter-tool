This is a necessary limitation in closed systems where there are no credit scores that can assign different risks to different users/unique wallets. This limitation makes sense from the security point of view of DeFi protocols, but it is a major obstacle for unbanked people who need to use reputation to obtain loans. The RealFi concept will bring possibilities such as undercollateralized loans, something that has great potential in underdeveloped countries and in layers of society where speculation and investment are not a priority.\n\nRealFi is also about accessibility and an example of this is the work done by WorldMobile, a company dedicated to developing mobile communication networks in Africa. This work is essential because access to DeFi also depends on the infrastructure and internet in the locality.\n\nThis challenge setting intends to give space to projects and initiatives that make it possible to bridge applications that still focus on communities with greater financial power and bring not only DeFi, but metaverse and NFTs to different communities.\n\nDue to these points, I consider this challenge setting of great importance and critical for mass adoption on the Cardano blockchain.\n\nThis challenge setting is in line with items 1 and 3 of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals mentioned in the Proposal Assessor Guide.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The NFT and DeFi niches are amongst the most popular of the blockchain communities and in Cardano is no different. There are hundreds of projects developed and under development in these two niches in the Cardano blockchain, but few still have an interest or application in \"RealFi\". For RealFi to be possible, identity solutions through DIDs are necessary, which is not a problem, as hundreds of community members have already made the ATALA pioneers program. If we consider that this challenge setting is an intersection of niches of great demand by the Cardano community (Defi, NFTs, identity and metaverse) I see that there is great demand from the community.\n\nThe only caveat is that this challenge setting has a relatively high budget, around 25% of the total budget of Fund 10 and we have not had any challenge setting dedicated to RealFi before with a budget of this magnitude, which brings uncertainty about the ability of the Cardano community to create proposals. in sufficient quantity and quality to meet this challenge and still remain competitive.\n\nThere are other challenge settings that allow development of projects related to identity, Dapps (which includes the DeFi niche) and NFTs, so excess funds can deplete demand for this challenge.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The definition of success is appropriate to the context of this challenge setting, but there is no time frame to measure success.

The next sentence mentions collaboration in expanding use cases for DID and the Metaverse to reach end users. I suggest making a stronger message under the challenge brief, with more detailed explanation for at least one of the aforementioned statements, making it reprehensible for public (end users).\n\n\"We need to find real marketing dollars, real savings and real entertainment to power the crypto economy.\"; the sentences like this one are too broad meaning to bring focus to the challenge.\n\"Our goal is to attract additional outside investment by creating 'RealFi' use cases.\"; this is a more concrete and welcoming statement.\nAt the end, the challenge maybe has enough explanation to attract the right ideas to it, like the very last paragraph under the challenge brief.

What is the baseline of Cardano wallets? If it is meant as a number of wallets active within the project, then this could be the same problem or the same metric as the metric #3.

The concept of the challenge is very interesting and very broad. Metaverse itself if a fluid concept and there isn\u2019t a single definition for it: some people say each project will have its own metaverse, but others say there is only one metaverse that connects everything. So, this challenge, as stated, could fit different perspectives about what metaverse is, and the only requirement is that the projects will have to connect DID solutions, such as Atala PRISM, to bring people to the metaverse, and not just avatars that are potentially not unique and not necessarily connected to an individual. The proposer claims that RealFi and metaverse are the future of blockchain and the internet as well, and I believe it will play a central role in the change that is happening today from Web2 to Web3. This challenge proposal is very well connected to building real-world solutions based on Cardano, especially because it positions itself against pointless play-to-earn and the ludicrous APYs offered by some DeFi platforms. The challenge would also allow developers from other blockchains to join Cardano and possibly create their open-source projects here. In general, the alignment of this challenge with Cardano\u2019s mission is very high.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Catalyst and Cardano communities are already building many solutions related to DeFi, gaming, NFTs and other blockchain applications that van be integrated with the metaverse and SSI solutions. The biggest challenge in going so in Cardano is that the main DID solution, which is Atala PRISM, has not launched yet and there are already many funded projects that are waiting for it to be in production so they can, in some cases, even start working on their projects. There are some initiatives going one that are using DID solutions from other blockchains, such as ProofSpace, which is currently using HyperLedger but wants to migrate to Cardano once PRISM is ready. If this is a possibility for this challenge, then the risk would be lower, but some budget for re-work in the future would be required. Also, the number of people currently proficient with DIDs is very low in the community, and it would not be so easy to find enough people to work a minimum number of projects to use all the 3M ADA budget requested for this proposal. I believe that, for a first submission, the budget of this proposal should be lower, and once we see that it\u2019s successful, we, as a community, would be confident to spend more budget with it.

I believe they are good, very appropriate, and possible to measure - only the \u201cGrowth in total number of Cardano wallets above baseline\u201d that might be more challenging to measure -, but I would like to see as well some KPIs related different areas. For examples, number of projects that are bringing NFT projects to the metaverse, or DeFi, or gaming, to understand the distribution of community interest and focus when it comes to the metaverse. Also, besides launching new projects and linking existing ones, it would be good to measure the number of projects that already exist but were not in the metaverse yet but started their migration because of this challenge. Maybe even measure the number of different DID solutions that are being used by different projects as well.

Although I agree with the arguments presented, I also believe that the way this challenge is framed there is a high probability of overlap in topics to be addressed when compared to other challenges in catalyst. Compared with the strategic goals of the next fund, I would like to affirm that the proliferation of real-world use cases is a key strategic goal of the next fund that is directly related to one of the four strategic objectives. I would nevertheless recommend that the authors of the proposal seek alternatives that are aligned with other goals that will be established in subsequent catalyst cycles.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I find their approach to be very interesting, and I believe there is room for this kind of projects at Catalyst. Unfortunately, the team's only argument for justifying the requested budget (which represents 23.4% of the available budget for the next fund) is that RealFi represents the future of Cardano, a conclusion I do agree with generally but on which I would have expected more data to be provided. I am also concerned about the possibility of overlap with other challenges, as it is directly related to the community's capacity to address it, which could result in an inefficient allocation of funds. As such, I recommend that the team revise the description so that it is clear what are the requirements and/or considerations to be considered by future proposers. These considerations should be specific enough so that they can be distinguished from other challenges, without being restrictive.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As I read the description of the success criteria, it seems as if the focus is on the proliferation of DID solutions, which is confusing when compared with the rest of the sections. This set of metrics is designed as a combination of metrics that could be used to measure the performance of the challenge itself as well as metrics that could be used as a guide for future challenge proposers. Taking a look at the metrics, for example, we have \"the number of successful projects that were launched as a result of this challenge\", which I consider to be a generic metric and could be applied to just about any challenge. There is another proposed metric which is \"Proposal dApp/solution users issued with DID\" which, although it could have been better described, I consider it to be a better metric that would better describe the expected impact of this specific challenge. These metrics are wide enough that they could not be construed as restrictive and can serve as a useful point of comparison between projects. I would suggest adding to the challenge setting specifications for proposers an information regarding the need to report not only to IOG but also to the community, as well as the means and frequency of communication.\u00a0\u00a0", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2142", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 1, "ng": 10, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1012, "q0": "When it comes to driving adoption and expanding influence in the cryptosphere in today's market, RealFi is the way to go.

Our community needs this type of forward thinking proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer lists membership in Developer Ecosystem and Defi challenge teams from the three most recent funding rounds. Such experience provides valuable insight into the areas in which Cardano needs to expand. Does this translate into guaranteed success, no \u2026 But it does greatly increase it\u2019s likelihood. Admittedly, the goals of this challenge proposition are quite lofty and will be difficult to achieve. That said, if anyone can hit this mark it would be the likes of the Cardano community, IOHK and Atala Prism. DiDs are already starting to be implemented on our blockchain, all of the facets to be integrated in this challenge are operational, save a fully functioning Metaverse, which folks like Cornucopias game are promising to deliver. I wish 4.5 were an option for scoring, because that is my honest assessment.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The KPI metrics listen in this challenge are spot on, and will be easy to verify. The number of DiDs issued and number of successful projects that evolve from this proposal can more than adequately be monitored and evaluated. Determining the increase in ada transactions on related metaverse and game projects may be tricky, but a close estimate should be possible. Similarly, growth in numbers of wallets would be subject to a calculus with a degree of uncertainty but ultimately yielding a ballpark figure. The metric that could most easily be assessed as a measure of success would be the number of DiDs operating on Cardano metaverses. Again I am scoring a 4 when I feel a 4.5 to be more appropriate.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2252", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 2, "ng": 8, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3369, "q0": "Based on the information in this challenge setting proposal, I believe that this challenge setting firmly addresses all four of the strategic goals for fund 9. It addresses the first strategic goal (prepare a group of people to make contributions to the Cardano ecosystem) because it provides the necessary guidance for future proposers to build their own solutions to current problems using a combination of Decentralized ID (DID), Defi, and the metaverse. The proposers listed some great examples of basic guidance for future proposals, such as the fact that proposals should have some component of identity and an immersive experience (to some degree). Listing this information is very helpful for proposers and it ensures that they will have the proper understanding of the requirements when they make their proposals. The challenge setting encourages people to create solutions for real value, real marketing dollars, and real entertainment while ensuring the individual has the ability to control their own data and identity, with no centralized authority having control over it.\n\nThe challenge setting also addresses the second strategic goal (building an open-source ecosystem and attracting developers) by creating a huge opportunity for new projects that developers can take on. The RealFi space (combining Defi and DID) has a huge amount of space to grow in the coming years, so starting with this challenge setting, the community can show developers that they care about this field. Thus, more developers are likely to come to the ecosystem when they see that there is a challenge setting that matches their interests. Additionally, I believe that this challenge setting will encourage open-source development because of the statement \u201cfree from centralized or greedy agency\u201d that the proposers used in the proposal. While they did not explicitly say that projects should be open-source, I believe that it is mildly implied in the language of the challenge setting. Additionally, any participating developers who are passionate about RealFi are likely to make their projects open-source since it is a standard for any successful project on the Cardano blockchain. The proposers could have mentioned it explicitly, but I don\u2019t think it is a huge problem in this case. \n\nThe challenge setting addresses the third strategic goal (build real-world solutions on Cardano) by building RealFi solutions on the Cardano blockchain. I don\u2019t know how much more obvious real-world solutions can get than that alone. The basic concept of RealFi is to bring real finance to people who need new ways to access finance and create value that Defi often cannot achieve in its current form. An example from IOHK is working with the Ethiopian Ministry to provide DID to many students. This DID would not only allow students to have access to financial opportunities, insurance, education, etc. Ideas like these or even smaller scale projects that the community comes up with for this challenge setting will provide huge real-world benefit to many individuals around the world. \n\nThe challenge setting does not explicitly address the fourth strategic goal (support human processes in Catalyst). However, I have been able to find a connection that I think works well. By growing and developing the RealFi ecosystem within the Cardano ecosystem, developers can provide ways for people around the world to get involved with Catalyst. There are many opportunities to onboard new members and further develop the Catalyst mechanism through concepts from this challenge setting, such as DID. I could see DID involved in PA/vPA reputation (a place that could really use DID). There are many good use-cases for DID in Catalyst, so I think the cross-benefit to the human processes of Catalyst is enough to justify a score of 5. (score given: 5)\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the information provided in the proposal, I believe that the Cardano community has the capabilities to address this challenge. I know that there are many DID projects already building on the Cardano blockchain, and there is Atala PRISM. There are also a lot of DeFi protocols running on the Cardano blockchain. Since there is already huge amounts of participation for a few of the RealFi components, I think that there will not be any issue with bringing together DeFi and DID developers on this issue. Additionally, there will also be new developers who want to join Cardano and build their RealFi solutions. Overall, from my experience observing the development happening on the Cardano blockchain, I am confident that there will be enough people to address this challenge setting. \n\nThe budget for this proposal is 3 million ADA. Given the immense scope of RealFi and implementing it, I think that this budget is reasonable. The proposers also mentioned that they hope there will be at least one future proposal in the category that requests over 10% of the 3 million ADA in order to create a robust project that produces meaningful MVPs with a good user experience. All criteria for feasibility have been met, and I do not have any critiques. (score given: 5)\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Given the information provided in the challenge setting proposal, I think it does a good job of defining some metrics of success for its focus areas. The overarching goal is DID that can be used by a larger demographic \u201cunifying personal finance, goods and services, gaming and collecting.\u201d Some more specific metrics of success include, number of successfully launched projects from this challenge setting, proposal DApps and solutions issued with DID, and total ADA value locked in metaverse, games, and platforms. There were a few more metrics mentioned, but I think overall they are all useful for future proposers when they think about their proposals. There is also a great space for healthy competition between proposals since everyone has the same goal of reaching a working RealFi ecosystem, but there are many different ways to reach that point, so there will be many projects and ideas that contribute to that ideal future. The metrics of success are broad on purpose, which allows future proposers to have flexibility to build whatever solution they feel is necessary for RealFi.

Metaverse might sound like the Valley or the Street companies overhyped, marketing buzz word right now but we all know that it is all inevitable. Digitalization and virtualization will eat the world. If Cardano wants to be at the forefront of this cutting-edge technology and stays relevant for the following decades, the community must have good answers to this challenges. This is a quite broad challenge that covers DeFi (decentalized finance), NFT (non-fungible token), and DID (decentralized identity) as the solutions wanted to be integrated to create the superstructure of fully functioning and mass-adopted metaverse.\n\nOverall, I can see this challenge setting aligns with strategic goal and critical mission Cardano plans to achieve in Fund 10. The metaverse will attract many users wanting to consume and utilize all the features and benefits from a novel world. The builders, developers, and entrepreneurs will need to come, explore, and realize all these visions of new world. Lastly, functioning metaverse (might) has the solution to real world problems that cannot be solved using traditional method due to physical or other constraints such as distance, disabilities, inequality, etc.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The solutions really encompass major niches in the blockchain industry and cryptoverse from DEFI, NFT, and DID and trying to combine all these into an ultimately interconnected metaverse integrated to the real world. We regularly see plenty proposals regarding those three major topics, therefore I do not worry about the number of submissions we will receive, as well as with the quality of the submissions.\nDue to the grand idea envisioned behind this challenge setting, fully functioning products as the results to be delivered within next six months are mostly will pretty much be longs shots. Therefore, to manage communities\u2019 expectations, I suggest the challenge team can advise proposers to start as seed phase and plan the roadmaps into multiple Catalyst Funds ahead to minimize under delivery or even non-delivery risks. I commend challenge setting proposer to mildly state that meaningful MVPs (minimum viable product) with serviceable UX with maximum budget of USD 300,000 can be the ideal model of the submitted proposal. Lastly, regarding the challenge team, we have ample choices and combinations of community members who are expert enough and they can cooperate together to steward this challenge.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The metrics are measuring ideal and favorable outcomes I believe Cardano community want to see in general. More seamless interoperability between dApps inside Cardano ecosystem or even outside of Cardano will absolutely be invaluable.

It is helping that Cardano ecosystem already has few numbers of major and notable metaverse projects such as Pavia, Cornucopias, Drunken Dragons, and the most recent Virtua\u2019s Cardano Island. I have been involved in majority of them and I can say the enthusiasm is above and beyond and it will keep growing in terms of adoption and value. The proving grounds are here with us already and I am excited the coming proposals could realize this challenge setting\u2019s grandiose vision by imparting impactful and significant values upon these metaverses.
