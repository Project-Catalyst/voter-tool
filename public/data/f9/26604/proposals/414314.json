A decentralized FAM network to produce quality Cardano community media is vital yet absent.", "f6_no_assessments": 6, "f6_rating": 4.666666666666667, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 86, "q0": "This proposal is very positive and attempts to expand the concentric circles around Cardano\u2019s tech core into a wider ecosystem. First, I would like to point out that the challenge question field consists of two very distinct statements, but there is no question. It might seem nitpicking, but the question field is there to ensure that a problem question is posed so that a framework can be proposed by future proposers to address the problem question. \nThe first statement in the Challenge Question field is \u201cGlobal entertainment+media market = $2 trillion\u201d. Pointing this out is important for the media industry but not directly relevant for the Cardano mission, as many different markets are very valuable. The automotive market is valuable, the pharmaceutical drug market is valuable, you get my gist. The value of a market is not something that can be transposed directly onto Cardano\u2019s mission. The second part of the question is more relevant \u2013 \u201cA decentralized FAM network to produce quality Cardano community media is vital yet absent.\u201d In this part of the question, we can see the proposer\u2019s own words about the importance of the challenge. I agree that Cardano needs exposure - although what I would like to have seen more explanations about why funding a decentralized FAM network \u2013 per se - is vital, on its own, for achieving Cardano\u2019s mission. \nThe proposer calls for establishing a \u201cbridge between YouTube, the traditional media, TV and film.\u201d I never thought about the bridge and, while it sounds good, is this something that should be financed? If the challenge is not voted in this round, I would suggest that the proposer provides more information in the next fund \u2013 such as why do we need this bridge? What is this bridge and how would it like ideally?\nThe proposer also states \u201cWe need to communicate a clear message towards media.\u201d This might be true \u2013 however what does it mean exactly? In the sense \u2013what is the \u201cclear message\u201d. Focusing on a single message might be counterproductive. I see value in communicating objective stories about Cardano \u2013 critical as well as positive stories, not only \u201cspreading the word\u201d - because only focusing on the positives might help create an environment where we ignore problems in order to hype the eco-system. \nIf the proposed challenge is not approved, I would advise the proposer to better focus the challenge to Cardano\u2019s specific mission and development components. The proposer specifies that the Challenge Setting is open to any creatives \u201csince art in general can help spread the word about Cardano\u201d. Nevertheless, \u201cspreading the word\u201d seems to be a bit on the simplistic approach for a challenge. \nIn short, if it is not funded, try to resubmit with more focus on core Cardano elements, more guard rails, more vision. Statements like \u201cThe FAM challenge category can unlock a flow of submission of ideas and proposals that bring about high quality, educational and inspirational multi-lingual multi-media content.\u201d are too vague and general. If that is true (can unlock), then the opposite might be true as well \u2013 the challenge category as its stands MIGHT not unlock that flow. In my view it aligns well with Fund 9 goal 1, partially with goal 2, not so well with the fund goals 3 and 4. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The feasibility seems straightforward. I agree that the Catalyst community probably does have the capacity to address this challenge, thanks to the very diverse nature of the Catalyst community and its ability to attract professionals from all professional and amateur walks of life. One thing that I would propose is that there seems to be a need for a more critical approach to quality for challenges like this \u2013 and if it is not approved in this fund \u2013 the feasibility could be improved through more components that add critical approach to the media products that are produced through this funding. I would have liked to see a rationale concerning the proposed ADA300,000 challenge budget and how it could generate sufficient return for the Cardano ecosystem at this stage. This was not mandatory, however the proposal authors could have included some more info on their reasoning that would support this specific sum and why they think it reflects the requirements of the challenge. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposed key metrics for the proposed challenge are mostly quantitative and they involve several measures of \u201cthe health of the ecosystem\u201d \u2013 that are based partially on counting the number of multimedia projects and number of decentralized teams. These numerous metrics on multimedia projects and decentralized teams seem to favour multimedia ideas and teams that are decentralized (which might lead to having centralized teams pretend that they are decentralized in order to fulfill the criteria). Also, quality work in one media form should not be seen as less valuable than a multimedia project. I feel that a Challenge Setting of this size ADA300,000 should also include some better-defined quality criteria for success and metrics that would help to determine the quality of output. Even in the crypto space we know about the proliferation of projects, but it is quality that trumps quantity in many walks of life. \nI think that the challenge might benefit from a rewriting and streamlining (if it is resubmitted in the next Fund), as some of the statements seem too generic. For example, the statement of potential outreach: \u201cfor example films and documentaries created can be screened at festivals / can be broadcasted on national televisions / articles can be printed or released online\u201d \u2013 seems superfluous as it is self-evident. Many things can happen, if it is not a specific metric then not necessary. The challenge team for Film & Media might try to quantify potential impact in more defined ways, if this Challenge Setting proposal is not approved in this round and is resubmitted for funding in Fund 10.  \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2047", "no_vca": 21, "ne": 7, "ng": 6, "nfo": 8, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you for taking the time to assess our proposal. Your comments and rating of 3 for Impact appear to display a bias and do not comply with following the Proposal Assessor Guidelines, nor include relevant evidence to justify a 3 rating."}, {"id": 602, "q0": "The goal of this challenge is to create space for creatives and artists to submit their ideas to increase the awareness about Cardano, especially to create decentralized entities to work on this matter. This challenge is very focused on advertisement and marketing, and it is essential to help Cardano to achieve its goals. It is not enough to have a good product, people must learn about it so they can start using it, and this essentially what this proposal is all about. This proposal has already been funded previously and the work is being done, as some results can already be seen as well. The proposing team is well connected and, if they are part of the challenge team, I believe the impact of this challenge will be increased even more. This challenge proposal is directly aligned with the goal of attracting more developers, since it will increase Cardano\u2019s awareness and developers who are not aware about Cardano yet can get to know it better and join existing teams or created their own projects. Indirectly, this challenge has the potential to address other goals such as building real-world solutions on top of Cardano and attract other non-technical community members that want to contribute to the ecosystem. In general, I believe the alignment of this challenge proposal with Cardano is very high.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The budget requested for this challenge is 300k ADA, which is very similar to the budget requested previously in Fund 8, $150k, if the price of ADA doesn\u2019t change much until results are out. In Fund 8, there were 34 proposals submitted and only 9 got funded. This shows that there were more people willing to execute ideas related to this challenge than funds available. Not necessarily all these proposals were good, but it shows the potential and interested of the community. Now, for Fund 10, the budget is going to be very similar, and the community has grown. Proposers that got funded in Fund 8 might have new ideas that they want to execute for this Fund and submit new proposals as well. And there are some groups within the ecosystem that are already working with marketing and media that could benefit from this challenge being voted in. Based on all of this, I believe there is no risk associated to this challenge in case it is present in Fund 10 and the community will be it a success, therefore its feasibility is very high.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPIs presented in this challenge proposal are good to track the execution of the proposals submitted in this challenge. For example, number of multimedia projects and platforms, multilingual teams, and decentralized teams for different kinds of media. Although these number are good to track the execution, they are not ideal to track the success. There should be some KPIs related to engagement, outreach, visualizations, and other metrics related to the number of people who are interacting with this content overall, especially if they are shared in social media, which might be one of the main goals. These number will help to really track the success of the content created, more than tracking number of what was produced and its quality. Possibly, some of these outreach and marketing campaigns would add some links to different communities\u2019 platforms and projects where new members could be onboarded, and these links could be used to track interest as well. Overall, I believe the KPIs presented in the proposal are good but not enough, I would add some related to what was mentioned, and this way the success of the challenge could be properly verified.

Inserting Cardano in this types of initiatives can defineely help it to achieve its mission in a unique way (one of the F10 strageic goals), as it can drive Cardano adoption anywhere in the world, grow Cardano community globally and faciliate parnertships. Moreover, media are also used to set culture patterns (many countries have been doing that since, specially after TV and Cinema became popular). In this way, it is also possible shape local legislation and commercial standards, by having a true positive agenda and influencing the people. It's also a great opportunity to show the youngest, who usually learn more by medias,  what Cardano is and its wholw potential . In addition, this challenge was already funded in F8 and and proposal presents some nice funded projects in it, just as well a nice shot video. One extra note, it's also good to see that proposer incentivizes not only youtube, but all kinds of medias. This variety is important to broad total audience reached, as many are indeed not very keen on youtube.\nAll in all, this challenge would be very imporant and is totally aligned with Cardano goals in long term", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Considering this challenge was already funded in the past and projects are, at least currently, being successful, Cardano community can totally address that.  Moreover, after learning with the projects developed in F8, these funded proposers can bring even better projects. It's also possible to see in several proposals, members who are enthusiasts on Cardano and work on the media industry as well.

It will help the Cardano ecosystem in many ways. The quality content proposals funded and executed under this challenge will assist in spreading the Cardano message to the crypto & non-crypto audience. It can also help onboard people into Cardano, onboard them into Catalyst, fight mainstream crypto media bias, fight the fud spread by maximalists, etc. \n\nEverybody knows about the Charles whiteboard video, which educated many people and made them Cardano enthusiasts. I am also one of them. However, I know very few people can articulate like Charles. Still, suppose the quality media content is made regarding Cardano and let it be available on various platforms such as print media, YouTube, social media & other traditional platforms. In that case, we can expect more or less such transformation in peoples\u2019 lives by educating them about Cardano and opening their lives to the Cardano ecosystem.\nAs per the guidelines, the alignment rating is based on two metrics. i.e., Fund10 strategic goals and guiding questions for challenge setting.\n\nIt will help achieve the first strategic goal as it will educate people, especially crypto enthusiasts & developers, and let them know how they can contribute to Cardano. Hopefully, they will turn to Catalyst, submit proposals, and become part of the Cardano builders\u2019 community. It is not addressing the open-source goal. But as stated, the challenge will accelerate the growth of the developer and app ecosystem.\n\nFrom the point of the guiding questions, this challenge will likely engage the voters. If some video content is media specifically about the Catalyst and its voting, it will directly address this question. As it seems, most Cardano holders are not participating in Catalyst voting. If the content is created to highlight the importance of participating in Catalyst voting in funding the proposals, hopefully, it will increase voter participation. As stated above, this challenge will help bring in people and developers and thus act as a springboard for Cardano adoption. \n\nI am rating this challenge five as it addresses the strategic goals and guiding questions, excluding the open-source goal.

In Fund 8, the Cardano community submitted 34 proposals in this challenge, and nine proposals were only funded, being the small budget allotted to this challenge. We can expect similar enthusiasm from the community in this challenge in Fund10.

So far,  Cardano blockchain on the media is still not good, there are a lot of negative and inaccurate things about the Cardano on YouTube or the Media.

Therefore, I believe that if marketing and communication (through films, documentaries, and journals) are strengthened, the Cardano ecosystem will be widely known and will attract more developers.
