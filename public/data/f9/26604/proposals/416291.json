A good example of this is the NFT market in the last two years. I believe there is an important market share that can be changed, but I cannot understand how the author makes the connection that it is necessary to allocate 100% of the next funding to this challenge (the author assumes that the $12,800,000 ADA is not the entire budget, which is correct from my understanding and from what has been shared in the last TH).

Throughout history, art has been a catalyzing factor in driving development. Therefore, it is logical to produce artwork at the pinnacle of current day technological advancement. This challenge setting proposal adheres to most of the strategic goals set for this Fund.

I presume that if this community would go ahead and create such a machine, the difference would be that it probably would get created on OpenCog: Hyperon, which is a novelty. So the capacity is certainly there within the community, but I feel like this idea is not very feasible in terms of requested budget.

With decentralization as a northstar, this kind of \"all hands on deck\" thinking should be limited to existential crisis, where the nonexistence of the community hangs in the balance, and what we see on a daily basis in Catalyst is real people innovating in real time with real solutions.
