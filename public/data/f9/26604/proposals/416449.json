The challenge brief is only three lines long and the challenge description needs more information to better explain the purpose of the challenge and how the community can address the challenge.\n\nDue to the lack of information about the context and rationale of the challenge, there is no way to properly assess its importance and alignment in the Cardano mission. I Would recommend that the proposer further explain what types of business and social impact this challenge is intended to cause, what are the inspirations, what target problems does the challenge aim to solve? In the section that addresses the reason for the importance of the challenge is written \"Social impact and practical application are the golden keys to increasing the trust and popularity of Cardano Blockchain.\" This is a short and impactful definition, but it is important to go into more detail about the importance of the challenge proposed in the challenge brief.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "This is a new challenge and has never been previously funded on Catalyst.\n\nIf we consider the potential directions suggested in the challenge, I believe that the Cardano community has sufficient expertise, but the challenge brief description does not contain enough information for the challenge to be understandable and this should limit the feasibility.

For instance in previous rounds, there have been plenty of proposals that were touching social and business development initiatives, for instance food delivery to the needy for remaining food in restaurants, and such proposals give us a good indicator that community has the capacity to both have new businesses based on dApps and projects that will contribute to the social development and environment protection. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The success criteria is detailed out with countries and enterprises cooperating or partnering with Cardano as a sponsor of solutions to social development and business. For instance, a decentralized solution by IOG, Atala prism,  was offered and is now in use by the Ethiopian government. On the similar note, it would be great if dApps on Cardano that are being funded under this challenge settings are eventually used by the nation states or enterprises.  Additionally, the key metrics against which the proposals can be measured are detailed out. Therefore, I strongly agree that success criteria and suggested metrics are set correctly to measure progress in addressing the challenge.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2114", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 0, "ng": 12, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1459, "q0": "This challenge setting is well aligned with the strategic goals and seeks to foster adoption by engaging social networks, businesses and even countries to build on Cardano.

Despite this suggestion of a minor tweak, there is no doubt that this challenge proposal speaks to the mission and priorities of the Cardano community.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Social and business integration into the Cardano blockchain are very attainable goals and it is quite feasible to expect that this challenge setting can deliver these goods. Certainly the professional relationships between IOG and the Dish network can be leveraged to instill confidence to prospective partners and businesses interested in building on Cardano. The extensive network of governments, businesses and individuals working in this community provides a strong foundation that can be built on.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Most of the key metric indicators listed in this challenge can be quantified sufficiently to provide verification of progress and auditability of impact per dollar spent. Again, I would suggest replacing \u201cwant to apply Cardano Blockchain solutions\u201d with \u201capply Cardano Blockchain solutions\u201d, as the latter phrase can be quantifiably measured. Want is very hard to quantify and does not easily mesh into the KPI framework. My suggestion does not imply that there are insufficient metrics in place to verify progress, as clearly there are. It\u2019s just that some metrics have stronger analytics in which to evaluate success.

Focus more on that part and it will be a more unique challenge", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I am sure it will be possible to adress the challenge because we have all of people from business, socials and the other skills needed in the community.

It gets my interest up in two ways:  the first is that the Fund8 B2B-B2C challenge had HUGE participation for a first time challenge (12k+ total votes cast on 84 projects) and yet there is a lack of similar business oriented challenges in either Fund 9 or among the proposals for Fund 10.  Second is that this could be an interesting experiment to add a budget overlay to existing projects or proposals where they ask for funds not for a whole project but to supplement project budgets in order to add these collaborative impact elements.  \n\nIn regards to the Fund10 goals, this proposal primarily lines up with #3, real world solutions, as the Impact component combined with dedicated Business use cases should reliably generate real world solution ideas from proposers.  There is also the possibility of some alignment with #4, improving process and tooling for people, since the collaborative element of partnerships between businesses would create as a side effect the data that comes from multiple perspectives on a project, and in my experience, this almost always leads to improved UX.\n\nBecause the team has provided some relevant links to the fund 10 goals, I believe there is a good basis for alignment here, but due to the lack of details specific to fund goals, I am reducing the score to 4 stars for alignment.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It seems to be well within the scope of the community to address the issues presented here, and the Brief does a good job of describing what kinds of proposals and ideas would fit under this challenge setting.  In particular the CRM, ERP type proposals are an area that has been highly overlooked to date in Catalyst and it is good that they were singled out for attention here.\n\nThe budget is in an odd place:  as a lot of the ideas presented in this challenge are effectively enterprise level solutions, the amount seems too low (The Fund 8 B2B challenge was over subscribed by almost $5m in approved proposals).  On the other hand as an experimental tangent relating impact to business adoption and use, it is more suitable and perhaps even a bit too high until more data has been gathered around use and support of a challenge like this.  In the end I think they set the budget reasonably for reaching the type of enterprise proposers or integrations envisioned, while not excising a whole lot of scope from the overall fund 10 budget.\n\nBecause of this reasonable budget and the support and guidance provided for proposers to bring ideas into the challenge, I think it merits a full 5 stars for Feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The included metrics give perhaps the best insight into the potential of the challenge, by describing not a measurement of impact, but how well a project has increased its connection to its region or community, or how many collaborative relationships have been set up between enterprises or enterprises and Cardano.  This is one reason I feel that if this challenge isn't funded (or even if it is) the proposing team may want to re-engineer it to target specifically budget-addons for other projects in order to adopt these collaborative partnerships and impact characteristics to their roadmaps and outcomes.\n\nBecause the team has provided 7 solid metrics for measuring success and supporting proposers in setting realistic and actionable objectives, I believe this proposal warrants a full 5 stars for verifiability.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Dear PA, \nThanks for your valuable comments.\nThank you so much."}, {"id": 5601, "q0": "This proposed challenge setting is very broad and covers countries and enterprises as possible Cardano partners across a wide range of business and blockchain applications and even impact and social projects. While this is without doubt a possible direction for Cardano, and a close fit with the strategic goal \"build real-world solutions based on the Cardano blockchain\" I do not consider it a priority to stand on its own as a challenge setting. Allocating half a million ADA out of 12.8M for such a broad, almost all-encompassing set of possible directions in my humble opinion \"wastes\" the opportunity of the community to set a more narrowly defined objective, for example targeting governance, improving vulnerabilities in the current technology stack, increasing users from a particular region considered strategically important or neglected and so on. For Fund-10, it would have been preferable to focus on either governance and improving Catalyst as tool for driving community engagement and decentralization away from IOHK, or add to tooling and developer capabilities for upcoming improvements to smart contracts (Vasil CIPs, Marlowe) and SSI/DID (Atala PRISM).", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The community does have the capacity to address this challenge, as it covers almost any possible aspect of blockchain use cases that drive Cardano adoption as long as it involves a third party, either governments, businesses, or consumers. The problem that we have often seen in previously funded proposals interacting with governments and companies is that crypto is often seen as a generous partner, where Cardano Treasury funds are taken for granted as a windfall, rather than an equal partner for future growth and investment opportunity. I would love to see the opposite - relationships where the other party (businesses, government) have the money, and we bring the tech. To achieve this hopeful vision of Catalyst, I do not think that this challenge setting is right.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I really like the last performance metric \"Increase additional funding from other sources to fund actual business and social development projects\" as this would be a big step forward for Project Catalyst - not just shower money on the partners we work with, but create mutual relationships where additional funding can be tapped into. Most of the other metrics provided are too easy to tick off, and might encourage the status quo - number of projects, number of tools - which sounds a bit like quantity instead of quality. Maybe some other KPI like Cardano mentioned in national government tender documents, companies accepting ADA as payment, number of unbanked provided with DID and the list goes on could helped to show the specific area of improvement targeted by this challenge.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2720", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6013, "q0": "The proposal matches the requirements set out in the Challenge Setting. I think that setting up this challenge in Fund10 is absolutely necessary because of its impact on the ecosystem. Proposals around business or business development are always of interest to the community. Proof at Fund8 we have the Business Solutions challenge (B2B & B2C) and it has attracted up to 84 proposals submitted to Catalyst with different business solutions applying Cardano blockchain technology to products or processes . And so if this proposal is set up as a challenge in Fund10, I am fully convinced that it will attract a large number of proposals for solutions that are not inferior to Fund8.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I believe that the Catalyst community will effectively solve this challenge. As blockchains are gradually present in every aspect of life, It create countless opportunities to exploit and implement business ideas based on business ideas on it so we don't have to worry that we are short of ideas for funding.

One that I think will be difficult to measure is the increase in posts about projects or events sponsored by Cardano. I think (my personal opinion) is that it will be difficult for the proposer to gather data because we have thousands of large and small newspapers and no tools to make statistics on the content and those newspapers contain the content we are looking for. Besides, I want to add one more criterion to measure it: % growth in mainnet activities brought about by business solutions. Overall, the criteria given here are good and closely related, so I give a score of 5.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2771", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6323, "q0": "This challenge wants to support real business and social development initiatives on the Cardano blockchain. Social development is essential as the world suffers from various challenges such as climate change, poverty, inequality, etc. Also, we are running short of achieving the UN-adopted sustainable goals by 2030. On the other hand, the focus on real business solutions is required to push for the real-world utility of the Cardano blockchain and achieve greater adoption worldwide.\n\nBoth focus areas of this challenge will help onboard capable people, groups, and businesses who want to build solutions and contribute to the Cardano ecosystem. Thus it will enhance the growth of Cardano's DApps and Developer ecosystem. In this way, this challenge helps achieve two of the strategic goals of challenge setting.\n\nFrom the perspective of the guiding questions, this challenge likely attracts a good number of votes, considering the good voting turnover for the 'Business Solutions' challenge's proposals for Fund 8. Moreover, this challenge attempts to bring businesses onto Cardano and address social goals. Therefore, it will have a good impact and become a springboard for Cardano adoption.

If some proposers have big budget requirements, they can submit their proposals under other challenges based on the other characteristics of their proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The metrics stated in the challenge help measure the success of the challenge. Few metrics will help evaluate proposals' success. But the author did not mention the metrics required to track/audit the progress of the 'proposals' while under execution.
