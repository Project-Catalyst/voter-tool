Now, whether that translates to higher ROI or not is unknown, but what I can see browsing through the completed projects list (https://dynamicstrategies.io/docs/catalyst-delivered-projects/) is that internal development and infrastructure is trumping general product development through Catalyst at an almost 3 to 1 rate, dollar for dollar.\n\nAgain, this doesn't mean this is the more valuable category (the biggest dapps launched on Cardano have not gone through Catalyst) but that Catalyst seems well suited to the needs of its Cardano developer community, and that it is playing a critical role in essential back end technology, which is a tide that raises all boats.  As such it is great to see it receive not only dedicated space within the Categories experiment from (pace) but also that the community budget weighting vote saw fit to make it equitable with the broader \"Products and Integrations\" category ($3m)\n\nGiven that the vast majority of these projects are opensource and that they directly aid in getting contributors up and running to participate in developing Cardano, the alignment with the Fund10 mission statements is very strong.  5 stars for alignment.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "They have included an extremely thorough (but non-exhaustive) list of proposal types that are expected to suit this category, and frankly, it covers everything I have ever seen under this heading, including giving good examples of what each type entails.\n\nThe budget, especially when contrasted with past iterations (we have to remember, though, this subsumes multiple technical challenges that are sometimes there, sometimes not) and then further contrasted with its partner categories in this (pace) experiment, it does seem high (though I hope my Alignment note helps establish some context there).  In the IOG paper on treasuries (https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/435.pdf) this is one of the core categories mentioned as an area where a blockchain accrues risk to sustainability if it is un- or underfunded, so that context may help balance any concern about how reasonable the budget is.\n\nBecause this kind of internal development is within the needs and capacity of the community to execute, and because the community has a proven track record of delivering on the proposals submitted, I believe the budget is on point and the challenge setting is fully feasible.  5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is an extensive list of metrics that focuses primarily on total counts (of users, repos, instances, etc.) and scalability, which is indeed a core concern for any infrastructure development since the Shelley hard fork.  They also do a good job of frequently highlighting the role of SPOs, which is a tactical metric that has been left on autopilot since dexes and NFTs became the fashion, but which must always be iterating and developing as the backbone of the whole protocol.  So I appreciate the specific SPO related metrics that were included here.\n\nAs always, I look for specific metrics and KPIs that help to track successful alignment with the Fund 10 mission statements.  This is more than asking how many opensource repos a project has (though this is a start).  Measuring progress is one thing, but measuring actual success (ROI) requires a much more holistic view of a project and its meaning within the larger ecosystem, and typically, alignment with ecosystem goals are the shortcut we take to get to that understanding.  I want to suggest both a KPI that would be useful to developers in this category as well as a broader perspective for how to approach a measure of quality and ROI.\n\nThe KPI is (average issue handle time) and can help voters gauge a teams time on task and the impact of that time, in order to help prioritize one vote over another.  The best way to measure this is to track how many tasks your team completes within a certain amount of time.  Tracking this on a weekly or bi-weekly basis works well, and with this data, you can make better decisions about assigning and implementing new projects.\n\nFinally, software projects, especially SMEs should be implementing some kind of self reporting protocol such as the one available through this opensource repo (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/fourkeys).  The ability to ask our developer ecosystem to standardize their approach to both velocity and stability in development will help greatly to start establishing standards for rep and reliability within the network.  This is an area that challenge teams can be helping with.\n\nWhile I would have liked to have seen more success metrics, opensource software development does tend to be more straightforward, and the teams included KPIs just barely offer enough coverage there for me not to mark the proposal down.  That the rest of the verifiability criteria are met or exceeded, I believe this proposal merits a full 5 stars.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3351, "q0": "Based on the information provided in this challenge setting proposal, I believe that it completely addresses all four fund 9 strategic goals. Firstly, the challenge setting will do a great job at preparing a group of people to make contributions to the ecosystem as well as improve tooling to support human processes in Catalyst (strategic goals 1 and 4). The proposal was so thoroughly written (thorough is an understatement) that it would be perfectly clear to any proposer what the guidelines are and how they can create a proposal to fit in the challenge setting. There were many examples of projects that future proposers could take on, allowing for people to take the suggested sub-categories of the challenge setting and make their own solutions and ideas. Additionally, the goal of the challenge setting is to make the onboarding process for developers and new SPOs simple and easy. The tooling created from proposals in this challenge setting will do exactly that. But the most important part of this challenge setting, in my opinion, are the development tools. The critical part of building Cardano is making the building environment better, more friendly, and more accessible to a wider audience. Based on the listed potential proposal ideas that can be submitted, I think that this goal will be met. There are also other very important proposals that can also fall under this challenge setting, according to the proposers: scalability and research solutions, technical standards, blockchain interoperability, and research and development. I could go into much more depth as to why each of these categories are important for Cardano, but for the sake of length, I will refrain from doing so. But they are all important parts of addressing the first strategic goal for fund 9 because they list out interpretations for proposals under development and infrastructure that can encourage participation from more people. \n\nAs for the second strategic goal (building open-source ecosystem and onboarding new developers), this challenge setting does exactly that because it encourages proposers to make tools for developers, which will then encourage developers to come into the ecosystem. It is a bit of a self-perpetuating loop where more projects that improve the open-source ecosystem will lead to more developers coming into the ecosystem. I also really like that the proposers of this challenge setting thought to include some \u201cconsiderations for proposers\u201d at the bottom of the challenge setting. These metrics, such as encouraging proposals under this challenge to be open-source, are exactly what the second strategic goal is about.\n\nLastly, this challenge setting addresses the third strategic goal (build real-world solutions on the Cardano blockchain) through all the potential proposals that can be submitted. For example, safe, scalable blockchain interoperability, alone, can bring a whole new world of real-world use to Cardano. If certain systems or concepts only currently exist on other blockchains, allowing for connections to those other blockchains could actually benefit the Cardano ecosystem by bringing in new users and opening doors for new functionality on Cardano. I am specifically thinking about DeFi, but there are many other applications of cross-chain infrastructure. Also, data oracles address the third strategic goal because they quite literally bring in information from the outside world onto the blockchain. As a result, data oracles can allow for the creation of real-world solutions since they allow for the data of the real world to exist on the blockchain. These are just a few examples of the great solutions the challenge setting has for each strategic goal. I think that the proposal addressed every point I looked for with regards to the 4 strategic goals. (score given: 5)\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Based on my knowledge of past funds and the potential of the future, I believe that the Cardano community has the capacity to address this challenge setting. Since this challenge setting is so broad \u2013 covering a whole wide range of concepts related to development and infrastructure \u2013 it can be easily taken up by a large group of Cardano community members/developers. In fund 8, there were over 400 proposals in categories that could be encompassed by this singular challenge setting. With such a huge amount of proposals (not all of which were funded), I can safely say that the Cardano community will be able to address this challenge setting. There is always a need for the creation of more standards, resources, and documentation because Cardano is still in a relatively young stage of development. Having this challenge setting to boost the foundation of Cardano will greatly by setting up the future of developers for success. Once the framework for Cardano development has been achieved, then even more developers will see the potential of the Cardano ecosystem for their own projects. \n\nSince this challenge setting is so widely encompassing, I think that the budget requested is completely reasonable. In the past, there might be 3-4 different challenge settings that have components that are a part of this singular challenge setting, so 2,925,000 ADA allocated towards development/infrastructure make sense. Also, development and infrastructure projects take a lot of resources and manpower, so I expect that higher budget proposals will be in this challenge setting, which requires a higher budget for this challenge. (score given: 5)\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The challenge setting proposal lists metrics of success for every single focus area. For example, node/SPO tools and software, Plutus and IELE tools and software, and native asset tools and software all have metrics about the amount of adoption by other projects, scalability, and security or cost improvements. These metrics are both specific and broad at the same time because they allow for future proposers to have some leeway in determining how their proposals can address the challenge setting and provide good KPIs. The way the metrics were listed in this challenge setting are constructive for proposers, rather than constricting \u2013 meaning that proposers have the flexibility to address KPIs as they see fit, instead of being forced to make all their projects check certain boxes. There are also some good KPIs provided for other focus areas, such as total transactions achievable for scalability and increased number of applications used between different blockchains for interoperability. All of the metrics of success mentioned for future proposals are easily traceable from the point-of-view of the Cardano community because there are usually concrete numbers that can be associated with them. For example, the number of new quality tools for developers, the number of new quality standards created, etc, that arise from this challenge setting are all things that any Cardano community member can look up and find an answer to.\n\nDue to the broader nature of the metrics of success, this challenge setting should be able to create healthy competition between proposals because every proposer has the flexibility to address the challenge setting as they see fit. The possibilities are quite large, which will lead to many new projects being developed. Each project will be different and provide a unique benefit to the community as a whole. Since this challenge setting proposal provided a thorough list of key metrics for success, I can give this section a 5 (score given: 5)\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2457", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 7990, "q0": "Development and infrastructure is a funding category that PACE intends to include. Developers have a huge need for tools and software to build and scale simple applications and integrations on the Cardano blockchain. This challenge is critical to getting new developers on board Cardano. We need to make sure there are enough tools available to get new talent on board. By creating new tools, I am convinced that with the right choice of tools we can get new people on board from other platforms. This challenge is linked to the strategic objectives of Fund 9. Providing innovative tools will ensure that a better Cardano infrastructure is developed.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "PACE chose to include this topic as a funding category. By working in this way there will already be an immense cost saving of 80 percent. This proposal is certainly feasible to implement.

PACE has included a very comprehensive plan that will be used for all 7 funding categories. Working in this way will make it possible to work much more efficiently.

Another huge advantage is that the submitter has already foreseen different parts depending on what kind of subject it has to do with this category.

In essence, they ask for the entire funding available in F10, and offer a unique distribution along several categories which have been previously selected by the community through a complex mechanism, culminating with an open vote for whomever wanted to take part. Any voter entirely supporting their approach should thus vote for the encompassing \u201cFunding Categories Full Fund\u201d. If, however, one feels that the approach goes a bit too far, this proposal is simply one piece of PACE\u2019s puzzle. \n\nThis fresh alternative to the classical challenge setting process overcomes many downsides (low entry barriers for malicious actors, unilateral budget weighting, limited understanding of challenge teams, suboptimal time consumption, etc.) and aims to be more efficient, flexible, scalable as well as legitimate. Let\u2019s see if it also has the capacity to deliver on of the strategic goals from Fund 9. \n\nCan it help prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem? Yes it can, with limitations perhaps. It\u2019s important to note that it will focus on providing funding to development teams across mainly infrastructure proposals: node and SPO tools, Plutus tools, data oracles, scalability research, technical standards, etc. The challenge casts a fairly wide net and is rather broad, albeit technical by nature. Are there groups willing and able to rise up to the challenge? Such groups are already present in the Catalyst scene, and the need for funding will only increase in the future - look only at the increasing competition from the previous two rounds, and especially the 5.6X competition within F9\u2019s Developer ecosystem challenge (budget 1 million USD). Even if this challenge basically triples that, keeping the demand constant for the next round would still leave us with almost 2X competition, which is not amazing, but still decent. \n\nCan it turn Cardano into an open source project and attract developers? I would argue that attracting developers is a clear yes, since it is by definition of the most hard-core and technically competent developers. Is this also the case for open-source projects? Again, by definition yes, since it\u2019s hard to imagine that any team would want to build closed source tools within this infrastructure area where the peer pressure to deliver quality open source tools is probably very high.\n\nCan it help build real-world solutions based on the Cardano? Not directly, but it can definitely increase the infrastructure\u2019s resilience and long term sustainability of the ecosystem. To better understand the indirect effects let\u2019s try to come up with a more down to earth analogy. Can building a highway between two major cities increase the supply of housing in the area? Of course, not directly, but it can allow for a quicker transportation of raw material, better movement of labor, new opportunities, etc. I hope my argument is sufficiently clear.  \n\n \nCan this challenge improve tooling to support human processes in Catalyst? To a lesser extent I dare to argue, since this challenge will not be focused on the Catalyst ecosystem. This does not imply however that projects that improve the human processes will not be present, I merely say that their presence will be the exception rather than the rule. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Does the Cardano community have the capacity to address this challenge? Its capacity to address this challenge is undeniable. The strongest argument is the fact that Catalyst has already been running for quite some rounds, the last two of which being fully-fledged in terms of overall budget, and we have seen a consistent, and increasing, number of teams and proposals sprouting within it, across all previous challenges. Again, F9 alone has 5.6X competition within F9\u2019s Developer ecosystem challenge (budget 1 million USD). \n\nIs the budget realistic and reflecting the requirements of the challenge? In this case, the budget has been established following a vote open to all community members, secured by a few gatekeepers that anonymised voters identity and the vote itself, thus ensuring a high level of trust as well as legitimacy. And the results of this vote have been transposed into the budgetary splits present in the challenge. Are the amounts realistic? The answer to this will definitely be clear post-factum, if we notice enough implementation capacity from the community in terms of sufficient projects, sufficient competition within each category as well as a general good quality of the projects submitted. But the budget is close to a wisdom-of-the-crowd solution, so there has to be merit behind it. The budget is almost three times the one in the current round, where competition is sufficiently high. So the budget is definitely sufficient, and realistic, with limited risks that the community will not come up with excellent proposals to fill the supply.  ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "To assess the challenge\u2019s verifiability, we go one more time through the process of turning the verifiability statement from the guide into a fundamental question and answer it:  \n\n(1) Is the challenge well scoped in defining the measures of success? \nThe challenge is very well scoped in terms of defining the types of accepted proposals. We have a multitude of infrastructure projects included, ranging from node and SPO tools, Plutus tools, data oracles, scalability research, technical standards, etc.\n\nDefining objectives is also possible, since the challenge is defining a very wide range of performance indicators for each of the possible types of projects. They revolve around adoption measures, scalability, security and cost improvements, but I can\u2019t say they are very concrete. This task is of course very complex for instance in the case of scalability, where, trying to move away from merely counting transactions per second, having a quantifiable way of measuring throughput is no easy feat. \n\n(2) Can the challenge drive healthy competition between proposals?\nThe moderately broad scope of the challenge also implies a healthy potential for competition because this is easier achievable within a clear market segment like we have here. I also dare to say that competition is not perhaps a very meaningful angle to analyze this challenge. Take for instance standard setting, when collaboration between market players rather than competition is bound to bring the most impact into the space, for instance through wide range adherence to a certain standard instead of rupturing the market along several ones. \n\nFrom my point of view, it passes with flying colors all of the checklists from the guide, is clear and leaves no room for interpretation.

As this is the new language, creating DApps and other products on Cardano becomes difficult. However, with the inception of the Plutus pioneer program and other supporting tools & resources such as Cardano stack exchange, and Gimbalabs, this has been overcome to a certain extent.

I have a degree in engineering though I have very minimal education and training in computer science and programming so learning these stuffs are not easy for me and require much time and effort to success. Cardano community itself is very helpful in general but I can sense that Cardano still has some way to go before becoming the go-to blockchain for everyone to build on and use due to the current technical barrier is still quite high to promote and support mass adoption.\nI realized that Cardano both had come a very long way since Byron era when people just called it a wallet then we got staking then came native assets enabling NFT then just recently smart contracts and still have quite a journey to go by completing two more eras in our roadmap. If we to consider Cardano as a nation-state or country, for a country to be able to grow and prosper they need to have a good foundational, infrastructure to attract as many and as brilliant builders possible to help them develop the country.

The Cardano ecosystem is still very young and the elements of infrastructure are still very few.

When looking at Cardano, those infrastructures are very little or incomplete.\nWithout these platforms, it will be a long time before developers can quickly build a decentralized application at a low cost.

A small example to make my point clearer:\n\nStarkware, a company responsible for developing a second layer solution on Ethereum, received funding of $100M USD in May this year.\n\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/starkware-nets-100m-as-investors-bank-on-layer-2-success\n\nMy point is that without the support of VCs and grants from private companies, Catalyst becomes much more important for the development of core infrastructure, which is the primary concept of this challenge.\n\nIn addition to the points mentioned, this challenge is also directly aligned with items 1, 2 and 3 of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals, which makes its importance more evident in Cardano's mission at this time.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The topic addressed in this challenge has already been funded by Catalyst since Fund2. Challenges dedicated to improving the developer ecosystem have been present in all Funds (since Fund2) and community groups such as dcSpark, 5 Binaries and Gimbalabs, just to name a few, have created countless solutions for improvements in tooling, education, infrastructure, CIPs , among other improvements, so there is demand and evidence that the Cardano community has the capacity to create proposals in quantity and quality and increase the development of solutions related to the theme of this challenge.\n\nIn Fund 7, there was a drastic reduction in the budget dedicated to improvements to the developer ecosystem, the community responded negatively on social media, a sign that the community values \u200b\u200bthis topic very much. In Fund 8, we had two challenges dedicated to the developer ecosystem; Open Source Development Ecosystem and Developer Ecosystem. If we add both budgets together, the total amount available was $2.2M USD and even with a relatively high combined budget, the funds requested in the proposals was about 3x greater than the available budget (which is slightly below the competitive average challenges, but considering the budget much higher than average becomes a relevant indicator).\n\nConsidering that this challenge has a larger scope and will also allow for improvements to node operation, improvements to SPOs and solutions for scalability, the defined budget seems appropriate.\n\nThe budget setting at 2.92M ADA was decided by a vote, where more than 50 people decided on the allocation of resources to the Development & Infrastructure niche, so there has already been a validation process reflecting the vision of the community.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The items below are the sub-themes suggested as categories within the scope of this challenge. \n\n-Node & SPO tools & software\n-Plutus and IELE tools & software\n-Native asset tools & software\n-Data oracles, indexers & explorers\n-Scalability research & solutions -\n-Technical documentation & education\n-Technical standards\n-Blockchain interoperability\n-Research & development\n\nEach of the sub-themes above has several key metrics for evaluation, according to each sub-theme of the proposals that can be submitted, this facilitates greater precision in the evaluation of outcomes in different areas. I consider that the subdivision of metric keys into sub-themes is important, because due to the scope of the challenge being wide, a wide variety of proposals can be submitted and without detailed items for verification of success for each sub-theme, the outcomes of this challenge could be inconclusive.\n\nMy only caveat was the absence of a definition of success/key metrics associated with time, as without this it is difficult to measure the success of outcomes.

SPOs, and Open Source Developer Ecosystem.\nIt's good to see that PACE adjusted this challenge a bit since the last fund to give it a more global spectrum by focusing more on the tools in global.

This is why it has been present in past funds in the form of challenges and individual proposals, for which funds have been awarded. From my perspective, I think that this should be an ongoing challenge within catalyst. For this reason I believe it is a wise thing that PACE has assigned an exclusive category for the associated projects. With the proliferation of proposals of these types, we will eventually be able to develop more and more tools that will support developers and SPOs in achieving their goals. These tools will help them create high quality code that is also user friendly. As a side benefit, by having this category, we will be able to give a place to the entire Cardano research community that already exists as well as open up the door for new researchers interested in investigating the topics related to this challenge to participate. As I have explained, I see this challenge setting completely aligned with Cardano's mission. Finally, when contrasted with the strategic goals for the next fund, at least 2 of them are aligned directly with the next fund's strategy, which is more than sufficient.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Although the topic of community capacity may be open to interpretation, I believe a good approach is to examine the past community response to proposals and budget requests. During fund 7, for example, we had two challenges related to SPO development, for which 13 proposals were funded for a total of approximately US$800,000. In addition, more than US$800K has been allocated to individual proposals in various challenges related to libraries, SDKs, among others. Last but not least, I was able to locate an allocation of more than US$300K for proposals seeking funding for scalability and cross-chain research. Another way to determine whether the allocated budget is adequate is to compare it with challenges that might be included in this category. For instance, Fund 8 included three challenges that fall under this category, namely \"Open Standards & Interoperability\", \"Open Source Developer Ecosystem\", and \"Developer Ecosystem\", and approximately US$2.8 million has been allotted for proposals within these challenges, which is in line with the budget allocated for the next challenge. This data allows me to assign a score of 5.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "PACE presents a number of metrics which are specific to the types of proposals that are expected to be included in this challenge category.

This challenge category, unlike OSDE (open source dev ecosystem) and Developer ecosystem, is focusing also on increasing the quality and number of tools that will directly help  SPOs, Plutus or native asset development. \n\nThis challenge seems to be the first initiative coming as a part of  \u201cFunding categories\u201d initiative and hence comes up as more specific yet broader use cases that would fit under this challenge. As an example in the previous round Orbix for layer 2 scalability was proposed under OSDE challenge, but since their ask was of 1 Million did impact their funding abilities. This challenge, via using new Funding categories proposals, could potentially resolve such many issues by redirecting funds in a more efficient manner. \n\nNevertheless, I see a lot of overlap between this, OSDE and developer ecosystem challenges, therefore in my opinion it would have been nice if these challenge teams could have communicated among each other and see the possibility of having less overlap OR just merge their challenge teams to come up only with this proposal. For instance, having a 5 million total budget.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I strongly agree that the catalyst community has the capacity to address the challenge.

For example, the creation of tools to support SPOs, that are related to Plutus and IELE, oracles, solutions for scalability and more. This is a very technical challenge, but it is well aligned with Cardano\u2019s mission for Fund10 goals of turning Cardano into an open-source project, since it is mentioned in the proposal that open-source proposals should be considered and would be better received by the community; attracting more developers to the ecosystem, since these tools and more infrastructure will help them build on Cardano; and the proposers submitted here will indirectly facilitate the creation of real-world solutions based on Cardano.

The community was always able to come up with very good projects and ideas to be submitted here, and many of the funded projects were already delivered. The budget requested this time, which is almost 3M ADA, might be higher than the previous requested budgets, although it is likely that ADA price will be below $1 when results are tallied and the budget for this challenge will probably be very similar to the previous funds.

For example, increase the quality of tools and software developed through this challenge, increase Cardano\u2019s scalability due to this challenge, and increase the quality of standards. This can be subjectively assessed but some definitions must be made in advance. It would be good to track the number of proposed, funded and successfully completed proposal related to different areas, for example, relates to SPOs, Plutus, oracles, scalability, education, standards, interoperability, etc. This way, the community could better understand what areas are being benefited the most by this challenge and give some insights of what is lacking, so future proposers could try to address the issues that are currently not being tackled by already funded proposers. Since this is a very broad challenge, this could help with coordination of efforts and avoid spending Catalyst funds in overlapping solutions, increasing cooperation instead of competition.

Of those hundreds, majority are from the western hemisphere. If we want to have wider/global adoption, as this Category suggest, more tool and infrastructure to help onboarding should be set-up and should be our highest priority. Marlowe classes should also be accelerated and made even more inclusive not specific only towards financial solutions.\n\nSecond, the concept of this Challenge Setting is to become a fix Category which again is a must.

In the \u2018Full Fund\u2019 proposal they have created seven all inclusive categories to divide the challenge into, rather than individual challenge setting briefs. The detail, effort and thought gone into the main proposal is astounding, so instead of risking its disapproval if it doesn\u2019t get the highest possible votes, I think the proposers are hedging their bets by putting each of the 7 categories as separate challenge proposals. I believe this is a relevant detail when examining this proposal as the categories or parts they have developed do indeed cover all of the Cardano Catalyst strategic goals, however, individual categories, such as this proposal do not necessarily achieve all the goals stated.\n\nDiving into this specific category as its own challenge setting proposal, there is a lot of thought, detail and explanation provided to align this project with specific Cardano Catalyst goals and the overall mission of Cardano. Overwhelmingly this proposal supports the third of the fund challenge setting strategic goals, devising authentic solutions on Cardano blockchain. The challenge question the proposers have stated reiterates this goal with reference to making research, tools and software so that it\u2019s easier to use Cardano blockchain to build and scale projects. \n\nThe proposers suggest an extensive, thought not exhaustive, list of types of proposals that could successfully qualify for this proposal. From developmental tools, scripts, libraries and SDKs; that may support node & SPO tools, Plutus and IELE; through to native asset tools, data oracles and blockchain interoperability. Included as an important side note within the considerations for future proposers, is that although it\u2019s not necessary, there is a goal of working towards open sourcing projects within the Cardano ecosystem. The second key strategic goals listed for fund challenge setting mentions turning Cardano into an open source project. I\u2019d like to see more stipulation or encouragement within this category for proposers to develop and implement solutions that can be then shared, altered and replicated through open sourcing. However, projects that are not yet open sourced yet still greatly benefit the wider ecosystem need to be included within this \u2018Development & Infrastructure\u2019 category, so I see that they can not directly specify that proposals need to be open source.\n\nOverall, the proposers from the PACE team provide detailed information about this category of funding and I rate their proposal 5 stars for alignment with the strategic goals.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "When analyzing this fund challenge setting proposal there are no previous challenges that exactly correlate to this challenge proposal, however, due to its broad spectrum many aspects from previous successful challenge rounds are evident.

Scouring Fund 8 as well, the particular \u2018Open Source Development\u2019 challenge had several successful quality proposals that could address this challenge. I believe the Catalyst community has the resources in place to address this challenge successfully, mainly from the general outlook of this proposal, but also in turn looking at the detail of historically successful proposals.\n\nIn addition to the community\u2019s capacity, I believe the community voted budget allocation speaks largely to the feasibility of this project. When creating this multi-category proposal, the PACE team encouraged the Cardano voting community to choose which categories they foresaw as most important for the next round of challenges. (See more details at https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/catalyst-funding-categories/budget-weighting-votes/fund-9, if you want a more comprehensive explanation.) This challenge category was voted second most important with a budget allocation of 2,925,000ADA, just behind the Products & Integrations category. The priority that the community has placed on this challenge area is evident from that vote, with more than 22% of the total fund budget going towards this category alone. Showing this value early on, hopefully will motivate and incentivize contributors to create solutions within the future \u2018Development & Infrastructure\u2019 for Cardano Catalyst.\n\nOverall, I can clearly see the value and capacity that the community has to complete proposals and projects within the framing of this fund setting challenge proposal.

Having this possible list of success criteria, highly detailed, heavily supports the future proposers to think of and list many ways beyond their initial thoughts as to how they project can be successful. This in turn leads to better planned projects, with appropriate success criteria than can be effectively observed and recorded.\n\nThe other two criteria involve solutions to the scalability of Cardano and the overall quality being delivered within the Cardano ecosystem. Although not as obvious to measure as a \u2018new\u2019 development or pieces of infrastructure, these outcomes can be reported on. With suggested baseline data provided by proposers, and documentation along the way, it will be easy for the community to see and measure the success of the proposals. This supporting detail from the proposers will help them to write effective proposals, and in turn, help the PAs, VPAs and votes effectively audit and decide on proposals.\n\nOverall, I believe that this Fund 10 challenge setting proposal is verifiable and the proposers have clearly explained how this can be achieved.
