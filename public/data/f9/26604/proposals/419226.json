There is also the issue of authoritarian governments and exchange controls, where citizens are prohibited from trading local currency for currencies of other countries such as the dollar. At this point cryptocurrencies have been a lifesaver for many to maintain their financial wealth and/or not starve to death (literally).\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/opinion/sunday/venezuela-bitcoin-inflation-cryptocurrencies.html\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/23/axie-infinity-finds-ready-players-in-hyperinflation-racked-venezuela/\n\nRegarding unbanked people, LATAM does not have as bad a scenario as there is in Africa, but it is still very promising for leapfroging blockchain-based financial solutions in more precarious communities.\n\nhttps://medium.com/the-capital/the-unbanked-and-financially-excluded-ba55805dbb1c\n\nhttps://insights.invyo.io/latam/fintech-corner/why-the-banking-industry-should-bet-on-latam/\n\nThis challenge is in line with items 1, 2 and 3 of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals.\n\nDue to the similarity between the \"Cardano support for Latin America\" \u200b\u200band \"Gron Latin America, Grown Cardano\" challenges my assessments will have a higher similarity level.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "We've had a challenge aimed at the Latam community before in Fund 7 of Catalyst, called \"Grow Latin America, Grown Cardano\". Fund7's \"Grown Latin America, Grown Cardano\" challenge had an available budget of $500,000 USD and the total requested was around $2.5M, so a moderate available funds/required funds ratio. If all approved proposals were funded the budget would need to be around $1.5M USD. The demand observed in this challenge indicates a significant demand from the Cardano community for challenges in LATAM, which is a positive indicator for the feasibility and capacity of the community to address the challenge.\n\nCardano's LATAM community is also growing and participating more in project development, a few months ago LATAM TownHall was started and has helped to expand the LATAM NO Catalyst community as well.\n\nOn the other hand this challenge this challenge (\"Cardano support for Latin America\") has a large overlap area (almost identical) with the challenge \"Grown Latin America, Grow Cardano\" whose required budget is $1M ADA.\n\nIt is important for voters to keep this in mind, as if these two challenges become funded, there will be a budget of around $2.1M ADA, around 16% of the total Fund 10 budget for proposals in LATAM, which I see as a certain imbalance in relation to other Catalyst challenges. This rationale is for the voters' consideration only and will not influence the score I am assigning to this proposal, as each challenge setting must be evaluated on its own merits. Challenge setting overlaps are a problem in Catalyst as they can cause major fund imbalance in certain areas and I would recommend that proposers pay attention to this and try to collaborate with other proposers to set an appropriate joint budget and avoid redundancy in challenge settings.\n\nDue to the similarity between the \"Cardano support for Latin America\" \u200b\u200band \"Gron Latin America, Grown Cardano\" challenges my assessments will have a higher similarity level.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The definition of success is a little subjective. Forming broad groups of people who contribute to LATAM is a positive thing, but not from the notion of magnitude or time for this definition of success to be achieved. I would recommend setting a more precise goal and at least a time frame so that the outcome of the challenge is more measurable.\n\nThe Guiding Questions were well articulated and help to give a perspective of what is expected of this challenge setting and the proposals it allows.\n\nThe proposed key metrics are reasonable and help to identify important points for improvement caused by the challenge in the LATAM community, but there are no time frames for measuring these metrics over time.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2048", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 8, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3358, "q0": "Based on the challenge setting proposal, I believe that it addresses the 4 strategic goals for fund 9. The challenge setting addresses the first strategic goal (prepare people able to make contributions to the Cardano ecosystem) by encouraging members of the LATAM community to make proposals that will benefit their communities. The proposers listed many guiding questions that can help future proposers develop their proposal ideas. For example, one of the questions is about increasing the number of users coming into the Cardano ecosystem from outside of the blockchain space. There were also some potential directions included in the proposal, which I think are a very good idea because it provides more guidance: better tools for fiat to ADA and reverse conversions in Latin American currencies as well as creation of more hubs.\n\nThe challenge setting addresses the second strategic goal (build an open-source ecosystem and attract more developers) by bringing in new LATAM developers who will build the projects. Having a challenge setting is very helpful and encouraging for developers because it shows that there is a priority for their work. However, the proposers of this challenge setting did not provide any insight into how the challenge would promote an open-source ecosystem. This information could have been provided to make the proposal align even better with the second strategic goal. I understand that this challenge is mainly targeting community hubs which don't necessarily require the open-source documentation, but it would still have been worth mentioning for other products developed under this challenge setting. \n\nThe proposal addresses the third strategic goal (build real-world solutions on Cardano) by promoting the development of community hubs and products that can benefit local LATAM communities. New language repositories or community groups are important because they can introduce more people to Cardano, which can inspire them to make their own solutions to issues in their own communities. This chain of events would eventually lead to the desired outcome of more real-world solutions on Cardano.\n\nThe challenge setting addresses the fourth strategic goal (improve tooling to support human processes in Catalyst) through the new community hubs that will be proposed in fund 10. These community hubs can introduce people to Catalyst as well as teach people from Latin America how to improve their PA/vPA work. Workshops or other programs would be a great benefit, especially since there are some barriers to entry into Catalyst. I am mainly thinking about language barriers and culture barriers, but LATAM community hubs could help mitigate these issues to some degree. Overall, there is opportunity for this challenge setting to help further grow Catalyst. The only flaw I noticed for alignment was that there was no mention of an open-source ecosystem, so I can only give a score of 4 for this section. (score given 4)\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Based on my knowledge of Cardano and Catalyst, I believe that the Cardano community has the capacity to address this challenge. In fund 7, there were 107 proposals submitted in the Grow Latin America, Grow Cardano challenge category. Since there were so many proposals in that category, I extrapolate that there will be a good amount of participation for this challenge setting in fund 10 \u2013 which is a challenge setting with a similar scope. Latin America is a huge region (roughly 665 million people), and there are many opportunities to use the Cardano blockchain to improve the lives of the people, so demand will be high for this challenge setting. \n\nThe budget for this challenge setting proposal is very reasonable. The proposers mentioned how they came to this budget (1.153 million ADA), which arose as a result of estimating roughly $600,000 as the budget of the challenge at the price of ADA at .52 cents (the price of ADA at the time the proposal was written). I think that this breakdown is helpful because it provides insight into what the proposers were thinking when they designed the proposal. The amount of ADA requested for this challenge setting makes sense because there are lots of projects and ideas to be funded through it. (score given: 5)\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Given the information provided, I think that this challenge setting was fairly well-scoped in defining the measures of success for its focus areas. The first two metrics of success listed seem to be more metrics of success for the challenge setting itself (volume of proposals submitted and quality of proposals submitted). The next two metrics of success were more specific to the future proposals (number of Cardano communities created and new applications/use cases created that are intrinsic to the way of life of Latin Americans). These two metrics are a bit more specific because they provide future proposers with guidance on how they can measure success. I would have liked to see the proposers provide more specific KPIs that proposals should aspire to address. Listing out some examples would have greatly improved the proposal in this area. \n\nThe metrics of success that were listed should create some healthy competition between future proposals because they are broad enough and there will be a lot of different proposals all working towards the same solution using different methods. For example, there are many ways to build a community hub. Since the proposal lacked additional specific example KPIs for future proposers, I can only give a score of 4.

We as a global community should support by providing the category they feel safe in and communicate well in. Results will most definitely not be instant for besides the western hemisphere, everyone else is playing catch-up and patience is needed when building a community.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This Challenge Setting for some reason was eliminated last fund. Most likely is due to powerful individuals or groups that have strong voting power who do not understand the following issues :\n1. Cardano is largely still unknown\n2. Building a community takes time\n3. Education on Haskell/Plutus is needed\n\nThe LATAM community, has prominent members such as Maria herself, then there is Victor and soo many others. Victor is the person behind Catalyst School, Maria is the person behind various other global communities in Cardano. All this proves that if one seeks justification to support the development of Cardano in Latin America, then the CV of those individuals should be proof enough.\n\nWe as a community do have the capacity to develop Latin America even further, the question should be do we as global community understand the nuances of deploying Cardano in minorities? Do we listen to the plight of minorities? Are we even an inclusive community? Or are we dictated by groups of strong ADA voting power? Data is showing we are more siloed than we would like to admit.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Keeping things as general as can be would be the most encompassing strategy. For this allows all walks of life to explore their ideas. As per suggested by their KPI's, attracting individuals to just submit even a mundane proposal that only ask 1K is a great method to entice them further. Especially if those mundane proposals receive funding, that is a feeling and a story that is priceless. It sends a signal to their larger community that it is indeed possible to receive funding to build on your dreams.\n\nThen we can start having discussion on the quality and impact of these proposals, which is also suggested by the proposer. But none of that can happen if they do not have their own Challenge Setting where they feel accepted and safe. Again, I am a strong we as community do not understand that. We are still strongly driven by groups of ADA holders that have strong voting power.\n\nI do hope my plight is heard across the community somehow. For building a community it takes around 3 (three) years. What happens in those 3 (three) years, are as following :\n1. Synchronizing working environment\n2. Identifying committed individuals\n3. Achieving quality proposals\n\nReally do hope, these region specific proposals do get voted on. And if I were IOG I would find a way to have staple Challenge Settings that will never go away. I am a betting man, if IOG does not identify this, IOG will loose the adoption race in Africa to China and eventually all other places.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2088", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 2, "ng": 12, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 633, "q0": "This proposal is very similar to one that has already been funded, which was the Grow Latin America, Grow Cardano challenge in Fund 7, and which has also been proposed in the current fund once more. As expected, the challenge is focused on Latin America, not only proposers that are based there but also proposals that would benefit the population of this region. Since this is the only criteria for this proposal, it has the potential to address all Cardano\u2019s goals for Fund 10. It can help preparing people to contribute to the ecosystem, support the open-source environment, build real world solutions based on Cardano, attract more developers and improve the human processes of Catalyst. In fact, based the mentioned previous Challenge for Latin America, we can see that all these goals were addressed by the proposals submitted by the community. The alignment of this challenge proposal with Cardano\u2019s goals is very high.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The budget request for this challenge proposal is very similar to what has been requested before. Since the calculation has changed, the amount set would be approximately $600k, slightly higher that the last Latin America focused challenge, which had a $500k budget. This previous challenge had 70 proposals submitted and it has funded several projects that are being executed and some already finalized. The LATAM community has grown since previous funds as well, and since there wasn\u2019t a specific challenge for this region in that past 3 funds, I believe there are many projects waiting for this opportunity and proposals that are being submitted in other challenge that would fit this challenge better and could use the budget allocated to it. I believe the community can make this challenge and success and its feasibility is very high.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The key metrics proprosed to measure the success of this challenge are good, but I believe there could be more specific KPIs as well. The \u201cThe quality of those proposals as well as the impact on their local communities\u201d KPI is good but not easy to measure, but could be included as a subject evaluation of the challenge\u2019s impact. It would be interesting to measure the success of this challenge proposal in comparison to the goals set in Cardano\u2019s mission for Fund 10, since this is an open ended challenge that could fit proposals that address all those goals.

The region saw the use of cryptocurrencies rise by 1370% from 2019 to 2021. The part of the reason for this growth is the problems faced by the individual countries in the region like debasement of there fiat currency against US Dollar, high inflation rates, and lack of access to financial services to name a few. This has helped in the widespread adoption of crypto in the region.\nThis presents a unique opportunity to grow the presence of Cardano in the region and onboard new people to the Cardano community. Given the vast size of the economy of this region, it can bring a great value to the Cardano network and will also help in the further decentralization of the Cardano Blockchain by having new stake pool operators form this region. In my view, the region is very crucial for the growth of the Cardano user base and this challenge is critical for Cardano\u2019s mission.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "We already have a great community of people form the Latin America region and have seen regular participation of such communities in different initiatives including the Catalyst. We have also seen some proposals focused on this geographical area already submitted under different categories in various funds and some of them also got funded.

Only a hand full of key metrics are suggested in the proposal to measure the progress in addressing the challenge. Some more such metrics can be added to measure the success from different aspects. I would like to suggest some metrics that can be added to measure the success \u2013\u2013 1) Number of new SPOs joining the Cardano network from the region, 2) Number of new wallet downloads in the region, 3) Number of people from the region participating in Catalyst as Proposers, PAs, vPAs etc after the completion of the proposal.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2312", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2683, "q0": "Latin America is a place where establishing a strong Cardano is a must to achieve mass adoption. I think that blockchain technology is really needed in these emerging economies where some countries lack the financial basic infrastructure. One of Cardano\u2019s missions is to bank the unbanked. We have to find ways to unboard people who are in these conditions in order to promote financial inclusion and help fight poverty in the world. That\u2019s why this challenge is crucial to the Cardano network as it should help increase adoption in latin america. Because the reality of each area is different, Latin Americans should make proposals tailored to their needs. The proposals should have a great impact on the community as there is a large room where they can operate to make meaningful changes. For example, proposers can focus on education and building hubs where people can meet and create. Others can focus on building the tools needed by the local communities. There is also an opportunity to build real use case applications such as an escrow service which target $ada in local currencies, to facilitate transactions in the network. These are just some examples that can be implemented within this challenge. I think that the challenge proposer has done a great job giving directions to potential proposers. Altogether, I think that this challenge is crucial to achieve Cardano mission and is aligned with the strategic goals set in fund9. A good execution of this challenge can lead to more adoption and real world solutions built on the Cardano network.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I have confidence in the feasibility of this challenge. This challenge has been done in previous funds and I think that the challenge proposers could have added some data on the results of those.  That said, the challenge proposer has done a good job by pointing future proposers to some interesting directions. Asking great questions can surely lead to great solutions. So in this challenge, the proposers should find the answer to how to increase presence in person events. Community meetup can be great for building relationships and learning about blockchains. The future proposer can focus on this area and organize events on Cardano Theme. This is also a good way to attract talents such as developers or entrepreneurs who are not yet aware of the Cardano network. A Cardano awareness campaign would add more steps onto global adoption. The challenge proposer has also suggested focusing on the audience that is outside the blockchain space. This means that proposers should also think outside the boxes and have specific plans to reach other audiences. This is tricky as marketing and education have to be merged, in order to pull this off. Proposers should also think about ways to improve new proposers experience in the ecosystem. Sometimes being new in space can be tough because information is all over the place. Proposers of this challenge should find a way to assemble all the information needed in one place. A course can be a great example. The budget sounds legitime for a challenge of this size. To sum it up, I think that the proposers can find creative and effective solutions to execute this challenge. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The challenge proposers have included metrics that should help measure success. Potential proposers should study these metrics in order to deliver top notch proposals which are tailored to the challenge.

They should be able to propose solutions that fix problems that are important to their local community. I think that it\u2019s important that local communities participate in solving problems.

I suggest that the proponent can come up with goals and plans to support project teams to apply Cardano technology in real life, projects with high technical content in addition to implementing the development of project on expanding community hub, universal knowledge education. Doing so would match the proposed budget figure of 1.1mil ADA (10% of budget). If spending 10% of the total 10 fund budget just to support the development of projects on community expansion, I consider it a bit unreasonable. In addition, the proposal states how to calculate the proposed amount of $600,000 based on the ADA/USD exchange rate: $0.52. But at the time of writing, the price of ADA is only hovering around $0.45 and the potential for ADA slippage in the near term is huge.

This challenge is not funded earlier, and we cannot be sure of the quantity and quality of the proposals under this challenge. It will attract many proposals, but it will be low for the first time. If we keep a high amount, it will result in funding low-quality proposals. Therefore, I suggest the amount be $100,000 or a maximum of $250,000 for the first time. After that, we can see the participation and quality of the proposals, and then maybe this can be increased in future funds. \n\nAs mentioned above, we already have effective participation from the community in the Townhall meetings. These meeting organizers or other capable members of the community can act as the challenge team. However, as we did not have this challenge for Latin America earlier, Catalyst did not create the challenge team. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Few metrics are mentioned here in the challenge. The metrics are suitable for measuring the challenge\u2019s impact and success. The author can improve this to include the metrics to measure the progress of proposals in addressing this challenge. But from the guiding points, we can speculate on the metrics. If the proposals are about outreach, then the metric can be the number of people onboarded and the number of developers onboarded. If it is about the development proposal, the metrics can be the number of GitHub commits and the achievement of the milestones. Suppose it is about the content on media for educating the people on blockchain & Cardano. In that case, the metric can be the number of views or engagement of people on social media via that content. \n\nAs mentioned by the author, the success of this challenge will be the participation of a wide spectrum of people from Latin America in the Cardano ecosystem. This success will likely materialize on executing the proposals under this challenge. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2811", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12854, "q0": "Latin America is a large market with a population of about 665 million people - accounting for 8.35% of the world's population (July 12, 2022 data from the United Nations). The Latin American economy is also on the rise, including developing economies such as Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico... Therefore, community development in Latin America will certainly have a great impact on growing the Cardano community on a global scale. Besides, Latin American people mainly speak Portuguese and Spanish, and of course, they also have difficulty accessing materials and data in English. Therefore, we really need proposals to address this.\nIn the challenge brief, the author gives the main goals that the challenge aims to include: increase the adoption of Cardano in Latin America while giving equal opportunities and inclusion to its people. This is in line with the strategic goals of the Fund 9 Challenge setting: Prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem and attract more developers.\nBased on the above analysis I rate this Challenge 5 points in the Alignment category.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Currently, Cardano community development challenges by region are attracting a lot of proposals. For example, Grow Africa grow Cardano Challenge - 135 proposals (Fund 9), Grow East Asia grow Cardano Challenge - 101 proposals (Fund9). So I think if this challenge is approved it will definitely attract a lot of resources to address. \nBesides, the Spanish-speaking community is huge. Spanish is not only spoken in Latin America, but it is also widely spoken in America and Europe. Spanish is the 3rd most spoken language in the world after Chinese and English. In the United States, more than 41 million people speak Spanish as a first language (about 13% of the population) and nearly 12 million people speak Spanish as a second language. (information from Wikipedia). So I think the number of people who can speak both English and Spanish is huge. The Challenge of sharing information and knowledge about blockchain and Cardano to the Latin American community in Spanish will certainly be addressed successfully. \nThe budget for this challenge is 1,153,000 USD in Ada. If compared with similar challenges, such as Grow Africa grow cardano Challenge - 500,000 USD (Fund 9), Grow East Asia grow Cardano Challenge - 250,000 (Fund9) we can see 1,153,000 USD is too big for this challenge. The author should give a more specific and convincing reason for this number. I think a budget of around 500,000 or less is appropriate. \nBased on the above analysis I rate this Challenge 4 points in the Feasibility category.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The author gives 4 metrics to measure the success of the challenge. These metrics focus on measuring the number of Latin Americans participating in the catalyst as well as the impact of catalyst projects on local people. \nHowever, I feel some metrics are not easy to measure, such as, \"The quality of those proposals as well as the impact on their local communities\" metric. The author should concretize it into clearly measurable metrics, for example, Number of proposals addressing the fundamental issues preventing Cardano adoption in  Latin America; Number of proposals offering solutions to infrastructure and education concerns; Number of new  Latin American-based users onboarded onto Cardano (wallets, platform sign-ups); Number of new  Latin American-based Catalyst members (proposers, voters, CAs), etc.\nBased on the above analysis I rate this Challenge 3 points in the Verifiability category.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3494", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}], "importance": "Latin America is a Key Region for growth and needs to attract more engaged community members.", "success": "A wide spectrum of people from Latin America or with connections to Latin America coming together and forming teams to grow our ecosystem."}
