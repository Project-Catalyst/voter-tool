The challenge setting addresses the first strategic goal (prepare a group of people to make contributions to the ecosystem) by encouraging the development of community/outreach events or services. There is a lot of passion among the Cardano community, but they need a place to channel that passion to make an impact on the ecosystem. As a result, there will be a lot of proposals that are making contributions to the ecosystem by bringing the community together and onboarding new members. The proposers provided a lot of guidance for future proposers under this challenge setting. There were 13 example categories for future proposers to address, including online/in-person events, public outreach, interviews/podcasts, and translation support, among others. If I were a proposer in this challenge, I would have a good understanding of the requirements and guidelines for my proposal, so this challenge setting will do a good job of preparing people to make contributions to the ecosystem.\n\nThe proposal addresses part of the second strategic goal (build an open-source ecosystem and attract more developers) through the numerous avenues for outreach. Through hackathons, workshops, and community hubs, this challenge setting can attract new developers who want to get into the Cardano ecosystem. There are many opportunities for developers to get involved, not necessarily by being a proposer, but by participating in the projects created. Teaching people about Cardano will inevitably attract more developers \u2013 people just need to know the possibilities of Cardano first in order to join and get involved. The proposers did not mention how this challenge setting could potentially contribute to making Cardano an open-source ecosystem. I understand that this challenge setting is more about community and outreach, but maybe there is a way to tie in building an open-source ecosystem? Could workshops that teach developers be mandated to encourage building open-source applications? Just a thought for the proposers.\n\nThe challenge setting can address the third strategic goal (build real-world solutions on the Cardano blockchain) through the hackathons, government outreach, and community hubs that it will encourage the development of. All of these ideas can solve real-world problems by using the technology of the Cardano blockchain. Maybe some favorable legislation is announced, like IOHK\u2019s collaboration with the Ethiopian government to provide ID for students. Those IDs are significant because they can give the students access to banking or higher education. Ideas like those are the ones that I see having huge real-world impacts. While most of the focus areas presented in this proposal are off-chain solutions, like in-person events or workshops, there is potential for on-chain solutions that can benefit people as I mentioned above. \n\nThe challenge setting can address the fourth strategic goal (improve tooling to support human process in Catalyst) through the community hubs, workshops, nurturing culture, etc. because all of these focus areas can teach people more about Catalyst and its processes. Maybe a proposal will be created to show people how to be better PAs or vPAs. Or there can be workshops showing how to better use the current tools for Catalyst work. There are quite a few ideas for this section, but the proposers could have elaborated a bit more in this area. What are other ways in which this challenge setting could have encouraged the improvement of tools to support human processes in Catalyst? \n\nOverall, I had no complaints about this challenge setting proposal, except for the fact that they did not completely address the open-source ecosystem and the tooling to support human processes. In the future, I would recommend to the proposers that they include just a few more sentences elaborating on how these areas could be addressed by future proposals. (score given: 4)\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Based on the information provided and my knowledge of Cardano and Catalyst, I believe that the Cardano community has the capability to address this challenge. In the past, I have read many proposals that wish to create community hubs or make courses to teach people more about Cardano. Proposals like those can fit under this category and do well since there is a huge population that either doesn\u2019t know about Cardano or doesn\u2019t know enough to get involved. There is a big demand for proposals that target onboarding new people to the Cardano ecosystem. Over fund 7 and fund 8, there were at least 200 proposals under challenge settings that could fall under this new challenge setting. Thus, I believe that there will be enough interest and participation to address this challenge setting.\n\nAs for the budget, I think that the funding requested by the proposers seems reasonable given the scope of this challenge setting. Since community and outreach are very important for Cardano\u2019s future growth, we need to invest in that future now. The budget of 1.8 million ADA is perfect for this vision because it is big enough to fund a lot of different proposals addressing many different focus areas. Since I did not find any flaws with the proposal for feasibility, I can give it a score of 5. (score given: 5)\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Based on the information provided in the challenge setting proposal, I think that it is well-scoped in defining the measures of success for its focus areas. The proposers listed a few metrics of success for all 13 focus areas they listed as examples. For example, for hackathons, the proposers suggested that the metrics of success could include number of projects created, number of novel solutions, number of teams formed, and number of projects initiated that continue after the hackathon. These examples of metrics of success are very helpful because they provide some insight into the goals of the challenge setting. I also liked that the proposers said this list is not exhaustive because it allows future proposers to tailor their KPIs to their own proposal. Every proposal is different, so the metrics of success should take that factor into account. It is this same reason why I think that this challenge setting can drive healthy competition between proposals. By giving broad guidance, the challenge setting allows proposers to build and measure success as they see fit. Thus, there will be competition between proposals to be the best that they can be. Each proposal will strive to be more thorough than the next proposal, which will make the overall quality of proposals higher. I did not have any critiques of this challenge setting proposal for verifiability, so I can give it a score of 5.

In addition, Cardano's moment is opportune for joint efforts in this niche of Community and Outreach because, with the delivery of Goguen, Alonzo and now Vasil, a great dammed potential is being released, for a few years people didn't have much to do on the Cardano blockchain in addition to delegating, but since 2021 the range of options users have to interact with is increasing. This adds to the great potential for community participation in Catalyst.\n\n\nBlockchains and cryptos are still a taboo for a good part of the population, many see this technology only as a form of investment with no practical use. The large number of scams that our industry suffers almost daily damages the image of a large part of the population. Our industry still needs to improve the user experience a lot in many ways for mass adoption to be possible, so a challenge that allows efforts to improve reach and expand the community in a smart way is important to Cardano's mission.\n\nThis challenge touches all 4 items from the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals.\n\nCourses, workshops and hackthons are related to items 1 and 2, which are respectively: \"Prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem\" and \"Turn Cardano into an open source project & attract more developers.\"\n\nTranslation support, Ecosystem education, Courses, workshops, Community hubs, Demos are related to item 4, \"Improve tooling to support human processes in Catalyst\" as they are already existing and important activities for community interaction on Catalyst,\n\nItem 3, \"Build real-world solutions based on the Cardano blockchain\" can also be interpreted as part of the challenge since activities that involve outreach and integration of communities inside and outside Cardano end up being real solutions because the aim is to bring more members for the Cardano community and this indirectly ends up touching item 3.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This challenge has not been previously funded in Catalyst.

This challenge setting also presented several relevant success metrics for each subcategory of suggested proposals.\n\nMy only caveat in this challenge setting is in relation to the absence of a time horizon window to verify the outcome of the proposals. The existence of temporal screenshots would facilitate the assessment of the success of the challenge.\n\ne.g. \"Increasing the number of community members coming together to collaborate and get to know each other over different topics and high impact areas\"\n\nAt what point will the outcome of this key metric be evaluated? How often? 3 months? 12 months?

It seems targeted at the first goal which involves \"preparing a group of people willing and able to contribute\" to the ecosystem. It will also attract more developers and help improve tooling to support human processes. If the the category settings fund is voted first, this would be one of the categories. The benefit there is that these challenges contain less specific goals, and instead they have much broader goals.\n\nThe goal here is detailed in a variety of possible proposal topics. These potential topics are then given useful example metrics that could be used to measure those proposals. This is an excellent approach to setting a challenge goal for Fund 10.

In fact I have seen several proposals from fund 8 and fund 9 that would fit very well within this challenge. I believe that it will aid the growth of the ecosystem to see an increase in in-person and virtual events, more outreach through media and podcasting, more workshops, courses, training, and community events. I think this challenge is feasible and easily able to develop the Cardano ecosystem according to the Fund 10 goals.

These metrics can be used interchangeably depending upon the nature of  the proposal. Overall this challenge should be voted on and approved for Fund 10 if the Full Category setting plan does not get voted first.

In essence, they ask for the entire funding available in F10, and offer a unique distribution along several categories which have been previously selected by the community through a complex mechanism, culminating with an open vote for whomever wanted to take part. Any voter entirely supporting their approach should thus vote for the encompassing \u201cFunding Categories Full Fund\u201d. If, however, one feels that the approach goes a bit too far, this proposal is simply one piece of PACE\u2019s puzzle. This fresh alternative to the classical challenge setting process overcomes many downsides (low entry barriers for malicious actors, unilateral budget weighting, limited understanding of challenge teams, suboptimal time consumption, etc.) and aims to be more efficient, flexible, scalable as well as legitimate. Let\u2019s see if it also has the capacity to deliver on of the strategic goals from Fund 9. \n\nCan it help prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem? Not so much I dare to argue. The focus point of this challenge will be to support online events, hackathons, outreach to governments, interviews, hubs, etc. It is unlikely that most of these avenues will prepare groups of people, since participants will either be already fully immersed into the ecosystem (like hackathons) or simply will not have the capacity of changing overnight into adopters (like gov\u2019t employees). So while there is definitely a worthy value proposition that will increase public awareness on Cardano, there is less potential impact for this strategic goal. \n\nCan it turn Cardano into an open source project and attract developers? To a lesser extent, since this challenge is not mainly focused on developer projects. However, this should be a quick and easy fix by limiting the scope of relevant activities, for instance mentioning that hackathons should only be funded if they support / encourage open source exclusively open source activities.  \n\nCan it help build real-world solutions based on the Cardano? There would only be indirect effects here, since, again, we are not dealing with a challenge that supports building real projects. However, it is undeniable that public awareness, education, experimentation and hubs of innovation can all lead to better products and features in the future, and open new avenues for experimentation. In conclusion the effects of this challenge on real world solutions would most likely be significant, albeit long term, indirect and difficult to measure. \n \nCan this challenge improve tooling to support human processes in Catalyst? This challenge will only provide limited opportunities to support the Catalyst processes, since its focus lies elsewhere, in raising awareness and fostering collaboration.  \n\nIn conclusion this challenge is well aligned, but not perfectly, with the Fund 9 strategic goals, but there are some quick fixes for marginal improvements possible (open source as a precondition for hackathons). ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Does the Cardano community have the capacity to address this challenge? I believe it will not be as easy for the Cardano community to service the full scope of this challenge. While in some areas the technical competence and the capacity to deliver is definitely present (hackathons, courses, ecosystem education), might be more challenging for the community to deliver on some of the possible funding avenues, like for instance public outreach, especially when initiating discussions with governments, since the profile needed to obtain meaningful results from these undertakings is not a frequent occurrence among the general Cardano community. \n\nIs the budget realistic and reflecting the requirements of the challenge? The budget has been established following a vote open to all community members, secured by a few gatekeepers that anonymised voters identity and the vote itself, thus ensuring a high level of trust as well as legitimacy. And the results of this vote have been transposed into the budgetary splits present in the challenge. If the budget is realistic it will definitely be clear post-factum, if we notice enough implementation capacity from the community in terms of sufficient projects, sufficient competition within each category as well as a general good quality of the projects submitted. But the budget is close to a wisdom-of-the-crowd solution, so there has to be merit behind it. Concretely, it\u2019s also very hard to compare the proposed budget with the past funding rounds, since the diversity of projects means that community and outreach related ones were scattered within every past challenge, and there are no readily available tools to measure such past demand with the information currently available. \n\nIn conclusion this challenge is definitely feasible, but not as straightforward as others, in terms of being implemented by the community, while the budget is realistic but there are nevertheless unknown variables and only experimentation will paint a more clear picture on how realistic it is. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "To assess the challenge\u2019s verifiability, we go one more time through the process of turning the verifiability statement from the guide into a fundamental question and answer it:  \n\nIs the challenge well scoped in defining the measures of success? \nFirst, the challenge is well scoped in terms of defining the types of accepted proposals. We have a multitude of projects, including events, public and government outreach, interviews, community hubs and ecosystem education. The challenge includes as well a wide range of success metrics for each type of project, focused mainly on quantitative information (number of events, advertisements, videos, members engaged, views, etc). An excellent point of the challenge is that it makes a very strong statement about encouraging diversity and inclusion, which can definitely be interpreted as an additional measurement of success if enforced during the assessment / voting phases of the process.   \n\n(2) Can the challenge drive healthy competition between proposals?\nThe wide scope of the challenge also implies a certain potential for competition in the broader sense. However, because we don\u2019t have a very well defined market niche here, it will be difficult to measure it across the entire board, since there will be obviously area in which proposers are already well prepared (have a track record, clear value proposition, existing teams, etc.) and they will also be competing with proposers trying to enter newer areas where such resources and clear paths do not exist, and this will therefore offer advantages to the first groups over the others in terms of accessing funds, if quality and feasibility will be more important for voters than potential impact. \n\nIn conclusion, there is a good potential for verifiability for this challenge.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2824", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6299, "q0": "The community is one of the strengths of good blockchain projects and cryptocurrency.

But as someone with special training in recognizing the legitimacy or illegitimacy of research, there is a serious flaw in the \"funding categorization analysis\" materials provided that I must highlight. \n\nThere is a chart presented prominently in the overview section for categorization approaches, with small circles representing funding categories and challenge settings placed along bars, clearly implying that some kind of research has taken place in which funding categories have scored better than challenge settings on metrics according to some kind of research.

There is no way to tell how this chart was generated, which seems to suggest to me that it's nothing more than an art piece posing as a data-generated chart.

It undermines everything you're trying to do, and calls into question whether this team's own practices in verifying information are well-conducted. \n\nAnd if my best estimation here is wrong and some research was conducted to justify this chart, then that research should be easy to find, accompanying the chart in some fashion. Indeed, since the chart and many of this team's arguments revolve around improving 'effectiveness', there ought to be a clear defintion of how this team numerically measures effectiveness, which appears abscent entirely.

As additional effect, solutions developed and delivered through his proposal will also surely be useful and beneficial in assisting Cardano and Catalyst community members to work more effectively and efficiently.\nOne of the real cases we can find a solution through this proposal is meeting the demand of Haskell-based or Plutus smart contract engineers and developers from current thousands and thousands more budding projects in Cardano ecosystem covering many aspects and niches in both crypto and more traditional industries. Some of us may feel that both novel and prominent projects and builders are still offering jobs and hiring more workforce to help them achieve their goals and missions, even during this bear market. This situation is signaling that our community still has so much room to grow thus absorbing as much talent as necessary despite adverse market and industry condition.

Seeing the number of proposals and recurring challenges with similar theme, I have high conviction we will have deep enough pools to accommodate both highly sufficient quality and quantity of ideas starting from the immediate implementation. Moreover, seeing the liveliness in Cardano community and how fine the treasury being managed currently I believe this idea is in good hands to be executed.\nI would also like to see that we can eliminate awkward nationalism or negative (racial) identity associations plaguing the Catalyst due to fragmentation and limitation of challenges to certain demographic or geographic constraints.

This covers activities devoted to cryptocurrency market share growth; market analysis, advertisement, conferences, etc. The vastness of the area demands this category should take the biggest percent of the funding budget.\"\n\nThey based this recommendation on an internal report on the DASH cryptotreasury (https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/marketing.html#) funding disbursements and needs and experience of that community.\n\nThis prioritization of marketing may seem counterintuitive to some, given that Dapps is by far the most heavily proposed and voted in, and most heavily budget weighted category over every Catalyst Fund to date.  But if we ask ourselves how Dapps drive impact, is it not from onboarding and retaining users?  Typically this category of challenge settings has focused on onboarding outside the context of specific dapps and services, unless those were founder services like db-sync or the PAB, but by including the dapp language here, they essentially open the door for developers and builders to opensource their marketing to the community, with Catalyst funding it.  \n\nWhile I would have preferred \"Marketing and PR\" to \"Community and Outreach\" (the latter is too abstract and doesn't put enough emphasis on the core needs here) I recognize that everything that should be included under a challenge setting devoted to marketing has been included here in this broader scope, and so I rate the challenge setting 5 stars for ability to expand the growth of Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As noted above, as a key part of a set of inbound marketing principles (basically that if you build it, they will come...but only if they know it exists) this is a highly relevant challenge setting to everything underlying the idea of impact...before you can impact users they have to acquired as users.  To that end, I would have liked to have seen the community vote this budget at least twice as high (another indicator that).  If the budget was closer to $3.5m it would be more in alignment with the principles of the treasury paper, and underlying best practices for cypto adoption.  However, though I feel the budget has been shortchanged, this was a budget arrived at by the vote of 56 people in Catalyst, so the experiment allows for discovery and education in this area to continue to iterate to whatever the best alignment with reality is, and I feel there is no call for marking it down based on budget feasibility.\n\nThe proposal also does a fantastic job of laying out many possible proposal types that could be covered under this category, while also leaving room (but just) for emergent ideas that align with the 3 broad objectives stated.  If there is an issue with feasibility, it may be that the high levels objectives are just a shade too abstract, and that the idea of supporting builders in the ecosystem to reach users isn't well articulated.  I'm not downgrading for this, as the category does include this if parsed carefully, however I do feel it should be more upfront specifically, in order to make the marketing aspect of this category more accessible.  Whether they add language to the high level objectives to support marketing, or they add more specific marketing-style proposals to the list, I would like to see more focus on this core concept from this category going forward.\n\nBecause it covers well established ground and gives lots of support for use cases, I believe the objectives of this category are reasonable and achievable, 5 stars for feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As so often happens with auditiability and verifiability, this is where the chickens come home to roost if their are subtle missteps or errors in a proposals attempts to realize its goals.  While there are an almost overwhelming number of metrics listed for projects to use to gauge progress and success under this category, there is zero, not one, KPI for supporting context for those metrics.  And to be fair, I'm not picking on (pace)...this is an area that all of Catalyst needs to improve upon.\n\nSpecifically, I would like to suggest the adoption of two metrics that would help these projects gauge the ROI on their proposals under this category.  The first is something called User Acquisition Cost (UAC) and it is something that almost every project can easily calculate.  A proposer needs to take the marketing budget (or in a lot of cases under this category, their whole budget) over a specific period of time, and divide it by the number of users onboarded over the onboarding period associated with that budget.  If a hackathon with a $20,000 budget seeks to onboard 25 projects, the UAC is (20k/25)=$800.  Projects would then need support to catalog \"users\" according to criteria such as \"developer\", \"consumer\", etc in order to allow voters to understand and prioritize impact across projects, while allowing project teams to dial in their operating costs (lean operations can have high UAC, for example).\n\nOver time this kind of data can help inform context for a lot of the metrics that get tossed out without meaning, like number of users onboarded.  An additional metric that can be added, that plays off the same data is Retention Rate, where ((UE-UN)/US)) X 100.  Users at the end of a period(UE) minus new users acquired during a period(UN) divided by users at the start of a period (US) total multiplied by 100 gives you a user retention percentage rate.  Projects can plug their metrics into this to get a flexible target rate, and then check against it as part of the auditing protocol.\n\nAnother KPI is Lifetime User Value (LUV).  For Catalyst style projects (lean startup, innovative) there is assumptions involved, but teams should be able to project how much value an onboarded user can bring to the ecosystem through their project, usually over a specific timeframe (for dexes they might use 12 month TVL, for onboarding new Catalyst proposers they might use avg value to newly funded projects in previous funds) and then calculate this LUV as a return on the UAC investment.  This is the kind of support projects need from challenge teams to realize their ROI and stay on track, and it is the kind of support voters need from their challenge teams to prioritize the weight of their vote.\n\nBecause the category is built solidly on discovered metrics for measuring progress, there is a good verfiability foundation here.

The detail, effort and thought gone into the main proposal is astounding, so instead of risking its disapproval if it doesn\u2019t get the highest possible votes, I think the proposers are submitting the categories separately as well to increase their chances of success. I believe this is a relevant detail when examining this proposal as the categories or parts they have developed do indeed cover all of the Cardano Catalyst strategic goals, however, individual categories, such as this proposal do not necessarily achieve all the goals stated.\n\nExamining this specific proposal \u2018Community & Outreach\u2019 I find a well written, researched and presented proposal, with solid accompanying documentation on their Catalyst Contributors site  https://docs.catalystcontributors.org. The proposal aims to bring the community together, research solutions to attract new members and also investigate partnerships with other organizations. This aim is in direct correlation with the initial strategic goal of fund challenge setting: \u201cPrepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem.\u201d This first goal is indeed essential for success with any of the other strategic goals and Cardano\u2019s mission itself, in that there needs to be an established, diverse and dedicated community for the Cardano ecosystem to thrive. \n\nLooking deeper into the proposal, the proposers carefully explain why this category is particularly important. They have given two succinct but detailed paragraphs explaining, in summary, that an increase in collaboration will allow better problem solving to improve the ecosystem, and wider society itself. While this is a somewhat lofty statement, I appreciate the further justification and the time and effort the proposal team put into writing this piece.\n\nThe knock on effect from a better community within the Cardano ecosystem will in turn support the other strategic funding goals, although it may take time to see this effect. For example, more developers may be attracted to develop real-world solutions, or within Catalyst itself particular talent and ideas may improve the entire funding system. However, these strategic goals can not all be guaranteed, only that this proposal challenge category will indeed attract and hopefully keep more members within the community.\n\nOverall, I see this proposal as highly relevant and vital to Cardano and the Catalyst program\u2019s ongoing success. Without dedicated community members and a fresh influx of people from time to time, it will be hard to continue to grow and succeed. I rate this proposal 5 stars for alignment.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The PACE group provided a detailed list of potential proposals that their challenge could attract, in turn proving the possible feasibility success.

Scrolling through Fund 9\u2019s proposals, and a brief investigation of Fund 8, there are many proposals that fit neatly within this range, showing the likeliness that the community can rise to this challenge and provide quality, varied and effective proposals.\n\nOne example I\u2019d like to go into detail is in regards to events. This round, several major, and it appears popular proposals were classified within the \u2018Dapps, Products & Integrations\u2019 category, as there wasn\u2019t a specific category for the community. There are many people and distinguished teams i.e. Rare Bloom, Ninh Tran, who have written compelling proposals that will have a considerable impact on the community, however, they risk not being funded as they are in the same massive challenge with all the apps and products that are planned for development. Having a specific community challenge would allow these proposals space, and clearly prioritize growing our community, and in turn promote proposers to think of new and unique ways to run Cardano events.\n\nAnother key point regarding feasibility is the growing number of country/region specific challenges that are growing each funding round. Local country/region programs are key to Cardano\u2019s success, however,  who\u2019s to decide favorites? If there is a challenge for Grow Africa and a separate Grow Latin America, but a proposer has a fantastic proposal to develop a community hub in India, where do they go? Do they have to wait another round to create their own funding challenge just for their proposal? I believe it\u2019s much better to be able to compare the impact of these proposals across the different regions and voters can decide how to prioritize them. There is a lot of prior evidence of successful proposals for region based workshops, courses and ongoing education, the Catalyst community definitely has the ability to submit proposals within this category.\n\nOverall, given the details provided of possible projects, the successfully funded past projects and the desire for more region specific proposals I believe the community definitely has the capacity to address this \u2018Community & Outreach\u2019 challenge.

These aspects would take some time to document, however, it would be easily accessible information, it\u2019d just be a case of deciding if the increases were specifically related to this challenge\u2019s work, or external market driven influences.\n\nThe proposal includes an impressive list of suggested proposal types that contributors could design. Matching this is a detailed list of potential success metrics for each of the types of the proposals they\u2019ve listed. For example, within the \u2018hackathons\u2019 proposals they\u2019ve listed: number of projects created, solutions, teams, initiated and continued projects on completion. These little details will definitely help future proposers, who have a baseline to develop their proposal from. Providing this level of detail in the challenge itself, leads to quality proposals with clearly defined metrics, which in turn allows the challenge to be assessed overall as a success. The team deserves congratulations on the level of detail and explanation they\u2019ve put into this aspect of the proposal to support future proposers and the community at large.\n\nOverall, with the specific proposal type detail provided, through to the whole challenge success criteria listed, I believe this challenge setting idea \u2018Community & Outreach\u2019 is highly likely to display success.
