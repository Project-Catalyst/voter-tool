The FUD mentioned in the description in many cases has more to do with tribalism due to the financial and consequently emotional involvement of the different communities than the lack of information, so I don't think it's a simple marketing campaign to solve it, it also takes a lot of education at the very least, so I don't think the definition of success is appropriate.\n\nSeveral blockchains have foundations and centralized organizations and VCs that promote marketing campaigns, but that doesn't mean that IOG, CF and EMURGO don't do marketing, they do too, but I see that the priority of these entities is to BUILD first, unlike many other blockchains that have chosen the path of centralized blockchains, EVM-based copycats and second layers that make marketing a priority.\n\nThe Cardano community along with IOG, CF and EMURGO does a decent job of educating the community through articles and different media.\n\nAnother point is: What kind of community do we want to foster? Cardano has a focus on research, first principles and this ends up making it develop more carefully and slowly, the Cardano community is also critical thinker and much of this is due to Cardano's ethos.\n\nAny marketing campaign developed needs to take these points into account, because if the idea is to fight FUD, we will have to explain why critical thinking, research, security and decentralization are important too. I would recommend including something like this in the description in order to avoid marketing campaigns that only aim to count views and virality.\n\nI don't see this challenge as a priority in the Cardano mission at the moment because before spreading the message with marketing, we need an ecosystem of developers, applications and solutions that are welcoming to new members and there are still many points that need to be improved in the Cardano product, such as scalability to meet demand, governance to make DAOs useful, and tools to make developers work more efficiently.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Considering the relatively low budget in relation to the budget available for Fund10 and the other challenge settings present in this Fund 9 and the low technical complexity of the challenge, I do not see any relevant obstacles for the community to address the challenge.\n\nWe haven't had a marketing-only challenge present in previous Catalyst Funds, but we have had some marketing-related challenges in previous Funds, such as \"Film + Media (FAM) creatives unite!\" challenge that was present at Fund 8 and presented a demand for proposals and a request for relative funding above the average of the 22 challenges present in Fund8. The potential directions suggested at the end of the description also indicate activities that are already carried out independently by community members and projects in the Cardano ecosystem, so I don't see major obstacles for the community.\n\nI would recommend including examples of projects and marketing campaigns already carried out by the Cardano community, in order to indicate if there is already a community ready to develop solutions.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding the definition of success, I do not believe that it serves as an appropriate reference to verify the success of this challenge setting. As I mentioned in my lineage rationale, defeating FUD is vague. FUD involves each person's financial conflicts of interest and biases. I would recommend establishing a more objective definition of success with a time frame for outcome verification.\n\nSome key metrics proposed do not seem appropriate in the context of this challenge setting, such as:\n\n\"Number of new Dapps\"\n\"Number of new NFT projects\"\n\nDapps and NFT projects are end user end products created with \"smart contracts\"/validators, why would the number of these applications be related to greater marketing reach? How did I measure this in order to isolate the impact of this challenge setting on the outcome of these two key metrics?\n\n\"Number of positive vs negative articles written about Cardano\"\n\nHow would that be measured? Who would curate this data?\n\n\"Visibly decreased number of opinion-based misinformation about the Cardano blockchain\"\n\nAnother metric difficult to measure, as it would be totally dependent on who curated the data. Social media is full of bots, how to differentiate opinion of different bots representing 1 person?\n\n\"Number of new wallets\"\n\nHow to differentiate the increase in the number of walles resulting from this challenge setting from natural unique wallets growth?\n\nAlso, a time frame was not established to assess the metric keys of this challenge setting, which makes the verification more subjective.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2048", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 4, "ng": 8, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 645, "q0": "This challenge proposal goal is to focus on marketing efforts that will fight back all the FUD related to Cardano and to help stablishing it as the go-to blockchain solution to many different applications. It is stated in the challenge brief that many other blockchains have centralized entities that are responsible for marketing, and they have stablished themselves as go-to solutions for some field like Tezos for art and Polygon for gaming and dApps. It argues that Cardano should have a decentralized way to do its marketing campaigns and this challenge could help with that. It is a fair point and might a good experiment to run with the requested budget of 300k ADA. This challenge might help with two goals of Cardano\u2019s mission for Fund10: attract developed and bring more people to build real-world solutions based on Cardano, and it also has the potential of indirectly address other goals such as prepare people to work contribute to the ecosystem and help turning Cardano into a fully open-source project. The alignment of this challenge with Cardano\u2019s mission, in my opinion, is very high.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There are many people in the Catalyst community that are capable of producing marketing campaigns and advertise Cardano. They have the necessary background to build the visuals and have done so already, through previously funded proposals. They could partner-up with other people with enough technical background to explain to the general, layman public the advantages of Cardano and why it is a good choice for many applications. This challenge could also attract developers and other people who currently don\u2019t work in Catalyst to build their solutions here. And since the budget is relatively low, 300k ADA which might be approximately $150k after funding, using the current exchange rate, I believe this challenge is highly feasible and the community won\u2019t have much trouble coming up with enough quality proposals to use this challenge\u2019s budget in an effective way.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPIs provided to measure the success of this challenge proposal are good but it\u2019s very difficult to connect some of them with the marketing campaigns that might come up from this challenge. For example, number of new wallets, new dApps, new NFT projects\u2026 I believe it would not be practical to find a way to track all of this and if they were influenced by these campaigns or not. The same applies to number of positive vs negative articles written about Cardano, and the absolute number is not that relevant, but the importance and reputation of the website that published is also relevant. At the end, I believe that could be tracked is the engagement in social media and traffic numbers, because the outcome of improving Cardano\u2019s reputation as a whole is going to be very difficult to correlate with the proposals submitted in this Challenge.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2110", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 4, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1490, "q0": "Seldom in assessing projects do I see a more pressing need than one that emphasizes taking control of the narratives circulating around Cardano.

Using this data set, the community will be able to accurately assess the successes and failures of this challenge.

But it can indirectly contribute to #1 \"Prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem\", this is why I score 2 for alignment.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Each project team generally makes his own marketing campain, so there are marketing skills among community members.\nThe challenge proposal lists several blockchain categories for which building a common marketing strategy would be impactful, and defines the scope of expected proposals as \"strategies, materials, and executed marketing campains\".\nI would recommend to add example of proposals that would fit in this challenge, that would not be limited to offer an marketing campain and that would promote innovation in marketing.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Key metrics listed in the challenge brief are very classical metrics for a marketing campain (like number of positive vs negative articles about Cardano).

This FUD has usually been tackled by our strong Cardano community and some of Cardano's social media heroes such as 'Cardano Whale,' 'Hosky,' etc. So it will really help if this marketing campaign challenge can add some tools and resources in fighting the consistent FUD and making people aware of Cardano's true resilience and security.\n\nThis challenge will help with at least two of the strategic goals. First, it will bring in able people who want to contribute to the Cardano ecosystem by building marketing solutions to promote Cardano. Then, as marketing is an outreach, it will help onboard many new users and developers. These developers will likely add solutions to the Cardano ecosystem and thus accelerate DApps and Developer Ecosystem.\n\nMoreover, this challenge fights the FUD and reaches out to new users and thus will add momentum to the Cardano adoption. Given the above points, I think this challenge is critical for Cardano's mission.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Fund 8 has seen several marketing proposals, and in the current fund also, numerous marketing proposals are submitted. This shows that the community is capable of addressing this challenge. We will likely attract more proposals in this direction by having a challenge focused on marketing.\n\nThe requested budget of $300,000 is reasonable. However, I think it would have been better if the challenge author kept a budget cap for each proposal, as some of the challenges did. Although it would have let us fund several proposals, without a cap, one project may take a substantial amount.\n\nThe author did not provide any information on the challenge team, and it is not likely we currently have a challenge team being the new challenge.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The author mentions several metrics which will help measure the challenge's success. Some of these metrics, such as 'Number of new wallets, Number of new DApps & Number of new NFT projects,' are also useful to check the proposals' success.\n\nThese metrics are relevant because it shows the impact of the proposals. For example, new wallets can show us the number of people onboarded via a marketing campaign. Likewise, the number of new DApps & new NFTs projects can show the impact of onboarding developers and artists through marketing. But auditors should check these metrics for the effects of the marketing because these things can also happen without the marketing campaigns.\nThe author also provided some potential directions at the end for the proposals.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2811", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6731, "q0": "First, it is not really clear whom this marketing campaign would target, or what type of proposals are welcomed. We have as targets for success numbers of dapps, wallets, NFT projects, so from this point of view one can argue that the target for the campaign would be the development teams, since they are the ones deciding for themselves which ecosystem to join, and what kind of projects to build. But is it really a marketing campaign an effective tool in driving adoption numbers for builders? For me, this would be more of a door-to-door effort in which very knowledgeable people from the ecosystem have in-depth conversations with potential builders and alleviate their worries, answer their questions and explain to them Cardano\u2019s advantages, but in a very unique and tailor made fashion.  \n\nCan this challenge prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the Cardano ecosystem? Can this challenge attract more developers? I don\u2019t think so, if we treat a marketing campaign in a classical meaning: ads, commercials, social media content, op-ed pieces, paid content, etc. Would development teams respond well to such a technique? I have mixed feelings about its success rate.       \n\nCan this challenge build real-world solutions based on Cardano? Only indirectly, and only if the campaign is extremely successful, but otherwise its impact on real world solutions would be rather limited. I find a rather weak alignment between this challenge and the strategic goals, and I think three stars are appropriate.

It\u2019s impossible to offer a clear answer to this question, since the challenge does not include a list of welcomed proposals, and we can thus not assess how well the community can answer this call if the call is not clear. How will the promotion take place? What target channels should we address? Who should take the lead of shaping the technical messages? I have to go again with only three stars, considering the unclear use cases of what type of marketing tools are welcomed in this challenge. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I perceive the challenge as rather poorly defined, without clear indications of what will constitute success at the end of its implementation. I can also visualize a rather unhealthy competition with a race to the bottom not in terms of price, but rather in terms of the quality of submitted proposals, with questionable youtube influencers crowding out the space and it will be impossible for legitimate efforts to rise and make their voices / proposals heard in the public space when seeking funding.

This project's goal of promoting Marketing for Cardano, bringing it closer to the community, and drawing people to this ecosystem is exactly in line with Fund 10's mission. Basically, users won't be able to join if we develop platforms, apps, and products that are adequate but lack sufficient marketing. People cannot overcome FUD (stands for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) to learn about Cardano. This results from the fact that Web3, the knowledge of Blockchain or Cardano is still fairly new to non-technical users. In particular, a lot of false, unfavorable information, and fraudulent actions also cause The community to doubt the applicability of Blockchain and Cardano. A lot of synchronous marketing initiatives are required to prevent those things from happening, assist users in overcoming FUD, and ensure both breadth and depth while enhancing Cardano's standing in the community.\nThis challenge will undoubtedly inspire people to send suggestions and ideas for promoting Cardano, leading to the creation of more media campaigns for the ecosystem. Also, an ecosystem full off marketing will attract developers to come and create their products on it. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This is a Challenge I believe the Catalyst community is capable and enthusiastic enough to successfully implement because more and more I see Developers interested in Marketing campaigns. As a person working in the media field, I see a large team of Marketers, Content Creators, or reporters in Catalyst, I believe they will be very supportive of this Challenge. It probably also makes developers more interested in Marketing for their own projects, which I see in many proposals missing. There are 2 small issues that I would like to comment on for this Challenge proposal: First, the author should give an idea of \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bsubdividing Marketing categories so that later proponents can understand and allocate funds easier. than. For example, it can be divided by Media channel or divided by communication stages and creating applications for Marketing such as Data processing, Content production, creating images, videos, KOls, ... Besides, the author mentions a lot of press channels and articles, but little emphasis is placed on social platforms like youtube, TikTok, Facebook with the characteristics of fast access, good viral effect.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Challenge also presents many marketing performance metrics that we often use in the Marketing industry. They are all logical and easy to understand like the number of positive articles, negative articles, data from social platforms.

This is a great new idea. Of course, the challenges to expand and develop the Cardano community in different markets are also one way of marketing. However, to build a brand and promote the brand in a methodical and effective way, it needs to have its own challenge. \nIn addition, the challenge\u2019s goal is to create a strong marketing strategy for different categories of the Cardano blockchain, for example, promoting eUTxO, Ouroboros, and technical aspects of Cardano; helping dapps, dexes and other solutions market themselves; Improving the outlook for startups and projects that are undecided about what blockchain to join, etc.\nIf this challenge is addressed, more people will know and understand Cardano, and the number of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem will increase. Cardano Blockchain will attract more developers, and have more real-world solutions built\u2026.

This can be a challenge as our Catalyst community is now more tech-oriented than marketing.\nThe author suggests a budget of 300,000 USD. I think this number is appropriate for the size of the challenge.

For example, for a social media marketing campaign, the metrics of Audience Growth Rate, Reach, Virality rate, Click-Through Rate, Conversion Rate\u2026 is very important. \nAuthors should consider adding these metrics to key metrics to help measure the success of proposals more effectively.\nBased on the above analysis I rate this Challenge 4 points in the Verifiability category.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3494", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 1, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 13436, "q0": "One of Cardano\u2019s main objectives is to be a decentralized operating system available to everyone.
