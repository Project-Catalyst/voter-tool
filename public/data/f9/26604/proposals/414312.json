So this challenge setting is critical to achieve Cardano's mission.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This challenge was in all recent Funds. Actually, apart from the current Fund, but it was important and very popular of Fund 5-8.

The idea is that a top-down approach to evangelizing Cardano is not sufficient in order to make sure that adoption and expansion of the technology and community proceed at a sufficiently dynamic pace. I do agree that having Cardano Community Hubs helps to achieve and promote Cardano\u2019s mission. I also think that the proposer \u2013 as this type of Hub challenge has been previously financed in earlier funds \u2013 could provide more evidence for its \u201ccritical\u201d nature as it is currently designed. The proposers of this Challenge Setting proposal have cited several examples of past-funded 'Scale-Up Hubs' and specified that this challenge has been funded three times previously (Funds 5, 6 and 7). This means that success stories must be available and probably should be listed by the challenge team, which would do wonders to promote the merits of a challenge that has been funded several times previously. The team does specify that \u201cdemand is growing for this category\u201d. The other statement \u201cThe impact is real and ROI is being met\u201d would benefit from more facts, less faith in the proposer\u2019s statement. If ROI is being met and impact is real \u2013 I would prefer to see it in the form of a summary of key impacts and ROIs. Some aspects in the Challenge text would need more explaining \u2013 as they seem to be personal opinions: \u201cWhile we are Scaling UP community hubs, we need to Scale DOWN individual capital outlay, to ensure that we can spread as far as possible, as quickly as possible, which is why we work from first principles.\u201d Namely, not everyone might agree immediately that the priorities are to \u201cspread as far as possible, as quickly as possible\u201d \u2013 quality is an issue as well, for me probably even more than quantity and speed. I would also like more backup information on the merits of 'minimum-viable hubs' (MVHs) that are \u201cneeded\u201d. What is the research or practice that confirms the need to focus on \u201cthe smallest effective unit for a hub\u201d? However, the concept is interesting and could benefit from further details if not selected in this Fund and is resubmitted in Fund 10. It seems in my view that the proposed challenge is well aligned with most Fund 9 strategic goals, somewhat less with the Fund 9 goals 3 and 4. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I agree that the Catalyst community does have the capacity to address this challenge as it is written (except for the budget, see below). The proposing team specifies that it wants to scale up community hubs, and it sees that it is needed to scale down individual capital outlay, \u201cto ensure that we can spread as far as possible, as quickly as possible, which is why we work from first principles\u201d. \nStatements such as \u201csupporting partners have rallied, met the call, and are keen to join forces to collaborate with Project Catalyst to scale up our Community Hubs\u201d \u2013 would benefit if they were backed up by citations of such statements from the supporting partners themselves \u2013 in this case \u201cThe Commonwealth, UNESCAP, Accelerate 2030, One Million Mentors (1MM)\u201d. Hereby, I mean specific statements from these partners confirming that they are \u201ckeen to join forces to collaborate with Project Catalyst to scale up our Community Hubs\u201d\nI am not convinced that the ADA500,000 budget reflects the ability of the Cardano community to provide sufficient value \u2013 through Cardano Community Hubs \u2013 at the current moment for the proposed amount. So, although I agree that the community does have the capacity to address this challenge, I think that the budget is overly large \u2013 and that it reflects the proposing team\u2019s desire to spread \u201cas far as possible, as quickly as possible\u201d \u2013 which is a relatively unsubstantiated position that would require a greater supporting rationale, in my opinion, for funding of half a million ADA. If the proposal is resubmitted in the next funding round, I would advise a more realistic budget that would be somewhat lower. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Here the proposers specify some information that might be overly specific and may push the challenge into territory that favours certain applicants, over others. For example, the proposing team includes information on how the Fund 10 version of this challenge is different and the proposing team cites a question:\n\u201cThe question is: How do we ensure that community hubs are optimizing and scaling efficiently?\u201d That is a valid question. \nWhat I find a bit problematic in this Challenge Setting proposal is that the proposers answer this question and presuppose an optimal outcome for future applicants in Fund 10 who are expected to submit their own ideas and proposals. Namely, the Challenge Setting here states: \u201cThe answer is: By providing documentation around best practices, building tools that support growth and tracking performance across the global hub network.\u201d\nBy narrowing down the scope of answers, future proposers are inadvertently limited to the Challenge Team\u2019s vision of how to optimize and scale efficiently. This is effectively a leading question. If the proposed challenge is not accepted, I would advise the proposers \u2013 when resubmitting in Fund 10 \u2013 to be less prescriptive in order to allow different visions to flow upstream. Also, I like a lot of the additional success metrics that were listed, although \u2013 I think in this case some more focus on specifics is needed from future proposers. For example, the metric \u201cHave they given an indication of a financial sustainability model?\u201d \u2013 seems overly general. An \u201cindication of a financial sustainability model\u201d is almost nothing. If resubmitting, in the next fund, I would advise the proposers of this Challenge Setting to ask for a \u201cfinancial sustainability model\u201d, not a mere indication of it. \nSame applies to the additional success metric \u201cHave they given an indication of budget costs vs 'cost to launch'?\u201d An \u201cindication\u201d here is double-speak for almost nothing. Also, I am not sure that the proposers of this Challenge Setting proposal should provide a prescription for what \u201cratings by CAs and Voters should favour\u201d. This seems outside their scope and crosses over into the \u201cjob description\u201d of CAs and voters. The proposers here are stating explicitly\u2013 what should CAs and voters favour \u2013 but that seems outside their remit. Effectively, the proposer/Challenge Team should write up their Challenge Setting proposal clearly \u2013 but should refrain from prescribing how CAs and voters should vote/act/score/assess. This seems overly restrictive and might prevent healthy competition, instead of fostering it. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2047", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 5, "ng": 7, "nfo": 11, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you for taking the time to assess our proposal.

For it seems the larger Cardano community feels there needs to be a differentiation/specialization of this Challenge Setting for it to be effective. For example, this Challenge Settings seeks to address the needs of the developers but is not clear to what extent. This Challenge Setting also seeks to address the local needs of a community, though unclear what specific issues need to be solved. This Challenge Setting also seeks to address Sustainability Issues yet it does not provide guidance on which issue to address.\n\nBut it is undeniable, that having a general Challenge Setting like this, where everyone can be involved, not just proposers but also PA's and vPA's is a great way of introducing newbies into Cardano.

It gets to deep into realms of expertise beyond the \"regular person\". This proposal becomes too complicated for it's own good. It as I have suggested should be a Challenge Setting that seeks to onboard newbies or \"regular person\" with outputs such as ; Cardano Talks at Coffee Shop A, Podcast by Radio B on Project Catalyst, Weekly online article by Media C. Simple things that just focuses on exposure.\n\nDespite the critique above, since the content of this proposal is a bit overkill, it definitely shows one is easily guided to create a proposal.

This proposal is very well written and elaborated, and it clearly shows that the proposers have done some research to provide good information for the proposal assessors, voters, and the community in general. This challenge setting is very well aligned with some of the Cardano\u2019s goals for Fund 10, for example, attracting more developers and preparing a group of people to contribute to Cardano\u2019s ecosystem, which is directly affected by this challenge, but also it indirectly affects other goals such as building real-world solutions and possibly improving Catalyst\u2019s human processes. Also, the proposer mentioned that the effect of these community hubs is already measurable by the previously funded proposals, and its goal is to continue with this execution and improve the feedback loop with addition of new and useful KPIs.

Besides the already existing teams that could benefit from this challenge, the community continues to grow and there is an increase in the number of people in the community that could benefit from this challenge and submit their ideas. I believe that the budget could even be increased to 1M ADA, and this would continue to be a very feasible challenge for Fund 10.

Building or improving tools and frameworks that enable them to enhance their bases and promote partnerships between these hubs and associations already established in the \"real world\".\u00a0 Those who prepared the proposal for this challenge did a great job of giving the necessary arguments for this challenge in order to justify why this kind of challenge is necessary to maintain as a community at this time.

I think that has demonstrated to be critical to achieve the Cardano mission. The Main benefit I see this challenge  offer is the capacity to prepare groups of people to contribute to the Cardano ecosystem. In fact the hubs created serve as education centers as well as means of awareness creation.  Education, in my opinion, is one of the greatest weapons for Cardano to succeed and achieve adoption. The fact that these Cardano hubs can be created in any country is really important as, now, we can touch audiences that really need Cardano. Let\u2019s not forget that one of the ultimate missions of Cardano, is to bank the unbanked. So we need to create these hubs in order to show the opportunity to those who need it the most. The challenge should also give a special focus to students and young entrepreneurs because they usually represent the youth which usually are the ones responsible for changes and revolutions. Targeting these young people in schools and universities will help Cardano attract future developers and leaders that can help develop their local communities. I also want to suggest to the proposers to put a special focus on areas such as Africa and Latin America where there is a gap to be filled in terms of financial benefits and financial inclusion.

In fund 10, the main question asked by the proposer is: How do we ensure that community hubs are optimizing and scaling efficiently? In this question we can already detect the will of the proposers to create hubs that are more than the basic one and the can scale. The answer given by the proposer is: By providing documentation around best practices, building tools that support growth and tracking performance across the global hub network. I think that the proposals in fund 10 have quite a task in their hands. The hubs that we create have to be more sophisticated and be run more professionally. It\u2019s a natural evolution that needs to take place in order to promote growth in the Cardano ecosystem. Proposers in the challenge should focus on building the infrastructures like tooling, such as tracking systems, and also building documentation.

One of the key metrics to measure is the number of hubs created in 2022. In fact, this challenge has been running for quite some time, so it\u2019s important to track the number of hubs created to measure its success. We also have to track the number of countries where there is at least 1 Cardano hub. The beauty of this challenge is that it allows proposers to create hubs anywhere in the world, which is great for the community. Another important metric is the number of tools created to support the global hub network. This is important because once the infrastructure is in place, we should be able to scale and optimize the creation of new hubs. This leads us to the next metric which is the number of hubs which improved their processes thanks to the toolings and documentations available. This emphasizes the importance of building tools and framework to support new hubs. Moreover, hubs are the best way to bring people to the Cardano ecosystem. So we have to check the number of developers that this challenge has brought to the ecosystem. Developers are one of the greatest assets of any chain because they are the one that have the ability to build dapps and tools.

Following that development, this project is not difficult to implement, it is clear that the Catalyst community has the full skills and experience to tackle this challenge.
