In May of this year, applications for the Marlowe Pioneer Program started and the program is happening right now, so we will have at least one cohort formed and available if this challenge is funded, which will allow the use of this new workforce to leverage the development of applications in Marlowe.\n\nCardano is in a moment of rapid growth and transition, many conceptual steps taken at the beginning of the project are being delivered in the last few months and largely are technical deliveries that greatly expand programmability and development capabilities. The delivery of Goguen and now the Vasil upgrade are expanding the range of options for the development of smart contracts (validators) and the community is assuming an increasing role in the development of tools and applications, but until now these steps have focused on Plutus. Now Marlowe is at a point of maturity for this development to take place. This challenge seeks to make room for this development, but it does not mean that the scope of proposals suggested here does not have space in the other developer challenges. The theme suggested in this challenge would also have space in all previous funds (there has always been space for this theme in previous Funds) and other challenge settings dedicated to developers in this Fund, it is important that the voter is aware of this when voting.\n\nThis challenge aligns with items 1, 2 and 3 of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals mentioned in the Proposal Assessor Guide.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I am on the fence about assessing the feasibility of this challenge, I will present arguments that I saw as positive and negative to justify.\n\nOn the bright side, the first cohort of the Marlowe Pioneer Program is taking place right now, which is an important step towards building a Marlowe-experienced community and leveraging the growth of this new Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThe challenge description indicates that this challenge seeks to kickstart the development of the Marlowe ecosystem, which is an argument in favor of a larger budget that can catalyze this initial expansion.\n\nBut there are some points that raise doubts about the ability of the Cardano community to address this challenge:\n\n1 The proposed budget is relatively high for a new theme challenge (not suggested in previous Funds) and with a specific theme(narrow scope). Marlowe is a sub-theme within the developer ecosystem, so the potential demand is less in this context.\n\n2 There are a large number of challenge settings related to the developer ecosystem, which can cause a specific and narrow theme challenge to be depleted due to oversupply in similar broad scope challenges.\n\nThe challenge settings below focus on the developer ecosystem and their combined budget is 8.925M ADA, which corresponds to about 70% of the entire budget for Fund 10.\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/422540\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/421335\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/423218\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/423220\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/423239\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414308\n\nIt may be that none of the above challenges are funded or that they are all funded, this uncertainty makes it difficult to predict community demand on this challenge, but if only one narrow scope challenge is funded a large amount of proposals runs out of space, whereas in the case of a broad scope challenge to be funded, all proposals under the developer ecosystem theme have space.\n\n\n3 Marlowe is in its first cohort while the first Plutus Pioneer Program cohort took place a year ago. It took a few months for the community to grow, mature and create proposals to meet a $1M USD demand for Plutus development. During the first Plutus Pioneer cohort we were in Fund 6 of Catalyst and the available budget for proposals in the Developer Ecosystem challenge was 1.05M, although the budget is similar to this challenge setting, the \"Devolper Ecosystem\" challenge had broad scope for proposals across the developer ecosystem while this challenge has smaller in scope, only in Marlowe.\n\nThe arguments I mentioned above make me question the community's ability to fill a Fund with proposals in sufficient quantity and quality, so my position on this criterion will be neutral.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The definition of success is clear, objective and appropriate to the context that was described in the challenge setting. Additional success criteria bring different forms and niches where the outcome of Marlowe-related solutions can be evaluated.\n\nSeveral key metrics were presented, metrics that aim to measure various criteria such as security, integration of solutions with the community, diversity of applications, number of tools, documentation, repositories, among others.

We know that low code solutions to create or implement smart contracts are just not mature enough. The complexity of transposing real-world processes and use cases onto smart contracts is hard to conceive owing, in part, to a lack of supportive tooling.

IOG has identified the need for more developers to build on top of Marlowe but there is no focus on education on Marlowe and Cardano. For there to be an engaged and actively contributing developers would they not to be informed of the capabilities and possibilities of Marlowe and Cardano? There is only focus on building, which assumes there is already a ready and hungry talent pool. The reality is the pool is small and tired. The focus now should be mass education on everything Cardano technology.\n\nI would go as far as to have IOG provide scholarships to universities worth the same amount they are asking from the community, $1 million. $1 million in developed nations would result in legions of developers if it were managed correctly.\n\nAt it's current state it would be challenging to achieve the Success Criteria for the context is incorrect.

My rationale for each goal is in brackets:\nPrepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem. (There are many experienced developers who are able to make contributions, but may not be willing due to a lack of incentives. Their time and work is valuable, and if they can receive compensation elsewhere, they may not have time to donate their time without an incentive. This challenge will give them an incentive to contribute. There are also many new developers who wish to contribute, but may not be able to, due to a lack of educational materials, tools, tutorials, documentation, training, etc. This challenge can incentivize contributors to create freely accessible and open source training materials that can be used by a growing number of new developers. These resources can also continue to be expanded upon with open source contributions. Education is the foundational pillar for any society/ecosystem) \n\nTurn Cardano into an open source project & attract more developers. (Developers will be more attracted to the Marlowe ecosystem if there is sufficient documentation, training resources, tools, libraries, sdks, etc.) \n\nBuild real-world solutions based on the Cardano blockchain. (This challenge will incentivize existing businesses and start-ups to launch their ideas on Marlowe and receive compensation and catalyst support, reducing the risk of failure significantly) \n\nImprove tooling to support human processes in Catalyst. (Incentives will motivate contributors to create tools and resources for Marlow, and support human processes by providing free educational content) \n\nThis 1M ada incentive can have a significant effect on society and the Cardano mission by unleashing a new wave of developers and contributors. Free and open access to open source education and tools is something that will be incredibly powerful for the Cardano community, as aspiring contributors from around the world realize the potential of Cardano and Marlowe. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This challenge is feasible and it is highly likely to deliver results within the next 6 months. The budget will encourage a wide range of proposals that can cover many different areas of improvement for the Marlowe developer ecosystem. As outlined in the proposal these could be related to open tooling for developers, running real-world Marlowe contracts, stablecoins, DeFi, Realfi, NFT's, legal, etc... The budget is significant and able to cover more complex proposals, but will also likely fund many smaller projects with results being shown within weeks to months after being funded.

Some of these metrics are not specific quantifiable KPIs that can be easily tracked by Catalyst community members. However, much of the value of this challenge will come in the future and may not be easily quantified or tracked, as any number of people will be accessing these open source tools and using them.

I was able to identify that, after a quick search of past proposals with similar characteristics to those expected here, more than US$1.5 million have been allocated in a variety of funds and challenges for projects with similar characteristics.

That is why it is called no-code or low-code programming.\nMarlowe has been designed to be used by someone who is an expert in the field of financial contracts or business, but does not have programming skills and experience, because it allows you to build contracts visually and in more traditional code.

Given that so many of the artifacts already created are key financial contract modules, this latter category can be expected to take quite a bit of bandwidth...almost every major project I know that has recent Catalyst funding could be automating simple things with smart contracts that aren't happening due to Plutus development's affect on their budgets.

If business adoption is a metric, then you need to provide this kind of guidance and support for proposers in this challenge, as innovation is rarely in the driver's seat when businesses are looking at new technology for internal processes involving their own ledger, and instead is an equitable partner with risk/trust assurance.\n\nIn addition, they are looking to support proposers in approaching the challenge with diverse use cases, which drives home how they really want to showcase Marlowe.  If I thought 70 projects would all submit proposals for basic access to an internal settlement or buy_sig protocol, I might be able to shrug off the big picture, but they are suggesting NFTs, real estate, legal docs, and of course RealFi, TradFi, etc.  (If you haven't already, check out the algorithmic contract standards being built out to support the kind of open interoperability between financial institutions that makes RealFi possible: https://www.actusfrf.org).\n\nBecause they are providing both north-star style guidance as well as solid metrics for real impact in the sectors this challenge could be affecting, I feel like they have provided proposers with key information to be able to find success within this challenge.  5 stars for verifiability.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 4, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5964, "q0": "This Fund-9, Project Catalyst focuses heavily on Governance and Open Source, looking to transform itself by introducing dReps, full-time (or at least more active) community contributors and making tweaks to auditability and oversight.

While not everyone may agree with this approach, I strongly agree that it makes it easier to measure progress, namely by seeing that sufficiently diverse proposals are submitted, the request for funding will likely be competitive despite the generous amount requested, and given the excellent functionality of Marlowe to test and analyze contracts, an audit of tools and use cases should be possible even before a rollout on the mainnet happens for all Marlowe functionality.
