Today much of Cardano's technical development is carried out by employees hired by IOG, but it is important that the community begins to gradually assume these roles in order to increase Cardano's decentralization, which is one of the pillars of the blockchain trilemma (along with scalability and security) and an essential aspect of Cardano's mission. A good example of this is the creation, discussion and editing of CIPs, which until today is a process very dependent on the IOG, but which has been gradually taken over by members of the community, such as Sebastien Guillemot, Mark Stopka, Michael Liesenfelt, Shawn Mcmurdo, among other community members who participate in CIP discussions and proposals on Github. Funding for this challenge would make room for accelerating the transition from people working for IOG to people working for Cardano.\n\nAnd I mentioned creation/discussion of CIPs only as an example, as the contribution work suggested in this challenge can be addressed in different fronts such as technical support, information curation, coordination, governance, code development and other potential directions that are seen as positive by the community.\n\nIf we want Cardano contributors to focus on the development of Cardano, we need to provide financial conditions so that they can have tranquility and due dedication in these activities.\n\nThis challenge clearly aligns with items 1 and 2 of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals.\n\nFor all these reasons, I believe that this challenge is important in Cardano's mission.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Cardano community has already been filling the roles of contributors.\n\nThe areas of action suggested in this challenge are Development, Coordination and Analysis.\n\nIn the development context, I can mention that the community has already been playing this role with the following examples:\n\nAs I mentioned in the previous rationale, the creation, discussion and edition of CIPs has been gradually taken over by members of the community, such as Sebastien Guillemot, Mark Stopka, Michael Liesenfelt, Shawn Mcmurdo, among other community members who participate in CIP discussions and proposals on Github.\n\nAnother example that can be seen in the infrastructure part is the development being carried out with Blockfrost, an API service that was created by 5 Binaries, a private company and has been widely used by several projects developed in Cardano.\n\nIn the context of coordination, we have groups such as Gimbalabs, SWARM, Cardano DeFi Alliance and many others that work with coordination in different contexts, such as education, documentation, frameworks, etc...\n\nIn the context of Analysis, we have Cardano Blockchain Insights, which provides a service with data collection, editing and presentation of digestible data so that the community has an understanding of blockchain stats.

The concept for resource allocation took into account the ADA price fluctuation, the key roles to be filled and the priorities of these roles, the market remuneration of these roles according to the OECD. Considering these factors, they arrived at a number of contributors between 8 and 19 for the challenge. This interval is important because it is what we have to base ourselves on to understand what the demand for the challenge will be and in this case I believe that there are enough people in the Cardano community to propose this challenge, both in quantity and in quality .", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The definitions of success are objective and appropriate to the context of the challenge. They will allow the performance of contributors to be evaluated in different aspects, such as contributing to the community and ecosystem in a productive and efficient way. The suggested key metrics are good indicators to capture the development carried out by the contributors and if we think about the current context of what the contributors already do (commits on Github, organized events and community support) they would only be confirming the work that already exists. Funded contributors will need to submit weekly reports with data and KPIs. The suggested key metrics associated with the reports and various items mentioned in the definition of success will allow measuring the outcome of this challenge over time in a practical, critical and broad manner.\n\nThe success key metrics and definition of success for this challenge are very similar to the Catalyst Contributors challenge, so my assessment will be largely similar.\n\nOne note, the proposer submitted a copy paste snippet in the description \"Number of contributions to support Catalyst\" and that didn't make sense in the definition of success. I assumed it was just a typo due to the great similarity between the Cardano Contributors and Catalyst Contributors challenges.

Some might not understand the value of this, but through individuals like these, we have Swarm, we have Africa Town Hall, we have LATAM Town Hall, we have Eastern Town Hall, we have the collaboration with Seedstars and list just goes on and on and on.\n\nBasically we would not have the thriving community we have right now if not for these individuals. It is a skill to build bridges to foster collaboration to entice communication. And there are levels to this, there are those that are true heroes or special individuals who do it for the sake of doing it and there are those hidden gems who can only contribute to a certain extent due to non-Cardano obligations.\n\nBy providing a consistent livelihood for these individuals, where they are appreciated and rewarded for their efforts more and more contributors will come. While the existing contributors will feel it is worthwhile to be part of the Cardano community,", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Reckon this is actually the perfect timing. I have observed existing contributors giving and giving yet they are only given thanks or a part of compensation through the proposal they are involved in. In some cases, these contributor refrain from receiving compensation. Which is unfair and unjust in respect of their efforts to induce collaboration.\n\nConceptually I believe we have gone through enough funds to identify or to start to conceptualize the method of compensating these individuals. One can utilize the work of one our most prominent contributors who has enlisted the collaboration of Dewerk. A potential platform to offer compensation to contributors or perhaps we can go the route of something such as the Treasury Guild/QA-DAO, where specific talents are pooled and offered as a service to the community.\n\nThe options are potentially endless, it is more a matter of a brainstorming and experimenting a system that utilizes this category.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This is where it gets a tiny bit fuzzy, since the Success criteria is not a numeric metric more of a ambiguous concept.

Each potential role are explained in detail, including their responsibilities and how they will report back to the community.

This proposal has a very different approach in comparison to other \u2018regular\u2019 challenge proposals. Instead of having proposals submitted, it would have candidates running for a position to work full time for Cardano. The budget would be used to pay their salaries and their contribution would be focused on different aspects of Cardano: Development, Coordination and Analysis. I believe the concept behind this challenge is good, and it is partially aligned with all the Cardano\u2019s goals for Fund 10, but this is not a requirement necessarily for the work developed by the contributors. There is one thing that decreases the overall trust in the challenge proposal, which is having a lot of information provided as external links, and these are editable even after the refining phase of Catalyst of closed. This may cause trouble with PAs assessing and with the execution of the proposal in the future, since it would be difficult to track exactly what was presented for this Fund and what was possibly modified afterwards. It is understandable due to the amount of information included here, but I would have preferred to see this information in the attachments of the proposal, for example. Additionally, I didn\u2019t find the information about duration of these mandates. Based on the numbers presented, I believe it should be at least 1 year of dedication, but I\u2019m not sure about that.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This challenge proposal is very similar to the \u2018Catalyst Contributors\u2019 challenge proposal (some parts of the text actually mention Catalyst instead of Cardano, I believe the proposer missed changing them), thus the assessment also has some similarities. The feasibility of this challenge is very different to assess than the feasibility of other regular challenges. The first topic is about the kind of proposals to be submitted. Since instead of projects, people would be submitting themselves as candidates, everything in the assessing stage is going to be different. There is some guidance on how to assess the candidates - even though this is included as an external page and could be modified in the future, which is not ideal -, but we know from previous experience that having specific assessment guidelines for different challenges causes a lot of friction. The example is the Challenge Setting challenge, which always has a lot of assessments filtered out because PAs don\u2019t understand correctly how to assess proposals there, and in this case the challenge is recurrent since the beginning of Catalyst. Also, the guidelines have some rules such as auditability shouldn\u2019t be 1 or 2 to any candidate, but I believe some PA would give this score and it wouldn\u2019t be removed in the QA stage, which would cause disturbance in the whole process. The budget of almost 1M ADA, which might be close to $500k if the price of ADA doesn\u2019t change until results are tallied, is good but I believe it\u2019s too high for a first iteration of this challenge. I would believe that this challenge would be less risky if the budget requested was lower, and if all the information was provided as attachments instead of external links, to guarantee that the provided information hasn\u2019t changed.

Due to the nature of this challenge proposals, I believe its verifiability is something that might be very tricky to measure. Since the scope is very open, the elected contributors could almost propose and execute anything related to their roles, and I don\u2019t believe this is an issue in itself, but this increases the complexity of auditing their performance, and this should be closely related to the success of this challenge as well. There are some guidelines on how to assess their performance, but I believe this is something that is going to change a lot with time and that should be adapted and evolve as results are shared with the community. Also, I missed some KPIs related to the success of this challenge related to individual success of the contributors, like how many contributors are performing well, above or below expectations, since this would be a good indication of the challenge\u2019s ROI. Other related metrics should also be added to provide more insights about the contributors\u2019 performance. The first KPI provided is too high level in my opinion, \u201cNumber of contributions to support Catalyst\u2026\u201d (which should be Cardano), and the second, \u201cCommunity support - Conversations with existing projects\u2026\u201d, is not easily measurable.

This was very well received by the community and even Charles himself has mentioned this as a great example. This challenge category is nothing more than a way to institute this type of collaboration with other technical peers within the community. Like the challenge category \"Catalyst Contributors\" this is an evolution within this great experiment we call project Catalyst. I personally celebrate the PACE team's ability to analyze the current status of the community. They proposed a completely different system that makes sense and feels like a natural evolution. Regarding the alignment with Cardano's mission, I thought it made perfect sense, and regarding the metrics of the next challenge, they clearly align with the need to prepare a group of people who understand and want to contribute to the ecosystem, as well as drive Cardano to become a fully open source project.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "We already have a great precedent of how the community has addressed this challenge, as I mentioned in the impact section. And, from my interactions within the community I can identify many technical profiles capable of tackling this challenge. It is good to make voters aware, specifically, that the budget allocated to the challenge was the result of discussions with the community. As a result of these discussions, votes were taken to determine the weight that this challenge category should have in relation to the total budget available. In terms of feasibility, I also consider it relevant to mention that the setting establishes a maximum period of 6 months for which the contributor may apply for funds. Despite the fact that this period does not coincide with the Catalyst periods, I do not consider this to be a significant issue. If the contributor requires the budget allocation to be renewed, it must present sufficient evidence that it is adhering to the original proposal. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Considering that this is a totally different type of challenge than what we are used to, I can understand why the description of this challenge remains very general in terms of success metrics and verifiability in general, due to the fact that contributions will vary greatly from one another, and if very specific metrics are defined they may end up being very restrictive for one and favor a specific group of contributors. On the other hand, I consider it important to highlight the work done by PACE here, since knowing these difficulties in terms of metrics, they decided to go a step further and define many characteristics and requirements expected for those who apply for this challenge. All this well-documented research will serve as a guide for future contributors wishing to apply for this challenge.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2142", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 1, "ng": 12, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3257, "q0": "This nascent model for funding fulltime contributors to the wider Cardano ecosystem (pace has another proposal for the same model specific to the Catalyst ecosystem) is essentially an attempt at a governance scheme for a side-treasury.  The timing of it aligns well given Charles's recent roadmap update (https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/ekphrasis/june-2022/roadmap-and-governance) which talked about full time contributors funded by the the treasury.\n\nIt also lays out many key areas to the approach:  documentation, governance, accountability, election criteria, etc.  Unfortunately many of these are incomplete, especially the governance and accountability aspects (mentioned often but the only tools or framework presented amount to a few suggestions, each just the tip of a massive iceberg), which is alarming for a million dollar side treasury.  Even if the attempt is to create full time salaries for a first cohort, there is a circular reasoning going on here where you need a governance structure in place to pay people and administrators from a side treasury, so they will pay people and administrators from a side treasury to establish a governance structure.\n\nAs a start to structuring an approach and deliberating the process, this is good beginning with potential, however it would essentially be an unsecured treasury at this point.  What it needs to do is bring itself more into alignment with mission statements 1 and 4, which state that the community needs to be prepared to contribute, and that they need tools to help with this, which in practice would mean finishing the governance protocols, and perhaps taking a different tack (rather than a challenge setting to support proposers for full time pay, perhaps it should be an actual side-treasury proposal, that supports full-time contributors not by paying them, but by preparing them to present the best proposals they can to Catalyst....i.e. provide tools and prep).\n\nBecause this category proposal aligns very well with the larger vision and long term approach needed from a members based working community, I believe it has a very strong Alignment foundation.  However, given that it does not have good alignment with the short term roadmap to get there mission statements 1 and 4), I have to deduct 1 star, for a 4 star rating.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As mentioned above, the Category proposal sets itself up for failure by not having more governance framework already designed and built out, and in this way it simply isn't ready yet.  Things it is missing include:  Code of Conduct (think CCv3, only with a million dollars at stake), trust assurance (they admit existing reporting needs to improve, but outside of not requiring a KPI report, they haven't lined out the improvement implementations), a means of revision (the documentation is a great start, but where are the protocols for revising and adapting and evolving, for capturing and implementing the improvements they point out they need?)\n\nA huge component, which you will see getting built out by Dirk Hohndel (https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/dirk-hohndel-joins-cardano-foundation-as-chief-open-source-officer/) is the governance around committees and working groups.  This requires policies that all these governing bodies align with, as well as templates for how to form them, and how to create the connections between them (originally envisioned as Catalyst Circle and Technical Circle, don't be surprised if those experiments get completely revised under these committee frameworks).  There is no suggestion here of such a thing, even though the Challenge team is essentially going to be a committee (they create documentation, set parameters, etc. for the challenge setting).  This is the kind of lack of oversight that results from thinking about process, but not actually trying to build any of the tools for the process.\n\nGovernance is a sticky issue that must be iterated and approached carefully.  If done wrong, it exacerbates issues instead of supporting divergence in pursuit of bringing them into convergence.  Because this experiment has structured a path and approach that could yield results in time, I find that I do not fully disagree with its potential to succeed, however, because it lacks so many critical pieces, I believe that it is highly unlikely to work in its present iteration.  2 stars for feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The governance issue almost strips this section bare.  In establishing support for proposers under this Category (all seeking full time wages...even the assessor guidelines have been rewritten to accommodate this pivot in approach) it is expected that there would be robust metrics provided for the roles described, however that is still a work in progress.  It can get there, but it isn't there yet, and in fact, outside of a stern suggestion that proposers can't flake out in their reporting, there is actually less oversight provided here than there normally is for Catalyst funding, as KPI reporting has been replaced with a preference for more general reporting.\n\nThere is also a (good) suggestion in the documentation that analysis of results is critical, however no guidance was provided for how to even collect that.  It is hard to make data-driven decisions when you aren't capturing data.  There was early static research with a hint of dynamic community involvement around things like price discovery and roles, but there isn't a clear process described for how the community continues to build that out in all the areas that require it (file this under the need for a revision protocol in the governance framework--there should be some kind of landing page that makes it accessible, not just readable).\n\nBecause the proposal has an element of verifiability that is a solid starting point for continuing to build out methods, protocols and KPIs there is at least some potential here.  But because these things have not been fleshed out, and because there is little linking up of the various Catalyst protocols (connecting PA work to progress reporting to proposal submissions) to take advantage of the underlying Catalyst governance, I don't believe the proposals submitted under this challenge setting will have adequate standards and support for verifiability.  2 stars.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3326, "q0": "This is challenge is part of the \u201cFunding categories\u201d approach to challenge setting, a community-initiated reform to challenge setting championed by PACE group.

It also reduces the challenge involved in justifying budget sizes and instead replace that with a more democratic budget setting mechanism.\n\nThis particular one invites individuals to propose themselves as full-time contributors to the Cardano ecosystem.

With this challenge, we could allow currently unpaid volunteers to work dedicated with stakepool operations, reviewing of CIPs and possibly direct contributions to the Cardano protocol.

The challenge explicitly lists a few roles which will be initially needed: development, coordination and analysis, and for each of them we have a \u201cjob description\u201d that makes it very easy for interested members to assess their competencies versus the job requirements and to improve where necessary. \n\nCan it turn Cardano into an open source project and attract developers? Since the Cardano contributions will be immersing themselves into an open source ecosystem, it is unlikely that the ethos of the community will be affected in any way.\n\nCan it help build real-world solutions based on the Cardano? There would only be indirect effects here since we are not dealing with a challenge that supports building real projects. However, Cardano contributors can help maintain a high level of resiliency and efficiency of the infrastructure, and that should have a positive effect on new teams looking to establish themselves into one of the available blockchain ecosystems. \n \nCan this challenge improve tooling to support human processes in Catalyst? Since PACE already has an alternative challenge focused exclusively on the Catalyst processes, it is unlikely that if this challenge receives funding we will observe an increase in the Catalyst tools, since they are simply out of scope. \n\nIn conclusion this challenge is well aligned with the Fund 9 strategic goals, even if not formally ticking all the right boxes. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Does the Cardano community have the capacity to address this challenge? There is not a great deal of public information about the supporting staff behind the Cardano ecosystem, since the heaviest load is still carried out by IOG. Over time however, as the community matures, more and more tasks will be pushed out and we should be able to observe an increased competition within the space, especially if there is funding to back up these mission-critical functions. So whether or not the community has the current capacity to fulfill this role is relevant, and the key message here is that funding must be provided to stimulate this niche to flourish in order to, one day, benefit from a fully decentralized Cardano ecosystem support, autonomous from IOG\u2019s efforts. \n\nIs the budget realistic and reflecting the requirements of the challenge? The budget has been established following a vote open to all community members, secured by a few gatekeepers that anonymised voters identity and the vote itself, thus ensuring a high level of trust as well as legitimacy. And the results of this vote have been transposed into the budgetary splits present in the challenge. If the budget is realistic it will definitely be clear post-factum, if we notice enough implementation capacity from the community in terms of sufficient projects, sufficient competition within each category as well as a general good quality of the projects submitted. But the budget is close to a wisdom-of-the-crowd solution, so there has to be merit behind it. From all the PACE sub-challenges, this is the one offering the least amount of funding, around 8% from the total, so we can definitely bring the argument that a lesser amount would probably result in a not so meaningful challenge, while the budget can definitely be increased in future rounds if a healthy competition among proposals is to be observed.        \n\nIn conclusion this challenge is feasible in terms of being implemented by the community, but most importantly it is a critical component of the ecosystem that has to be supported. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "To assess the challenge\u2019s verifiability, we go one more time through the process of turning the verifiability statement from the guide into a fundamental question and answer it:  \n\nIs the challenge well scoped in defining the measures of success? \nThe challenge is well scoped in terms of defining the roles for Cardano contributors and their duties in the ecosystem: we have development, coordination and analysis roles initially, and further down the road other support functions are envisaged by the proposers: product, design, education, HR and finance. The challenge also makes it very clear what attributes are desirable for the contributors (supporting, collaborating, flexible), so there are excellent measures of success already available. Now, if the selection process will lead to community voting, this will turn into a beautiful experiment sitting at the edges of politics and business, since ADA voters will have to carefully decide which applicants should fill the proposed positions, and it will most likely necessitate more than a beauty contest to convince the community of one\u2019s added value.  \n\n(2) Can the challenge drive healthy competition between proposals?\nThe narrow scope of the challenge implies a very healthy competition will take place. One risk however is that the selection process will be prone to the same disadvantages encountered usually in elections, where imperfect information and mis-alligned incentives lead to suboptimal outcomes and even unintended consequences. A key aspect in mitigating this will be for the community to find and implement the right tools to assess individual performance and align it with the right economic incentives. \n\nIn conclusion, there is a good potential for verifiability for this challenge.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2824", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6908, "q0": "Fit to strategic goal:\nThe challenge setting helps to contribute mainly to two of the three strategic goals of cardano. It adds value to the fact that there need to be people that contribute to the ecosystem and incentivives them to do so with funding. This is a great start of such a project to give \u201estarting help\u201c and therefore also supports the second goal to accelarte growth. \nAcceleration of growth and evolution:\nIn giving people full time to support the ecosystem there is a lot more motivation to also give better quality in work and therefor this challenge setting can be an catalysator and also a step of efficency to bundle tasks and raise productivity.\nValue to open source:\nAs the contributors are employed with Cardano there should be a natural drive for open sourcing. Even though this setting is not explicitly talking about the open source character, it can contribute to the spirit. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Community support in the past:\nAs a PA that also worked in the last funding and doing this in my spare time I can see how such a project or challenge setting can support in giving people the time to do the tasks that are needed to create a system with a lot of quality. One can not contribute as good to the ecosystem if one is only able to do it part time or spend a few hours every week. \nPopularity gain:\nWith having people working full time for cardano there will be a wider communication that the system also creates jobs that will support the increasing popularity positively. In this grwoing environment there is a strong need of full time workers that can show stability and drive development even further. The capacity therefore is there and should be used.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "KPIs and goals:\nThe KPIs used are lined out in the challenge setting proposal.

Lately, and especially throughout the entire blockchain ecosystem as a whole, the entrepreneur who owns a unique vision in addition to a team of dedicated individuals has been assigned complete relevance. It's not surprising that the best ideas are generated at the base. However, a sizable subset of the population contains very useful expertise even though they did not come from a company or are not the typical entrepreneur type. These individuals are committed to making a positive impact on the world and have a great deal of enthusiasm and knowledge from their experience in more conventional fields.

In contrast, I can appreciate why the team decided to define the metrics that will be displayed in this challenge category only at a high level, given the vast variety of contributions that could be made. The team offers prospective workers essential and beneficial information, such as job descriptions, position descriptions, and a community evaluation methodology.

This challenge setting proposal is part of that larger idea in that it is one of the 7 funding categories removed from the larger idea and presented on its own. By breaking the funding categories into pieces where they do not work together to create the inclusive circle that eliminates overlap, the purpose of the funding category idea is somewhat compromised. Because this funding category can be evaluated for its own merit there is no reason to deduct any stars for diverging from it's own overall idea.\n\nThis challenge setting provides opportunity for those who want to contribute to the Cardano ecosystem but may not have a skill set or ideas that can be translated into typical proposals with typical KPI's. The idea is to select individuals and pay them to work. While providing a group of people with money to work within the Cardano ecosystem for the purpose of supporting and advancing it might seem like it is preparing a group of people to make contributions I am not sure they are the same thing. While the challenge setting leaves open the opportunity for an individual to advance the ecosystem it also leaves open the opportunity for an individual to provide no value. The PACE team has provided a well organized proposal with extensive documentation for anyone who wants to dig deep into their ideas. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "A community vote was conducted to determine the budget for this challenge setting. Participants in the voting process were asked to divide the total funds available across 7 broad categories that included this challenge setting. This seems to be a good indication of the percent of community interest in an area and might in some form inspire a budget setting practice for future challenge settings at large.\n\nThe PACE team has provided a clear roadmap for proposers. I have no doubt that this challenge setting would have a large number of applicants. I have reservations about these applicants being selected based on how well they run their election campaign and also the divergence from the idea of decentralized leadership. I am concerned that this form of funding might limit the opportunity for inclusion. If there is a paid position, will others interested in doing the same thing be excluded? Will this take something that is spread throughout the community and consolidate it under an individual? \n\nAn alternative idea that might compete well with funding full time contributors is the creation of working groups. This is something that I have seen spreading through Catalyst and appears to accomplish something similar to what seems the heart of this challenge setting. The idea is that a task must be done, or a problem is identified, or an idea developed, and a funded person or group forms to address the issue.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This challenge setting allows for a broad interpretation of what could be considered acceptable contributions and is therefore difficult to verify.  Candidates might be expected to support the ecosystem/community or have high collaboration or participation.
