Another objective is to improve communication, coordination and collaboration between developing countries to reduce inequality, which is something positive and promising.\n\nThe problem is how will this be used in practice? Will there be any criteria for proposers according to the socio-economic conditions of the proposers or the team? There is no clarity on the borders of this challenge\n\nThere are several confusing points in the challenge description that make it difficult to understand the concept and purpose.\n\nThe challenge question does not present a question but a statement.\n\nThe importance justification mentioned in the section \"Why is it important?\" doesn't make sense, it's too subjective.\n\n\"Global dialogue has the opportunity to find its own way. Similar problems present similar opportunities for solutions.\"\"\n\nThe lack of an articulated rationale for what problems this challenge intends to solve and providing an appropriate context for this topic makes the goal uncertain.\n\nI would recommend avoiding excessive catchphrases, as catchphrases are often generic, lack specificity and a challenge setting needs to show value through clear and objective ideas of what it is expected to achieve in order to guide the proposers who will submit proposals in it.\n\nDue to the lack of clarity in the target problem of this challenge setting, I do not agree that it is critical in the Cardano mission. I recommend that the proposer better describe the target problem. Improving inequality and conditions in underdeveloped countries is an overly generic definition that could fit into almost all challenge settings as an indirect effect.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Blockchain applications and solutions naturally tend to reduce socio-economic inequality, so there are numerous solutions that can be created in this context, this would indicate that the Cardano community in theory would be able to create projects to improve inequality and communication between underdeveloped countries, which is already happening through teams/projects such as WADA and Latam Town Hall, but the lack of clarity in the challenge brief raises questions about feasibility.\n\nIn addition, there is no established time window to define the outcome of the challenge. How to assess whether the community can address the challenge when there is no established period to reach the goals?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The definition of success is extremely subjective(\"Problems from different continents converging on common ground. Solutions remove boundaries.\" ).\n\nThere is no way to gauge the outcome of a challenge with such a vague definition of success.

Differently from other challenges where the focus in a specific geographic location, this challenge tries to include all the developing countries at the same time, and I believe this approach makes a lot of sense since many solutions might work on different places that are facing similar issues. As mentioned in the challenge brief, there is also the possibility of applying solutions already developed for some places, for example, to other places that could benefit from it, not necessarily creating completely new projects and solutions. Since the scope of the projects is not limited, but only the countries that would be able to submit proposals in this challenge, all the goals of Cardano\u2019s mission for Fund 10 can be covered in this challenge, although it is not guaranteed that they would be covered.

Also, there have been many proposals that already got funded and delivered that could be submitted in this challenge. I believe the community is completely capable of making this challenge a success. The challenge team of this challenge proposal is yet not defined, but I know the proposer of the challenge and he is well connected in the community, and I believe it wouldn\u2019t be hard to find interested community members to take this role.

In Project Catalyst, there have been challenges, such as \"Grow Africa, Grow Cardano\", \"Grow Latin America, Grow Cardano\", \"Grow India, Grow Cardano\", etc., which are positive in that they have budgets to solve regional problems, but may restrict the opportunity of those in other regions to take advantage of the solutions. It appears to me that when viewed from this perspective, it has a better alignment with Cardano's mission. However, I feel that leaving the term \"socio-economic conditions\" without further explanation could be confusing and would add to the difficulty and transparency when discussing global issues. A model reference would be the Human Development Index (HDI) promoted by the Human Development Report Office (HDRO) which measures not only financial factors but also health, education, and a decent standard of living. Compared to the strategic objectives of the next fund, I find a clear alignment with at least two of the four objectives as it can prepare people to contribute to the ecosystem while on the other hand, it can create the conditions for developing real solutions.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Since the conception of Catalyst we have had multiple challenges and proposals that directly or indirectly want to address the type of issues that are included in this challenge.

There is also \"Grow East Asia, Grow Cardano\" with an allocation of $250,000 in ADA and 73 competing proposals. Considering the above arguments, it can be concluded that the community has the capacity to address the upcoming challenge and that the $1,000,000 budget is appropriate for the project. The team that prepared this proposal has not yet defined the challenge team, but considering the community's affinities with this type of challenge, I do not anticipate that this will be a problem in the near future.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The author of the proposal presents an appropriate and easy to understand description of success. The metrics presented are a combination of metrics that seek to measure the success of this challenge itself (as one more iteration within this grand experiment), as well as metrics that are intended to serve as a guide for future proponents. There is an excellent job being done in describing the common problems found in these areas, as well as providing a good description of the directions that could be expected in the proposals that fall within this challenge. As a recommendation for future challenges, it would be interesting to include within the considerations to be taken by proposers as well as for the PA/vPA community the definition of communication and reporting channels between teams and the Catalyst and Cardano community in general.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2142", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 3, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1462, "q0": "Despite some of the controversy surrounding the wording of this challenge setting, it is a wholly worthwhile undertaking and clearly aligns with the strategic goals and missions of Cardano. Leveling the playing field by equalizing opportunities through the use of blockchain is a recurring theme in the sermonology of one Charles Hoskinson.

Creating a collaborative platform to elevate those voices is a noble endeavor that can efficiently accelerate mass adoption and drive appropriate, targeted innovation.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Cardano community is extremely diverse, economically, culturally, and geographically. Exploiting this diversity will enable this challenge to be successful, thus, it is very realistic to foresee great accomplishments deriving from this proposal.

The standard procedure at this point is for a geographic region to propose a \"Grow Region\" challenge setting.  This proposal seeks unite all such challenges under a collaborative heading.  One issue this creates is that for projects with no reasonable need for collaboration outside their region (and there are many of these due to the nature of regionality itself) you really still need the other challenge setting, so their is risk of allocating too many funds to this area. (Perhaps a middle ground would be to encourage these other regional challenges to adopt this regional collaboration language, and to prioritize such goals through their metrics.)\n\nIn terms of Fund 10 alignment, Goal 3 is a particulalrly strong area, with real world solutions being a key deliverable here.  Improving human process and tooling (goal 4) and preparing people to contribute (goal 1) are also well represented in the list of proposals to consider.  It should be remembered that RealFi in these developing nations will amount to access to decentralized global markets through global finance participation, so this kind of cross-region collaboration is built into many of our assumptions about Cardano's sucess in this area.\n\nBecause of strong alignment with most Fund 10 goals, I feel that this proposal merits full marks for alignment, 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is excellent support and guidance provided here for proposers under this challenge setting. 9 general areas where proposers could apply themselves, along with 5 general examples of types of proposals allow for good orientation to the fund goals through this challenge, and provide plenty of inspiration for how a proposer might interpret and apply these goals to their projects.\n\nIf there is an issue, it is that it quite explicitly pins these proposers down into this collaborative mindset, so a project with no reasonable means or need for this kind of cross-border collaboration will not be able to bring itself into alignment with this challenge, and will need to look to other funding challenges, so the budget here of $1m may end up being too high due to this exclusion.  Given that it is an experimental idea as well, $500k is the usual entry point, and would have suited this proposal better.\n\nOne area of interest, is an idea expressed in the comments that these types of challenges that rely on definitions of socio-economic regions have issues related to being too inclusive or exclusive because of our inability to parse the particulars of these definitions.  I actually think this kind of cross-border interoperability (poverty is a shared problem with a common language) can help with this issue.  An example is that in \"undeveloped\" countries you may have regions that are swimming in wealth due to foreign infrastructure investment etc.  On that same note, there are areas of \"developed\" countries that have been left behind, and which experience unemployment, impoverishment or lack of food security as poignant as anywhere else.  The ability to connect people in these neglected areas to eachother and to the wider world of opportunity and innovation is definitely a shared, borderless problem.\n\nBecause the team has provided excellent guidance for proposers to build effective proposals from their ideas I believe there is a solid foundation here.  But due to a budget that is too high for both an experimental category and one that is borrowing bandwidth from other still necessary challenges, I am going to give 4 stars for Feasibility.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is a fantastic list of KPIs here both measure success as well as how proposers can prove iterative progress towards their goals.  The objectives laid out in the metrics would effectively represent the culmination of this cross-border approach to problem solving, and in particular the areas where it suggests applying existing solutions across multiple regions, which would require on the ground teams across these regions, is a great way to get the information from that collaborative process captured.\n\nBecause the team has provided KPIs that support the proposers in formulating goals and objectives that align with the Fund 10 goals, I believe this proposal merits the full 5 stars for verifiability.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 3, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4435, "q0": "Personally love this idea to make it a challenge setting for Fund 10.
