This challenge will leverage the Js SDK development that was started by IOG in 2021, bringing a greater number of developers and reducing the complexity for the development and implementation of solutions on the Cardano blockchain.\n\nDue to the fact that the JS SDK is in pre-production and the fact that this challenge has a specific scope (it's a sub-theme within the developer ecosystem) I don't see it as a critical or high priority challenge for Cardano in this Fund.\n\nThis challenge aligns with items 1 and 2 of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals mentioned in the Proposal Assessor Guide.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The Cardano community has been developing SDKs for JS in several applications. Teams like Blockfrost, Tango and Liqwid have developed their own Js SDKs and Javascript is a popular programming language, so I believe there is potential demand for the challenge.\n\nThe fact that the SDK being developed by IOG is in pre-production may limit the feasibility of the community creating solutions.\n\nAnother aspect that casts doubt on the feasibility of the community addressing the challenge is that in this Fund, there are several challenge settings related to the developer ecosystem, this is not necessarily a problem as each of these challenge settings has a different focus, however it is important that voters understand that the combined budget of these challenge settings is 9,925M ADA, which correspond to about 78% of the entire budget for Fund 10. I have linked links to the challenges listed below. https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/422540 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/421335 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/423218 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/423220 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/423239 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414308 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/423211 \nIt may be that none of the above challenges are funded or that they are all funded, this uncertainty makes it difficult to predict community demand on this challenge. It is difficult to assess the feasibility of this challenge in relation to the community's ability to meet the supply of funds, as if all challenges are funded, the supply of funds intended for this challenge tends to cause low competition compared to other challenges. Low competition tends to result in fewer quality proposals. Judging by Fund8's data, there were two challenges themed to improve the developer ecosystem, \"Developer Ecosystem\" and \"OSDE: Open Source Developer Ecosystem\". The total requested/available budget ratio was 3.1 and 2.8 respectively, indicating a below-average competition when compared to the other challenges. In Fund 8 the total budget was $16M USD, the budget for the \"Developer Ecosystem\" and \"OSDE: Open Source Developer Ecosystem\" challenges represented $1M USD(6.25% of the Fund) and $1.2M USD(7.5% of the Fund) respectively . The combined budget available for the development ecosystem at Fund8 was $2.2M USD (13.75% of the Fund). Therefore, challenges dedicated to the developer ecosystem had 13.75% of the total available budget and a competition for funds below average in Fund8, this is an indicator that the combined budget of all challenge settings dedicated to the developer ecosystem of Fund9 is well above of reasonable and balanced demand for Catalyst. Each challenge setting must be evaluated on its own merit, so I don't think it's fair to deduct points due to the excess of challenge settings dedicated to the developer ecosystem in this Fund, but it's important that voters pay attention to this, as it fund most of these challenges can cause a resource imbalance in Fund10, causing other important areas to run out of resources. It is also important that the challenge setting proposers try to collaborate with each other and check the possibility of merging in similar challenge settings or if they do not believe that the best way is to merge, at least try to coordinate the budget definition together in order to make the distribution of more balanced funds. \n\nNote: Due to the similarity between the challenges and the situation I mentioned above, my assessments should present a relatively high degree of similarity, and I will make adjustments in the necessary points.

This library has been created to decrease the difficulty in using some of Cardano\u2019s tools to build applications using a well-known language that can be integrated with many others. The proposal is to have the community creating tutorials for this library, case studies, example projects and other content that helps onboarding the developer\u2019s community to use this SDK. It is proposed to use other similar onboarding platforms as a benchmark of what to do and what not to do as well, to make this experience as good as possible for new Cardano developers. This challenge proposal is very well aligned with Cardano\u2019s mission goals of preparing a group of people to contribute to the ecosystem and attract more developers, and potentially to build real-world solutions on that of this SDK. The alignment of this challenge proposal with Cardano\u2019s mission is very high.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The budget requested for this challenge proposal is 1M ADA, which might be approximately $500k if the exchange rate of ADA doesn\u2019t change much until the time results are tallied.

This adds additional risk to the execution of the proposal because it would not be easy to estimate the time required to learn it and could lead to unrealistic or insufficient proposal budgets. Also, most of the developers in the Cardano ecosystem are currently working on their own projects and it would be necessary to offer attractive rates for them to get interested in leaving their work to dedicate into a proposal for this challenge but given that the budget requested here is quite large, there might be enough room for this. Overall, I believe this challenge proposal is feasible.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer has added good metrics to be measure the success of the challenge: number of download of the library, high quality repositories based on this SDK, number of case studies and example projects, and new features requested. I believe these KPIs are good and well aligned with the challenge, and I would suggest adding some more KPIs related to other possible directions that the proposers could go, for example, creation of documentation to use this library, analysis of other onboarding platforms that could be used to define what to do and what not to do for this process. Is it good that they have added as a KPI the sentiment of onboarding platforms, and I believe that this is very important to measure not only the overall results of the challenge, but also projects individually, since it would enable assessing that are the most effective ways to onboard new developers.

One area for potential improvement would be the creation of a positive feedback loop with the community of developers using the js-sdk.

The base repo has been built and supplied with kits for CIPs 2 and 30, web-extensions and wallets, and several more.  But what ultimately will this all include?\n\nThat is where this challenge setting comes in:  YOU get to decide.  They recognize the importance of an SDK for the community by the community, so this challenge will be for anyone to describe relevant SDKs and their use cases for specific utilities and functions, or to provide research regarding what SDK strategies have had the best implementations from other areas or ecosystems.
