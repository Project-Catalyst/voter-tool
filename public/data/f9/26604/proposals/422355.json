This challenge is also aimed at open source and shared solutions, which is important in a public blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThis challenge aligns with items 2 and 3 of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals mentioned in the Proposal Assessor Guide.\n\nThe challenge setting suggests in the challenge question that the solutions may already result in Cardano adoption in 2022, which is positive as it indicates a short-term impact on the Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals, which are also short-term goals.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Considering the 17 SDGs and the history of the Cardano community, I agree that the community has the capacity to address the challenge, as several goals have already been used as a target in several projects on Cardano. Some examples:\n\nThe Cardano community has a group of SPOs called Mission Driven Pools (http://www.missiondrivenpools.org/) where different SPOs (stake pool operators) contribute in different ways to causes such as: environmental preservation causes, social causes, education, charity, among other causes that can be checked on the website.\n\nSeveral projects in the DeFi/RealFi niche have great potential to make financial services more accessible, which ends up contributing to the economic issue to mitigate poverty.\n\nSeveral projects related to models of carbon credits through NFTs.\n\nDozens of community education initiatives for onboarding new members to the community.\n\nIn addition, many projects developed in the blockchain industry end up having outcomes that go in the direction of SDGs indirectly.\n\nThe budget requested is relatively small compared to the other challenge settings and around 2% of the total available budget of Fund 10, which brings more certainty about the community's ability to fill this challenge with quality proposals.\n\nMy only caveat is that one of the budget definitions was not clear enough:\n\n\"...the collective total budget of proposals in this challenge are equal to or below the challenge budget.\"\n\nThe above definition is not understandable and should cause confusion. How to make the combined budget of all proposals within the available budget? Requires further explanation.\n\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The definition of success is relevant and appropriate to the context of this challenge setting.\n\nThe 4 key metrics are too subjective, but as the auxiliary success metrics will need to be aligned with the 17 SDGs and examples were mentioned for establishing KPIs, I believe that from this point of view the established metrics will allow a good assessment of the outcome of the challenge.\n\nIt was mentioned in the challenge question:\n\"What regenerative solutions and use cases will seed and grow Cardano adoption in 2022 and beyond?\"\n\nThe existence of 2022 as a reference doesnt add for measuring the outcome. We are already in 2022 and if this challenge settingbecame funded, it is not realistic to expect any tangible results this year as the funded proposals should only receive funding in 2023.

Following the 17 UN SDGs (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals), it is easy to create synergies and lead new projects towards these common goals.\n\nAll four fund9 strategic goals covered with this challenge. I am explicitly pointing to the challenge's clear statement, noting that all solutions within this challenge are open source.

And the challenge creator, described with reasonable rationale, this modest approach. The rationale states that, in order to showcase how limited resources, in a permissioned cooperative environment, can reach the goal of creating regenerative and sustainable solutions. I am looking forward, to see what under this challenge can really sprout out with this modest budget.\n\nThere is nothing else to add but to say that the challenge has everything that future proposers need, to identify and be successful under this challenge. From thorough explanation of the challenge goals, to types of proposals expected and good guiding questions.\nI can strongly agree that with a good structured challenge like this one, the Cardano community has the capacity to address this challenge.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The key metrics are:\n- Tech & science based products, tools & solutions to increase accuracy & trust\n- People participating and engaging to increase collaboration & action\n- Boots on the ground use cases as templates to scale & increase real world impact\n- Systems, processes & integrations to create connections, increase efficiency and reduce redundancies\nAs for the future proposer's ability to present and track KPIs, there we are presented with a perfect example of good structured logic for the KPIs.\nEach project may design their own KPIs, with a specific formula.

The main theme is optimization of resources and collaboration over competition: solutions that are open-source and can be used by the whole community, developments that overlap between proposals and could allow saving and reallocating part of their budget and other ways to maximize the impact while minimizing the use of resources. This is even part of the rationale behind the budget: 250k ADA, which is quite limited, but the goal is to show that it is possible to have a great impact even with a short budget. Besides this, since the goal is also to address the United Nation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals, it is clear that this challenge will allow the funding for real-world solutions. At the same time, I believe it would be a great opportunity to onboard entrepreneurs that currently work with regenerative projects into Cardano. Therefore, I believe it is well aligned with Cardano\u2019s mission for Fund 10.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There are many different projects in Catalyst already working with sustainability, climate change and related topics. Also, the indication of which SDGs are being addresses by each proposal is something that has already been incorporated into the Catalyst process.

From the technical perspective, I believe the community won\u2019t have issues to execute the projects, it might be more challenge from the insights and ideas perspective. But since the budget for this challenge is quite small, only 250k ADA, especially in comparison with other challenges that have millions of ADA, I believe the community would be able to come up with enough projects so that really good quality projects get funded through this challenge. Also, this would be a very good opportunity to onboard members to the Catalyst and Cardano communities, for example, through the partnerships that exist between the projects that work with sustainability in Catalyst and other external projects that are currently not here. Overall, I believe the community will be able to make a success out of this challenge and I think there are big risks associated with this challenge being voted in for next fund.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposing team has presented good and measurable KPIs to track the success of the challenge proposal. I believe most of the proposals submitted there will contribute to more than one of these KPIs, since they measure products by desired outcome - accuracy & trust, boots on the ground use cases, increase efficiency & reduce redundancies - and people participation. I believe it would be interesting also to track which SDGs are being tackled by these proposals, because this would provide a good insight about which of them are being currently addressed by our community and can benefit from blockchain applications. It would also help with the creation of specific initiatives in the future, maybe even specific challenges by SDGs, that could focus on solving issues in a specific area related to regenerations, for example, fighting hunger and increasing education. Also, the challenge team of this challenge proposal, if voted in, is probably going to be made of members of the Cardano4Climate group, and I believe they will provide all the information necessary for the community to track the success of this challenge.

This is important as the world is in danger, and we are running short on achieving sustainability goals; the provision of funding can bring things on track.

We can build upon that fame, and if this challenge can contribute to the sustainability goals, it will show Cardano's commitment to society.\n\nThis challenge will help with at least two of the strategic goals. First, it will bring in capable entrepreneurs and impact companies who want to contribute to the Cardano ecosystem and ultimately towards sustainable goals. Secondly, as described by the author, all proposals under this challenge must be open source. I think it is essential as it will help to boost cooperation & collaboration and make the developed solutions available to others to increase the impact. \n\nAs mentioned above, this idea of Cardano contributing to achieving Sustainability goals will solidify our commitment in society's eyes and pave the way for Cardano adoption.

Regenerative, in this context, is any solution that is life-centric, applies to all life, brings / creates wellbeing, or answers urgent societal needs like climate or poverty. Focusing on Cardano, regenerative solutions can be interpreted as more collaboration and less competition and a strong focus on product integrations and sustainable development goals. \n\nCan this challenge prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the Cardano ecosystem? The biggest challenge will be, in my view, to make all stakeholders and proposers \u201cthink Cardano\u201d and speak the community\u2019s language. I already see a few projects in Fund 9 that would fit in this challenge, with the overarching unanswered questions being, for all of them: \n \n- Where is the tokenomics discussion?\n- great idea, but how is the blockchain involved in it?\n- you can\u2019t do \u201cthat\u201d on blockchain, that\u2019s not how things work..\n\nAnd so on and so forth.

Absolutely, it\u2019s a one of the challenge\u2019s features of collaboration not competition and focus on open source projects. So definitely yes. \n\nCan this challenge attract more developers? Unlikely, but it can shift existing developer resources to regeneration projects, for what it\u2019s worth.\n\nCan this challenge build real-world solutions based on Cardano? Yes it can, with the significant caveat of the \u201cable\u201d part detailed above - it will be very difficult to have a critical mass of realistic solutions being proposed. \n \nIn conclusion, this challenge would be a great experiment within the experiment, but with some question marks on how the target audience / future proposers will fit within the existing Cardano community.

Given its very modest amount and the fact that it\u2019s designed as an experiment, I say definitely yes, it\u2019s small enough to be considered as one, and not large enough to be unfeasible.\n\nWith a good capacity to be addressed by the community and a small but realistic budget - five definite stars again.
