The cNFT (Cardano NFT) space is burgeoning and as the proposing team themselves state - NFTs play a crucial role in the Cardano ecosystem. NFTs \u2013 or non-fungible tokens [unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be replicated] - are not simply blockchain representations of JPG files. NFTs are most known for their role in the rapidly rising digital art sphere, but they also serve as unique representations of other types of assets, property or claims to something. I think this challenge is both necessary and welcome in Fund 10. The part of where it is important, the team states: \u201cThis challenge incentivizes the development of infrastructure and tools for Cardano NFTs.\u201d. I would add that the challenge should probably also give equal weight to looking at new use cases for NFTs \u2013 fortunately the team did include new use cases as a potential direction for the challenge.

The community growing around Cardano\u2019s NFT space is growing by leaps and bounds and there is a clear potential for expanding and strengthening NFTs in this unique blockchain \u2013 due to Cardano\u2019s exceptional technical qualities. This is not merely an NFT space like in every other blockchain community. It is an NFT system inside one of the most decentralized, most global and most technically minded blockchain communities. No doubt in my mind that devoting a specific challenge to the needs of the NFT Ecosystem will yield ample rewards. As regards the size of the budget, to me it seems on the large side as it has been set at ADA1.5 million. I would advise the proposing team, if resubmitting for the next round, to reconsider whether the size of the allocated budget will lead to careful and rational spending.

Another possible metric would be to look at the number of NFT project migrations from other blockchains to Cardano. One of the proposed metrics seems to be too vague [\u201cA sense of community and conversations. Having people around to talk and connect with.\u201d] \u2013 I think that if the challenge is not adopted, this metric could be improved by tightening it up into something more tangible.

But despite NFTs being popularized by the digital art market, there are numerous applications that can be benefited through NFTs, such as tokenization of real-world assets such as houses and works of art or tokenization of company shares.\n\nThis challenge setting is in line with items 1 and 3 of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals mentioned in the Proposal Assessor Guide.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "NFTs is probably the topic that generates the most social engagement in the Cardano community.

This challenge is very well aligned with the goals of attracting more developers to Cardano and possibly build real-world solutions using Cardano blockchain, since NFTs are already being used for many real-world applications, art being the main application so far, but others like property registration and certifications, for example.

Unfortunately, as of today platforms such as https://cryptoslam.io/ do not have listed the Cardano NFT marketplaces. However, doing a performance comparison in the last 7 days of the data presented on that site versus the data we can see on the platform https://www.cnftjungle.io/ we can see that Cardano is located in the fourth place behind Binance with a total of US$2.44M in sales. They place Spacebudz among the top 40 compared to the data of other ecosystems available on cryptoslam. The numbers are convincing, although we have already demonstrated that there is an ecosystem that is growing organically. However, we still have a lot of market to gain with respect to the first 3. This challenge seeks to strengthen the ecosystem, looking for a space for entrepreneurs who seek to improve existing tools and markets, promote research and the establishment of standards, as well as promote communication between the different NFT projects. Based on my previous arguments I find a direct relationship with Cardano's mission, as well as a relationship with the goal that seeks to prepare people who seek to contribute and evolve the ecosystem.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A good indication of the community's commitment to the focus areas of this challenge is the data we have in this regard from previous funds. There was a challenge in Fund 6 called \"NFT Business Models\" with a budget of $200,000 in ADA, for which 80 proposals were submitted, of which only 25 were approved and only 8 were funded. However, if we examine proposals associated with NFT in the past fund (criteria: NFT word in proposal title), we have 46 approved proposals of which 17 were allocated funds totaling $821,004 in ADA. This represents a considerale demand with a lot of potential that deserves to be elevated to challenge. In order to determine whether the budget is appropriate or not, I consider that in Fund 8 alone, there were 31 proposals approved by the community but not allocated funds due to simple funding limitations in each challenge. I consider this sufficient justification for the budget. The proposal's preparation team was also tasked with finding community members willing to become challenge team members, which adds an additional layer of feasibility.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The definition of success relates directly to the multiplicity of possible directions that the proposals within this challenge are expected to take.

NFTs are a popular part of the Cardano ecosystem and they drive a huge part of Cardano adoption and transaction volume.  As of the beginning of June there have been 5,727 NFT projects launched on Cardano (https://blazetrends.com/over-5-million-nfts-created-on-cardano-network/ note: the info about 5million NFTs is inaccurate in this article, as that is the total number of token policy IDs which includes fungible tokens as well as NFTs).  In the most recent funds, there hasn't been any real dedicated space for NFT proposal submissions, to the inclusion of this well crafted challenge settings makes sense.\n\nBut there is a problem.  Our job when assessing alignment is to assess alignment to the Fund 10 goals, and for this proposal, that alignment has not been well described.  By reading between the lines, I can excavate some possibilities of alignment:  for Goal 1, the suggestion for proposals around community events MAY allow for education or support around NFT standards and governance parameters; for Goal 2, there MAY be possible alignment with opensource development in the establishing of standards and CIPs; for Goal 3 there MAY be some NFT project that aids in real world solutions (there are no examples or terminology for that suggested here, but real world projects like Littercoin have NFTs in their roadmap); and for Goal #4, there is plenty of mention for how to improve standards and tooling, so that MAY be aimed at human-centric UI/UX.\n\nAgain, none of these possibilities are specified, so even though I personally can imagine how they could support projects in coming into alignment with the Fund10 Goals there is a high likelihood that many of the projects submitted under this challenge will not be in alignment.  While in the end, as always, this is in the voters hands, I find that I can neither agree nor disagree with how well this challenge aligns, so I am giving it 3 stars for alignment.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "As noted in alignment, while there is plenty of examples and inspiration provided to support and guide proposers, none of it supports and guides proposers to the Fund 10 goals.  I do think that the guidance related to creating standards and CIPs has the most potential to impact the fund 10 goals, with the suggestions for community tooling also having a chance.  But this limited alignment becomes an issue when you start talking about a budget of $1.5m, where you would like to see good alignment across all 4 goals, or excellent impact in 1 or 2 goals.\n\nAt the end of the day this proposal is a general Cardano impact proposal, rather than one targeted through the lens of the Fund 10 goals, and so all of the suggested examples are also of general Cardano impact.  The result is that it has high feasibility generally, but not feasibility specific to the goals lined out for challenge settings.\n\nBecause it is well structured and does provide good guidance and support for general NFT ecosystem proposals, I believe it has a strong Feasibility component, however I am removing 1 star due to not having enough guidance and support for the Fund 10 goals specifically.  4 stars for Feasibility.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Finally, the lack of explicit goals alignment continues to haunt the proposal in the area of providing metrics for proposals to measure progress and success.  When these types of metrics are suggested, the idea is to measure \"progress towards what objectives?\"  \"Success by achievement of what goals?\"  The issue becomes that this proposal defines the objectives and goals without relation (without alignment) to the short term mission statement of Fund10 (which other challenges are being held to as well).  Proposals under this challenge really have been given no guidance as how to achieve those short term objectives.\n\nHave they provided general guidance on long-term Cardano ecosystem issue and alignment, yes.  But challenge setting is about taking the long term goals and anchoring them to short term goals in the present, about focusing the bird's eye view of the Cardano mission into less abstract, more objective means of achieving it now.  And it has to do this in conjunction and competition with all other challenge setting proposals, which is why the Fund goals are formulated: to give everyone a scope and fair field within which they should apply for the funding over the next 4 months.  Voters ultimately decide what matters and what doesn't, but I have to mark this proposal at 3 stars for verifiability due to the lack of metrics that describe goals and objectives related to the Fund 10 goals.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 4, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4950, "q0": "This proposal aims the support the Cardano NFT ecosystem by setting up a 1.5M ADA challenge in Fund 10.

The worst case with these challenges is exemplified in Fund8 with Cardano Scaling Solutions challenge. It was so technical that only a few proposals were submitted and most of them got funded with 180,000 USD to spare. NFTs are a big part of the ecosystem so this is a general topic that would get a lot of proposals, so we don't have such an issue here. This is more inline with Business Solutions challenge from Fund8, which had a healthy amount of competition. I think this sizing is just right for this challenge.

Hence it is critical for Cardano's mission.\n \nI am concerned about the NFT projects that are funded but failed to make an impact. For instance, there is an NFT project funded by the catalyst known as 'akkadia (nftdao).' They built their marketplace website & minted their ticket NFTs, but if you go on to check their NFTs on jpg.store or other Cardano NFT marketplace, you will know that they have not yet verified their project. Also, there is very minimal community building or engagement from this project.\n \nWe also have some funded NFT projects which contributed to the Cardano Ecosystem and have had a good impact, such as 'nft-maker.io.' The difference between these two projects seems to be marketing and community engagement. The challenge author does mention briefly regarding 'the community sense,' but the community aspect is much more critical in the case of NFTs as the strong community is the foundation of any successful NFT project.\n \nAnd in the case of tools or marketplaces, we need to consider the number of projects awaiting to utilize the protocol or the number of partnerships and collaborations.\nFrom the strategic goals point of view, this challenge will bring people who will be able and willing to contribute to the Cardano space. It certainly accelerates the growth of NFT related developer ecosystem.\n \nThere is a chance that this challenge will garner more votes if the projects submitting proposals already have a community presence who will try to vote for their proposals to win. We can also expect the Cardano NFT community, in general, to pay attention to this challenge and vote for the deserving proposals.\n \nCardano is among the top ten in the NFT space with a volume in millions, which is still a fraction compared to the total market volume of billions of dollars. Cardano's NFTs space is only a year old, but we have reached in top ten.

Before that, we had a Challenge in Fund 6 as 'NFT Business Models,' which attracted 80 proposals, out of which seven were funded as the small amount allocated for the challenge. This time the asked amount for this challenge is $1.5 million, which will help fund many projects and is an appropriate amount expecting the number of NFT-related proposals.\n \nIt will help if we have a specific challenge for the NFTs.

In my opinion, this is a long and quite big challenge so we should also have some more long-term looking metrics in terms of the quality and development of the projects in the challenge because it's clear what we desired is the level of completion as well as the quality of NFT projects", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3096", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11702, "q0": "the challenge being proposed here is definitely aligned to the strategic goals for the fund (Prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem, Build real-world solutions based on the Cardano blockchain), and cardano's mission as a whole. We know NFTs are a huge part of the cardano ecosystem already and is growing by the week. adding more ideas, proposers, and developers through the onset of this challenge in the next round of catalyst will only accelerate the growth of the cardano ecosystem.

The community certainly is learning and dveloping up until this current moment, and they definitely have the capacity to address the challenge. \n\nthe budget that is being asked for is a hefty sum, standing at $1.5m. However, i understand that technical talents are a scarce resource these days and to have valueable input from experienced individuals in the industry is defintiely not cheap, letting alone some of the proposed directions like \"Developing NFT Standards\", \"Academic research and analytics on topics related to NFTs or NFT tooling\", and \"Change existing tools to support and adopt new standards\". which are huge undertakings. some basis of comparison for voter's easy reference, the average Web3 developer salary is $100k - $150k per year. splitting them out to differnt seniroity levels, shorter duration of work, language, and experience, i would say that this is reasonable amount for the entire challenge with enough headroom for some outstanding proposals.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "while the proposal is valuable and impactful to cardano as a whole, I have one feedback to give. The scope of this challenge I feed is too large. Indeed, the proposers were likely trying to attract a decent number of proposals for some healthy competition between proposers, but NFTs itself can be used for a wide variety of applications. will this challenge be focused on helping the art community, gaming community, digital ID community, etc? i understand that they want to - quoting them - \"build NFT tools & platforms, maintain standards, offer services, organise events and research\", and they have a bunch more listed potential directions of the challenge, but i still think the scope is too wide. having more focus on a particular use case will help attract the right proposals and developers, with the relevant assessors to be able to give valuable guidance to the proposing comunity. \n\nfor the measures, i think most are fine. however, i did find some of the listed measures being...not quantifiable. how would one measure \"A sense of community and conversations. Having people around to talk and connect with.\" or \" Filling in gaps defined in the exploration stage\"? would suggest for proposer to be more specific in these cases, though i believe a good intent was behind the measure - to have a sense of community, for example.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3270", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}], "importance": "NFTs play a crucial role in the Cardano ecosystem.\nThis challenge incentivizes the development of infrastructure and tools for Cardano NFTs.", "success": "Kicking off community based solutions to build NFT tools & platforms, maintain standards, offer services, organise events and research."}
