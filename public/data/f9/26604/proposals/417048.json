How will Cardano contribute to solving this wicked problem?", "f6_no_assessments": 9, "f6_rating": 4.518518518518519, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 148, "q0": "The discussion of the human impact on the climate has been going on for decades and is a wicked problem, perhaps more complex than the governance of the blockchain itself, so I will not dare to take a definitive stand. There are conflicting studies when it comes to pointing out the real human impact on climate change, more precisely on the impact of human activity on the greenhouse effect and observed temperature increase. Climate is a complex system, so establishing models that can quantify the impact of human activity on climate is extremely difficult.\n \nThe challenge question chosen is impressive (\"Climate Change is humanity's greatest challenge going forward\"), but there are no sources to support that climate change is humanity's greatest challenge. I recommend that the proposer avoid catchphrases and, if he decides to use them, include rationale and sources to support them.\n\nClimate change is a very politicized topic lately and when we put governments and large companies into the equation the situation ends up becoming more complex, as several known and unknown conflicts of interest end up being created, which causes great confusion.\n\nThe challenge brief mentions \"The best way to fight greenhouse gases is by reducing energy-consumption\" but it is necessary to take into account that the world is a complex system, reducing energy expenditure is not something simple and without consequences.\n\nA country's GDP tends to be proportional to energy consumption, so reducing energy consumption implies lower growth in economic development for a population as a whole. One cannot overlook the fact that reducing pollutant emissions by reducing energy consumption leads to economic slowdown. I realize that the ESG cause doesn't make these pros and cons clear.\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1057/978-1-349-95189-5_3015\n\nhttps://lifepowered.org/fossil-fuels-contribute-to-human-flourishing/\n\nIn this context, the alternative is to migrate to a less polluting energy matrix, but energy matrix transitions usually take long periods, as can be seen in this article:\n\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/global-energy-200-years\n\nI am raising these points because for this challenge to be more productive it is important that the community is aware of the root problems involved in environmental issues. The economic aspect cannot be put aside, otherwise the outcome can be disastrous.\n\nOne of the major problems with the climate change discourse is the hasty and uncritical search for the transition from a model where the energy source is oil to models with alternative sources of energy.\n\nEurope today is a good example of this, as in recent years the continent has embraced the ESG cause and abandoned energy independence by drastically reducing coal energy production and replacing it with gas imports, and creating wind and solar plants. With a season of low wind production, Europe ended up spending more of its energy stocks and became dependent on Russian natural gas and today we see the consequences, oil prices have increased by an order of magnitude due to dependence on Russia, the poorest European population is having to bear a huge cost of energy and Europe lost bargaining power to negotiate against Russia in the war in Ukraine. Due to low energy stocks, Europe now needs to reactivate coal plants, one of the most polluting energy sources, so we have to keep in mind that energy and the environment are part of a complex system and it is not possible to reduce consumption without waiting that it affects society in other negative ways.\n\nIf the ESG alternatives require higher costs for the population, the impact will be harder on the poorest population, so the environmental cause cannot be thought of as a silo. Electric cars are charged from electric energy, but if the energy matrix that generates electric energy is based on fossil fuels, the use of electric cars ends up not being something so positive.\n\nRegardless of that, there are some points where there is greater consensus, such as environmental pollution (rivers, oceans, air), destruction of forests and biodiversity in general, these are impacts more easily associated with human behavior.\n\nI see great potential for decentralized governance structures (DAOS/DISCOS) to play an important role in this case, as environmental and climate issues affect society as a whole and governments and companies have conflicting interests with each other, which makes it difficult to bring solutions , so I see that blockchain technology can be a helpful tool in the matter.\n\nThis challenge is within item 3 of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The challenge setting proposal included an archive with previous Catalyst fund proposals related to the theme, which shows the demand of this theme on Cardano community. There are several proposals already created aimed at the environmental cause, but the attached file presents some proposals with themes not directly related to the theme of this challenge, such as social inclusion and agriculture, but most of the proposals listed in the file are related to the theme suggested in the challenge and are possible to verify an adequate demand to the requested budget.\n\nMy recommendation would be to expand the theme of this challenge setting just a little bit, because from what has been described, the proposal is not limited to \"climate change\" but to proposals that aim to improve sustainability in the environment. By limiting the theme of the challenge to climate change and focusing on reducing greenhouse gases(see guiding questions of the challenge), some proposals related to environmental improvements may end up not fitting well within the scope of the challenge or not being well interpreted in the context of the challenge.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposed key metrics are not enough to assess the outcome of the challenge and some are subjective. e.g.\n\n\"Co2 impact estimation (direct and indirect)\"\n\nCO2 impact where?

There are a few groups that are already working on projects related to this subject, such as Cardano4Climate, the group that submitted this proposal, and Sustainable ADA. This challenge is directly related to Cardano\u2019s goal of creating real world solutions, and it is also very well aligned with Cardano\u2019s overall mission of creating a better a sustainable world. This topic has been extensively discussed by the community, and there was also some resistance by some community members that believed this shouldn\u2019t be a priority, but in my opinion these kinds of project have the potential of changing the public perception that blockchain is a technology that necessarily damages the planet. Having successful projects delivering their solutions related to Climate Change using Cardano blockchain would benefit not only the community, but the society as whole. In my opinion, it\u2019s already time to have this challenge included in a Fund. The budget of $500k is appropriate for a first-time inclusion in Catalyst. Based on all this, I believe the alignment of this challenge with Cardano\u2019s goal is very good.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As mentioned, there are already existing working groups that are proposing to use Cardano as a tool to build sustainable solutions, not only for Climate Change but for sustainability in general.

There have been proposals submitted that include the scope of Climate Change already and having a challenge specific for would make it certain that we would have proposals funded that would tackle the Climate Change topic. I believe there is enough people already in the community to submit enough high-quality proposals to use all the 500k ADA budget of this challenge, and this challenge would also help to onboard many people from other organizations that work on this area.

I would include also some other metrics related to the number of projects developed, companies and NPOs/NGOs onboarded, partnerships, and engagement (social media numbers) related to this challenge and the projects submitted in it.

However, I believe that we have reached a tipping point where doing only the minimum is no longer sufficient. Changes in climate have global impacts and a scale that is unprecedented, ranging from altering weather patterns that threaten food production to rising sea levels that threaten catastrophic flooding. No one can dispute this fact. The alignment with Cardano's mission may not be direct or explicit, but I would argue that there is no organization that does not consider the environment when planning its mid and long term strategy. Therefore, I would agree that the organization's mission is aligned with Cardano's. They clearly explained the context, the data, and the references that supported their decision to propose this challenge for consideration in the next round of funding. The indirect relationship between the strategic goals and the goal that strives to prepare people who are willing to contribute to the ecosystem could be argued since, ultimately, allocating a percentage of the budget incentivizes a demographic of people who may not be interested in blockchain technology.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In order to gain a better understanding of the community's interest in responding to the problem raised in this challenge, I thought it would be interesting to review the data from the previous fund. In order to do this, I used keywords such as energy, environment, carbon, clean, footprint, etc. I found that for Fund 8, 16 proposals were submitted in different challenges, of which 13 were approved by the community and only 2 were selected for allocation of funds. In total, the budget requested for the 13 proposals that have been approved amounts to more than $565,000, so the budget requested for the next fund does not appear to be unreasonable. The synergy that may occur if all these proposals and teams that are scattered and requesting budgets for different funds and challenges are consolidated into one location may enhance better initiatives and foster healthy competition among them. According to the team, the environment is not the main focus, so they are asking for 4% of the budget. But to be honest, I considered it a bit high, considering that this challenge has never been available to the community. This is why I decided to assign a score of 4.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team's description of success seems appropriate, simple and transparent to me. Thus allowing the community to understand the success or failure of this challenge in the medium and long term. The team presents metrics in two different sections within the challenge setting. In the section \"Key Metrics to measure\" they propose metrics that from my point of view are focused on measuring the performance of the challenge itself. Generally, I find them easy to measure except perhaps the one that measures the CO2 impact. In addition, there are a number of \"Proposal success metrics\" which are planned as questions, but I believe many of these are very difficult to measure. Finally, although the team does not include potential addresses for future proposers, it does include a series of guiding questions that, in my opinion, can be used to question anyone who wants to apply for this challenge. As an additional recommendation for the team, I would suggest including in the future some considerations to be taken into account by proposers that include the establishment of channels for continuous communication and reporting of progress and milestones with the community.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2142", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 1, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1329, "q0": "IF Cardano's mission has, as central to its goals, the transformation of the world into a better place, then central to achieving this goal is taking on Climate Change.
