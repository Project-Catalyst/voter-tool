Today there are just over 1000 projects being developed on top of Cardano. This data can be verified in the IOG media and articles. In Catalyst itself, there is a great demand for the development of Plutus solutions in various niches, such as marketplaces and DEXs. This indicates that there is a great demand for Plutus development and the Cardano community has the capacity to fill this challenge with quality proposals.\n\nWhen reading this challenge setting I noticed that its scope is within the scope of three other challenge settings proposed in Fund 9 (\"OSDE - Open Source Developer Ecosystem\"; \"Developer Ecosystem - The Evolution\" and \"Development & Infrastructure\") but this challenge has a narrower theme and is focused on improvements in Plutus, while the others are more open to solutions in the ecosystem development as a whole. \nI'm not discounting points due to the similarity of the challenges, just making an addendum so that the voters and proposers of the challenge settings pay attention to the situation. In this Fund, there are several challenge settings related to the developer ecosystem, this is not necessarily a problem as each of these challenge settings has a different focus, however it is important that voters understand that the combined budget of these challenge settings is 9,925M ADA, which correspond to about 78% of the entire budget for Fund 10. I have linked links to the challenges listed below. https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/422540 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/421335 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/423218 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/423220 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/423239 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414308 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/423211 It may be that none of the above challenges are funded or that they are all funded, this uncertainty makes it difficult to predict community demand on this challenge. It is difficult to assess the feasibility of this challenge in relation to the community's ability to meet the supply of funds, as if all challenges are funded, the supply of funds intended for this challenge tends to cause low competition compared to other non developer challenges. Low competition tends to result in fewer quality proposals. Judging by Fund8's data, there were two challenges themed to improve the developer ecosystem, \"Developer Ecosystem\" and \"OSDE: Open Source Developer Ecosystem\". The total requested/available budget ratio was 3.1 and 2.8 respectively, indicating a below-average competition when compared to the other challenges. In Fund 8 the total budget was $16M USD, the budget for the \"Developer Ecosystem\" and \"OSDE: Open Source Developer Ecosystem\" challenges represented $1M USD(6.25% of the Fund) and $1.2M USD(7.5% of the Fund) respectively . The combined budget available for the development ecosystem at Fund8 was $2.2M USD (13.75% of the Fund). Therefore, challenges dedicated to the developer ecosystem had 13.75% of the total available budget and a competition for funds below average in Fund8, this is an indicator that the combined budget of all challenge settings dedicated to the developer ecosystem of Fund9 is well above of reasonable and balanced demand for Catalyst. \n\nEach challenge setting must be evaluated on its own merit, so I don't think it's fair to deduct points due to the excess of challenge settings dedicated to the developer ecosystem in this Fund, but it's important that voters pay attention to this, as it fund most of these challenges can cause a resource imbalance in Fund10, causing other important areas to run out of resources. It is also important that the challenge setting proposers try to collaborate with each other and check the possibility of merging in similar challenge settings or if they do not believe that the best way is to merge, at least try to coordinate the budget definition together in order to make the distribution of more balanced funds. Note: Due to the similarity between the challenges and the situation I mentioned above, my assessments should present a relatively high degree of similarity, and I will make adjustments in the necessary points.

The idea is to make it as simple as possible to integrate solutions and software with Cardano, and at the same time, increase scalability and accessibility. Some of the potential directions mentioned are, for example, identify areas that lack tooling, make it easier to set up dev environments and facilitate debugging of Plutus code. This challenge covers very well many of the aspects that would indeed make it easier to start using Plutus, and this is a real struggle in the community since Plutus is known to have a steep learning curve, and even people who have been through the Plutus Pioneers course sometimes struggle with simple things, so there\u2019s a real need for this challenge. It directly addresses the goals of Cardano\u2019s mission for Fund 10 of preparing a group of people - by facilitating their onboarding - a groups of people to contribute to the ecosystem, attract more developers and indirectly to turn Cardano into an open-source project and build real-world solutions.

This budget is considerably high, but I believe due to the importance of this challenge, it is also appropriate. Additionally, a large budget would be necessary for this challenge due to the scarcity of Plutus developers, mainly experienced ones. It is crucial to have them working on the proposals submitted in this challenge because they know the struggles and can come up with ideas to make things easier. But at the same time, most of them are already working on their own dApps and projects, and for them to become interested in submitting proposals in this challenge and executing them, the budget should be attractive, and I think this has been addressed by the budget size. If ADA price gets closer to $1M, it might be challenging to have enough high-quality proposals to use the challenge\u2019s budget, but I don\u2019t see it as a big problem.
