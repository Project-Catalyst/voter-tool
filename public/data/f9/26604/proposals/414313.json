I believe this challenge would be important to encourage members/teams of the community that do not yet have a solid reputation and find it difficult to compete with popular projects in the community. This concept can make this challenge a wild card for proposals that are not suited to other challenges or that do not want to compete in other challenges where the reputation of the proposers can make a difference. An open scope challenge can be important for Catalyst, as it would prevent good ideas/proposals from running out of space if they are not aligned with the other available challenges, but there is no way to say that a broad scope challenge is critical in Cardano's mission( for the simple fact that we do not have a reference theme), so I will adopt a neutral score in this regard.\n\nDue to the challenge having a broad theme (no specific scope other than the need to be related to Cardano's blockchain) it is not possible to say that there is alignment with the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals, but I do not consider it fair to subtract points due to the peculiar nature of the challenge .\n\nI see an issue that has not been addressed in the context of this challenge. When reading the following excerpt from the challenge setting \"Nurturing ideas & teams is a category that applies a cap to the amount of funding a proposal can request. This provides a less competitive environment for teams to find initial funding to nurture their growth and evolution.\" we see that the idea is to limit the maximum budget that a proposal can request in order to create a less competitive environment for teams because in theory this would make more teams have space, but I haven't read any definition of how many proposals a team can submit and there is a recurring practice in Catalyst of teams that break a large budget proposal into several small budget proposals to hedge the risk of not being funded and avoid the randomness of the voting stage, where in these cases the proposer prefers to have some smaller budget proposals funded than no funded large budget proposal. This situation brings the possibility that teams abuse the model, submitting several lower budget proposals in the challenge and going against the objective of less competitiveness.\n\nThe only appeal of this challenge in relation to the importance on Cardano's mission would be the inclusiveness that it would bring (which would be something very important) to new teams and seed ideas, but it seems counterintuitive to me to create a challenge that intends to nurture these teams and at the same time have no restrictions on the number of proposals per team.\n\nWouldn't it be more promising to also limit the number of proposals per team/proposer in order to avoid this type of practice?\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Since this challenge has an extremely broad scope (any proposal that involves a solution on Cardano's Blockchain is suitable) there are no difficulties or doubts about the potential  of Cardano community to fill the challenge with several proposals. The only point that could raise doubts about the community's ability to address this challenge would be the maximum budget limit of $40,000 USD, however there are two arguments that clear the doubts, first that most proposals on Catalyst request a budget below $40,000 USD and second, even if a proposal is above $40,000 USD, it could be broken down into smaller budget proposals.\n\nThat said, these arguments indicate that the community is fully capable of meeting this challenge.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Due to the nature of the challenge (wide scope) defining key metrics and defining success is tricky and this is understandable, however the definition of success and key metrics mentioned are hardly indicative of success or outcome.\n\nI would recommend using more objective definitions. This key metric is confusing and doesn't say much:\n\n \"Increasing the number of new teams funded to support the ecosystem or offer new novel innovations\"\n\n\"Offering new novel innovations\" is an extremely inconclusive definition\n\nThe other two proposed key metrics are also confusing:\n\n\"Increasing the number of new and novel ideas that help the ecosystem learn about which ideas should receive more attention and funding in the future.\"\n\"Tracking whether funded proposals for this category help lead to education or further proposals to improve the ecosystem based on any learnings from tested ideas and analysis.\"\n\nAnother point is that there are no key metrics and definition of success over time, which increases uncertainty about how to assess the outcome in this challenge.\n\nI think it's important that Catalyst has a broad scope challenge, but if we can't establish effective ways to check the success of the challenge, we may need to rethink how we assess specific challenges like this one, as the guidelines offered in the Proposal Assessor Guide don't seem to be suit so well to border cases like this.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2048", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 7, "ng": 8, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 601, "q0": "This challenge proposal is part of the Funding Categories initiative that has been initiated by PACE and that aims to create new categories to better distribute the budget of a Fund and to cover all relevant areas of Catalyst and Cardano development. This challenge proposal, specifically, aims at allowing the submission of new ideas and teams that join Catalyst and want to try out different approaches to solve basically any kind of issue or challenge that the community is facing. The scope of this challenge is very broad, and potentially it could cover all of the goals of Cardano\u2019s mission for Fund10, but at the same time it does not guarantee that they are going to be addressed. Therefore, I believe that the alignment of this challenge proposal with Cardano\u2019s mission is good. For it to be ideal, I would have added the requirement that the proposals submitted in this challenge should address at least one of the Cardano\u2019s goals for Fund10, although I am not sure if this is the intention behind this proposal or not.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The definition of this challenge setting isso broad that it becomes similar to the Miscellanous Challenge, that has been present in Catalyst in a few funds, with the additional requirement that budget has to be limited to $40k and that proposals have to be novel, i.e. not a continuation from something that has already been funded or executed before. Because of this, there are plenty of different proposals that could be submitted in this challenge, and I don\u2019t see any big risks of the community not being able to propose and execute successful proposal in this challenge. This challenge can be used both by new teams and also by existing teams that want to test different approaches to solves issues they are already trying to solve. The budget requested is high, but as mentioned, I don\u2019t believe it would be a big risk to the community and I believe this challenge proposal is very feasibile.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer has added some KPIs to measure the success of this challenge. Two of these KPIs are related to the number of new ideas and teams that get funded through this challenge, and one is related to tracking the success of these funded proposals and the lessons learned that the community can take from them. The latter is not something easy to track and to measure, since it\u2019s very subjective, but at the same time I understand that coming up with a KPI that can cover basically any kind of proposal, since this challenge is so open for different ideas, might be something very difficult to do. And since this challenge would be a kind of Catalyst within Catalyst, if a proposal fails to achieve its goal, it is not necessarily a failure of the experiment, since the community can learn from it and don\u2019t repeat the same mistakes. The KPI proposed, then, is appropriate, even though it is not so easy to track.

However, I find that there is a dichotomy in my analysis because I consider metrics necessary to serve as a guide for future proposers, but on the other hand I understand it is a totally new approach to Catalyst and defining metrics at this point could restrict one type of proposal and be convenient for another.

This indicates that there is a demand and response capacity from the community as evidenced by the 54 proposals that were approved and the budget ceiling per proposal, which is higher than the budget defined for this category. As a result of the above, and in consideration of the fact that PACE allocated budgets to all categories, I consider it to be appropriate. Although it is not clear that the challenge team has already been defined, considering that these proposals are based on community building, I do not believe that this will be a problem we will face in the future should we be selected for the next fund.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The description of success is simple and appropriate for the objective of this challenge.

This is a result of seeing the category as being a cross between an incubator and an accelerator (new projects welcome, but don't expect a massive initial investment), as well as an entry point for the missing ingredient in the Funding Categories experiment:  radical innovation.  \n\nWhich brings us to the second limitation:  projects submitted under this proposal will often be considered \"exploratory\", in the sense that they may be indicating the need to adjust or pivot other challenge settings, or even create new challenge settings.  This isn't made explicit in the proposal itself (where certain language around exploring and \"developing new solutions\" is used), however when you read the documentation for this Funding Categories project, on this page (https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/catalyst-funding-categories/funding-categories/overview) there is this entry for this Category:  \"**Experimental categories**:  Exploration in any new funding categorization approach to see how it is used so that it can be analysed once used to inform future iterations and improvements.\"\n\nWhile it may be the intent to not have this analysis be a part of the actual proposal, I would caution that it is THE critical part of the proposal, and without it one should just vote for Miscellaneous (unless you really dig the $40k limit, in which case, knock yourself out).  This retrospective on new and challenging proposals is a necessary component to allowing data to drive decisions about how and when the Funding Categories experiment evolves, and it necessarily must be included.\n\nThough this information would have been better served in the proposal, I see no need to mark it down, since it was in the documentation.  In addition, the proposal effectively aligns with the mission statements for Fund 10, especially statement 1, due to the intent to support many small teams or projects in an iterative fashion to be able to contribute more fully.  5 stars for alignment.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "They refer the reader to their other proposals and documentation for a description of what proposals make sense under this category which makes sense:  teams seeking the less competitive environment (nurturing) are already well described elsewhere, and radically innovative projects, by their nature can't be described anywhere!  \n\nI do think this nurturing aspect, of creating actual space within Catalyst itself for project incubation, is something which fits where large parts of the community will be at with certain ideas, so it is definitely suitable to the community's current ability to carry it out. The voted-in budget at less than 8% of the total could very well prove to be low, but it is unlikely, especially given the budget limit for proposals in the category.\n\nOne issue that highlights, which is true for all of the Funding Categories, is unexpected results that come from one piece of the proposal being funded but not another.  While they are modular, voting is an unpredictable event, and you could very well see this AND Miscellaneous not only approved, but funded as well (this is actually highly likely, since there was much agitation over having  no Miscellaneous dedicated category in Fund9, so the community will likely overreact to having 2 to vote on).  This isn't a flaw in the proposal, but more a reality for the overarching approach that may need to be rethought if it goes sideways again (see: Dapps, Products and Integrations: a History).\n\nAll in all, I see no reason to mark this suggestion down for Feasibility, and believe it should receive the full 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There aren't any KPIs included (not unusual for a Misc challenge setting) but this statement actually does a better job than most KPIs and metrics that are typically included:  \"Proposers should clearly identify what problem they are trying to solve, how they aim to solve that problem and share the types of outcomes the community should expect after the proposal is executed.\"  That is really all that is needed, especially given the expectation for the unexpected in this category.\n\nIn addition they have two bullet points at the bottom that help clarify the approach for proposers to this category, particularly how opensource is better for innovation and verification (though not a requirement), and how collaboration may arise from studying the ecosystem for overlap with an idea.\n\nIf there is an issuer here, it is that the need for projects and challenge team to work together to capture data to inform the rest of the Category setting process hasn't been covered.  As mentioned, it is described in the documentation as an essential characteristic (which I agree with), but nothing has been provided for how to follow through with it, which in my opinion is a critical oversight.\n\nOverall, these principles provide enough guidance for proposers to clarify success for their project, despite not being tied down to specific KPIs, a difficult needle to thread for a Misc challenge setting.  It is unfortunate that it does not include metrics for analyzing that would provide the needed data for future iterations and improvements, as suggested in the documentation, so I am lowering the score by one star.  4 stars for verifiability.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3352, "q0": "Based on the information provided, I believe that this challenge setting proposal addresses all four strategic goals for fund 9. The challenge setting addresses the first strategic goal (prepare a group of people to make contributions to the ecosystem) by providing a lot of guidance to future proposers. For example, this challenge setting listed out good examples and guidelines, like types of proposals (which they listed as open so long as the proposals are related to the Cardano community) that can help proposers figure out what they want to develop. Additionally, the proposal is intended to target new or existing ideas that can benefit from smaller amounts of funding in order to facilitate initial exploration or growth efforts. As a result, the challenge setting will support many new smaller projects and the people behind them that can help build Cardano ecosystem. \n\nThe challenge setting also addresses the second strategic goal (build Cardano\u2019s open-source ecosystem and attract developers) by encouraging smaller groups to request funding. Since there are many new areas that can be explored, there are opportunities for developers to get into the Cardano ecosystem and find their own niches. Nurturing new projects will make developers feel like they have a place in the ecosystem, which can then attract even more developers who hear about the positive experience of building on the Cardano blockchain. The challenge setting has a statement at the bottom that says it encourages future proposers to make their projects open-source or at least provide transparency into how they plan to make their project open-source in the future. If future proposers listen to this statement, then this challenge setting has the capabilities to grow the open-source nature of Cardano.\n\nThe challenge setting addresses the third strategic goal (build real world solutions on the Cardano blockchain) through the nature of the challenge setting. What I mean by this is that encouraging the exploration of new areas or collaborating on already developing areas can have a huge impact on real-world solutions. One idea that comes to mind is the healthcare industry. I have heard about some projects that want to integrate healthcare onto the blockchain, but I imagine this is such a huge area for research and development that it will require much more time and manpower. As a result, a challenge setting, such as this one can allow people to get their first funding to work towards greater solutions that benefit people in real life. \n\nThe challenge setting proposal can address the fourth strategic goal (improve tooling to support human processes in Catalyst) if the future proposals are related to improving the Catalyst space. One example that would come to mind is all of the AIM platforms and integrations that help PAs and vPAs do their work in a more efficient manner. Maintaining pre-existing software as well as building new platforms could benefit from funding in this category, but it would also greatly help the human processes of Catalyst. This is just one example of how the challenge setting could address this strategic goal. Since I have no issues with anything the proposers mentioned, I can give this challenge setting a 5 for alignment. (score given: 5)\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Based on my experience and understanding of Cardano and Catalyst, I think that the Cardano community has the capacity to address this challenge. The idea of having such an open category for projects that want basic funding makes a lot of sense because it can attract many different developers. This challenge setting could encompass just about every smaller-budget proposal ever written, so the size of the group of developers that could address this challenge setting is huge. Every fund, more and more proposals are submitted, so it is clear that there is increasing demand for funding from a challenge setting for smaller projects.\n\nThe budget of the challenge setting is reasonable given the scope that it is trying to achieve. 1 million ADA is enough to fund many proposals. I also appreciate how the proposers said that no future proposal under this challenge can request more than $40,000 because it ensures that no single proposal can take a huge portion of the budget. One question I had that is associated with this is, should that number be denominated in ADA? Since challenge settings are denominated in ADA going forward, wouldn\u2019t it make sense to keep the cap for individual proposals a constant amount of ADA, instead of relying on the volatile price of ADA? If the price of ADA plummets, then less proposals would be able to request the maximum $40,000. Just a thought for the proposers to consider in the future, but I see an argument to either side: If the cap is kept at 40,000 in USD, then proposers would be able to get the actual amount of fiat money they wanted. This critique is more just my own commentary for the consideration of the proposers \u2013 either option is sufficient in my eyes \u2013 so I don\u2019t think that it actually takes away from the score of the proposal. (score given: 5)\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Based on the information provided in the challenge setting proposal, the challenge setting is well scoped in defining the metrics of success for its focus areas. The proposers were purposely general in wording the expected metrics of success for proposals because they understand that every proposal will be different. They did, however, provide guidelines that can be used by future proposers, such as proposers should identify what problem they aim to solve and include metrics/outcomes that the community should expect after the proposal is executed. The challenge setting also has some general metrics of success, such as tracking whether funded proposals from this category help lead to education or further proposals to improve/iterate on the learnings from tested ideas or analysis. This metric is especially important because it helps provide insight into whether the proposals from this challenge setting continue in other forms in the future. Since the suggested metrics are intentionally vague, I think that they can promote a healthy competitive environment because each individual proposer can choose how they want their proposal to address the challenge. Thus, there will be many competing proposals that all have their own unique ideas and problems to solve.

This challenge category will allow these trailblazing and pioneering proposers to connect and network with each other and test the water, check the wave before getting involved deeper and experiencing more complex situations and issues in Cardano and Catalyst community. The proposal budget cap will also prove to be beneficial in encouraging as much idea generation and participation as possible. The maximum budget cap also alleviates the stress from losing the resources community had staked and mitigate the risk and downside from less satisfying results and under deliveries. Margin of error tolerated from this kind of setup can encourage more iterations of ideas and executions from either new or existing members of Cardano community, thus accelerating the evolution of Cardano.\nThis sandbox-like environment similar with testnet is vital and essential in Cardano as a technological infrastructure and community since it promotes and actualizes the most adoption and collaboration possible between individuals at the highest level. Without any doubt, we can also see that this challenge category will help us achieve our critical missions and strategic goals for Fund 10 in attracting and preparing willing and able individuals to contribute to Cardano, developing real world solutions leveraging Cardano blockchain technology, encourage open-source mindset and implementation, and promote more efficiency and effectiveness as improvement in Catalyst works.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "By doing napkin math on this proposed challenge category, we can assume there will be maximum 25 proposals going to be submitted under this challenge category, assuming all proposals are budgeting to the maximum cap (USD 40,000) allowed in this challenge funding amount requested (USD 1,000,000). The most rational and accurate comparison of this challenge category will be the Miscellaneous Challenge in previous Fund 8. The Miscellaneous Challenge in Fund 8 concluded with 24 proposals funded with budget ranging from USD 5,000 to USD 45,000. Based on this supporting fact, it is safe to say that we Catalyst have the resources and capabilities to address and manage the processes and deliveries from this challenge category.\nThe diversity and variety will not be a concern since this is fundamentally a challenge functioning as a catch-all. Considering the proposals will have fair funding to start with and reasonable duration of at least six months, I also have high conviction that community can expect a sufficiently satisfying and robust results and deliveries from the proposals. Previous Miscellaneous Challenge team members in Fund 7 and 8 can also start working together with PACE, combining their accumulated experiences and skills from previous funds with research and analysis about Funding Categories framework model studied by PACE. This collaborative effort will help developing an overall more efficient and effective model for Cardano governance in general and Catalyst in particular. No organic platform is better than Catalyst and no challenge is better than the described Nurturing Ideas and Teams to be the breeding ground for this kind of innovation.\nMy suggestion for improvement of this Nurturing Ideas and Teams proposal is we can also regulate that a certain proposer or team of proposer can only submit one proposal in this challenge. This will limit resource centralization to certain individual or interest group and even preventing malicious actor trying to game our system and resources by submitting multiple proposals in this relatively low-barrier challenge category. The other important positive effect we Cardano and Catalyst community can benefit from is the promotion and enhancement of healthy and productive competition while also being equal opportunities to all vast and diverse members of community, existing or new.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Upon general reading of the proposal, it is a tad difficult to determine a set of tangible metrics to measure the progression and result precisely and accurately, thus the success, of this challenge category. This difficulty could arise from the fact that the scope of this challenge is so broad that mentioning several specific metrics or KPIs will be irrelevant or not do some proposals submitted to the challenge justice. We can consider this as a trade-off by choosing creativity and discovery to be the mainly encouraged qualities in this proposal. Still, given enough time and iterations, we can start figuring out how to improve the verifiability of such broad challenge category. PACE has vastly initiated this valuable study and wider member of community can help contributing to the betterment and advancement of this challenge.\nTherefore, a rating of four stars for now will push the boundaries for everyone curious to solve and improve the current condition. I believe that these never-ending endeavours to set foot in novel and unexplored lands, always exploring new possibilities, and never-settle attitude are what makes life exciting and worthy to be lived.

In essence, they ask for the entire funding available in F10, and offer a unique distribution of funds along several categories which have been previously selected by the community through a complex mechanism, culminating with an open vote for whomever wanted to take part. Any voter entirely supporting their approach should thus vote for the encompassing \u201cFunding Categories Full Fund\u201d. If, however, one feels that the approach goes a bit too far, this proposal is simply one piece of PACE\u2019s puzzle. \n\nThis challenge is peculiar in two different ways: \n- it reached its shape following an open but intricate process. This fresh alternative to the classical challenge setting process overcomes many of its downsides (low entry barriers for malicious actors, unilateral budget weighting, limited understanding of challenge teams, suboptimal time consumption, etc.) and aims to be more efficient, flexible, scalable as well as legitimate. \n- it applies a cap to the maximum amount of funding that any proposal can request (40.000 USD) in the hope that this will create a less competitive environment for any idea. \n\nLet\u2019s see if it also has the capacity to deliver on of the strategic goals from Fund 9. Can this challenge help prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem? Can it turn Cardano into an open source project and attract developers? Can it help build real-world solutions based on the Cardano? Can this challenge improve tooling to support human processes in Catalyst?\n\nI dare to say that most likely the answer is no to all of these questions, or at least that there are no guarantees for any of them. There are a number of reasons why I think so: \n\nFirst, there will be an utter lack of real competition. Without offering a real environment for the ideas to compete in (given its very broad nature, with almost no boundaries of what can be brought forward) proposers will not have clear reference point as to what is voters will expect from them, and this can turn into a breeding ground for opportunistic ideas, ones lacking clear objectives, niche proposals or anything in between. Perhaps a bad analogy, but we will be recreating a primordial soup from which life began at some point. But how long will it take for a good few ideas funded this way to gain traction and be successful? Will it be worth the cost of funding perhaps 99.9% unsuccessful ones? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nSecond, the proposal sets a relatively high maximum request, 40k USD. Stretching things a bit, 25 ideas requesting the maximum budget would deplete the entire funding available. In these conditions there is no guarantee that the challenge will foster innovation through the sheer number of ideas supported. \n\nThird, there are no guarantees for attracting developers either. Serious development teams will most likely have budget needs exceeding the maximum allowed in this challenge, so their appetite to compete in this challenge will be limited by this fact. \n\nI shall end my argument here, with a rather grim outlook for this challenge\u2019s alignment with the strategic goals, and deem only three stars appropriate.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Does the Cardano community have the capacity to address this challenge? Its capacity to address this challenge is undeniable. The strongest argument is the fact that Catalyst has been running for eight rounds already, with the last two of which being fully-fledged in terms of overall budget, and we have seen a consistent, and increasing, number of teams and proposals sprouting within it, across all previous challenges. This F9 alone has a 6.8X competition, thus requests for funding almost seven times higher than the available funds. So under normal circumstances we should see even higher numbers in this challenge. My \u201cguesstimation\u201d is that 10x the budget is not so far fetched.   \n\nIs the budget realistic and reflecting the requirements of the challenge? While the budget is realistic, I think a missed opportunity was to perform a quantitative analysis and observe what kind of proposals were submitted in the previous rounds in terms of budget. My biggest worry here is that the 40k USD cap for the proposal is too high, and it might consume the budget too quickly and without funding a critical number of ideas. \n\nFive stars from my side, despite the rather high cap for individual proposals.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "To assess the challenge\u2019s verifiability, we go one more time through the process of turning the verifiability statement from the guide into a fundamental question and answer it:  \n\n(1) Is the challenge well scoped in defining the measures of success? \nNot really, since the onus of defining the measures of success will be placed on the proposers\u2019 shoulders. We know from previous funding rounds that this is a rather hit and miss process, and it will not be easy or trivial for them to come up with valid frameworks for judging the merits of their own proposals. I also suspect that this phenomenon will be exacerbated at the lower end of the spectrum (small teams, lower budget requests) and will be very poignant in this challenge too.  \n\n(2) Can the challenge drive healthy competition between proposals?\nThe very broad scope of the challenge also implies a good potential for competition. But what kind? I dare to make another analogy and predict that this challenge will turn into a jungle of proposals, with similar jungle laws governing the ecosystem. We\u2019ll probably have a few popular ideas, highly visible and loved by the voters, but as well a myriad of smaller proposals trying to achieve success (receive funding) through many different tactics: beauty contests, over promising, small budgets to not be spotlighted, confusion by obscurity, etcetera. \n\nI know that I am painting a rather grim picture of what things might be, instead of focusing on the more positive aspects (lots of collaboration, nurturing community, sharing of ideas, combining efforts), but only experimenting will tell us if supporting such a challenge is a mistake or a brilliant strategic move. I am still unconvinced that the community will be able to ensure verifiability for this challenge, so only three stars.

There is one large challenge setting proposal that fully represents this idea, asking for the entire fund to be reallocated into these funding categories. The remaining 7 proposals represent the individual funding categories that are subsumed in this larger idea. Part of the idea is that the funding category system will eliminate waste by not having overlapping challenge settings. To do this all of the categories work together to form an inclusive circle. Breaking the funding categories into their representative pieces and including each of the categories separately as a challenge setting proposal is counterproductive to the overall idea.\n\nHowever when taken out of the context of the overall experiment, this challenge setting has many qualities of it's own. It can be compared to past Miscellaneous challenge setting in that it is open to all ideas/proposals that may not fit well into other challenges. If you do compare it to Miscellaneous you will note many improvements like encouraging proposers to include collaborations and open source plans. There is a focus for including new proposers and new groups that want to make contributions to the Cardano ecosystem while also including a budget cap of $40,000 per proposal to help create a less competitive entry point for proposers and be more inclusive of fringe ideas and novel innovation. These additions bring this broadly inclusive challenge setting more in alignment with challenge setting strategic goals so I see no reason to deduct any stars for aligning less with the larger idea within the proposal of converting to Funding Categories.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "To determine the budget for this challenge setting the PACE team conducted a community vote where participants assigned a percentage of the total fund available for fun 9, to 7 categories, with one of the categories being Nurturing Ideas and Teams. This is an interesting idea to determine the budget of a challenge setting and might be a good indicator that the budget is aligned with community support of that particular area.\n\nThe challenge team has provided an extensive road map for proposers in this challenge setting highlighting the exploration of new ideas to benefit the ecosystem and encourage growth. They emphasize open source discloser and disclosure of other projects and connections the proposers and teams may have. Also included is a budget cap of $40,000. This targeting of proposers with smaller budgets makes it more likely that there will be a higher number of proposals that might in turn make it more likely for these smaller pieces to come together to build something bigger.\n\nIt seems likely that there will be a great deal of community activity within this challenge setting. For these reasons I would call this a well organized and comprehensive successor to the miscellaneous challenge setting.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "We can easily see the need for a challenge setting that supports new ideas and teams and provides a place for ideas that might not fit into other challenge settings. If we consider the similarity between the Miscellaneous challenge settings attempt to accomplish these goals, we can see that Nurturing Ideas and Teams provides more opportunity for community auditing with there extensive proposer road map, while keeping the over arching key metrics to measure just as basic.\n\nBecause of the wide variability that can be seen in a challenge setting like this it is difficult but important to have a metric that can still be applied. Some things like number of proposals submitted is an obvious measurable but does not support the intent that a challenge setting like this is trying to attain so also including the question of if a proposals in this challenge provided motivation or support  for other proposers is an important question for verifying purposes.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3545", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 13872, "q0": "This fund 10 challenge setting proposal \u2018Nurturing Ideas & Teams\u2019 from PACE is a type of sub-proposal from their main \u2018Full Fund\u2019 package. In the \u2018Full Fund\u2019 the proposers detailed 7 all encompassing categories to split the challenge into, rather than individual challenges. The detail, effort and thought gone into the main proposal is astounding, so instead of risking its disapproval if it doesn\u2019t get the highest possible votes, I think the proposers are submitting the categories separately as well, in the form of a backup plan. I believe this is a relevant detail when examining this proposal as the categories or parts they have developed, as a whole, do indeed cover all of the Cardano Catalyst strategic goals, however, individual categories, such as this proposal do not necessarily achieve all the goals stated.\n\nExamining this particular category in terms of the challenge setting goals, the Nurturing Ideas & Teams proposal contributes to the first goal listed, preparing people to contribute to the ecosystem. The proposers describe the aim of supporting new ideas and for teams to form - this will directly enable more people to make contributions to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nSimilarly, due to the open nature of proposals that could be submitted in this proposed category, it also connects with the fourth strategic goal. That goal states challenges should \u2018improve tooling to support human processes in Catalyst.\u2019 This challenge could lead to new initiatives and new opportunities for everyone within Catalyst to learn and benefit from, however, it is not a specified requirement that the proposals adhere to this goal.\n\nThe category itself is a promising and previously used idea, almost a \u2018miscellaneous\u2019 challenge of sorts. The proposers have limited the funding requests to $40,000 and the overall budget to 1,000,000 ADA. However, there\u2019s no guaranteed value in regards to Cardano\u2019s mission that can be accomplished from this category. There may indeed be amazing small proposals that add high value and impact, or there could be some interesting ideas that are not overall supporting the strategic goals. For this reason, I rate this proposal 4 stars for alignment.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In terms of feasibility, a challenge that is broad and open leads to a vast variety of possible proposals. The proposers state within the description \u2018All proposal ideas are welcome\u2019 with some caveats that they must be somehow related to the Cardano ecosystem. They further list suggestions including: community initiative, marketing, development or support, to help guide potential proposal writers. This small almost \u2018seed\u2019 fund section is a good idea to test run initiatives before they align their proposal within a main category and have a full implementation plan for their project.\n\nIn Fund 8, we saw the successful miscellaneous challenge fund, with a similar design brief and instructions to this proposal. With a budget of $500,000, in Fund 8, over 140 ideas were submitted. Sure, some were way off task, but the sheer number competing for this limited amount meant that some truly ingenious proposals got their first chance at funding success. As an educator for many years, sometimes students develop their best work outside classroom settings, through experiential learning, field trips or just day to day life. Connecting to this, some teams and proposals just don\u2019t fit within the normal funding challenges, yet have a lot to show and offer the community.\n\nI think the Catalyst community can easily rise to the challenge to provide many quality proposals within this proposed funding category. I rate it 5 stars.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal team have attempted to add criterias and suggested metrics to adequately record the challenge progress, however, being an \u2018open\u2019 challenge this is difficult to do. Within the challenge, the team can track the increased number of teams or ideas that round, and also possibly teams that \u2018graduate\u2019 with a successful test idea to apply for funding in further rounds. They also hope to be able to track whether some of the proposals lead to education within the ecosystem based on trialing new methods.\n\nThe success metrics for potential proposals within this proposed challenge category are less defined. The team articulates that people should identify a problem, solution and their own outcomes for the community. While this is marginally helpful, it doesn\u2019t provide nearly enough support for new proposers and I would hope the suggested measures for success could be developed further within the PACE team, given many of their other proposals have highly detailed suggestions. I feel this could be a major hurdle to new proposers and their proposals, without having strong guidelines and metrics for success, so I am rating this proposal 3 stars for verifiability.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3840", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "importance": "There is a need for a diverse group of teams and ideas exploring different ways to innovate and support the ecosystem", "success": "An increasing number of small initiatives and ideas that provide new opportunities to the ecosystem to learn and benefit from"}
