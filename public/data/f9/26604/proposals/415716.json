There is real world use for crypto in Latin America (think shaky monetary systems in many of the countries of the region, think remittances, etc). This proposal is one of proposals that emulated the model of \u201cGrow Africa, Grow Cardano\u201d \u2013 to obtain funding. Yet, I think that it might be time to move a bit away from the continent-based challenges in order to focus more on ideas, especially as Cardano\u2019s mission is not overtly continent based \u2013 but rather global. Continents, such as Africa, South America, etc.., are as diverse inside as they may seem similar from the outside. Even Brazil is often known under the acronym Belindia \u2013 an amalgam of Belgium and India. The challenge question is wide enough \u201cHow do we increase Cardano adoption on our countries?\u201d \u2013 to encompass almost every project touching on Cardano in the Latin American region. However, that might be a bit of a weakness of this type of challenge \u2013 its lack of focus on the global priorities of the Cardano mission and Fund 9 (despite the seemingly strong focus on a continent) \u2013 as every region of the world could equally claim the right to a challenge in Fund 10 as in each region of the world Cardano wishes to spread its gospel. The challenge does address the Fund 9 goals 1, 2, 3 and 4 \u2013 but all of them partially as it narrows its scope to one part of the world \u2013 which itself (as an approach) is not Cardano\u2019s mission which is a global mission. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The Latin American community is pretty strongly present in Cardano and I would think that there are many proposers that could participate. The proposed success criterion \u201cMaking innovative projects that can bring real solutions to the people\u201d seems overly general to me and combined with the very general nature of the challenge (focus on Latin America) \u2013 it sounds like an invitation for many projects that may have or not have sufficient focus. I am also worried about the fact that many projects might try to include a Latin American angle (developer, token local partnership, etc.) just in order to formally fit in into this challenge. The asking budget for this challenge is pretty large at ADA1,000,000 for a Latin America based challenge and I feel that the challenge is so general that the feasibility of organizing a challenge that provides sufficient value for money might be compromised by the very large budget. The challenge brief is a bit too simplistic for my liking \u201cWe need to make Cardano grow in our countries\u201d as it focuses more on growing Cardano, than on providing real life use and utility. If this proposal for a challenge is not voted in this round, I would advise the proposers to shake up the now partially stale concept of \"Grow XXXX, Grow Cardano\u201d and to reimagine a new form of more focused challenge that would be more laser-focused on the specific needs of a certain category or groups of potential and likely Cardano users in the whole \u2013 or part of Latin America \u2013 or even without the geographical connotation. The budget of ADA 1million seems too high for a challenge that does not focus on a priority area for Cardano \u2013 I would argue that only Africa has been singled out as a priority area and that is also a priority that has been determined by IOG, one of the many players in the Cardano ecosystem. Hence, I question the feasibility of spending so much money and whether there are enough GOOD projects to share it. If the proposal is not accepted this time around, I would advise resubmission in the next fund with a smaller budget.

As this is not the first time that this challenge was proposed (I think that it has been voted in previously as well) \u2013 I would have liked to see more information from the proposers about which metrics have proven to be useful and how have they performed in the \u201cGrow XXXX, Grow Cardano\u201d challenges. There have been a handful of \u201cGrow XXXX, Grow Cardano\u201d challenges until now and there is real life information about some success stories and failures from these challenges that could impact the development of more precise metrics for the newly proposed \u201cGrow Latin America, Grow Cardano\u201d challenge. I would have liked to see feedback about what has been learned from these types of challenges and what type of growth has really been achieved. Hence, I remain a bit more skeptical - without that feedback \u2013 about the true verifiability of the impact of this challenge. As the proposers of this Challenge Setting are keen on improving the participation of Latin America in Cardano, one of the proposed metrics \u201cOffer Cardano solutions to real problems\u201d could have been more specific \u2013 by identifying some \u201creal problem categories of importance for Latin America\u201d that could be specifically targeted by the challenge. As it stands now, the challenge could be merged into a wider single \u201cGrow Cardano\u201d challenge, as it does not highlight any specific needs, domains or problems that face Latin America in particular.

I would like to see more arguments about the Latin American backgroudn to justify the importance of the challenge. I was born and live in Latin America and I understand the problems faced by being part of this context, but Catalyst and Cardano is a global community and many people do not understand the problems and importance of prioritizing development in LATAM x in the world as a whole.\n\nCardano has a global community and although many people are aware of the problems faced at LATAM, it is important to provide more detailed sources, articles or rationales in the description of the challenge, as this will define how critical this challenge is in the Cardano's mission.\n\nAs in Africa, which has major problems of infrastructure, connectivity, unbanked population and several socio-economic problems, Latin America suffers from these problems as well, but to a lesser extent.\n\nThis article (https://www.statista.com/chart/26757/cryptocurrency-adoption-world-map/) cites Chainalisys as a source and indicates that LATAM has similar adoption to Asia. When talking about adoption it is important to discern the context of adoption, in some countries adoption may be due to political issues in other countries financial. In Argentina and Venezuela we see greater adoption of cryptos in LATAM, most likely due to the chaotic financial issues of these countries. Venezuela and Argentina both face hyperinflation and despite inflation being around 10% worldwide, in these two countries it is more than 60% a year in Argentina and in Venezuela well above 100% a year during the last years.\n\nRegarding social problems, I can highlight the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, which has caused hunger and a large migration of Venezuelans to neighboring countries. There is also the issue of authoritarian governments and exchange controls, where citizens are prohibited from trading local currencies for currencies of other countries such as the dollar. At this point cryptocurrencies have been a lifesaver for many to maintain their financial wealth and/or not starve to death (literally).\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/opinion/sunday/venezuela-bitcoin-inflation-cryptocurrencies.html\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/23/axie-infinity-finds-ready-players-in-hyperinflation-racked-venezuela/\n\nRegarding unbanked people, LATAM does not have as bad a scenario as there is in Africa, but it is still very promising for leapfroging blockchain-based financial solutions in more precarious communities.\n\nhttps://medium.com/the-capital/the-unbanked-and-financially-excluded-ba55805dbb1c\n\nhttps://insights.invyo.io/latam/fintech-corner/why-the-banking-industry-should-bet-on-latam/\n\nThis challenge is in line with items 1, 2 and 3 of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals.\n\nDue to the similarity between the \"Cardano support for Latin America\" \u200b\u200band \"Gron Latin America, Grown Cardano\" challenges my assessments will have a higher similarity level.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This challenge was already present in Fund 7 of Catalyst, with the budget of $500,000 USD and the total requested budget was around $2.5M, so a moderate available funds/required funds ratio.\n\n If all approved proposals were funded the budget would need to be around $1.5M USD. The demand observed in this challenge indicates a significant demand from the Cardano community for challenges in LATAM, which is a positive indicator for the feasibility and capacity of the community to address the challenge. Cardano's LATAM community is also growing and participating more in project development, a few months ago LATAM TownHall was started and has helped to expand the LATAM NO Catalyst community as well.\n\nOn the other hand this challenge this challenge (\"Grown Latin America, Grown Cardano\") has a large overlap area (almost identical) with the challenge \"Cardano support for Latin America\" whose required budget is $1.153M ADA. It is important for voters to keep this in mind, as if these two challenges become funded, there will be a budget of around $2.1M ADA, around 16% of the total Fund 10 budget for proposals in LATAM, which I see as a certain imbalance in relation to other Catalyst challenges. This rationale is for the voters' consideration only and will not influence the score I am assigning to this proposal, as each challenge setting must be evaluated on its own merits. Challenge setting overlaps are a problem in Catalyst as they can cause major fund imbalance in certain areas and I would recommend that proposers pay attention to this and try to collaborate with other proposers to set an appropriate joint budget and avoid redundancy in challenge settings.

Which in turn alienates minorities in the community. Minorities here does not mean a small number of Cardano supporters, but more towards the impact a specific community has on the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nHence the importance of Region Specific Challenges, which allows the citizens in these region to develop solutions that are detached from the development mindset of Western Hemisphere/Developed nations. One huge aspect of almost all region specific Challenge Setting is their lack of human resources that can develop on top of Cardano. This handicap unaddressed will always render minorities to the mercy of groups with abundance of Cardano based human resources.\n\nThis MUST be understood by everyone in the community. The community must look at themselves, left and right and ask themselves, are we Cardano diverse enough? When we can confidently say we are diverse enough, decentralization happens by itself.

It will probably take 3 (three) years to reach a maturity where decisions made are highly effective, communications happens easily and coordination has become a system.\n\nAs mentioned, LATAM has shown consistent growth, but without funding they will slowly die out. They can not yet live from operating an SPO, their only chance is through Project Catalyst.

The Latin American country of El Salvador is the first country in the world to legalize Bitcoin as a legal tender. El Salvador is also becoming the favorite country for crypto enthusiasts.
