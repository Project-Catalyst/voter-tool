The inspiration for this series began with the aim of focusing on the local development of Africa, over time new series challenges were created, each to encourage the development of a local community.\n\nThe objective of this challenge setting is to develop and expand the access of the Arab community to Cardano, however the challenge description does not provide enough information about the context of the Arab community, further refinement is needed so that it is possible to understand if the challenge is critical in the Cardano mission . What hurdles does the Arab community face? What are the social and economic conditions in the Arab countries? The proposer mentions that a large part of the population of Arab countries is under 18 years old, which can be an argument to encourage development due to the demographic and productive potential of the population, but I would recommend providing sources whenever a statement or numerical data is used as an argument.\n\nSome parts of the challenge brief do not make sense, perhaps the proposer is not fluent in English and used a translator, which is understandable, if this is the case, I would recommend looking for a mentor on Catalyst or assistance from someone fluent in English to check if the description of the challenge setting is understandable.\n\nIn general, expanding Cardano's development in different areas of the world is something positive and important in Cardano's mission, after all mass adoption involves different communities, but due to the lack of clarification and details in the challenge description, the alignment assessment is limited.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "It is not clear enough what kind of solutions can be created in this challenge.

Hemisphere, Grow Cardano\" and \"Grow Africa, Grow Cardano\" challenges.\n\nI would recommend coordinating the definition of challenge settings with the other proposers in order to avoid overlapping themes. Overlapping themes brings uncertainty about demand for certain challenges and makes it difficult to assess feasibility.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The definition of success is not understandable and there are no key metrics, so there is no way to gauge the outcome of the challenge.

This youth is a great potential for Cardano ecosystem to thrive in Arabic-speaking regions, and the world.\n\nFor challenge as such, similarly to challenges of other regional communities, there is definitive possibility that this challenge, reaches all the 4 fund9 strategic goals, as it tries to engage with new minds and spaces.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "All the necessary points to make this challenge feasible, by the Cardano community, are presented in concise manner.\nThe challenge asks Arabic-speaking members to propose ideas, documentation, and videos.

Please be advised to edit and add more information about these examples.\nUnder challenge brief it is said that, there is a percentage of very wealthy Arabic people, and they are open to invest in ecosystems and future of the blockchain.

There are already some proposals that got funded through and were executed that aimed at translating content to Arabic, for example, some proposals submitted in the Grow Africa, Grow Cardano callenge, as well as some focusing Asia. Since this challenge would be focusing a group of people instead of limiting the scope of the proposals submitted in there, is it possible that the proposals will contribute to all of Cardano\u2019s goals for Fund 10, even though it is not possible to guarantee that since the scope if very open.

Having a strong sense of community, Cardano understands that in order to become the financial operating system of the world, it is necessary to provide similar financial opportunities to populations that have traditionally been marginalized by traditional financial institutions and governments. However, it is also important to take advantage of the market that has been handled informally until now, and to demonstrate successful use cases that will strengthen blockchain's position as an alternative to today's established practices. This particular case presents a different approach, which is not based on geographic limitations, but rather on linguistic considerations. I believe the establishment of this challenge for the next fund may provide exposure to a demographic group that had not previously been targeted at this level due to language limitations, and therefore I see an alignment with one of the fund's strategic goals.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regularly challenges that seek to address the needs of a particular geographic area, and are a great way to attract a demographic that might not otherwise have known about Catalyst. However, I believe that after 8 funds we have enough data to allow us to understand or weigh arguments. For example, in this case after reviewing the available data from Fund 3, I could only find two proposals with a focus on topics associated with this challenge, neither of which were selected for funding. On the other hand, to broaden my search field I took as a reference an article published in Tarjama (shorturl.at/acDT3) where the countries with the largest Arabic Speaking population are mentioned, which are Egypt, Algeria, Sudan, Iraq, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. I used the names of these countries as a keyword in the Catalyst history and found no proposals that seek to solve problems in these countries. The data presented above does not allow me to assert that there is sufficient community capacity to respond to this issue. Of course making clear that in my experience, the previous signs that a challenge is needed in some region is the previous proliferation scattered in different challenges in past challenges. I recognize that this is not true for all cases but in this case it seems to me a good indication that leads me to assign a score of 3.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In the hypothetical case that this challenge would be selected for the next fund, the description of success is a bit confusing, and does not reflect what would be expected to be considered \"success.\" The metrics presented are also unclear to me.

However, i am not sure about the appealing of the blockchain technology and its usage on the Cardano ecosystem, in order to provide these resources in Arabic as well. The fact that the language is spoken widely abroad doesn't necessarily come with blockchain adoption. Should you provide such information, maybe it will be easier to assess if that kind of a challenge will have a societal impact on the ecosystem.

So the prep goes both ways.\n\nAnd while there are implications here for the idea of improving UX and tooling, the other Fund 10 goals are not as well represented here, which may leave a void where proposers have some trouble creating highly relevant or meaningful proposals.

It is the balance between the amount of support provided in this area and the scope of the challenge that support ultimately circumscribes that determines how well targeted the budget is for any given challenge, so it should be understood that the lack of these details makes it difficult to assess the budget allocation as well.\n\nThe proposer should consider including examples of proposals that would satisfy the goals or mission statement of any given fund (for example, \"how can we capture data surrounding Arabic contributions to core repos in the development community, and how can those participation levels be improved?\" would address the goal of Opensource Community in Fund 10).  Also useful are identification of problem areas or issues that can inspire solutions and approaches for a community to bridge themselves to Catalyst and Cardano.\n\nIn the absence of such guidance, I can neither agree nor disagree with this being a Feasible challenge setting, so I will leave it at 3 stars.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Like Feasibility, there is a lack of details (it looks like a misunderstanding on the part of the proposer) regarding metrics that proposers can use to dial their projects in with meaningful, actionable, achievable objectives and goals that align with the Fund goals.\n\nExamples include metrics around participation levels of things like Town Hall events funded by the challenge, increases and rates of increases in participation in Opensource repos around Cardano, etc.  Basically any kind of measurable that helps proposers effectively target their proposals and set quality objectives or create relevant milestones.

One of these countries, the UAE, has a dedicated blockchain center in Dubai, and the government intends to make Dubai the blockchain center of the world.
