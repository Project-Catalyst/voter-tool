I think it should have been launched in the challenge which relevant history or human rights (maybe). The idea is excellent and meaningful: creating a blockchain-based digital repository of human rights and historical documents critical to the Rohingya people. The author states that this project would be of a non-custodial nature which enables the permanent storage of data in a decentralised manner. However, I didn\u2019t think it is in line with the challenge because it is not certain if Cardano will benefit from it and the connection between this project and the legal/financial fields. The proponents explain the problem situation and their proposed solutions very well but dedicate very little space in the impact part to explain the connection parts referring to legal framework or finance services on Cardano would be improved and developed. Because the purpose of this challenge is to fund projects that are beneficial to our blockchain, especially helping the other projects would broaden their horizons and increase their impact on the Cardano ecosystem once legal and financial frameworks are explored and established. So as far as impact is concerned, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re clear on whether the challenge\u2019s objectives would be met.

All that is said is what is expected to be ready from July 2022 to June 2023. The proponents also explain what would be done, but the establishment of the schedule is very superficial. The proponents give only a cursory idea of the activities that would be done along the way (almost 1 year). Regarding the budget, the asking value is high (40 thousand dollars). It is divided into two parts, and these are just mentioned. Once again, the proponents don\u2019t say how that part would be managed. We would need to understand where that money would go, and how long would the professionals involved perform this project? what \u201cDocumentation collection through field officer and community mobilization\u201d would be, how \u201ctechnical upgrades to existing R-Archive Interfacc\u201d would happen, how the work routine of the professionals involved would be, and the price of their working hours,\u2026 We could not reliably understand how the requested money would be used; much more detail and clarity would be needed. It\u2019s not very clear. Finally, speaking of the team, I think this part is good, knowing in detail who the team members are: their names, areas of activity, functions, and brief resumes. However, we do not have links to any of their social networks (LinkedIn profile, telegram, Github, for example, where we could see practical evidence of everything that was said. Overall, I think it would be necessary for more detailed explanations to be attached to each of these parts.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "All metrics chosen to measure progress are numerical. It would also be important to have qualitative information, that is, understand in a more human way how things are happening. In my view, this says about the measurement of partial goals, but not what is behind it, we need to understand how the pre-production of the project would be being done, if the money was being used properly if each professional involved would be doing the activities that were assigned to them. And talking about the final success, no scenario is drawn, it is only said that the success would be measured by some numerical indications given (number of actual documents collected on the ground, number of Rohingya community members engaged in the project, data storage space allocated for document file storing, upgrading of interface to allow for easier user meta data filtering and uploading experience). I think that\u2019s the basics. In addition to knowing if it happened, we also need to know how it happened, what impacts were generated for Cardano, and how this can be measured directly.

The use of Arweave seems particularly applicable for this use case as well. If successful the model itself could even become the standard for NGOs operating in countries where the local systems are not trustworthy to safeguard information. All that said there is one significant problem and that is that the proposal does not utilize Cardano or provide utility for Cardano or Catalyst. As such this proposal simply does not meet the criteria of the challenge or really of proposals on Catalyst in general. As a suggestion for the proposer perhaps finding a way to incorporate Cardano into the proposal would open possibilities for funding. For example this proposal seems very well suited for the use of a DID and storing that Cardano DID along with the stored document on Arweave. Reaching out to projects involved in that space may be beneficial. Unfortunately at this time I disagree and see some serious issues. The answer does not meet most of the criteria.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal itself is quite straightforward and most of the costs involved are related to logistics, training and some streamlining UX/UI work. Some more details about what specific UX/UI work is being looked at would be beneficial for a better assessment of the project and I would recommend elaborating on that. There is a roadmap, expected timeframes, a cost breakdown, and everything seems reasonable to achieve. The team for this project is highly qualified and has the relevant experience necessary to successfully implement this proposal. There was a short bio provided for each team member however no outside links to use to verify. As a suggestion for the team, providing this upfront would make it easier to assess your proposals in the future. However a quick google search of the team members provided the verification required.

There are quantifiable KPIs including the key metric of getting to 1000 documents stored on chain. The proposer has also committed to publishing progress reports for the community which is another good tool for this. However in future proposals I would recommend to the proposer to identify how this information would be shared with the community in the proposal. A web page would be a simple solve for this. With that said however this certainly is not a huge issue and I'm sure this team would be capable of finding a way to get those reports to the community therefore; I strongly agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2113", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2952, "q0": "This project is a very good one and a much elaborated proposed solution which makes me happy about the project. Unfortunately, the described proposal does not address the challenges that it finds itself. This challenge seeks to satisfy emerging projects in catalyst that faces legal and financial issues which block them from progressing with their funded projects. There is also seen to be a little impact on the Cardano ecosystem if this project is to be implemented. In as much as the documentation of human rights evidence is very vital to one's everyday life, there is little impact this project is going to have on the Cardano ecosystem in relation to the theme of the challenge category.\nAligning the KPI indicated in this proposal to the challenge, there seem to not agree. For instance, a key metric of this challenge is to look at the use case, where it looks at how many funded proposals are making use of the solutions being mentioned in this project.

This project in my view seems not to be in line with the challenge category setting and hence cannot be mutually aligned to most of the funded projects in the view of a solution to curb legal and financial issues that funded projects faces. \nFinally, we can also look at another KPI of the challenge which is the use case of the new solution or services which is intended to give solutions to already funded projects legally or financially.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2371", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2965, "q0": "The goal of collecting documentation of the Rohingya people is a laudable one. \n\nHowever, it is not clear how this project is connected to the Cardano or Catalyst ecosystem.

As important as it is to one's daily life to document human rights proof, this project would have relatively little overall impact on the Cardano environment, which is hardly commendable.\nWhile the proposed solution to the aforementioned issue is incongruous, the challenge asserts that the documentary evidence of genocidal human rights crimes against the Rohingya is at risk of being lost or destroyed.
