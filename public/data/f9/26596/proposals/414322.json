Meanwhile, this project aims to create a transparent system that will make elections fair, all citizens will be assigned a unique voter ID that can be accessed and validated on the Cardano blockchain. Even though I believe that the proponent and his team have run four campaigns for high profile U.S. politicians, honestly, in my personal feeling, the author promised something very good but didn\u2019t explain how he will deliver on it. It is said that \u201cThis proposed solution will solve the challenge of voter fraud and non-transparent elections by publicizing all votes and counting in real-time. Additionally, there can be no duplicate votes, extra votes, deceased citizens voting, underage voting, non-citizen voting, or criminals voting.\u201d It sounds good, but how does this voting app do that when \u201cthe system will be fixed\u201d, as the author said. He explained the problem situation and the proposed solutions very well, and I also know his team has worked and understood the U.S. political system and understands where the cracks in the system are but dedicate little space in the impact to explain the technological parts referring to Cardano would be used and developed. In other words, to summarize my opinion, the proponent should have explained how the promises he makes would be fulfilled and how this would impact the Cardano system.

We don\u2019t know essential details about each step, what kind of product they \u201cmust have to present to governments proving it is tamper-proof and will benefit citizens worldwide\u201d? How they could onboard citizens into the new system while running mock elections with beta test users? We also need to know \u201cany bugs\u201d and how would they prevent voter fraud in the new system, etc. Regarding the budget, I think it is also explained in a very basic way. We don\u2019t know how the money would be used. Why are 50 thousand dollars needed for this proposal? Who will do that, in what order, and why? Now talking about the team, it is said that the developers of Haskell will be hired, but who are they? What are their names, and what job have they done before?

It is complicated to audit this proposal also because it does not have a detailed roadmap. That is, in general, it is not traceable and measurable. So I think it necessary if the proponent explained in simpler ways which quantitative and qualitative aspects would be used to monitor the development of this project; and also how the Cardano community would be considered a success. How has all this benefited our blockchain? Have some specific goals of the challenge \u2013 such as increasing active members in the community, acquiring and delegating Ada, been achieved?
