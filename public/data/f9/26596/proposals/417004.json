This exposes project owners (and perspective clients) to potentially damaging risk.", "f6_no_assessments": 5, "f6_rating": 2.933333333333333, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 7157, "q0": "The idea aligns well with the objectives of the challenge, as it intends to create and maintain a registered company that would provide a fiscal (for tax purposes) and legal framework for TRACE to operate. As the proponent pointed out, it would allow the hiring of external contractors, detraction of expenses for tax purposes, and other benefits to us as developers and owners of the project. In my view, I think this would be useful for what the challenge is looking for projects that could help establish a financial and legal framework for the other Cardano projects and the Catalyst ecosystem. The idea is good but unfortunately, it is a little poorly structured. We know in general what would be done here, the purpose of the proposal, and where it would be, but we don\u2019t know anything about the activities that are developed, or how this project would be done.  We also know the target audience of this project, but it would be interesting if the proponent clarifies how he will persuade them to use his services. Another point is, that the proponent should tell us which KPIs are targeted for the project, as this generates a sense of purpose that is very useful for the other projects, that is, we know what will be done and for what it will be done. Therefore, I think the proposal is good, but to be perfect, more explanations would be necessary.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is not very good, unfortunately. Starting with the script, we don\u2019t have a schedule here, we don\u2019t know which phases would make up a whole and how long each one would take. What we have is a list of steps to need be done, but this is not a roadmap. In reality, what we need is for the proponent to explain what would be done in detail. That is, exactly what activities would be performed, by whom, how, for how long, and in what order. Which professionals would be involved here, doing what small tasks to make the prototyping process possible? What would your routines be like? What deadlines and with what specific goals? Anyway, I think that the entire development process is explained in a very superficial way, being necessary that the proponent explains in detail what would need to be done to compose each step, and it would also be better if they have a timeline. Regarding the budget, it is also explained very thinly. For example, 30,250 dollars is asked for \u201cSocial Capital\u201d, what is that, and why would it cost 15,000 EUR? \u201cExpenses (notarization, contracting, auditing) for the creation of the Company\u201d, with a cost of 3,500 EUR. How much would each of these parts cost? And finally, \u201cRecurring expenses for maintenance of the Company\u201d, why would this part cost 10,500 EUR? I believe that here are the salaries of the professionals involved, so I think it would be interesting for us to know what their work routines would be like, the daily hours dedicated to the project and so on. Speaking of them, the professionals involved, are given very little information about the team members. We only know the names of the duo that would be responsible for the project. We don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve done so far in their professional lives, the example of previous work, and especially how they relate to Cardano. What are their experiences with our blockchain, and how can we trust that they are prepared to successfully develop this project? So, unfortunately, I think all parts of this proposal deserved a revamp, both the script and the budget explanation, and team presentation. As it is presented to us, the feasibility of the project is low. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "About monitoring the process, the proponent just says: \u201cAll the major progress will be shared on the Trace Twitter account for a wider audience\u201d. I think it is very superficial. How could we audit the progress of things by a Twitter account? And how often would these updates be made? It would be essential that a script be prepared. That way, we would have a basis on which to audit. We would know which activities should be developed in each time interval. With that, we would have goals, and partial results to be achieved. This is already good material that could be monitored. Now about the final results, this part is much vaguer, we know that success would be considered by \u201cthe creation of the company. Documenting the success will be straightforward, as the process will generate several official documents. These documents will be signed by us as founders and owners of the Company, in the presence of a notary public within the Italian jurisdiction.\u201d But how can this be measured? How can we outline objective, measurable and direct ways to verify this scenario? In my opinion, it would be necessary for the proponent to have informed statistics and analyses, both qualitative and quantitative that would allow the Cardano community to be able to confidently verify that the objectives have been achieved. So I think the proponent doesn\u2019t give us good ways to audit the proposal, in need of improvement.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_2879", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 7409, "q0": "The proposed project to establish a legally transparent company in Italy, called \u201cSocieta 'a Responsabilita' Limitata\u201d (Srl), the official legal representative of the TRACE project, has been disbursed from F8 through Catalyst, this project is a perfect fit for the challenge\nThis is a natural step in the right direction, helping TRACE to function well within the legal and financial framework in accordance with Italian law, users and collaborative projects are protected by law. With the recent announcements on Twitter, TRACE is a dynamic, growing, and spreading project\nHowever, in the section of risks you listed, there is no clear law in Italy regarding digital assets, other than the option of paying a qualified consultant (without knowing when to stop), Do you have any other action plans? For example, register your business as a company providing regular network services, with legal transparency.

When officially present in the project, the members will work effectively, have high responsibility, and devote a lot of enthusiasm to the project.\nThe project outlined 2 steps to complete the proposal, but they are not really detailed, because you do not have in-depth legal expertise and company establishment as I mentioned above. You have to be more specific in the proposal, when you do, everything will go smoothly. For example, creating a company includes: contacting the government, establishing a legal entity, declaring a tax code, head office address, industry registration ...\nThe total funding budget is 29,000 Eur ~ $30,250, which is 6% of the total Challenge. As for the detailed budget, the establishment and maintenance costs are 3,500 Eur and 10,500 Eur respectively, you should list each work item corresponding to more minor expenses.

Such information will help the community get a broad overview of the proposal and assess the development potential of the founded company. However, the impact of the project will be far-reaching when supporting the funded projects in complying with the financial and legal system and ensuring success. \nThe main risk is well foreseen and followed by an addressing approach that uses a qualified consultant service. A small suggestion of mine is that the team can prepare the plan to hire the consultant according to the following aspects: the name of the chosen consultant, the estimated price, the duration, and expected results. By doing this, the team can clarify their risk management and increase the viability of the project. \n\"", "q0r": 4, "q1": "\"The delivery plan seems a bit vague.
