The team behind the project has great development plans and they are betting big on Catalyst funding, since this is one of their five Fund 9 proposals funding the core of the project, for a total of 480k USD, and an additional proposal seeking funding for an open source project that will indirectly benefit NewM. \n\nThis proposal seeks funding for the establishment of a digital identity integration tool, but sadly the details are very confusing since this proposal is closely connected with another one - KYC integration. As a reminder, our goal here is to create the legal and financial tools that can assist Catalyst proposers in better managing their projects from these points of view and we can only suppose that the proposal\u2019s title means that its content is well connected with challenge, but we cannot be sure. Let\u2019s go through the project in a bit more detail. \n\nFor a better understanding of the subject it\u2019s necessary first of all to put things into a wider context - and that is to understand the great potential of the music royalties market. More than a decade ago the industry was suffering due to extensive piracy, but in the last years the industry has begun to grow again, due mainly to online streaming and its advantages compared to the old distribution channels: convenience, personalization, accessibility. Therefore the music industry is generating constant revenue every year, and there is even a school of thought that considers the royalties associated with it to be an asset class of its own. Barron\u2019s estimates that US annual royalty revenues to be over 40 billion USD, while the proposers estimate the overall market for at over 1 trillion USD (a bit optimistic let\u2019s say). The main idea being that the music royalties market has a great potential to tap into, and gaining even a small market share from the overall pie is going to be a very lucrative business in the long run. \n\nThere is also a very good scalability potential behind the project, since after the development phase, the marginal cost of servicing an additional artist, an additional NFT or an additional smart contract are negligible in comparison to the high margins ubiquitous among the industry. \n\n\n\nIn conclusion, NewM has excellent development prospects, can be a tremendous asset for the Cardano community in the long run, and this proposal is well aligned with the challenge. \n\nHowever, this proposal is unfinished, so I have to offer only three stars. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "A first excellent point relevant for the proposal\u2019s feasibility is that the proposal is complemented by a white paper in which the concept and business model are presented in great detail, and the writers go to great lengths to ensure that no details are left out. There are extensive descriptions of the functionalities of the marketplace, the utilities of the token they wish to launch as well as how the DAO accompanying the marketplace will function. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about the team. Ryan, the CEO, has a very deep understanding of the music industry, can articulate extremely well the value proposition that NewM can bring and he is also in charge of developing partnerships. Florian, the finance guy, was instrumental at the beginning, since he was the one that shaped the business model. Andrew, the CTO and security guy, has a long track record of delivering open source tools to the Cardano community, amongst other the development of a Cardano node CLI tool (command line interface). Including advisors, they have onboarded in excess of 30 members, very diverse in their backgrounds and a fairly geographically distributed team. All of them are presented on their website with links to their profiles (and what music they listen to, of course). So there\u2019s a solid team behind the project. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about funding sources and financial viability. Right now the team self-funds the development of NewM, and they are securing additional funding through their own stakepool. A strength of NewM\u2019s business model (once it launches) is that it will not be reliant on just one stream for revenues - from the beginning the marketplace will focus on two separate sources of revenue: a streaming component trying to give established streaming companies a run for their money and a marketplace component focused on fractionalizing and distributing intellectual property rights as NFTs. In the whitepaper we are also offered a breakdown of their token distribution, which will begin modestly in 2022 and will continue until 2027. In conclusion, in addition to Catalyst, NewM will have various revenue streams, another excellent indication of the project\u2019s good feasibility prospects. \n\nThis proposal is sadly unfinished. For the detailed plan it is written \u201cImplementing KYC: see other proposal\u201d. For the budget \u201cFuture Edits forthcoming\u201d. For this reason I have to offer only two stars. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The team is in the right spot to ensure full auditability of the project. They have already set-up community engagement tools (Discord, Telegram, Twitter, etcetera) and are frequently present on podcasts (Learn Cardano for instance). The founders are making themselves available within these channels and are actively engaging in discussions with the community when being queried regarding the details of the project (I have firsthand experience on this). We have therefore good reasons to believe that the Cardano community will be in a good position to interact with the team, as they are connected to the ecosystem in more than one way. \n\n\nThis proposal is sadly unfinished.

I was happy to find a proposal in Project Catalyst that deals with the problems they are looking to solve.\nThe proposal focuses on a very important aspect of intellectual property rights - DID's and KYCs. The two together would form the solution to fraud security and legal rights.\nThe development team is working on building a system that incorporates DIDs and KYC on their platform, where artists can create accounts, upload and mint their music, select to fractionalise their work if they so desire and more.\nMusic NFTs haven\u2019t become mainstream yet, and for now, there is no music marketplace or standards when dealing with this type of content. \nIn short, I find there's a big potential for this proposal to be really impactful if implemented well.

It is about creating a platform that will engage directly with the artist, managers/management companies, labels, catalog holders, as well as live concert venues (live nation). The problem here is, as the proponent said, there are limited ways to connect blockchain tech with IRL events. So the idea is there has to be a legal entity to take custody of said rights. No rights holder will use a platform where they are restricted with no legal recourse due to malicious third-party actors. I think this fits perfectly with the objectives of the challenge because here we are looking to fund a project that serves to promote adoption and improve product ownership. The objectives of this proposal would be precisely to make these services more accessible, transparent, and auditable, as we can infer from the excerpt \u201cWhen creating an account on our platform the content will be required to go through KYC if they chose to fractionalize/mint their audio files. For added security that a consumer is indeed purchasing a song IP from the intended artist, we will implement a checkmark system built upon DIDs\u201d. In other words, as a result of KYC and DIDs, they will legitimize the trading of IP rights securely and responsibly. This will facilitate a transition from Blockchain to RealFi and pave the way to an equitable platform for ALL creators and consumers.
