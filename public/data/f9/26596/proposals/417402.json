The problem here is the lack of legal support to fund the projects in the Cardano ecosystem in Tanzania. As the proponent pointed out that this center would also serve as a hub for the facilitation of Cardano ecosystem awareness campaigns and a bridge for collaboration between local entities and the Cardano. In my view, they explained the problem situation and their proposed solutions very well, but dedicate little space in the impact to explain the support parts referring to the other project would be executed. However, I still think the idea is something really useful and can support effectively to other funded proposals in Tanzania. I think that for us to understand well how this would work, it would be interesting for the proponent to explain the detail of progress, and how the update process would be. Overall, I believe the impact would be real, positive, and likely to be successful, in line with our current goal. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The feasibility of the project, in general, is good, but I don\u2019t think that part is explained satisfactorily. Starting with the script, we are told that the project would be duration of 1 year, and the activities would develop according to the quarters of the year. The roadmap is very simple, however, the explanations are very superficial. For example, in the first quarter would be \u201can extensive legal and financial study will be made to the project\u201d. I think the proponent could have detailed this much better, will this study look like? Who will work on it and do what in detail? What exactly are they looking for during this study? The same thing I think for the second quarter of the project: \u201can extensive research on acquiring the necessary documentation and necessities of an establishment of the project\u201d. How would that research be done, and in what form is the document expected to be so that it can be researched? Regarding the budget, 35000 dollars are requested, a high amount. But I don\u2019t think the bidders adequately explained how this amount would be used, as again the information provided is superficial. For example, I would like to understand why this \u201cIncentive for the team of 5\u201d would cost 15000 dollars. What is the value of their month of work, how many days a week would they be working on the project, and for how many hours a day? What would the project manager, lawyers, and accountant do in their work routine to justify this salary? And 5000 dollars will be earmarked for marketing and communication in the whole year, but it is not detailed how the marketing will be done, for example, what strategies will be adopted and by what means this campaign will be publicized. As presented to us, the budget explanation is very basic, not being able to generate full understanding. And finally, speaking of the team involved, I think this part was good but there is also room for improvement. The names, backgrounds, and a little history of each team member are told so that we can get to know the satisfactorily, but I think that some profiles should be included on social networks or sites like LinkedIn, and Github\u2026 (except for Evans Kisanga, also a Cardano expert on the team), through which we could see the work of those involved in the practice. For these reasons, I think that all the important information about feasibility (script, budget, and team presentation) is not adequately explained and a revision is necessary.  ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Unfortunately, the auditability of the project is very shallow. The proponent does not provide us with good auditability of the process, what we do know is that success can be measured based on the document or legal study. What will be the important milestones? How will they associate with the project phases? I think the proponent just names what they are going to do, but doesn\u2019t explain. So we need more details on how this process would be in practice. It would be important, in my view, for the team to report the work process, how their routine would be if there were challenges if all team members fulfilled their roles each week, and so on. This can be easily monitored since we already have a very detailed roadmap, so we have a base of content to go by. We also know that the progress will be evaluated each month but a bridge must be established between the team and the Cardano community (through telegram, discord, etc), which they could use to update on the development process. Regarding the final results, unfortunately in this part, the explanations are much more abstract, we know that the goal here is \u201cbuild a strong advocacy center that can mobilize public support and influence policies and legislations for adoption, a world or workspace in which projects can easily ensure they are setting out on a safe endeavor legally and financially speaking, where the stress of compliance doesn't stop the growth potential Cardano Ecosystem has\u201d. However, it would be necessary for us to be more precise with the information to be measured, with more palpable consequences about success. How can we measure the \u201cstrong advocacy center that can mobilize public support and influence policies and legislation\u201d? What indicators will indicate that the strong advocacy\u00a0center where the stress of compliance doesn't stop the growth potential Cardano Ecosystem has? In summary, unfortunately, I don\u2019t think there are objective and valid ways to monitor this project, and this part needs good improvement.\u00a0\u00a0", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2879", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 4, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 11772, "q0": "\u201cTanzania Cardano Think Tank\u201d is an idea related to the goal of the \u201cLegal & Financial Implementations\u201d challenge. The solution proposed by the authors is, to establish a Cardano Center in Tanzania, operating in the form of an NGO, attracting local experts to participate. The aim is to support regulatory policy for Catalyst-funded proposals in Tanzania and to raise blockchain and Cardano awareness for local organizations. Although this is an idea suitable for a challenge setting, I personally consider the information related to the impact of the solution to be incomplete and unclear. Here, the content of the proposal is to build a Catalyst Community Connection and Legal Aid Center in Tanzania. However, I could not find any impact assessment information around this solution. For example, what are the legal issues that crypto businesses may face in Tanzania? What are the challenges faced by Catalyst-funded proposals in Tanzania when implemented in the local business environment? In addition, I personally would like the group to provide more information about the model of the Center in Tanzania, what are the expected size, organizational structure, and operation? This will help the community understand the scope and likely impact of the solution on the Cardano community in Tanzania. Unfortunately, this was not mentioned at all by the team in the solution description. The only risk raised by the group was on the educational side, of the difficulty of convincing legal and financial professionals that projects were not just \u201cscams\u201d but real. Personally, I think that there are still some other risks that the group needs to consider. Specifically: one is, that is difficult to attract legal experts and lawyers who are really knowledgeable about blockchain to participate in consulting and supporting the community. Second, the risks involved in accessing and providing legal support to Catalyst-funded proposals in Tanzania. How do connect with project owners, encourage them to come to the Center, and really effectively support them to implement the project? These are all issues of public concern regarding the impact of this solution. I rate 3 points, deducted -1 point because the impact content is not specific, and -1 point because the risks have not been considered.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Regarding the proposed implementation roadmap, the authors plan to conduct it in 1 year, including 4 phases (3 months each). In it, the team spends 3/4 of the total time (9 months) focusing on legal research and collecting documents related to the establishment of the project and crypto currencies. The last 3 months will be used to open a forum with stakeholders: media, policymakers, and regulators. I assess that, with this long research path, the remaining time will be less for communication, approaching and attracting lawyers and legal experts to join the Cardano center in Tanzania. This also made the task of providing legal assistance to the proposals in Tanzania unfeasible, as the group did not have enough time to do so. The budget is given by the team, I personally think is not clear and convincing. Specifically, what should the rental cost of $500 for 12 months be interpreted as? The group did not specify the cost of renting office space for the Center or the cost of hiring people to support the operation of the Center. $15000 (equivalent to more than 42% of the total project cost) is reserved for 12 months of expenses for a team of 5 people: 1 project manager, 2 lawyers, 1 accountant, and 1 secretary. I would like to ask how much is the specific cost for each HR position? Do they work full-time or do they still work in parallel with other professional jobs outside of the project? Not to mention, communication costs $5000 for brochures, prints, and flyers, so how are the quantity of each type and the unit price calculated? All these costs lack unit price and quantity information. This makes it difficult for the community to assess whether the stated expenditures are really reasonable or not. Regarding the team, of the 3 members of the team, only one author has a reference link to the profile. The remaining two members lack linkage information, so it is difficult to assess whether their capacity and experience are suitable for project implementation. So I made a deduction of -2 points on budget and team. My rating is 3 points.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Is this project auditable? Personally, I rate the project as auditable, however the success metrics are unclear. Here, the team is expected to provide monthly legal research (up to 30 days) as a measure of success. However, I think the team needs to come up with specific KPIs. For example: the number of lawyers that the group will approach monthly, the number of lawyers who will join the center, the number of proposals that are approached and supported by the group, etc. In the roadmap section of the solution , the group setup the goal of \u201cattract more professionals into the Cardano ecosystem, an estimated 30 lawyers and 20 accountants.\u201d In my opinion this number should be included in the audit as a measure of success KPIs. Communities need specific metrics to accurately measure outcomes and what project success will look like.

To achieve that objective, the proposers envision creating a center to work on shaping legislation.  The proposal would benefit from a few more specific descriptions including how the proposers will reach legislators, what tools and resources they will use to influence policy, and which issues specifically they will work on.

The proposer could also mention how the operation of this center will encourage more proposals coming from Cardano community in Tanzania or spark innovation for newcomers in the country. This impact is important as it means more people will know of the Cardano community and their ability to facilitate innovation. The Catalyst community will benefit from this and it will become a win-win situation. Cardano may become the forefront community for proposal-makers of the blockchain community in Tanzania.

The proposer chooses to mitigate this by offering 1-1 educational outreach (meetings, videos, social media,..) to give a sense of reliability and transparency - which is reasonable. From those early steps, the proposer may form partnerships with reputable organizations, figures, ambassadors to endorse the reputation of their project.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The roadmap is quite detailed. The proposal will be carried out in a year, with every 3 months for a specific stage of activities. Reading the key milestones, one could see that the project puts an emphasis on extensive study and research of related areas (legal and financial study, market research, cryptocurrencies. After this, the forum will be launched with the validation of \u201cpolicy akers, and regulatory institutions, press release and media engagement\u201d, which really adds to feasibility as this confirms how the project is legitimate and ready to be utilized. The proposer also points out how this will be a Cardano hub whose support will extend to other ecosystems - this expansion can be beneficial for Cardano. Therefore, the goals are clear. Similarly, the budget breakdown is quite satisfactory. However, there are parts where more specification will be necessary. In \u201cincentive for the team of 5\u201d, rather than arrive at a total amount of 15000 USD, the proposer should specify how much will go to each position (1 project manager = ? usd; 2 lawyers = 2 x ? usd = ?usd,...). What the budget for \u201cMarketing and Communication\u201d does well is that it includes marketing materials (but regrettably not the amount of money for them). Moreover, an amount of 5000 usd for a whole year is a bit too general and vague to assess its practicality. The proposer should break it down into smaller stages of marketing (Stage 1: ? usd, Stage 2: ? usd,...) and the procedures involved (printing posters/flyers/\u2026: ? usd, poster advertisement posters: ? usd, advertisement paid to professional companies (if any): ? usd). This is well explained in \u201ceducational outreach and awareness) where it includes a budget breakdown for certificates and catering. Miscellaneous fees should also be specified (transportation: ? usd, contingency plan: ? usd) - this makes sure the proposer has a clear plan for the budget and helps them to utilize the budget effectively. The team profile is good in that each team member is clearly introduced with their specialization, place of employment. The expertise of the team members proves to be much needed in this proposal and ensures the quality of human resources (member of Catalyst community, web development, researching, legal advisors working in tech companies). With these credentials, the team earns a good reputation and increases feasibility. The team could also give a specific role of who does what to make a clear picture of day-to-day activities. The explanation for further funding in later rounds is reasonable and reflects the long-term scale of their big project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The progress will be measured through monthly evaluation. However, the proposal should rephrase the key metric to make it clear that key metrics are measurable (which increases auditability and easier to track progress). The current phrasing is a bit confusing and can be misleading. \u201cThe document or legal study was done in a maximum of 30 days?\u201d (as cited) can be understood as a yes/no question \u2013 whether the legal study is done after at most 30 days - or it can also mean \u201cThe number of documents and legal study done in 30 days\u201d. These are a bit different, therefore requiring clarification. It is more advisable to choose a measurable key metric (such as the latter) where clear numbers can be given to track progress. The definition of success is reasonable and well\u2013aligned with the proposal. However, to objectively assess whether the proposal achieves this success, some indicators (advantageous policies, number of professionals participating, number of NGOs, number of positive feedback from users, number of Cardano projects made by users of this legal center) should be provided. The proposal comes with SDG goals, which is suitable with what the proposal is trying to achieve.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_4055", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "By laying out an amicable solution to help through established NGO to attract professionals to it, and help grow the accessibility of the legal support and support to Cardano ecosystem in Tanzania.", "experience": "\nBusiness consultancy agency,\nMasters degree in ICT law, Bachelor degree in law, Bachelor Degree In Social Protection,\nMembers and active contributors in Catalyst communities ( GTH, C4C, CATH, CETH), Catalyst Proposal Assessors, Front and Backend developer, F8 funded proposers.\n"}
