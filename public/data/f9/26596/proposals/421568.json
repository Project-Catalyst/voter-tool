Instead of providing us with their vision for the proposed solution, the team has actually put the detailed budget here. But what is even weirder, is the fact that the numbers provided don\u2019t even add up to the total amount requested. I have done the calculation and based on their numbers provided as fixed fees, the amount needed is only $28000. The team has mentioned in the problem statement that there will also be some additional annual costs (why there?), but they haven\u2019t been provided either here or in the proper field from the feasibility section. Regardless, this is not the place to talk about the budget, and it seems very weird to me that the team keeps pushing us these numbers without describing their solution to a clearly identified problem. Why would a voter decide to vote on this proposal? I have visited their website, and I can understand what their project is mostly about, but what would the impact be on the Catalyst/Cardano Community if this specific proposal would be voted in? Since there is no clear answer to that, I cannot offer an opinion on it.\nIn conclusion, I really do hope the team understands the structure of the submission form better now, and if not funded in this round they will resubmit their proposal in the next round with the required information.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team has provided us with some of the steps required to complete their project, though they haven\u2019t drafted a timeline during which these tasks would be completed. Since I have lived for a year in Switzerland, I know that the bureaucracy there is efficient and the team must have been provided with deadlines for each of the needed tasks, as such, these deadlines should have also been provided further to the community to be able to assess its implementation plan adequately.\nAs noted above in the impact section, the budget is placed there, while here we have been provided only with this sentence: \u201cThe costs that have been provided are based on different estimations from different providers in Switzerland\u201d.\nI will not repeat the same feedback that I have already posted in the impact section, but the arguments are obviously the same.\nRegarding the team, we have been provided with two names and LinkedIn profile links. While some short description about their skills and/or involvement in the Cardano Ecosystem would have been a nice addition, I do not see a problem in the fact that they have not provided those. Looking at their profiles and previous work, I can estimate that their skills and knowledge would push the project forward in a timely manner.\nUnfortunately, even though the team looks highly capable, I cannot ignore the fact that a lot of the required information in this section is missing as well, as such, I will rate it with a 3.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "It is difficult to track the proposal's progress because no metrics or specific actions were provided. Instead, the proposal lays down a very similar answer to the next question, namely that of success definition, where it is more appropriate.\nAlthough I am not familiar with this specific bureaucratic space, I imagine there are websites where you can monitor the progress of some of the presented steps essential to the formation of the legal entity. For example, the ones noted in the impact section: the formation of an association, domiciliation and directorship etc.\nThe main idea behind this question is to provide the community with the possibility of verifying the progress of a project independently from the proposers.\nAssessing the success question is rather difficult, mainly because the impact section has not been answered. If I do not know what a project intends to achieve and the reasons behind it, then I cannot judge its success either.\nGiven the reasons mentioned above, I will rate this section a 2, as I disagree that this proposal can be successfully audited for implementation and success.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 6, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Thanks for the feedback, our proposal aims to become a guide for DAOs and DAPPs that are looking for become legal compliant. Not every user is in USA and in EU is harder to become legal compliant"}, {"id": 6723, "q0": "There is a good connection between this proposal and the challenge, but its impact will be limited. Let\u2019s see why. \n\nFluidtokens is a Cardano based decentralized application that allows its users to lend and borrow using NFTs as collateral. The value proposition here is to create a DAO entity in Switzerland so that Fluidtoken owners can be represented both on-chain and off-chain and have legal guarantees about their power. Being intimately knowledgeable of legal services myself, I ask a few questions about how this value proposition will be put in practice, for which the proposal brings no answers, but they are definitely required in order to assess its potential impact: \n\nQ: Does Switzerland already have a legal entity structure that accounts for the novelty of DAOs, and do we have any evidence that it will indeed be able to protect the legal rights of DAO members? \nQ: At which level will a KYC process be performed, and will any citizens of the world be accepted as DAO members in Switzerland?\nQ: What happens when the token trades hands? Who and how updates the registry?\nQ: In the blockchain world, the code is still the law. In case of legal proceedings, how will court orders be enforced on-chain?Will court orders be above the code?\nQ: Has a comparison been made to see if Switzerland is the most fortunate domiciliation place for the DAO? Have other jurisdictions been considered?\n\nLacking a clear answer to the above questions (and many more) I have to maintain a rather negative stance towards the impact that this proposal can bring into the Cardano ecosystem. Two stars until the proposer can convince the community that the legal structure is viable and will actually offer legal protection to DAO members and token holders. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Of course the project is feasible. Switzerland is a flexible country, and with the right fees and the right lawyers, some paperwork in German / French can definitely be realized, and an association incorporated, so that\u2019s not an actual worry for me. \n\nAre the costs reasonable? It\u2019s difficult to say - perhaps future iterations can make the distinction between regulatory fees that cannot be escaped (those that have to be paid to Swiss courts / institutions) and consultancy fees paid to lawyers / consultants / accountants / etc - for which shopping around should be the way to go - and for which the proposers can demonstrate that they have considered multiple parties, compared several offers and selected the best value for money deal. Sadly this is not the case here.\n\nAnd just a few anecdotic questions: Why does opening a bank account cost 1k USD? Can we know the names of the third parties that were selected to assist with the project? \n\nLacking these details I deem the project as feasible, but lacking transparency with regards to its costs. Four stars. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability section is only lightly sketched, and there\u2019s not much to elaborate on other than the proposers wish for the association to be defined as a reference point for future DAOs that wish to incorporate. SO I shall continue with a few questions: \n\nQ: Are there any plans in place to issue a report at the end of the process and inform the community of how things went, and offer guidance for future DAOs?\nQ: will the incorporation documents be translated into English and made available to the community?\nQ: Will the Directors of the association be made available to the community?\nQ: Will there be a possibility for future token holders to apply for a position within the associations? Will there be on-chain governance for the legal entity? \n\nAgain, with such a light approach to auditability and lacking so many pieces of information, I have to limit my assessment here to three stars and can only wish that the proposers come back in future rounds with a much better value proposition, including, but not only, an increased transparency and explanation of on-chain to off-chain and vice versa mechanisms of ensuring everyone\u2019s legal rights.

The idea here is about creating the no profit DAO entity in Switzerland will allow Fluidtokens users to be represented both onchain and in real life, with legal guarantees of their governance and representative power. From what I read its whitepaper and the proposal, the whole idea is very well explained, the process would be divided into 3 parts - formation of an association, domiciliation and directorship, communication with authorities and 3rd parties. The information is very detailed. Despite being a very technical proposal, it is possible to understand what will be done, as the actions are explained in an accessible way. Therefore, I believe that the potential for a lot of impacts is high.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the roadmap, the main tasks to be completed in the total project development period are listed, and then these are divided according to the quarter. However, I think this explanation is still very superficial, for example in Q2 2022, three tasks are mentioned: Team creation, platform creation, and testnet release. I think these activities could and should be more detailed, for us to have a deeper understanding of the project development process. Now evaluating the other aspects of feasibility, concerning the budget, I think it is also explained in a very basic way. Besides that, I think it\u2019s a little tricky as the asking amount is 40 thousand dollars, but the proponent prefers to explain the money by euro. For example, domiciliation and directorship \u20ac10000, accountant (annual) \u20ac6000. This to me is quite inconvenient to evaluate. Thus, we know the total is divided into two phases, but these are not so well explained. For example, \u201ccommunication with authorities and 3rd parties \u20ac5000\u201d, who are these authorities? What are the 3rd parties? How to communicate with them? We also do not know how many hours per week (or month) the professionals would dedicate to the project so we would calculate the price of their working hours, or are the activities they would develop in detail explained. Finally, speaking of the team, it is also inadequate, we just have their LinkedIn profiles. We don\u2019t know details about those involved. It would be necessary for them to present us with a brief curriculum with their past experiences and also what kind of involvement they have with Cardano. Overall, the whole topic needs improvement.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The audibility of this project is not adequate. It is said that progress tracking would be done by being a point of reference for DApps in Cardano and DAOs that want to become legally compliant. But as I mentioned above, it\u2019s not that detailed, so we couldn\u2019t understand with as much specificity how this monitoring would be done. It would be better if the proponent explained in simpler ways which quantitative and qualitative aspects would be used to monitor the development of this project; and also how the Cardano community would be aware of all this. In my view, to improve this, the roadmap should be better detailed, from which monthly reports should be generated that identify whether the activities planned for each period were fulfilled, if partial results were achieved\u2026 and all this should be made available simply and directly way to all members of the Cardano ecosystem. Speaking of final results, it\u2019s just repeating the measure to track the project's progress. Honestly, I think it\u2019s very superficial. They must think of more accurate ways of measuring success. And this should be done both quantitatively and qualitatively\u2026 So I think, once again, that there is a lot to be improved in this part of the proposal. The proponent should outline exactly how the community will have access to all the audited information and you should also think more objectively about how to see if the intended success has been achieved.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_2879", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 4, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Will add more details, thanks for your feedback"}, {"id": 511, "q0": "I believe the proposal misinterpreted the intention of the challenge.

", "q0r": 1, "q1": "I understand that the funding is being used \"to pay the bureaucracy costs\" but that tells the community nothing about timelines, milestone, deliverables. For example, registering a DAO in Wyoming takes up to two weeks, if you want non-profit election, the IRS website in the united states quotes up to 90 days for a response. I would have expected similar timelines for Switzerland, if not a direct quote from the bureaucracy, at least some estimates by talking to other members of the community about their experiences and timing. \n\nIf the community have zero idea about when you might reasonable achieve your goal, they have no way of knowing if the goal can ever be achieved.

This is an amazing concept by the fluid token team. Looking at this current proposal which is dubbed fluid tokens legal entity I seem not to be much convinced of this project aiding as many already funded projects which need legal services in this proposal instance.\nThis project doesn\u2019t seem to talk much about how to help the already funded project with the legal issues that come up.

This gives me a great sense of success for this proposal all things being equal. They have provided enough links and references to bring some of us up to speed on their ongoing project and how relevant it is to set up the legal entity. I think the budget can be accepted as it stands with a bit of clear understanding of the details making it reasonable. An issue I have with the project is the inadequate details concerning the implementation plan that looks at some of the actionable tasks and how the project will be carried out. The plan also shows the steps needed to become a DAO and looks at the formation of an association, domiciliation and directorship, and communication with authorities and third parties.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Being an independent reviewer of this project, I need to ensure that there is sufficient information to help the Catalyst Community to be able to forecast the progress of the project.

In as much as the challenge category is more concerned with an already funded project, I think this proposal can be given time to settle well into the future with great legal solutions to help the funded project. I believe DAOs can be of global help to most of the projects in the Cardano ecosystem. I believe the blockchain architecture is growing rapidly and will help with direct access to solutions.
