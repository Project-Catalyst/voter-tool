It is about spending time educating the important NGOs and charities in crypto tools, mechanics and general infrastructure, including teaching them how to set up their own (non-custodial) wallets and receive, and make transfers of crypto assets. The idea, as the authors point out, will focus on the adoption of Cardano infrastructure (Cardano wallets, ADA on- and off-ramps, etc.). I found it very interesting how donors can benefit from financial advantages by making crypto donations as it allows the donor to claim a fair market value charitable deduction, and also the idea that contributes at least half of the funds raised by this proposal to the charities that adopt Cardano infrastructure and start accepting ADA (and other CNAs) donations. Even so, I didn\u2019t think that the proposal aligns well with the objectives of the challenge because it fits better with the challenge of crypto education. Therefore, I believe that in terms of impact, the proposal does not fit this challenge, although I think it\u2019s still a very good idea.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The feasibility of this project is low, we were able to understand in general what would be done. We have a roadmap, which lists the activities that would need to be developed for the project to become a reality in 5 months. But at the same time, it lacks a lot of detail. It is said the setting up meetings with all the NGOs, foundations, and charitable organisations, setting up in-person meetings,\u2026 but we don\u2019t know how many meetings would take place, where would they be, who would expose the content, etc. In the last month of the project, the proponents point out that they will contribute at least half of the funds raised by the proposal to the NGOs and charities that effectively adopt Cardano tools and infrastructure. Why would it take so long?  And the milestone that \u201censuring practical adoption of crypto infrastructure by the NGOs, foundations and charitable organisations\u201d, how could they measure the \u201cpractical adoption\u201d metric? I think it would be necessary for proponents to break the timeline into smaller scales and to provide more detail for each of the activities. Talking about the budget, an 8 thousand dollars is requested, which was divided into 2 parts but these are not explained clearly. For example, we know that \u201cat least 50% of the funds will be used to make crypto donations to the NGOs and charitable organisations that take our courses and participate in our sessions\u201d. Do we really need to do that? Why we don\u2019t use all of the fund to develop the project to improve their general knowledge of crypto? It is said that this donation aims to encourage NGOs and charitable organisations to adopt and help with familiarization, but it doesn\u2019t seem like a good idea for me. Secondly, the team says \u201cthe remaining funds will be used to cover all the expenses required for the successful implementation of the proposal, as set out in the steps plan described above...\u201d The information is said very superficially. We don\u2019t know how the budget would be used clearly, who would do them, in what order, and why? How is their work routine? How many hours per week they would dedicate to the project? The price of their work, etc. Finally, regarding the team, we are informed in a very detailed way about who is involved, their names, their careers, and previous experiences\u2026 but it would be essential to know their CVs, LinkedIn profiles, and how they relate to Cardano. Overall, I think the whole topic needs improvement.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The measurement of progress would be based on 3 indicators, consisting of a list of all the NGOs and charitable organisations they reach out to, the sessions and courses they hold with them, and the donations of the funds. I think they are sufficient for us to monitor the progress of activities, but I think that\u2019s the basics. In addition, to know if it is essential for charity, we also need to know how the NGOs and charitable organisations understand crypto tools, mechanics, and general infrastructure, what impacts were generated for Cardano, and how this can be measured directly. In addition, I also would like the proponents to make it clear how such information would reach the members of the Cardano community. Talking about the final results, the proponents are based only on the completion of the project but not do think about the consequences for Cardano. It is not thought how the reflection of this would be measured in Cardano.

The metrics and goals are clear. The project is sustainable because after the initial investment of time and energy has occurred to get the NGOs to accept donations, little further effort will be needed to support future donations. The only reason to score this proposal a 4 rather than a 5 is due to the lack of connection to the challenge. The challenge calls for \u201cbuilding effective solutions to explore and provide legal & financial services and support to funded Proposers.\u201d Nothing in this proposal would achieve those objects, and the proposers would have been better served by finding a different challenge and explaining the fit.

The budget amount request (8,000) is not that high, so I only deducted one point as a result of the missing CV info. The project is very straight forward and described in an organized and easy to understand way that gives significant confidence that it will be implemented as designed.

As the proposal mentions, the transparency that is at the base of blockchain is what would make the adoption of crypto by both donors and serious NGOs even more appealing.\nAnd I highly appreciate the fact, that half of the funds requested for this proposal - which are quite low, in my opinion - would be donated to NGOs that will adopt ADA and thus get them started on a future path.\nOverall, I find the proposal to be solving an important issue, that could potentially impact not just the Cardano community, but the lives of those who need it most, as well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I find the plan presented to be very comprehensive, with a clear timeframe provided.

The team should have provided us with clear information about the costs they will incur, as to help us better judge if the budget was well-drafted. For example, what would happen if the expenses will be higher than the team anticipated? Will the team stop their work on it or will they continue and pay out of their pockets?\nWhen looking at the team description field, I notice that we have been provided with two names and a brief description of the experience related to the needs of this proposal. According to it, the proposers seem to have the knowledge and relations needed to successfully implement the proposal.

Having 4 or 5 major NGOs adopt Cardano would be a great deal, and considering the fact that the team is located in Spain, makes me confident that they have the possibility to personally contact several large organisations.\nTherefore, I find the auditability section to contain the information needed for a proper assessment, as such I agree that the proposal can be well evaluated.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 2, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4981, "q0": "The focus of this proposal is on making crypto assets accessible to charitable organizations and NOT geared towards providing legal and financial support to funded proposers or Catalyst related projects.

It's a good thing to make donations in crypto to NGOs and this puts the idea more on adoption and use-cases, which would've been better if submitted under DAOs or Cross-Chain categories in order to leverage Blockchain stakeholders and resources through Catalyst and Cardano to provide funding support in forms of donations to these charitable organizations.

Scaling up the adoption of Cardano blockchain requires that Cardano establishes its presence in every sector. Therefore, to have a presence in the charity industry is a great initiative. The end goal here is to provide educational engagement to most important NGOs and charitable organizations on crypto tools and to encourage and facilitate the adoption and acceptance of crypto donation by these NGOs and charity organisations. Does this satisfy the legal and financial implementation challenge setting? Given the model setup for this project, it possible to advance the adoption of this initiative if implemented elsewhere across the world. Hence this proposal address the challenge.

To start with, the budget lacks the needed breakdown and details required. For instance, the proposer tells us that half of the budget would go to charity but I prefer he gives us the details of this allocation. How much would each charity NGO or charity organization receive? I suggest the team gives us more clarity here. Again, by the budget we see that the proposer doesn't tell us what the other half of the budget would be used for. In my view, I  envisage that this project would require budget allocation for items like educational content, event space (education), miscellaneous and team cost if possible. Therefore the team could include these items and provide information on the cost for these items. Aside that, I am satisfied with the roadmap, it presents detailed description of what the team intend to do within a specific timeframe.
