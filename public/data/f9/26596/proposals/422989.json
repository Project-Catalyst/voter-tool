For example, the timeline says that it will take two months to \u201cdetermine the financial calculations to be used in the app.\u201d What exactly are the sorts of calculations to be considered? What process will be taken to develop these calculations? How will their utility be determined? Would there be a process for surveying potential users and understanding their use cases? Perhaps a little market research could have been done prior to seeking funding and added to this proposal? As an example, say you do a survey on the cardano community discord asking what kind of data potential users would like in their app. Then put the results into the proposal. \n\nThe similar thing with marketing. The proposal recognizes that marketing will be key. But, it is necessary to market to an audience. Next time, consider researching potential sites where gold, dollar, and euro buyers are active, perhaps on Reddit. Do a poll to see if this app would meet a need, and then publicize your progress to a community that is already interested in seeing this come about. There are additional ways that this proposal could have been added to. I would recommend seeking out the proposals that are funded during this round after voting concludes to research what makes a proposal likely to be assessed at a higher score.  \n\nIn order to assess a proposal as completely feasible, assessors need to have enough details to make sure that 1. The proposer has thought through the full cost of the project, (don\u2019t build a tower until you have accounted for all the materials, costs, and labor needed). 2. The prosper and their team are capable of succeeding in the project in the timeframe and with the budet. This is to protect both Project Catalyst and the proposer from the risks of failing. Project Catalyst loses the funds, and the proposer loses reputation. \n\nAll this to say, I am not saying the proposer is incapable of completing this project. In fact, it is highly likely they are. But, the reason for the score of 1 is that the proposal itself does not present enough evidence to show this assessor that this is a feasible project by the team on the budget and in the timeframe described.

The first step is to have a clear set of measurable metrics. For example, how does the timeframe align with the goals of the project, and what tasks will be completed when. Then the auditability can say, the project will measure completion of goals and publish them in a monthly report to catalyst, or upload them to github, or a public website. As an assessor, I want to see evidence that the team will take the investment of catalyst funds seriously by committing themselves to a series of goals that can be easily measured within and without your team.

It is basically the salary of the professionals involved, as the proposers explain, the salaries added together give approximately 16K, and in the period of 3 months this would be an average of 5k (which is requested in the financing).
