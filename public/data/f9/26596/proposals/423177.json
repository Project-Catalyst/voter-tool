The proposal claims that this confusion and fear mongering by one government office threatens to limit the growth of the Ethiopian blockchain market, specifically the cardano ecosystem, as it may slow down the wider adoption of cardano, a serious competitor in the market, and slow down the advancement of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The cardano ecosystem is well fully conscious of the financial worth Africa possesses in blockchain and has been a key factor in fostering its African adoption through continuous technological innovation on project catalyst and by enabling a variety of African cultural traditions to partake in activities within the numerous cardano communities. Ethiopia's adoption strategy is currently in peril since unauthorized claims about the legality of utilizing cryptocurrency are spreading throughout the continent of Africa, where the community is stepping up its adoption strategies. This proposal strikes me as a positive move toward maintaining ethical trading among Ethiopian members and promoting sustainability advancements within the Cardano ecosystem.

The author has discussed his engagement in cardano and past experiences.

The purpose of the concept is to encourage and disseminate accurate information regarding Ethiopian participation in blockchain while publicly withdrawing the viewpoint that crypto trading requires a legal foundation. Although the proposal does not provide a delivery timeline, it does allude to very attainable project goals. Moreover, the budget sought in the proposal appear unsatisfactory for such a work. As indicated in the proposal, the likelihood of bureaucracy by government offices could have an impact on the project's success.

It would be necessary for the proponent to explain which topics would be consulted, such as what topics would be covered in each consultative meeting for the development of the Cardano community in Ethiopia? In general, there is a lack of understanding of the whole, which makes me think that the impact could be low for Cardano, unfortunately.

The asking amount (2 thousand dollars) is split into two parts \u2013 the lawyer fee and publication and promotion of findings \u2013 but these are not explained, they do not contain the necessary level of detail. For example, what is that publication? What is the promotion campaign? How many hours the lawyer would dedicate to this project? How much would the price of work hours be, so that we could see more concretely if the amount asked is fair? If this had been defined, we would certainly understand the monetary use better. And finally, regarding the team, it is just the author and we only have his LinkedIn. We don\u2019t know what he would do, his academic background, professional path, or how he relates to the Cardano ecosystem. And it\u2019s also worrying that he doesn\u2019t have a team in Ethiopia.

It would be important for him to prepare weekly reports talking about the pre-production progress of each consultant meeting (whether in person or online), how many people participated, and how the law topics were consulted. Now talking about the final results, the proponent doesn\u2019t make it clear how success would be measured. He states that \u201cthe wider Ethiopian community will be made aware of the current stance of the Ethiopian government on crypto and how to operate within the legal bounds\u201d. I think this scenario is quite promising. What we would need to know here is how these encounters reflected on Cardano.

According to the proposal, this misinformation and fear mongering by one government office stands to restrict the growth of Ethiopian market in the blockchain ecosystems, specifically cardano\u2019s, as it may hinder the accelerated growth of the blockchain ecosystem and adoption rate of cardano; a viable contender in the blockchain market. The cardano ecosystem is well aware of the monetary value that Africa holds in the blockchain ecosystem. As indicated in their strategic goals, cardano has been an integral asset in enhancing its African adoption through sustainable innovations on the project catalyst as well as allowing diverse African cultures  participate in activities within the many cardano communities. As the community is strengthening its adoption tactics in Africa, that of Ethiopia is currently under jeopardy due to the spread of unauthorized statements on the legalities of using crypto currency.

As stated in the proposal, the potential for bureaucracy by government offices can affect the success of the project.
