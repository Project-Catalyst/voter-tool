The idea group has come up with a proposal to solve this problem. Extensive research effort and knowledge sharing by a team of experienced blockchain law experts, documents and seminars to answer any questions about blockchain law and provide advice. Proposed impact on the challenge posed . The proposed group is the Littlefish Foundation (LFF), a decentralized global organization. The LFF team is a global team, but mostly from Turkey. The team builds technologies and uses Blockchain technology to define relationships between people, jobs, and organizations. This new operating model will bring freedom to participants and progress towards common goals. The basic information will be linked to the Littlefish Vault. The issues are presented in detail, analyzed in detail, and deeply explained by the group. There are 13 problem areas that need to be understood. Legal Status of the NFT Act LFF; Legal status of monetization through Project Catalyst; Legal framework for decentralized organizations etc. The information generated from the Catalyst community will be through seminars and further communicated through marketing. Good proposal, and little benefit to the needs of LFFs, potential Actions users, Catalyst monetizers, DAOs, and Catalyst community members and actors... very positive index. It proves that the proposed team has precise goals, knows what they will do, and how to achieve the ultimate goal of project success. Besides, with its expertise, the team has recognized many risks in the project and has solutions for all risks. Increase the success power of the project the team wants to develop.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From the plan table, it can be seen that the proposal is highly feasible. The first is about the route. The team provided us with information that 13 problem areas have been identified in the first part of the proposal, legal research will generate literature for each area, and Workshop details have also been published. planning in this process. Delivery milestones and quantities are expected in October, December and February. The proposed team also provided us with a detailed timetable for each section: Module 1: Legal Research; Module 2: Education Counseling and Workshops; Module 3: Marketing The Littlefish Vault. In each section, the team presents and explains in detail activities, time, space.. and milestones that are very valuable. We know all that will be done, how and in very clear time. Next is the budget. The team proposed a budget of $84,800. accounts for more than 10% of the total challenge value. In my opinion, the required value is appropriate given the complexity, and route, of the work to be done in the project. The team makes a very detailed budget for 3 parts: Modules 1, 2 and Module 3. In each section, the team explains in detail the operating budget, hourly staff budget. . However, the grant amount for the Comprehensive Action Fund is $21,200. While the action fund analysis said: \u201cThe Action Fund allocation is one quarter of the total budget\u201d. Since the budget for the action fund is quite large (one third of the total budget required), further explanation would be helpful. Finally, about the team members involved in the project. We were informed that the members were divided into a main team, a support group and a research assistant. Each member is introduced through a presentation board, so that we understand each person's identity, role, skills and experience. I believe our level of understanding about each member, about each member's ability to trust is good. I think the feasibility of the project is high, based on what was presented, we have a clear understanding of what to do, how much to invest and who will do the whole work in the project to get results. final.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Testability is perfect. The proponent says everything will be made public, the team will publish key Obsidian progress updates, and share learning about the Catalyst community. The Miro board will be open to the community, their progress can be seen here. Miro: this is a very interesting tool that allows you to integrate a variety of content and formats into your tables such as photos, videos, spreadsheets, and more. In addition, Miro integrates with many popular data storage and resource storage applications. Discord: supports video calling, voice chat, messaging and allows users to communicate with each other whenever needed... is a good place for us to find updates and daily action . Proposal to provide legal research specific to the LFF, Catalyst, DAO... enough development. In fact, no criticism was made at We can verify everything that was done in this project. Regarding the end result, the proposed team presented and explained densely and deeply about what the Littlefish Foundation is aiming for, i.e. the specific goals of the group. We were introduced to the group's Ikigai model. and another tests related to publishing action. On this we have enough data to see if the team is meeting its goals, making it possible to audit the proposal's success. In general, from the plan table, it shows the professional ability and active efforts of the proposed team. The detailed roadmap in each milestone can help developers easily audit the successful progress of the project. Besides, the strong team and transparent detailed budget in the proposal strengthen the confidence in the success of the project.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2786", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 4, "ng": 1, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 6730, "q0": "Littlefish is a DAO that wants to reimagine work. In today\u2019s world, the mechanisms we use to earn income are outdated and suboptimal. They limit autonomy within the workspace and represent a costly trade-off between financial stability and personal growth aspirations. Well, littlefish wants to start afresh with a model that stimulates individual leadership and initiative, asynchronous work, voluntary participation and a constantly evolving landscape. \n\nLittlefish have chosen the distributed ledger technology to set up camp because it can boost ideas like anything we have seen before, and they have chosen Cardano in particular due to its research focused ethos and the fact that Catalyst was the spark behind the idea rolling down the hill. As a personal note, I add that Cardano was an excellent choice also due to low transaction fees, best suited for such a project, but more details on this in the following section. \n\nTo fully understand their value proposition you have to visit their website and read the white paper. They have a fresh style, they keep all the information simple, easy to understand and it is complemented by very informative charts and diagrams. This assessment cannot really do justice to all their ideas, but here is the nutshell: the functioning model is built around the user (little fish) who is part of a wider entity (the colony). Littlefish are of course economic actors wishing to maximize their utility, while the colonies are created around a common goal / idea / task / cause / etc. The littlefish performs actions, and these actions are treated as an economic goods, thus carrying value and can be exchanged, or rather sold by the little fish. Another key feature of the model is a revenue sharing mechanism between the fish and the colony, complemented by a reward aging characteristic to incentivise fresh action over inactivity.   \n\nWhy are littlefish asking for funding? Because they want to conduct research into 13 legal topics of general interest to the DAO members and bring clarity into these areas. The proposal connects perfectly with the challenge since its aim is to support future proposers with the legal and financial challenges specific to blockchain technologies, and this project will do just that. There is also a very good scalability potential: if the project will be successful, many more can step in its shoes by following the same work pattern, while its findings will be of use not only to littlefish users, but to the entire Cardano community. A note of caution, littlefish have seven funding requests in this round, and they are all interconnected, albeit throughout different challenges. Make sure to read them all. \n\nEverything within this proposal is a testament to the team\u2019s rigorous process, no-nonsense approach of explaining their thinking and of course, it all fits extremely well within the challenge. Moreover, if Catalyst would ever implement a sixth star, littlefish would be a prime candidate to receive one. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Let\u2019s talk about the team first of all. Unlike most of the littlefish projects which are technical by nature, and mostly populated by developers, for this proposal the brunt of the work will be carried out by legal specialists from Tevetoglu Legal, a Turkish law office specialized in digital technologies and crypto assets. Each main team member presents him/herself in a few paragraphs, and we can therefore already have a good idea on what kind of expertise each team member has. It would have been extremely beneficial if the profiles were also complemented by links to social media profiles, but this is however not the case. Doing some additional work, I was able to find their website as well as some crypto specific publications, but sadly the language barrier kicked in since most of the content was in Turkish and no English transitions were offered. I feel confident that the team can do a good job for this proposal but I would have loved to see the same level of quality in presenting the team as it was the case for the other littlefish proposals. \n\nTheir deliverables are split into 13 modules. I won\u2019t list them all, but here are the most relevant / impactful areas of research: legal status of DAOs, Catalyst earnings, tokens and coins, smart contracts, data stored on blockchain and privacy implications, etcetera. The main takeaway here is that these are all topics of extreme relevancy to any crypto project and bringing some clarity through an organized research is extremely valuable.  \n\nOf course, each of the 13 modules briefly touched upon in the previous section are presented in great detail, and we can immediately realize what kind of activities will be taking place, as well as complementing the description with an estimation of the hours involved. Going further into the details, for each module we know the relevant stakeholders, the primary working group, the estimated duration and necessary hours. We are also offered a timeline, with key milestones, planned workshops and deadline for finalizing documentation (next February). And if this wasn\u2019t already enough, the entire proposal is sprinkled with useful links (perhaps a bit less with this proposal) where you go very deep down the rabbit hole into, for instance, past payment sheets for existing members, external case studies relevant to what you are reading or simply a beautiful post-it board to see the broad picture of how a certain module is intended to work. \n\nThis is also one of the very few projects that do take seriously the task of going through a risk assessment, and actually identifying, documenting, finding ways to mitigate and properly disclosing some of the risks that could affect the project. Again, just to offer a flavor of what is presented, the team discloses in great detail the financial risk stemming from the fact that a significant portion of the team is based in Turkey, currently experiencing hyperinflation, and the mitigating actions to lower the future impact of the situation. \n\nThe budget is built around the base hourly rate of 100 USD, with 250 hours going into legal research, and 250 going into consultations and workshops. I am wondering now if this is actually a feasible assumption, since dividing 250 hours of legal research into 13 modules, that leaves less than 20 hours, on average, to complete each module\u2019s research, doubled however by a similar number for consultations. Being a legal expert myself, I am rather neutral on whether that time will be sufficient to go into all the nitty gritty details of the topics covered, which are all very challenging. But moving on, each module has its own separate personnel budget and there is also an extra caption for each module, similar to an overhead, as a percentage of personnel costs. A part of it is to be spent at the discretion of the module team while the rest is pooled to cover common good expenses (videoconferencing tools for example). On top of all this lies an action fund (25% of the total) acting as a buffer mechanism to ensure short term sustainability and allow for estimation errors or even to fund additional modules if deemed necessary. \n\nGiven the less than perfect budgetary assumptions and the fact that the language barrier made it impossible for me to judge for myself the quality of their past materials produced, I have to offer only four stars for this project\u2019s feasibility. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Littlefish is built around openness, so ensuring full auditability of its activities comes rather naturally. The team publishes major updates on Obsidian (an online knowledge base solution), while their Miro boards are open to the community. The team uses Discord for daily activities as well as to \u201cshout\u201d when actions are done, in a similar way as to how Deworks / Discord works for Catalyst Swarm and bounties. The team will also use google analytics to track the overall success of the DAO (number of visitors, average time spent, etc.).  \n\nLittlefish also generally offers logical solutions for tracking the proposal\u2019s specific modules. For this proposal however, the team acknowledges that the general tracking mechanisms they usually have in place works imperfectly in these circumstances, and they only offer a rather fuzzy logic explanation on how things will be tracked - not the most efficient approach. If there is one piece of advice to be offered it is to think about implementing any kind of 360 degree feedback in which they seek feedback from the community (either littlefish or Cardano community) after their work has been done and published, to gauge the interest it has received and maybe even capture its impact, somehow, although I recognize that\u2019s no easy task. Overall we have a fair way of tracking the performance of the proposal, but not perfect, so only four stars.

The problem here is building solutions on the blockchain comes with many legal questions that need to be answered. Legal frameworks around blockchain are constantly being updated with new laws being drafted globally. These developments must be tracked, and legal obligations related to LFF must be understood and communicated. I think this solution is meeting the requirements very well, for several reasons. Starting with the fact that they determined 13 problem areas that people need to be understood, including the Legal status of LFF Action NFTs, Legal status of earning through Project Catalyst, Legal frameworks for Decentralized Organizations, Legal framework for tokens and coins, Legal status of smart contracts, Legal status of real world-asset backed tokens and coins, Legal status of the data stored in blockchains, Crowdfunding through ICO-ITO and Crypto Assets, Taxation of crypto assets, AML/KYC Regulations, Legal meaning and status of whitepapers, Intersection of Intellectual Property and BlockChain, Metaverse and Law. The proponents also noted that they need a solid team of legal consultants from the jurisdiction with expert knowledge of blockchain law to guide us in answering these questions. They will work with the team at Tevetoglu Legal to research and understand these issues. Their work will result in research documents, which we will publish on our knowledge base, The Vault. This is very important when it comes to ensuring that they will share the information generated in the Catalyst community through workshops, and spread it further through marketing activities, allowing others to learn. As the authors put it, it would be possible to \u201cget a group of lawyers with blockchain expertise into the Catalyst ecosystem\u201d. And with that, more and more projects would broaden their horizons and increase their impact on the Ecosystem once legal and financial frameworks are explored and established. Another positive is that they will work with Tevetoglu Legal, a professional team of experts, to mitigate the risk that legal knowledge can be misunderstood by the members of the blockchain community who are not familiar with the legal aspects of the proposed solutions. With that, I think there are several indications that the project will work and the proposer is perfectly aligned with the objectives of the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The script allows us to have a very accurate view of the success, since the activities that will take place each week between September 2022 and February 2023 are defined. I was surprised about the duration of this proposal because there are so many activities I thought the time would be longer, however, the way it is presented to us, the timeline related to specific actions for each week creates a very solid understanding of the process development of this project. So concerning the roadmap, I have no criticism to make, I can\u2019t even say that the activities could be more detailed because all the necessary detail is presented in this part. Now talking about the budget, the module budgets is perfectly explained, as there is a lot of detail, we know each proposal is made up of modules, each module has a specified budget, and the sum of module budgets makes up the first part of the overall budget. But how would this project be marketed? In the \u201cModule 3: Marketing The Littlefish Vault\u201d, Personnel Budget: 3000 USD (50 USD/hr * 60 hrs) + Operations Budget: 600 USD = Total: 3600 USD\u2026. I would like those parts that don\u2019t talk about the salaries of those involved to be better detailed. Finally, speaking of the team, this part of the project is very good, a good detail is presented about each member of the team, we know their names, their professional resumes, whatever, what they have done so far, but unfortunately, we don\u2019t have links to their social networks such as LinkedIn, Github,... which could help us to verify the said information.

In this way, we will have a wide range of information available on the progress of the module, so that we can fully monitor the development process. There is no criticism to be made here, the proponents have already committed to giving very complete gradual feedback to the Cardano community through which we can verify everything that has been done in this project. They will track these posts specifically and incentivize team members and contributors to share their Actions, preparing them for Actions on the mainet. Regarding the final results, the proponents explain that \u201cSuccess means their experiments which relating to publishing Actions (including Financial tracking of rewards, Actions published on #action Discord channel, Older Actions published on the Adventures of Littlefish) turn into learning which turns into applications loved by the community. With this, they have direct access to solutions that provide financial and legal services, support, and guidance to emerging Projects in the Catalyst Ecosystem.

I have no affiliation, and do not belong or serve on any of their projects and I am not from Turkey.\n-----------------------------------------------------------      \nThis proposal is one of the finest and complete Proposals I have read or reviewed. It is professorial in its structure. It directly addresses and strongly so, the Challenge.\n___________________________________________________________\nThe first step for this Proposal is understanding the unique concept and long term action goal the Little Fish Foundation has. The $84,800 Ask in the proposal begins by asking PA's (VPAs and Voters) to watch several videos that explains the structure, concept and philosophy within LFF and Little Fish Vault ( like an open source repository of pertinent knowledge(their own GitHub)). To fully understand this and every other proposal LFF, watching the videos is key. \n------------------------------------------------------------ The basics of this Proposal is to research blockchains legal & tax implications by using Tevetglu Legal in Turkey, compile the knowledge and share it thru documents and workshops. The Proposal lists 3 major key metrics it will address in the open source reports about the 13 problem areas identified. The problem areas include: taxes, laws, regulations, AML and so much more in their comprehensive well thought out identification metric. These will be converted (to paraphrase) into three key metrics of USE CASE, IMPACT and ADAPTABILITY with their Open Source Research.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThe main player in this research is Tevetoglu Law, based in Turkey. The firm is like the Who's, Who of all things Crypto and Blockchain and has some serious depth to their bench. The firm will also be utilized in LFF keeping the Vault research (very important with Legislation) current. \n------------------------------------------------------------\nBased on the proposal, attachments, and metrics stated I assess this Proposal as a 5 (Strongly agree) star that it addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From reading the proposal, fact checking data and included readings and attachment along with some of their work with Gimbalabs my thoughts are this project is extremely likely to be implemented successfully.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nTheir list of deliverables with research and monthly workshops is clear, understandable and concise. They will deliver and have broken the work load/flow/budget into what they term \"Modules\". The listed Modules are: 1. Legal Research, 2. Educational Workshops, and 3. Marketing The Vault (open source knowledge & research repository).\nEach Module has its own budget, hourly rates, metrics and purpose. \n-------------------------------------------------------------\nOne twist so to speak of this and apparently all LFF Proposals and one which once I got my mind wrapped around it I agree with. LFF is looking long term and building a Cardano Community (& more) Platform for long term self-sustainability. They budget (as I understand) a small !/14th-1/15th of the Proposal towards a rainy day(ACTION FUND) fund for their self-sustainability ultimate goal. They are completely above board and transparent about this and have principled reasons for its purpose and use. In my assessment I see this long term thinking as making this and all LFF Proposals more feasible that they will be successful.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nTheir 3 modules are broken into the categories i previously mentioned. Standard work and research, etc are budgeted at $50 per hour, with the exception of the Legal work which is budgeted at $100.  The modules and budget are fully explained, and clear. The timetable for delivery is straight forward and realistic. The proposal is realistic about its Risk Management and this is where their rainy (they call it ACTION FUND) day fund is a strong plus.\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nI assess this proposal by the LFF to be a 5(I strongly agree) that this will be successfully implemented.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The clarity of explanation to the 13 problem areas, broken down to 3 key metrics, along with the 3 modules, each with its own budget makes this, in my opinion, set up for an easy audit process.
