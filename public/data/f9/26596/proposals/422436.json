The idea here is the proponent will \u201cuse his list of contacts that will be powerful and appropriate to pursuing good blockchain laws & legislation along with teaming up with blockchain and crypto-friendly companies to further the enrichment of his SuperPAC's reach and abilities\u201d. Honestly, I think this idea is quite shallow. From what I understand, his goal here is to be able to expand knowledge about crypto and blockchain to \u201cthe people around politicians and give politicians the means of making decisions\u201d so that they would understand \u201cthe depth of crypto, systems, and tech\u201d. However, several important things are not clear: What is SuperPAC? What activities would be developed in this project? How would Cardano technologies be used here? What kind of contact would be powerful and appropriate for pursuing good blockchain laws & legislation? etc. I believe that all these questions should be answered so that we understand the core of the proposal. From the way the idea is presented to us, it is not clear what impact would be generated. In addition, the contextualized problem is that this project is not for common people. In my view, the target audience of this project is politicians who do not know about blockchain, especially the Cardano ecosystem. I agree that it\u2019s a good way to expand this type of project to new audiences, what I\u2019m missing here is more detail about the consequences would be for Cardano and how its technologies would be used in practice. So the grade for this topic will unfortunately be low", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The information that has been given is very superficial. For example, there is no roadmap in the proposal. We don\u2019t know anything about the pre-production process. And the temporal notion is a little strange, for example, this project would be done until November 2022? I don\u2019t think so much clarity is given regarding the temporal part of the script, in the following excerpt: \u201cElection coming in November which is the 2-year mark till the general elections\u201d. The proponent says what would happen according to a certain time but he does not explain the activities, he only mentions them, such as: \u201cgoing out and letting people know I am starting this SuperPac will be integral for future successful plans and reporting back new connections that bring other people and companies on board\u201d. With this, we have a somewhat superficial understanding of the whole. The same thing happens in the budget part, the proponent just claims that \u201cMy budget breakdown consists of me going places to meet candidates and elected officials along with the participation of mass corporate gatherings where partnerships can be sought and creating long-lasting connections being made by me.\u201d In general, we don\u2019t know how the money (9 thousand dollars) would be used. What happens in pre-production? How much time the author would dedicate to the work? How much he would receive in salary?... Finally, regarding the team, it is just the author and we don\u2019t have any information about him. We don\u2019t know his name, background, how he would work for this project (for how many hours per week, for example), or how he relates to the Cardano ecosystem and we would also need a way to verify all the information describes, some online profile, whether LinkedIn, portfolios, his contacts on discord, telegram, etc. So I suggest the proponent review his idea as a whole and revise the proposal.

About the progress, what would the SuperPAC be? How the reporting the filings and responses would help measure the project? I think, first of all, we need a detailed roadmap of the proposal so that we would know exactly what we are auditing. Regarding the final results, what the proponent includes here is the same thing we found in the previous topic, impact, from what I understand. As it is a proposal that is not well explained, I find it difficult to audit the results. In general, the proponent lacked a definition of what would need to be monitored in more detail, and how the project development process could be followed,\u2026 So, unfortunately, I think this part of the proposal needs a lot of improvement.

Political advocacy for funding for legislation is not directly related to this purpose. However, because political matters and \"a bill that wont stifle us\" could potentially affect legal or financial matters, I have given a rating of 2 rather than 1 stars for impact.\n\nMy rating is also influenced by the lack of the clarity on the purposes or identity of the SuperPAC, or the types of contacts that would be made to support it.\n\nI would encourage the proposer to explain in more detail in a future proposal how the proposed SuperPAC would work, how they would promote it and how it advances the goals of Cardano.

However, we are provided with no information about who the author is, other than some unspecific statements about previous involvement in political appearances and campaigns.\n\n2) The proposal author believes that his solution to crypto regulatory challenges could be addressed by expanding their personal contact list to improve readiness for a SuperPac in advance of upcoming elections.  However the plan to implement a SuperPAC is vague/absent so it's unclear what exactly the effect of this activity would be at such an early phase.\n\n3) The author's approach to achieving influence via this SuperPAC is to educate/inspire those people around politicians.  However, in the absence of the author's own profile, it's difficult to evaluate what qualifications they have in the crypto space that could offer utility in those efforts.\n\nIt was those reasons why I slightly agree that the fit between the team and the solution presented here would be effective in addressing the problem presented as it relates to the Legal and Financial Implementations Challenge.\n\nAs a suggestion, the title also includes the word SPAC to refer to a SuperPAC.  \"SPAC\" is often used to refer to a \"special purpose acquisition vehicle\" and that terminology might confuse voters.

To obtain a top rating a Proposal requires all of these, in detail for the PA, VPA and voter.\n-------------------------------------------------------------My assessment is this proposal did not include all of the pieces needed to fully understand if this was a feasible proposal. The first suggestion I would give to the proposer is about the formation of the Superpac.  This is essentially ignored in the section on detailed plan. How will you form it, who will do it, what state or region or Country will it be formed in. What is the time frame to form and how will the Pac be funded. These would be some of the basic information I would expect.  For the budget section, I think all readers need to understand where, how much and the metrics of the money you are asking them to invest in your proposal should be clear. The proposal Title states it is for a Super Pac, but your budget explanation of \"My budget breakdown consists of me actually going places to meet candidates and elected officials\" does not match up. I would suggest you be clear on what hourly rate you are paying yourself, how much is for entertainment, etc. And, how much is the actual cost to for the PAC?\n-------------------------------------------------------------Other sections which I assess are weak in your proposal include your Risk Management, Timetable, Team Members required to build and staff a PAC, and needed resources.

Improved perception can lead to support for innovation, and more pro-crypto legislation, which in turn can simplify and further the work of Cardano projects in the Tri-state area.
