However, that is not to say that the region\u00b4s governments are keen on aiding or necessarily even tolerating what to their eyes is a parallel financial system with no oversight or regulation. In this regard, exploring and establishing concrete financial implementations from countries with more crypto-friendly regulations becomes fundamental to the progress and success of funded proposals in the deverloping economies of the Global South.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers are long-time members of the Argentine chapter of the LATAM Cardano community, SPOs, funded proposers, and organizers of the Cardano Buenos Aires 2021 Summit. Their dedication to the Cardano ecosystem is beyond doubt, and the plan as is presented indicates a great deal of previous planning, with the important detail that many of the expenses of the planned trip and reserach will be at the own expense of the proposers, and dare I say that they would go ahead with this idea even without funding. As a note regarding potential modifications for future iterations of this project, it would be interesting how the knowledge obtained from the multiple consultations to be held in Malta, Andorra and Argentina will be made public for the community, perhaps via the LATAM Cardano Community channels, so as to create synergies for other regional and national projects that may benefit from this financial implementation framework.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposed reporting of specific financial institutions (banks and crypto exchanges), from which the proposers obtain satisfactory information that allows to carry out operations from Malta and Andorra, detailing the procedure to carry out said operations with each one of them so that it can be replicated by other members of the community, is a fair and quantifiable measure to audit the progress of this proposal. For future iterations, perhaps it would be interesting to count on a predetermined numerical sample of banks and exchanges to be approached, so as to be able to measure the favorable results with regards to said available portion of institutions (ie from a total of 20 institutions that were approached, only 5 offered viable financial implementations for crypto-backed ventures in LatAm).", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2636", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7496, "q0": "Since this type of information is required not just for Argentina but also for other countries, the fact that they are doing it from another country or countries makes it easily transferable to other countries, it is a very interesting process for everyone who wants to be in this community and who wants to work and finance themselves through cryptocurrencies. Knowing the law of the country where the financial movements will be generated will make it simpler to transfer those movements to other nations.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The fact that this idea arose from the requirement for a prior proposal gives me comfort in knowing that, despite the fact that I lack the financial expertise that is required for an investigation, I do have experience with something that is completely novel to anyone who needs to have the legal and financial know-how to make it happen.\n\nAdditionally, it makes it necessary for the proponents to complete an exceptional study because it is being implemented concurrently with a project that is being funded in the same manner. My main concern with this is how the community-based research will be disseminated because it is not entirely clear where the findings will be displayed, but overall, it is very clear what they hope to learn and what they hope to accomplish.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In the case of auditability, it appears to me that they have periods that are appropriate for the proposed study; nevertheless, I would have like to have more specific information, such as the development times of each topic, rather than just a list of all the topics they intend to investigate.\n\nBut the truth is that I am unsure of how we will be able to track the development of the studies that are being created because it appears that we won't be able to do so while the work is being done, only after the entire study has been completed. As a result, I am unsure of how the study process will be carried out.\n\nNevertheless, I think that even though this procedure is not entirely apparent, we will be able to witness the final outcomes, which in my opinion are quite beneficial for all the people who wish to be legally supported in various countries.\n\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2898", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8390, "q0": "In South America, Argentina is becoming the heaven of cryptocurrency due to high inflation and the national currency gets weaker making people livings tougher than ever.

However, there are still no specific solutions to approach this market so far and the team is still working on it so even it is matched completely to the challenge, there are many doubts about the possbility of this plan. The author is totally aware that the main risk comes from time which is a bonus for them, because the study can last longer than expected and the country policy changes quickly. One more thing to consider is that after the collapse of Luna coin, Argentina people will get more cautious towards cryptocurrency and they should study more for solutions. Therefore, at this stage everything is seem as potential only unless we have more concrete evidence.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "In this part, the author chooses to visit and research Andorra and Malta then apply which they study to find the legal channels for cryptocurrency in Argentina. In fact, they present the project very informative, explain the reason why to choose these countries and what they will receive / apply later. The timeline is clear and has exact milestones for each phase of the project. My only recommendation here is that Andorra and Malta have nearly the same culture and legal systems so it is greater if they could choose one country in South America / Africa instead as these two regions have huge needs for cryptocurrency too. The cost is optimized to serve the purposes of the project and it is reasonable as well, even the working hours are allocated systematically. Lastly, a combination between a project manager and an experienced lawyer will be the strong basic for the implementation and success of the plan in the future.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As this is the first time this kind of project deployed, it is understandable why there are no certain KPIs / metrics to compare and cross-check so it is better if the team could provide the list of financial institutons they intend to visit and study (I think it is easy in the internet era) then give us their expected convert ratio of instituations they can contact and collect data. The report content is comprehensive with enough sections, it is more ideal if the author could clarify where and when to publish it to help community and stakeholders monitor in the most convenient way. To value the process, the writer lists all required missions to be completed step by step leading to the final purpose how to raise fund legally in Argentina. In my opinion, even this project seems too small and not important as many projects in round 9, it is worth to invest because the potential is really high when it becomes successful, it will open the door to Argentina market together with much more benefits for people there as well as Cardano community.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2979", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9013, "q0": "ADA Solar is a project seeking to raise funds to develop clean energy in the real-world while maintaining active presence on the blockchain.

Faced with that challenge, the proponent proposed to ensure that crypto transactions in Argentina still continue by exploiting a legal route to bring projects into Argentina through countries who friendly with Crypto and find  countries that will allow the issuance of Tokens in the future. This project perfectly fits the goal of the challenge. The success of this project means opening a pathway for projects in the same situation and helping them to successfully obtain funding to carry out their future projects. The risks of the project are identified with 4 main challenges: research time, changes in national laws, restrictions on access to countries due to the Covid epidemic, some unclear laws. Although the proponent has found solutions to the above challenges, the success of dealing with those challenges is determined by many external factors.

Let's say, the project aims to support crypto-related projects that have difficulty entering Argentine banks by raising it through crypto-friendly countries before entering Argentina through legal channels. But how to raise it and legal channels here will belong to Argentina or other countries that allow the use of virtual currencies? The function of the project is not clarified, it will be easy for the voters to refuse to invest, so let's talk about it briefly to avoid being ignored by investors. Furthermore, the proposer says that this project is completely aligned with the Challenge, but so far I have not seen a point that is closely related or especially what benefits it will bring to Cardano. For future problems, though, the author has provided a decent workaround, yet I'm not entirely satisfied with them. For example, in the event that the law of crypto-friendly countries changes, not allowing links to Argentina anymore, the author chooses to move to another country to start researching again, then the time will be longer and if this situation continues happens, won't the project never be completed? Overall, the aim of the project is good, but perhaps the author should spend some time getting a little deeper into how it works and how the way forward is limited to facing as few challenges as possible", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Different from the above, this section helps us to have a deeper understanding of the project.

Each milestone very clearly explained the parts that need to be completed, along with the completion time of both parts will be 14 weeks. However, as the proposer said Andorra and Malta are two countries that have no special legal restrictions and they are more friendly to cryptocurrencies, but in case they change the law, move to a new country to study, whether the process implement is the same, and this makes me concerned. Therefore, it is better if the proposer has a backup plan to avoid wasting time and effort. For the capital use plan, the author has clearly listed the items that need to be spent during the project's progress. They are calculated by the number of hours along with the number of weeks to complete the work and will be used to pay the only 2 members of the project. Both of them are well-known names in industries and directly related to the purpose of the project as well as are very talented.
