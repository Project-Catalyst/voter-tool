The proposal does not address the challenge brief, which calls for building effective legal and financial solutions for funded proposers. The proposal itself provides few details about the project. One of the linked sites requires an email address to receive information. The other GitHub site provides more detail about the project, although it is confusing and hard to follow. For example, the concept seems to be that on the envisioned social media platform, everyone moderates content. In the same paragraph, the site discusses the use of algorithms. It isn\u2019t at all clear whether this is a crowd-funding play or a machine learning/AI strategy. The proposers also reference the need to run a Cardano node. It isn\u2019t clear what is meant by this, and whether they mean they only need to download Daedalus (in order to run a node) or if they meant they want to operate a stake pool. They state that their impact comes from expressing financial reputation as a monetary value and thus \u201cdisincentivizing bad actors from spamming online disucssions.\u201d Having read through almost the entire Github site, it is not clear how this would work. The proposal would benefit from a shorter and clear description of how they plan to accomplish the primary objective. Additionally, they probably would be better served by proposing in a different challenge. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposal would benefit from a lot more information about the team behind the project. No information is given in the proposal itself other than the name \u201cJan.\u201d I couldn\u2019t find any information on the Github site about Jan or the team.  The linked Fund8 proposal (which was not funded) provides a LinkedIn reference, but it only goes to an outdated job posting for a COO. Each step of the plan could use additional information. Step 1 involves operating a node (and was discussed above). Step 2 involves integrating with finclout-io\u2019s API. It would be helpful to understand what entity or project is connecting to the API and for what reason. The third step states \u201cEstablish as single form of clout for financial services creators.\u201d It would be helpful if the proposer provided a lot more detail about that idea within the proposal. Even reading through the Github site does not fully clarify what this step entails. The budget also would be improved by adding additional details. The proposer requests 5,000 for UX/UI \u201cimprovements.\u201d It would be helpful to see screen shots or the existing UX/UI to better understand specifically what would be improved, and how this will benefit the Cardano community. The rest of the budget request is for \u201csalaries\u201d and additional detail around which skill sets are required would also improve the proposal. While it is a minor detail, the GitHub site lists \u201cccvault\u201d as a supported wallet. CCvault changed its name to Eternl quite a while ago.

The proposer has indicated that they are working on other proposals in Fund9. No links to other proposals were provided.

In that case, I would suggest that the proposer provide additional detail about exactly how retention rate is defined for their platform, how it will be measured, why the chosen benchmark rate is a good target, and what that benchmark rate means about performance.
