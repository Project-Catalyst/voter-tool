Even if it required the allocation of more treasury funds, I think commissioning a summary statement or article by your legal counsel that could be published, or even just holding a Twitter Space and/or recorded livestream about issues you ran into navigating legal considerations in the formation of the DAO, could greatly benefit additional projects in the Catalyst Ecosystem. The formation of compliant DAOs in the US is a huge legal issue that deserves some attention and investment from the Catalyst community, but I believe we also have a responsibility to try and share lessons learned via Catalyst funding as broadly as reasonably possible within the community.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I have little doubt that JPG Store will successfully utilize funds awarded from Catalyst to form the JPG DAO. However, because it's possible the process could be more time consuming than currently expected, it would've been better if the proposal broke down legal considerations to work through with more granularity, and explained potential mitigations in case there are time/cost overruns.\n\nAlso, while I have little doubt that the proposal will result in a legally compliant, JPG DAO, the challenge of forming a DAO that preserves the community driven nature of a platform while also complying with US securities law may be a difficult needle to thread, so if success is measured by how well this balance is struck, that kind of success may not be easy to attain. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal states that \"The progress would be tracked as checklist against the Howey test to ensure we don\u2019t fall under the definition of security ... \" but I'm a little unclear about whether this checklist of the Howey Test will be published, or reported in monthly Catalyst coordinator reports, or whether it will just be tracked internally by the JPG Store team. Also, the proposal states that it will have the following impact: \"This will empower other entities within the Cardano ecosystem and crypto as a whole to learn from our roadmap and launch other utilitarian tokens.\" But unless more granular reporting is published by JPG Store's team or their counsel on how the JPG DAO navigates its legal considerations, it may not serve as a particularly useful case study for other Cardano projects to learn from. Simply seeing that JPG Store formed a DAO that has not drawn unwanted attention from the US SEC or other regulatory authorities won't necessarily be a big learning opportunity unless more details about decisions that were made are eventually shared with the community.

However, I think that by starting now to implement solutions, even if they were only for the short term, the developments could help the entire space grow and advance.\nHowever, I would have liked to read more information about the efforts of the JPG team in this venture. As it stands at the moment, the proposal only has minimal information for each of the three main sections and as such, gives the impression that the funding request is put in place just to further their project, without any consideration for the Cardano Community at large - here comes to mind their wording \u201cto learn from our roadmap\u201d, which implies that the findings will not be made available to the Cardano Community in the form of a separate document, but only as a mention in the project\u2019s roadmap.\nFurthermore, the team mentions the formation of their DAO, yet it is completely unclear what the role of this DAO will be, why it is needed and how will the rest of the community benefit from it.\nOverall, I find myself in a position where I neither agree nor disagree with the potential impact the proposal could have on the entire ecosystem.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I understand that the purpose of this proposal is to find solutions for JPG Store\u2019s DAO tokenisation model, yet I feel there could be a lot more information in the detailed plan section, than just the fact that over a period of 2 weeks, they would be spending 15 hours of consultation with a legal team to come up with a solution for their token model.\nFor the start, I\u2019m asking myself what considerations do they already have? What are the main roadblocks and what potential directions would they be taking? A few sentences about this would have proven that the preliminary discussions with the said legal team have produced at least a minimum of ideas.\nThe budget the team is asking for is $50000, which will be spent entirely on the legal consulting firm. While I am not a US citizen, I know that law firms are expensive in the United States. In the proposal, the rate asked is of $2000 an hour per partner from the  Schulte Roth & Zabel LLC, which is one of the top firms in New York and Washington DC.\nWhile most well-paid lawyers ask for around $800 an hour, I have googled the hourly rates of top lawyers, and indeed some are asking for $2000 an hour, especially those who specialise in taxation, antitrust, restructuring and mergers and acquisitions.\nBut considering that the rate is extremely high, I would have expected the JPG Store team to consider offering some explanations as to why this particular firm is so important in achieving their goals and why they decided to work with them and what particular skill do the partners at the firm have in regards to the crypto space.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "For auditability, the solution the team offered is sensible but they might have forgotten to mention how they plan on letting the community assess the checklist evolution. This aspect is very important, as the funding is successful upon the community voting, paying fees and supporting the blockchain. As such, it is vital to offer as much transparency to the projects funded by the treasury.\nAs mentioned in the impact section, the role of the DAO in the context of this proposal is unclear, so having it mentioned in the last paragraph of the auditability section when describing the vision of success for the project, is to me very confusing. And the DAO is not just mentioned, but it is the focus of the entire answer, looking to me like it was taken from a different proposal and not from this one.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 6, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1421, "q0": "Bringing on more accounting and legal support requires projects that can afford to spend the time and resources educating the expensive professions on web3 prior to specific goals, unless these organizations have a history in the space. When considering the impact on such a (relatively) small amount of funding for the scope of legal and accounting framework, JPG Store has a clear advantage as a profitable company in the ecosystem. Their ability to leverage the existing relationships from top legal counsel in North America, primarily the USA where there is still many questions especially related to DAOs and Securities Laws. \n\nThe primary deviation from the Challenge proposal can be seen in this request (10% of the Challenge) being allocated for only JPG Store\u2019s DAO and it\u2019s legal review. While I believe this to be a net positive for the overall Catalyst / Cardano Community due to their large footprint and very active community - it should be noted that this will be a blueprint for others to follow, not a tool to replicate the process. \n\nIf the community were to pick a clear market leader to set an example with the best lawyers in the country (high cost, selective clients) I believe this would be a worthy spend for high overall community impact. For these reasons I give this a 5/5 ranking.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Since the work is broken down on two sides, education for the legal team from JPG Store as well as the legal experience and execution it\u2019s worth considering the feasibility of both parties involved. \n\nFrom my research Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP is a top tier legal team in the general financial world with experience going back at least to 2015 when the CFTC discussed their thoughts on Bitcoin. This means they have spent the time being engaged in regulatory discussions, educating existing financial institutions, and being thought leaders in the legal crypto space. This alone makes me more confident the spend on this proposal would bring a clear opinion to the overall community on how DAOs can succeed in Cardano. \n\nJPG Store and Blake (Founder) have been very open and engaged with the broader Cardano community as they have launched and built the marketplace. From hosting Twitter spaces addressing key concerns, often taking the feedback to reverse a decision they may have made too hastily even, shows me a level of empathy and engagement needed in building the initial framework for a DAO. \n\nFurthermore this direct access has given Blake a great name and the company rocketed to the #1 Marketplace on Cardano. With this broad of a reach (90%+ marketshare) it\u2019s likely the largest active community using an app on Cardano. \n\nWith the high calibre legal team + the large community visibility of JPG Store, I think there is a high likelihood of creating a solid legal review of a DAO structure that any number of USA based companies could mimic. For these reasons I give this a 5/5 ranking", "q1r": 5, "q2": "While the Challenge parameters are a little vague on distinct Key Metrics to track, I believe that Auditability will be quite straightforward for this proposal. There isn\u2019t a deliverable beyond a legal review and checklist against the Howey Test ( the legal US test to determine if a Security is being issued ), this increases feasibility and gives us a clear deliverable for Auditability. \n\nI would like to see JPG Store also include appropriate legal opinions and notes that help others create a framework or example to follow as they build different companies. While each of these companies would require their own legal counsel, it would likely save 100\u2019s of thousands of dollars in billable hours over time. \n\nFor the simplicity and the clear deliverable I give this a 5/5 ranking.

In that sense, a roadmap with detailed planning can be of a simpler nature. The proposers will use a Howey test as their method of progress tracking, which is a well suited method for the purpose. The few parts to improve in terms of auditability could be to provide a public channel/blog where the progress is provided to the community during the legal review. Also, the definition of success is a bit hard to define as a measurable goal since staying compliant with the law can be hard to properly assess.

Through this proposal they are reaching out to the Catalyst community because they intend to launch a DAO and token, and are seeking to fund a discussion with Schulte Roth & Zabel, a law firm, in order to help them choose the best path forward in order to avoid risks which can materialize down the road, for instance that of the token being considered a security under the existing legislation. \n\nThere is a very clear value proposition in front of us, and the proposal is very well aligned with the challenge, since its purpose is, remember, to fund projects that can help Catalyst proposers to better navigate the legal and financial challenges. The risk that the proposers would like to steer clear of (being considered a security) is definitely real, and we only have to go as far as recalling the well known SEC vs. Ripple case, which is still ongoing. While this is definitely one of the few prominent cases of such nature, and not proof of an endemic problem in this direction, the fact that the JPG store decides to cover all bases here is a laudable thing. \n\nConsidering all of the above, this is definitely a proposal that fits well with the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Here is how the project would take place. The JPG store\u2019s executives would enter discussions with legal experts to ensure the creation of a DAO. The budget is very simple to understand. The legal assistance will materialize in 30 hours of assistance, out of which 20 would be charged by 2 partners (for an hourly fee of 2.000 USD) while an associate would charge 10 additional hours, for an hourly fee of 1.000 USD. The hourly rates are slightly on the higher end, but in the end it is each voter\u2019s responsibility to judge the value for money for each individual proposal. \n\nA rather weak part of the proposal is the presentation of the team, or rather its lack thereof. We are merely informed that, from JPG store\u2019s part, their \u201cC-Level executives will be interfacing with the law firm\u201d, but we are not being told who those executives are. Unfortunately, neither does their website shed more light into the matter, because the entire team sits behind pretty NFT photos and nicknames (Blakelock, Shabro, Yellowbutt, etcetera). Of course, privacy is an important matter, but I believe that executives of important Cardano projects (especially when asking for funding) have a duty of transparency towards the community, and this is definitely not the case here. \n\nFrom my point of view, the team\u2019s anonymity is a very major issue, and I can\u2019t hold a straight face and offer more than three stars given that the community is not able to verify even a basic identity of the founders.  ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There is an excellent point of reference offered to track the progress of the project, and that is a checklist against the Howey test. For those not in the know, the Howey test was designed by the US Supreme Court in 1946 to assess whether a certain business arrangement (a leaseback of a citrus plantation in that case) constituted or not an investment contract. The test in itself had withstood the test of time, and, albeit now there are other ways to ascertain that problem, it remains an important point of reference not only in the US. \n\nWhat would have turned this proposal into an excellent one is a feedback loop through which the Cardano community can also benefit from funding this proposal. For instance, considering the already rather steep pricing behind this consulting project, it would not have cost too much in additional money to ask the law firm to document the discussions had and turn them into a report that can be shared with the community and be of reference point for future Cardano projects that will be faced with similar challenges in the future.

I agree that the Cardano ecosystem exists a lot of tokens that can be construed as securities under the North-American and European laws raising issues of legitimacy and legality. And the proponent intends to create a JPG DAO and tokens are in line with the legal requirements and outlines of the land. By sitting down with the partners and associates at Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP, they would discuss the plan the team has for the DAO and its token.

We know what would be done, but not how it would be done. The roadmap only mentions that the project will be done in 2 weeks, and its activities are not explained so it would be a lie to say that it is possible to understand the process.

Regarding the budget, a very high amount is requested, but the same thing happens: we are informed in a very basic way about expenses, for example in \u201cPartners: 2000/hour\u201d, \u201cAssociate: 1000/hour\u201d, and \u201c10 hours * 2 partners + 1 associate = 50k\u201d. But who will do what, in what order, and why? Why would the partners cost 2 thousand dollars? I think all parts should be carefully detailed, mainly because they are such expensive values. Finally, speaking of the team, we don\u2019t know details about those involved. We need to know who we are dealing with to have confidence that they are capable of executing the project. Who are they? What are their names? What jobs have they done before? How can we prove that they are prepared for this?

In my view, to improve this, the roadmap should be better detailed, from which weekly reports should be generated, for example, on how their work routines have been, and make them available to the entire Cardano community, its partial results were achieved, etc. There would need to be several smaller goals, and measurable data, that would allow our community members to understand if this was achieved and how.
