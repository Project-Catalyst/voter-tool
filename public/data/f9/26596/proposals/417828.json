Ultimately, the team has a long term intention of making this model accessible to other hubs outside WADA. On the basis of this, I see the model for this project as a more aligned approach to the legal and financial challenge setting. Wada has several projects that falls under its auspices, therefore with the myriad of WADA hubs, the possibility of an oversight on the activities of any of the WADA hubs is very likely. Therefore, I support the idea of putting in place a framework that enable WADA track and monitor all hubs and at the same time scaling up the level of transparency and accountability across all WADA hubs.

And that\u2019s very normal, because small teams should only focus on their core competencies and value proposition instead of wasting resources on maintaining a top notch legal and accounting position and lose themselves in paperwork. How can Wada help African small businesses with these challenges? \n\nBy creating a hub model, sort of a franchise, and onboard new hubs and partners by using legal and financial frameworks to streamline these activities. This will help them to deliver an operating model that is sound, and repeatable across their geographical reach, a white-label framework framework that can potentially be used by non Wada hubs. \n\nHow is this proposal connected to the challenge? Well, remember that our goal here is to support the proposers in any way shape or form when it comes to their financial and legal challenges. Setting up a framework for Wada hubs does not help them directly, but can really boost the operations of all the hubs if they will manage to streamline their activities and service more small businesses.

Half of it would go towards funding two persons for six months drafting the necessary documentation, while the rest would be split between sundry items. \n\nConsidering Wada\u2019s strong presence in the Cardano ecosystem, the modest budget and the simple yet effective timeline, this project is highly feasible and welcomed.
