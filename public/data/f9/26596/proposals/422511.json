Here, a training program is suggested for about 20 people to become mediators (to resolve conflicts so that they do not have to involve the legal system); This perfectly serves the objective of promoting \u201ca direct access to solutions that provide financial and legal services, support and guidance to Emerging Projects in the Catalyst Ecosystem\u201d. The stated problem is that there are many conflicts within (and outside) the Cardano community that are inadequately handled (\u201cmany emerging projects on Catalyst face legal and financial issues that prevent them from moving forward\u201d), and there are few mediation experts these days. available. Mediation would be precisely this process in which the parties try to find a solution to their problems with the support of a mediator, who is someone who is technically prepared to deal with this type of situation in the best possible way. Mediation, according to the proponents, does not mean that a third party will make the decision that will completely dissolve the parties' problem, but will guide them through alternative solutions, which do not have to fall into the legal system, which despite from sometimes being indispensable, it is still quite bureaucratic and expensive. So if more mediators are available within our community, the chances of us being able to resolve conflicts properly will increase a lot, and this will be extremely positive for the entire ecosystem, because once situations are unlocked, the problems that previously prevented projects are executed will no longer get in the way of getting the work done. This will generate an increase in team unity (since conflicts often occur between members of the same project), which will enhance the daily work of projects and thus increase the results that would be generated; which would directly contribute to Cardano's overall growth and establishment. In addition to the idea being very valid, it is extremely positive that the proponents explain in detail what the training program for new mediators would be like, which would include parts such as: \u201cintegration into mediators.ai (optional for new mediators) + NFT for successful completion program success + ongoing support for a minimum of one year for new mediators\u201d. It is possible, through the information given, to understand how the program would be executed in practice. And it is very relevant the fact that, apparently, it is not necessary to have any specific training to become a mediator, it is enough to be interested and to know how to speak English - if the proposal is successful I think it is a good idea to launch this course in other languages \u200b\u200bwidely spoken by our community, to increase accessibility to mediations for people from different backgrounds. That said, in my view the proposal is highly relevant and fits very well with what the challenge seeks.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It would be very interesting if the activities proposed in the roadmap were more detailed, so that we have a more solid understanding of the project development process. For example, in September, the registration of interested participants would be carried out, as well as the definition of the dates and times of the synchronous sessions. I would like to know how the team intends to publicize the course opportunity, how the Cardano community could become aware of this possibility, in which media they intend to advertise, and in what way (what would the marketing process look like, say?). To increase our level of understanding of the training program, I would like to know what topics would be addressed at each meeting. It is said that \u201cthe 40-hour mediation training introduces the basic principles and methods of alternative dispute resolution. This training program provides a solid foundation and mediation skills through lectures, small group exercises and role-play, and is rich in theory and practice.\u201d What would these basic principles and resolution methods be? Although the proponents have defined some milestones, such as by October it is expected to have at least 10 accredited mediators and by December the first cases are being resolved by these mediators, it would be beneficial if we had a little more detail about the course itself and about how it would be publicized. Even the proponents themselves define it as a risk to the project to have a lack of interest in the program (less than 10 participants), so it would be important to know how this situation could be avoided. Speaking of funding, the measured amount of approximately 20,000 dollars, the amount is divided quite satisfactorily. We were able to understand that part of the money would go towards Zoom accounts, part would go towards creating the NFTs and part towards project management (with a value of 34 dollars an hour of work for these tasks). I believe it is important to make it very clear that the training will not be free, because from what I understand the mediators will have to work for the program for a period of 2 years (minimum) to reward the teachings received, I think this is quite fair but it needs to be very explicit, to avoid further problems. Finally, thinking about the team, there is total confidence in this team, both due to the fact that the company behind the proposal (Loxe Inc.) already has good experience with the mediation field; both for the richness of detail with which each member is presented (for example, we know a lot of information about Renata Valr\u00e9e, we know that Mathias already has a good involvement with Cardano, etc.). That said, I believe the proposal is very viable, only a few details could be added.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proponents suggest very valid ways to audit the proposal, but in my opinion they are not enough for us to have a complete monitoring of this project. They suggest the partial results that can be used so that we can verify if the proposal is developing as expected (for example, in September the \u201clinks to relevant posts and media related to the promotion of the proposal in the Catalyst community + definition of dates would be analyzed\u201d. and schedules based on information from interested participants + number of registered participants\u201d). But how could we evaluate the first activities being developed in the project, behind these small successes? As I commented on feasibility, how could we first audit the training program dissemination? And how could we verify that all interested parties were registered, and if the number of participants greatly exceeded the expected, with what criteria would a selection have been made? Regarding the development of the project in a more advanced way, how could we verify if the meetings were happening as they were agreed in relation to the dates and the contents that would be passed in each one? I think it would be necessary for the team to collect this information at the end of each month, so that we could understand what was done that month, and also how, what activities were behind the achievements, what challenges were faced that month, and so on. Such information could be taken to the community in written reports, which could be disseminated for example through the community's Telegram and Discord channels. Talking about the success scenario, the proponents state that \u201cwe will consider this project successful if we manage to get at least 10 registered participants and 10 mediation certificates issued at the end of the course. Our goal is to have 20 dedicated participants signed up instead of just 10, which we consider the ideal outcome.\u201d But in addition to training future mediators, it would be very positive if 1) we had some way of collecting feedback from those who participated in the program; 2) we could have more knowledge about their performance, that is, they would actually be acting as mediators, how many cases would they be solving per semester (for example), if the cases would be relevant to Cardano or not necessarily have to do with our ecosystem... If If we had more details about the consequences of the project, perhaps our understanding of whether the project actually achieved what the challenge proposes would be increased. With that, I believe that auditability is good, but it could be deepened in some aspects.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 7, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 909, "q0": "Conflicts between parties in the Cardano ecosystem are only growing, and the legal institutions are not prepared to provide a solution in a way that\u2019s fast and efficient. This proposal tries to address this problem by providing mediation training to interested participants. It tackles this challenge by providing solutions to arising legal problems in the form of train mediators who will try to find a balanced solution that benefits both parties involved.\n\nThe way it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem is by training and certifying members of the Cardano community who have the desire to get started in dispute resolution. In turn, these members will help catalyst and other Cardano projects solve the conflicts they may have. This is great for Cardano since it builds a solid foundation for solving disputes in a way that\u2019s more beneficial for the ecosystem than starting proceedings before the court of any legal court or tribunal.\n\nRegarding scalability, the certification this proposal would offer not only is applicable to US based conflicts, but also international conflicts. Therefore, the voter can assume scalability to address future challenges is viable. Besides, what the proposer are trying to offer, is certification for mediators to get started in dispute resolution through the platform \u201cmediator.ai\u201d. Because of this, scalability in their operation would imply training more participants, which shouldn\u2019t be too hard to achieve.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer\u2019s skills and experience match the goals and objectives of what they are trying to accomplish. Enough evidence is provided to the voter in the form of personal, professional and academic history and links to official portals that can verify the data provided. The voter can observe that the skills of the proposers, such as certified estate planning mediator or Adjunct Professor in the Negotiation, Conflict Resolution at California State University (in the case of the person in charge of carrying out the training), match the objectives and requirements of the proposal. This is good to see, since it shows that the team that would carry out the roadmap has the knowledge and experience required to successfully obtain their objectives, the fact that the founders of the company in charge of the operation are catalyst members also helps in this regard.\n\nRegarding the team, the members and their assigned tasks are provided along with their LinkedIn accounts and some detailed information on their background, which allows us to have a more complete view of the team structure and their different functions.\n\nWhen it comes to the budget, the amount being asked is a bit less than 20,000 dollars, and it is divided into sections such as: instructors, project management or NFT. Looking at the different sections of the budget and the amount for each of them, the total number seems reasonable. For example, the most expensive section of the budget, which refers to the Instructors, is the average wage an Instructor in the state of California will receive per student.\n\nThe proposal also provides a timeline that includes some key milestones. While this timeline is short and concise in the information it provides, in my opinion it gives the voter the ability to comprehend what will happen and when through the different stages, which basically will be the last months (September, October, November) of the current year.\n\nAt last, the proposal mentions the only possible risks could be lack of interest from participants or cases where the instructors are unable to provide the training. The solution they provide to this is to return the money to Catalyst, which seems like a fair solution. Considering this proposal centers around training people, I can\u2019t think of any other risks that could arise, besides problems with the NFT mint or technical problems. If the team work on that, I see the solutions they provide very fitting and practical.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As mentioned earlier, the proposal provides a timeline with key milestones which need to be covered to determine success. To measure these milestones, the team will use some already determined metrics for each phase of the project. For example, one metric which will be recorded in September will be the number of register participants. In my opinion, this metrics are great to measure success since they track every step of the project development.\n\nPerhaps, mentioning a public channel where voters could track this progress, would have helped them to know the exact place where they could follow the proposal\u2019s development.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2151", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 5, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thanks for the suggestion to indicate where the voters could track our progress.
