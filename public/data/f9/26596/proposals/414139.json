Putting such a transaction on Cardano, a user can ascertain the price. The proponent states very well what the problem is \u201cmost contractual payments stay denominated in fiat currencies\u201d so we need a payment solution denominating payments in fiat, but without the financial risks of stablecoins. It is a very interesting use case that takes advantage of the using meta-oracle, which would allow us to avoid rate volatility by using a median of prices, avoid dependency on a single oracle provider, and increase service availability and stability even in case of a single oracle breakdown. I found the idea very promising, being able to bring a new payment solution without the financial risks of stablecoins. With this, the objectives of the challenge would be fully achieved. I think this project is something really useful and can help bring new active members into our community, thus fulfilling one of the specific goals of the challenge.

The schedules are explained in the action, where we could understand which activities would be developing each month. In that regard, there isn\u2019t much to complain about. In the script, they divide some objectives that need to be accomplished in 6 months, and what would happen each month in the process as a whole. Now talking about the budget, a total amount of 57.7 thousand dollars is asked, which is explained in a somewhat confusing way. \u201cDevelopment of meta-oracle and payment smart contracts - 30k\u201d. How much would it go for each? How many hours of work would each task, do so that we can get an idea of the price of the hours of work and conclude if the value is fair or not? \u201cCompliance and legal services - 20k\u201d. If so, what would the services look like? Who are the people who would work on this part? What would their work routine be like? In general, we get the total amount of $57,700, but we don\u2019t know if these parts would need to that cost. In short, all values should be better explained clarified. Regarding the team, I think that\u2019s the best part of feasibility because we are given their names, a very brief description of their professional roles, and their LinkedIn profile, where we can get to know them in more practically way and direct. But I think it would be better if we knew how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem.

Some indicators are mentioned that would serve to monitor how the project development process would be happening, as the author pointed out. However, the proposal does not outline ways in which we could monitor the project, it does not provide KPIs, metrics, what would be the partial results that would need to be achieved little by little for the proposal to be considered a success\u2026 For this part to improve, it would be necessary that he left the script more detailed, so that we could have a clearer view of the process and with that more conditions to follow it, monitor it to know if what was promised was fulfilled in the right way. Afterward, it is also necessary for the proponent and his team to update the Cardano community periodically (preferable monthly) on how things are going, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This must be done through direct contact with the community, using any of the various possible platforms (telegram and discord channels, online tools, etc). And concerning the final result, I found the visualization of the success scenario to be superficial. The desire here is to the public this plan and \u201cdemonstrate and document expected cost of launching a payment service on Cardano blockchain\u201d. I wonder how would such information be monitored and how would it become known to the Cardano community? I think the proponent needs to outline ways to verify such a scenario and prove that such impacts happened through examples. In general, I think the auditability of the project is ok, but it needs more detail on how the information would reach the Cardano community and more detailed explanations of how the success scenario would be perceived in reality.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2879", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2753, "q0": "\"The challenge of the challenge is that by any means we can provide a financial legal service.

Basically, the idea is to build a smart contract that makes payments. equal to ADA. The price of ADA will be taken as the average price for a certain period of time. Oracles will be responsible for providing exchange rates from exchanges into this smart contract. The project will build a \"Meta-oracle\" that has aggregate functionality from at least 3 oracles in the market. As for the impact side of the idea, I think will bring little value to emerging projects in Catalyst because of the usefulness of the proposition. The crypto market is not always full of price risk because of its high volatility. When we look over a period of time to calculate the average price, the price nature is still subject to volatility but only to reduce its fluctuation range, this has not yet solved the stability of payment for all types of delivery contracts like buying and selling goods, stability must be guaranteed to every zero after the comma. Thus, on the whole, this proposal will not be generally applicable to the emerging projects in Catalyst.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I do not agree on the feasibility of this proposal because there are several issues we need to discuss here:\n- First about budget breakdown: the proposed team has not yet stated the cost for each work to be done. Specifically in \"automatic monitor that writes meta-oracle data\", the proposed team offers a cost of 1.2k but how long does it take to produce an automatic monitor, the salary per hour of work is how much but total cost is 1.2k?. Same goes for other work items like \"compliance and legal services - 20k\". Therefore, I suggest that the proposed team should be more detailed in these work items, this will help the community have a more detailed view of the implementation costs.\n- Second about the roadmap: I think the time to build the synthetic oracle and provide the price for the smart contract only takes about 1 month is really very short. Because Oracle is the most important part in the blockchain space. The mechanism against currency manipulation has to be well-built and usually takes a long time to implement (in my experience 6 months or more for basic protection functions). Therefore, I advise the project that we should spend more time building oracle as securely as possible.\n- The third is about human resources: in general, we have experienced software developers and business analysts, but I think it is necessary to add more resources to develop the project's communication segment.. Because no matter how good the project is, bad marketing will lead to less attention from users.\nIn the end, I think the team recommends developing more promotion strategies for different user community groups. The guiding question is can this solution be used anywhere in the world?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "On the audit side of the project, the proposed team provided us with complete information about each team member through links to each person's profile page. But besides that, there is still some more information to be added because when looking at the milestones to measure the success of the project, the proposal team has not been able to concretize it into numbers. that we can simply measure by tracking code update progress on the website or Github. For example update frequency is 2 times/week and continuously until smart contract and oracle testing phase. Or target the number of users participating in the test, such as having #50 users sign up to participate in a product test.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2771", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 1, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6642, "q0": "There is a straightforward problem that this proposal wishes to solve - the ability to pay a certain amount of fiat (USD, GPB, etc), but the payment to be processed in ADA, at the exchange rate applicable from that point in time. For this, it is necessary to develop a smart contract and to use an oracle solution. Since the existing oracle solutions (ChainLink, Ergo and Wolfram) are still in development, the team also proposes to develop an in-house oracle just as a test basis for the smart contract. \n\nSince the project would bring to life a module that can be inserted in a payment solution and that it would be an off-the-shelf integration solution, it matches very well within the existing challenge and has excellent scalability potential. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind the proposal consists of four members. We have Michal and Francesco, both with a software background, then Patrick, a lawyer, and Szymon, a business analyst. We are thus observing a rather broad background, which is excellent news considering the project\u2019s blend of development and necessity for compliance since we are talking about a module from a payments solution.  \n\nTimewise, the project can be implemented in three months, followed by an additional three months of \u201csandbox\u201d solution to be showcased to lawyers / regulators / etcetera. During the first month the oracle and the smart contract would be built, the second month would see the automated oracle and payment API come to life, while in the third month the integration with the CIP-0030 wallet would be executed. \n\nAnother excellent point of the proposal is that it sets aside a very modest budget for exploring the opportunity of engaging in a third party security audit at a later stage. This is especially important since IOG has recently released a video outlining the future of Cardano dapps, especially offering details regarding how their security would influence the way in which the dapps will be displayed on the upcoming dapp store. This highlights Cardano\u2019s increased focus towards greater security, and the fact that this proposal sets aside a very significant portion of the budget for a third party certification is definitely an advantage over other dapps which will soon have to compete for \u201cprime space\u201d within a dapps marketplace where being certified will matter a great deal. \n\nThere are a few points which are rather unclear. First, the costs for developing the in-house oracle and the smart contract are bundled together for 50% of the overall budget. Given the fact that the oracle is only functioning as a temporary solution, it would have been a better solution to isolate its budget under a unique caption. In its current form, we cannot be sure if the 50% budget would go 50/50 for instance towards the smart contract and the mock-oracle, or 90/10, or 10/90, it is therefore difficult to judge the value for money obtained by each of the two modules, given that one of them is the core value proposition while the second is a temporary crutch. An additional 30% would go towards legal services, which is perfectly understandable considering that we are talking about a module from a payments solution.  \n\nOverall this is a highly feasible project, with perhaps a few more questions than necessary with regards to the choice of building an in-house oracle and how much resources would this necessitate, which is rather unclear. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal delivers good results in its auditability sections. The team pledges to have a web page for the project, with regular updates, hashes made available of the deployments (although I am personally not sure why hashes are necessary here), as well as updates from the compliance front. This being a proof of concept project, the team sets as success measurement simply being able to demonstrate the idea\u2019s feasibility and offering a flavor of how much it would cost to launch on the mainnet. Another valuable point is that the legal and compliance analysis performed during this time would be made available to the Cardano community. \n\nConsidering all of the above, we can say that this project is in a good position to deliver a transparent implementation of the smart contract + oracle that they wish to develop.
