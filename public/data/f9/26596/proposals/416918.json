What a divisive topic amongst blockchain enthusiasts. The value proposition here is the creation of a Cardano based stablecoin backed by (and convertible to) fiat. But the proposers are asking for funding for a very limited use case - the license fees for several US states, which are necessary for making payments.  \n\nCompetition is always a catalyst that fosters innovation, drives costs down and increases consumer utility, and I fully embrace it. So in theory yes, having an alternative to the DJED stablecoin, already in testing, is a great thing to have. However, in this case, we have in front of us a value proposition that does not touch upon very critical aspects of the business model. \n\nHow far in the development is the team if they are only asking for license fees? Have they launched it yet? Do they have the technical team to implement it? Do they have the financial team to handle the reserves? \n\nWhat about the other infrastructure necessary? To launch the stablecoin you need a very solid investment team in place to handle the money proceeds and invest it into short term bonds, highly liquid and while having a strong risk management process in place. While on the project\u2019s website there is a white paper that lightly touches upon these aspects, the level of detail presented is nowhere near what is needed in practice for such operations. \n\nConsidering the lack of details regarding the business model to be used, we cannot state for a fact that this proposal will be beneficial for the Cardano community. To reach that level, a clear business model must emerge, backed by a solid team and much needed capital. Right now, this is not the case, so only three stars I deem as appropriate. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "This proposal\u2019s feasibility is insubstantial. Matthew, a chartered financial analyst, is the main proposer, with background in traditional finance in the US and EU markets, including money markets (a very relevant point). But moving past this, the section that should describe the team only references that the team is \u201cfully doxxed\u201d on their respective website. Sadly, the website does not offer any additional details regarding the team, we can therefore not be sure of the existence of any other relevant team members so far. \n\nTimewise, things are rather simple, at least at first. The proposer expects to be able to launch each request for license soon after receiving funding, while the results should come in at most six months later, depending of course from state to state. But I am not convinced that this will be the case: handling 20+ state licenses, with different deadlines, necessary documentation and applicable legislation is a massive undertaking, and we know from above that we don\u2019t have a proof of a solid team behind the proposal, or the money set aside to hire a consultant to help with this task. So how will it be performed by a single person? We are not being told. \n\nThe budget is very simple to explain too: it will cover licensing fees in many of the US states, with fees ranging from 100 USD to 2.000 USD. While this is clear, nothing else is when it comes to the budget. Why, you may wonder? Because the task of launching a fiat-backed stablecoin and aim towards full redeemability in many of the US states is an enormous challenge, and it needs massive amounts of capital and technical competence, nowhere near what we are being demonstrated here. Let\u2019s take the biggest stablecoins and see how they function: in practical terms none of them is redeemable by the retail investor. For USDT, users must pay 150 USD for a KYC verification and the minimum amount to redeem is 100k USD, while USDC is issued and redeemed via Circle and Coinbase, again, not by retail investors. \n\nConsidering all the major red flags above, I think two stars are appropriate, since it is unlikely that this project can be implemented successfully in its current form. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposer begins the section by stating that the project would have its progress measured individually for each state\u2019s license application, and that success would be achieved if a favorable outcome for each state. While these details are necessary, they are definitely not sufficient, since a true transparency for this proposal would be ensured if and only if the entire project would be transparent for the community, and we have many missing links. Just a few examples. First, a crucial element is missing: we are being informed that Mehen, the project, is registered and able to operate in 3 states. If this is the case, how is the business going? Have they been able to issue the stablecoin yet? What would be the added value of obtaining 20 additional licenses, while still lagging in terms of stablecoin development?\n\nAgain, we have in front of us a rather unconvincing section of the proposal, and we cannot be sure that the Cardano community will be in a good position to track the development of this project, if implemented.

It can be very summarized in the following excerpt: \u201cCardano DeFi urgently needs a fiat-backed stablecoin, and Mehen is building that coin following the best practices demonstrated by Circle\u2019s USDC. The Mehen USDM coin will be directly-convertible 1:1 for USD, and is backed by fiat assets\u201d. The proponents intend to create a fiat-backed stablecoin that has several moving parts. It is also clearly very beneficial for Cardano DeFi, as people could easily and cheaply buy and redeem stable coins. However, it is not clear how this project could help the other Catalyst projects broaden their horizons and increase their impact on the ecosystem once legal and financial frameworks. For starters, what is \u201cfiat\u201d? I think this idea would fit better with the Dapps challenge, for example. Therefore, as much as the fiat-backed stable coin is useful for Cardano, it would be meeting only one of the facets necessary for the challenge to mint new coins for $1 and sell them on-chain, with that, I will, unfortunately, give a low note for the impact.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The presented script only gives us an idea of what would happen, because the time interval chosen is very confusing (for example, the first one is \u201cimmediately\u201d, the second phase is \u201c90-120 days\u201d, and the final phase is \u201c3-6 months\u201d). Besides that, all the information we needed to know about it is provided in a very basic way. Regarding the roadmap, the proponents explain what would be done, but the establishment of the schedule is superficial. The description of the activities is done in a very summarized way. A single sentence explains each one of them, without the proper detail, we cannot understand in a deep way what will happen, or how these things would be done exactly. Another observation is about the temporal division. It is said what would happen immediately after funding successful this project, and then in the next 3-4 months and finally 3-6 months. In my opinion, this timeline is abstract because I believe that the funding of this fund would only be distributed in an approximate timeline. But anyway, the time division is very macro. In addition, we don\u2019t know what activities would be carried out. Who would work on them, what their work routines be like, etc? Now speaking of the budget, it is very superficial and confusing. What are these indicator symbols: ID, MO, UT, DE, DC, ME, NH, NV, LA, MS, ND, AL, IN, NE, OR, VA, WA, WV, KT, MA, IA, NC, RI, SD, KS, AZ, CT? Maybe I\u2019m not a Defi expert so I do not understand what kind of those symbols are, but I think each symbol must be very well explained. Because I\u2019m unable to understand with solidity and specificity how the requested budget would be used. Besides that, I also don\u2019t know who would work here, how many hours the professionals would work on this, what would their working hours be, or how much would the price of the work hour be, so that we could see more concretely if the amount asked is fair?... Regarding the team, the proponent just claims that \u201cthe team is fully doxxed on Mehen.io.\u201d. And from what I found out on the website, I think this part is perfect, knowing in detail who the team members are: their names, areas of activity, a small resume, and their LinkedIn profile, Twitter, and email are also available where we can verify all the information said about the. We also have Cardano experts on the team which make sure we have someone very knowledgeable about our ecosystem. but overall, in terms of feasibility, only 1 of three topics is satisfactorily detailed, and the others parts need to be improved a lot. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The ways to audit progress are very superficial. The proponent claims that progress tracking would be done through each state\u2019s licensing path. But how could the Cardano community monitor this? In fact, we don\u2019t know what needs to happen, when it would happen, and I don\u2019t see clear ways in which the community could verify this licensing path in each state. So I think that it would be better to follow the development of the activities if the script were better organized in time, and if each of the activities was better detailed. And in order to properly monitor the construction of this part, there would have to be ways to audit the task and the partial results, not just the paths or the goals. Therefore, I consider that the audit of the process is quite inadequate. Regarding the final results, I found the information provided here to be too superficial: \u201cSuccess is promptly receiving a favorable outcome from our licensing examinations\u201d. The said information is extremely abstract, basically there is no specific goals, measurable objectives. The proponents do not define KPIs, metrics, quantitative and qualitative data that make it possible to safely monitor the project. In other words, I think that this part of the proposal left a lot to be desired, the proponents do not provide enough and adequate information so that we could follow neither the development nor the results of this project. So I think there is a lot of to be improved in this part of the proposal. You should outlined exactly how the community will have access to all the audited information and you should also think more objectively about how to see if the intended success has been achieved.

In their proposal, they are requesting funding for covering the fees for Money Transmitter License within 27 states. If successful in obtaining these licenses they can start operating in these states and achieve stable values for the USDM stablecoin.\nThe need for a stablecoin on Cardano is obvious to a lot of people not just in the Cardano community, but also within the smaller Catalyst community as well. As such, I agree that this proposal would be highly welcomed in the space.\nWhat I find particularly important in the case of this proposal, is how they covered the risk section. They have provided a long list of potential risks and challenges, and for each one, they have carefully considered the solution. Especially considering the anxiety in the blockchain space, ever since the de-pegging of other stablecoins, approaching this subject carefully will convince the community to adopt the asset.\nGiven all the considerations provided, I find this proposal to be highly impactful if successful and I will rate this section a 5/5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have done a great job in detailing what is probably a boring procedure, the application for Money Transmitter License, in a comprehensive and enjoyable manner.

They have transparently provided the fixed fees for each of the 27 states they will be submitting in. And I have also done the math, the total amount checks, the entire budget is dedicated only towards covering the fees and nothing else. Further down in the proposal, I read the mention that the team is hoping to cover the remaining licensing fees through the success of the project, which I find to be a very good approach on their part.\nThe team descriptions, photos and LinkedIn profiles are available on the project\u2019s website.

Their website (mehen.io) is a quick compilation of stock images and has NO legal print, a no-go for a regulated entity working on highly sensitive use cases.

The fact that the Mehen team has chosen him as CMO raises even further doubts on the integrity of the Mehen team and their ability to successfully register and launch their stablecoin.
