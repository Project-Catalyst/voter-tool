Catalyst does not have an available/ relevant source of information about it.", "f6_no_assessments": 5, "f6_rating": 4.8, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 5096, "q0": "The Onboarded companies playbook is a $13,500 proposal that directs its focus to the center of this Challenges Main Criteria. This experienced Catalyst and Cardano team, that are effectively - full time- have proposed to put together a Catalyst Playbook for newly funded companies. The Playbook will be constructed to first focus on the newly funded company; direct accounting and community Communication; offer post funding support with an additional benefit (other than just the funded company) to attract new companies and increase engagement with them.  To paraphrase a strong observation by the proposal team, in their recent experiences with helping to onboard other projects into Cardano they noticed some World Class projects that came to offer their services but after kicking the tires decided to stay and propose. This team by the way has stated involvement with onboarding or helping to onboard a couple of companies like Seedstars, Goodwall and Digifarm. \n--------------------------------------------------\nKey areas to figure out once a Proposal is awarded, according to this proposal is how to manage funds, make connections to the community, figure out administration around Catalyst and learn how to use Cardano technology.  Their 6 point key metric solution includes: 1. Develop a playbook for funded operations, 2. QA written, 3. Office hours for funded, 4. Intro docs about Cardano technology for business use, 5. Helping to make connections to relevent people in Cardano, and 6. Collaboration with the Treasury Guild for accounting specific processes.\n----------------------------------------------------\nBased on this very specific Proposal for a systematic playbook in helping to onboard new Proposal teams, this teams (Razil Samusudin; Nori Nishigaya; Yoram Ben-Zvi and Jo Allumin & colab with the Treasury Guild) past successes and their Impact statement my assessment is a 5 ( I strongly agree this proposal effectively addresses the challenge) star proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This team has depth and experience both long term previous to Catalyst that is/was relevant and Full time Catalyst experience. They have listed and provided links to DoXX (which I did and was impressed by the qualifications) and see what they have been up to.\n-------------------------------------------------\nTheir Risk Management is realistic and seemingly on-point with Mitigation strategies. One humerous but extremely relevant RM thinking was the proposal statement of \"...challenging to streamline the onboarding with Traditional/Rigid organizations\". Their mitigation thoughts rated a GREAT ANSWER from me.  Additional feasibility notes for my assessment included explorations of their attachments, timetable (found to be realistic) and ultimately my assessment is that this Playbook can be a solution for onboarding funded teams into Cardano and Catalyst.\n--------------------------------------------------\nThe budget is well laid out and clear.  The only issue I had in my assessment of this proposal was some lack of clarity and detail in the budget notes. The budget is detailed to the hourly pay, number of hours, etc in the very first budget section, which I think should be defacto for all proposals and certainly set my expectations for the following three sections. However, the detail level was absent for these sections. One example is in the following section it lists: PLAYBOOK AND Q& A - $2,500. The explanation notes are generic \"Collecting information... & preparing the documents...\" While the dollar budgets are relatively modest and appear appropriate the detail provided in the first section would be better.\n--------------------------------------------------------\nBased on all the information directly in the proposal, extraneous information, links and team strength my Assessment of this proposal is a 4(I Agree this proposal is likely to be successfully implemented) star. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The metrics provided in the first section of the Proposal were found to be straightforward , understandable and would have (in my opinion) been fine for accountability and for success measurement and audit purposes. However, the proposal team elevated the transparency and measurable milestones by further slicing the deliverables. Instead of \"Office Hours\" in the Solution Phase, the proposal injects the metric of \"120 hours of..\", which is a very specific and measurable goal.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThe milestones are even added to in more measurable items, e.g. How many funded companies are using our solutions/services - we expect....  And, how many downloads of guidebooks... - with another metric. Perhaps the most step out of the box metric (but we believe in what were doing optimism)is their \"expectation\" metric of \"We expect by Q1 2023 at least 5 new companies to develop solutions using the Cardano technology and not only offering their services\". That is confidence in my assessment and provides a long term metric to audit. \n----------------------------------------------------------\nMy Assessment for the clarity and the auditability is that this is a 5(strongly agree that this proposal has milestones with KPIs and identifiable measurements of success) star Proposal.

The team working on this is well experienced with this very thing. They have already been in the process of investigating what kind of resources exist and discovered a hole. Large professional organizations desire to see evidence of progress and history of work from Cardano/Catalyst. There is no professional looking repository of success, instead we have a large pool of decentralized hubs and resources, including discord, telegram, google sheets, github, gitbooks, etc. What is needed is a singular professional process that is clear, streamlined, and targeted at stakeholders of larger organizations.

These docs need to layout a clear process for joining the Catalyst system in a visual and compelling way. The team here has a plan to accomplish their goals. The idea involves meeting with these companies to help set up accounting, and prepare for fund 10. They will also prepare a step by step guide, that includes the process of onboarding and setting up wallets. There will be recording, researching and more.

Clear guidelines are helpful for onboarding companies, projects, organizations to Catalyst and Cardano. Since the proposer has experience in onboarding these communities (provided with the name of projects they have successfully onboarded and the potential ones), it is valid that they develop a guidebook for onboarded companies on the next key steps, which are listed. Figuring out the know-how of how Catalyst works is a great way to facilitate progress and the effectiveness of a proposal. The solution to this stems from the frequently asked questions from other funded companies, so developing a playbook is a systematic way to tackle this problem. This play doesn\u2019t stop at answering questions but will expand to making connections with ecosystems and community members as well as devising accounting and reporting processes. The proposer is able to highlight the impact of this playbook for the newly funded companies (how supporting these emerging companies will boost engagement). The clear operation of Cardano and Catalyst provided by the playbook is also a good way to encourage new companies to onboard. The proposer makes a good point of how funded companies will have a need to apply Cardano technology to conduct their proposal and a playbook will enhance this process and allow them to utilize Cardano technology to the fullest. High utilization rate of Cardano technology is highly positive for the growth of the Cardano community and paves the way for innovation. However, the proposal could specify in what form the playbook will be distributed (ebook, physical copies, \u2026) or if it will be free of charge or come at a certain price. Little information is given on this so the proposer should elaborate more. The proposer is able to point out the main risks, being communication with many stakeholders and the fluidity of Catalyst\u2019s operation, which can provoke reluctance for traditional organizations such as universities who require clear authentication.

A budget breakdown is provided with a clear explanation for each expense where parts of the budget will be allocated to, which is good for feasibility and transparency.

Treasury Guild is also presented with details of its operation and how the wallet will be managed. The proposer will return for later funds as the project grows to contribute value to the community.
