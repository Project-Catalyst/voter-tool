Let\u2019s start with the problem statement, where the proposers inform us that generally, Catalyst proposers are finding it challenging to manage effectively their budgets and keeping track of their transactions. The solution proposed is a treasury service that manages budgets, documents and wallets on their behalf, as well as project management support. \n\nIf this proposal is funded, the team will provide their service for free to three proposers for a period of eight months. \n\nThis is a well thought out proposal that fits extremely well with the challenge. It is one hundred percent tailor made for Catalyst proposers, it emerged naturally from the team\u2019s past activities and significant involvement in the community and it functions as a validation of the business model. The plan has moderate scalability potential since after the eight months period there will definitely be items that can / will be automated, but only up to a certain point. Usually in treasuries around the world the volume of work / transactions dictates to a rather high extent the human resources necessary to perform the function, and most likely this will be the case here if the service gains traction and extends well beyond the initial three customers. \n\nI only see positive aspects of this proposal and it well and truly deserves five stars for potential impact. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The treasury guild team is composed of Catalyst veterans. Stephen, Andre, Felix and Miro and well known and appreciated figures in our community. Stephen is the cofounder of quality assurance DAO, Felix is the cofounder of Catalyst Swarm, while Miroslav and Andre joined the Catalyst Circle team in 2021. They all have extensive biographies presented within the proposal, as well as social media profiles, and they are very well known within the community. \n\nTheir plan is rather simple, to start offering the service from September, for free, to three Catalyst proposers, for a period of eight months. Of course, the service will include kick-off meetings, wrap-up meetings and monthly services rendered to all three customers. Dividing the total budget, we would have a monthly cost of 2k USD/proposer/month, so it\u2019s fairly easy to summarize its core value proposition. A bonus comes from the fact that the team acknowledges the risk that during these eight months, one of the teams might not need their services. In this case, the money will be redistributed and they will try to offer the same service to a different proposer. \n\nI think the proposal would have been excellent if it had answered the following questions: \n\n- do they perceive the cost/month as sustainable after the Catalyst funding is gone, and will they be able to charge a similar amount to the proposers moving forward?\n- in case of high demand, what criteria will be used to select the lucky three proposers? Which ones will be prioritized?\n- their service will also offer the possibility of handling proposers\u2019 wallets, which will require teams to share recovery data with the team. What mechanisms will be set up to make sure that there will be limited operational risks for data loss / theft / etc?\n\nConsidering the excellent team behind the project and the no-nonsense approach to offering this service, but also being mindful of the above mentioned questions, I rate this project\u2019s feasibility as four stars. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team offers some very basic indicators to track the project, but I think they could have done better. Instead of focusing on quantitative data alone (number of meetings, number of projects, etc.) I think a very useful indicator for success would have been a feedback questionnaire for each proposer that could have answered the following: \n\n- a general level of satisfaction with the service received for free\n- an indication of how much the proposer would be willing to pay for in the future for a similar service, if at all\n- suggestions for improvement, if any\n\nGiven the very basic level of performance indicators offered, I rate this proposal\u2019s auditability at four stars.

This proposal has identified a key problem that truly requires to be solved. We have encountered projects that are unable to implement their ideas successfully even after getting funded due to lack of project management guide like what this proposal seeks to offer. This proposal if funded would be really impactful to the community, most especially the proposers who lack the project management skill. This proposal clearly align with the campaign brief and scales to address the future problem of resources being mismanaged to no corresponding productivity due to lack of project management skills. I strongly agree that this project is impactful.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I have enough information that is clearly justified from the proposal to believe that the identified problem in the proposal can be solved  by the solution as articulated by the team. The team members behind this proposal is great and we've seen them do great works for the community already. I personally have no doubt about the implementing team as I have witnessed them spear-head the growth of Cardano since Fund 3. All links provided for verification of team experience is accurate and leads to the right source of information.\nThe budget sits well and broken down perfectly to suit deliverables of the project. I have no doubts about it.\nWe are provided with a clear roadmap with milestones that would help the community to define clearly what success looks like for the project. In addition, the community has been given enough information to help us know what to expect from this project at the end of every month.\nThe identified risks are indeed true and I like what the mitigation plans are. Very effective and accurate to ensure success.

The team is proposing to manage budget and document transactions for the proposals funded by the Catalyst and will also provide Project Management support to ease proposal delivery. There is no doubt that the projects funded by the Catalyst need this kind of support especially if the team is new and never had previous experience of managing large amount of funds. Also having such support will help them achieve the 3rd criteria of the Catalyst funding requirement which is the Auditability.\nThe solution team is proposing is to select 3 projects from the list of successful proposals in Fund 9 and provide them these services for the period of 8 months. They would provide hand holding support to these projects from the beginning till the project is completed and help them meet the Auditability criteria of the Catalyst. I have no doubt that this perfectly aligns with the objectives of the Challenge catagory.\nBut the problem I see with this proposal is that it looks like a fragmented kind of solution to the large problem at hand. Catalyst funds hundreds of proposals in every Fund and providing a solution which helps only a fraction of those proposals is never an ideal solution. Also it would be like a traditional consultancy kind of support where the successful proposals hire a professional team to help them manage the project and achieve its goals efficiently.\n\nIn my point of view, this kind of solution is not going to help catalyst much. What we need here is a technological solution like a decentralized application to be developed which is permissionless and which any team can use to manage their proposal from start to end. This kind of solution can help all the projects which are in need of such management services without relying on a small team which can only help a handful of projects. This will also be easy to monitor as given the transparent nature of decentralized technology, all the progress and funds spents can be seen by the community on chain.\n\nI like to add here is that although the proposal is addressing the objectives of the challenge, the solution will have very small effects as compared to the number of proposals requiring such support and is not a long term solution. Providing a technology backed solution which can help large number of proposals and for long term is the solution to this probelm.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team consists of 4 people which have the combined experience of more then 70 years in the various fields related to technology and consultancy and possess the required skills to provide the kind of support needed by the funded proposals. \nBut I have many concerns related to the feasibility of the project. 1st of all the team will be able to help only 3 projects which, given the number of Proposals which are successful and need such kind of support, is very small. Also the issue here is that they will start looking for the projects to work with only after the list of successful proposals for Fund 9 is out. This can delay the start of this proposal as they might not be able to get proposals on board very quickly. Moreover they are proposing to provide the support to these projects for 8 months. If they are able to find a project which only runs for, say 2-3 months, after the completion of that project they will again have to go and find more projects in order to fulfill that objective of 8 month support. This will most likely delay the complettion of this proposal itself.\nOn the budget front, the team is asking for $48000 funds. Now to be honest, I don't have any experience in the field so I might not know the fund requirement of such kind of services. But looking at the breakup of funds provided, the team is asking for $3000 per proposal (total $9000 for 3 proposal) just to setup the meeting and $2000 per project for agreement meeting. This amount looks very high to me. If they require $48000 funds to help just 3 funds, we would need more then total budget to this challenge to provide just financial services to just half of the successful proposals. \nAgain, there will be many proposals which are completed in less then 8 months and many which will require way more time so finding ideal projects will be a difficult task to achieve. This will make the implementation of this proposal very difficult.\nI would again reiterate that we will need a technological solution to achieve the objectives of this challenge instead of 1-1 support to be able to help all successful proposals.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "On the Auditability front, not much of the information is provided. They have provided the parameters like number of projects onboarded and no of projects completed with their support to measure the success of their proposal, which being just 3 in numbers, won't be much of a help. They have also not provided the details about different ways in which they will provide regular updates to the community. There are also many factors which will make the implementation of the proposals hard. They will have to look for the projects which need such support which might delay the start of this proposal. Theyln if some projects are completed before 8 months, they will again have to look for more projects but as many projects will be in advanced stage of completion, they might not be able to find more projects. This will delay the complettion of this proposal and make it hard to monitor and audit the progress. Also we need to consider that one of the objective of the each challenge in Catalyst is to have solutions which are scalable overtime. I think the proposal in the current form will not be able to scale to fullfill the needs of the funds. \n\nIn conclusion, I would say that the proposal is trying to solve the problem in a traditional way which might not be optimum given the scale of the Catalyst funding and number of proposals funded by it. We need to crrate technological solutions to address these challenges which are able to scale with the growing needs. \nI wish them all the best.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2312", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Assessor repeats the same points in all three sections instead of assessing each section on its own.

Furthermore, their 3-project pilot to be undertaken starting October and December 2022 will ensure they are able to work out the kinks during the proposed implementation timeline, so as to have a finished Treasury Guild Advisory service by the end of the project in September 2023, which can be made extensive to the rest of the community, seeing as they have stated that if their other work starts generating enough income for Treasury Guild to become sustainable, they won`t even have to submit this proposal in future funds.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As essentially a pilot project with 3 cases to be supervised throughout the proposed timeline, the onboarding and completion of all three projects in the proposed dates will be a clear way of evaluating the success of the proposal.
