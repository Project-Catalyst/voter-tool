Let\u2019s dive into it. \n\nWe have to start from the problem statement brought forward by the proposer - that the world will experience a growing demand for accounting services in the next 5-7 years, and that there is a global lack of supply for such services due to a diminishing number of new accountants. While this is a useful statement to begin with, it would have been beneficial for the prosper to quote the source of these estimations, since usually trusted niche market reports are hidden behind expensive paywalls and it is not very easy to verify the information or at least the assumptions behind it. \n\n\nThe value proposition here is thus to upskill and introduce blockchain literacy to a significant number of accountants and lawyers from Zimbabwe through organizing a dozen 4-to-6 week courses and engaging up to 900 participants, new graduates as well as practitioners. Of course, such a training program can only be launched after the trainers are already knowledgeable of current industry standards, legislative frameworks and also delivery mechanisms that can efficiently get the message across. \n\nI think it\u2019s worth mentioning two forces acting as catalysts for this proposal. First, Africa is definitely the number one target for Cardano in terms of development and deployment of resources.  A most important example of this is the activity of IOG, since, as a reminder, one of Charles\u2019 mission is to bank the currently unbanked. A second catalyst is the fact that the project can tap right into Zimbabwe\u2019s high unemployment rate and ensure high attendance rates for their courses. Of course, this last point does not ensure its success, but it is nevertheless a necessary precondition for a solid project.\n\nHowever, I also see two possible headwinds for the project. First, it is worth mentioning that usually training courses have a \u201csink-in\u201d period following the course being finalized, during which participants usually digest the information received, and slowly build the internal mechanisms that allow them to put into practice the newly acquired competency. This process is of course longer in the case of new technologies like distributed ledgers, which for many people, accountants included, is very challenging to wrap their heads around it. A second point connecting to this is the geographical distribution of proposers, which, if not being in full alignment with the target of the course, increases the risks of obtaining sub-optimal long term effects. And at least currently, this might be perhaps the care in the target geographical area of this proposal, but this would have to be of course validated by hard data which currently is not really available. \n\nConsidering that the forces identified above influence in both directions the proposal\u2019s potential impact, and also considering the only indirect effects on future Catalyst proposers, I think four stars are appropriate for this project\u2019s impact rating. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The roadmap of the project would be rather quick to roll out, and the proposers pledge to start the courses as early as September this year. In phase 1 a market research would be performed, and course developers would be onboarded. The second phase would bring to life the necessary recordings (since online delivery is of course one of the approaches chosen) and the necessary software would be purchased. Eight weeks from the start, the first courses would be organized, but this would be preceded by a marketing campaign to popularize the courses. \n\nThe budget section is fairly granular and very well built, clearly a sign that the proposers have put a lot of effort into coming up with a viable proposal. There are however two areas which, given their importance in the overall budget, should have been better described. First, the bulk of the money goes towards course development, which, if I understand correctly, will be shared between three companies, Trellis Training, Dope Crypto and Dash Stone Advisory. An excellent budget would have perhaps made the distinction between these three partners in terms of revenue share. Second, there is a rather significant budget caption set aside for ERP software purchasing, and it would have been very useful if the proposal contained a bit more details as to which solution exactly would be purchased, or even if such a decision had already been made.\n\nThe proposal also contains sufficient information with regards to the team behind. We are indeed offered four profiles, with sufficient information as to ascertain each member\u2019s background and areas of expertise. And they are indeed fit for purpose. They all have Zimbabwean background and very diverse profiles, which is of course a strong point. It would have been excellent if the proposal included links to their media profiles (Linkedin for example). They do exist, I\u2019ve checked them, but it\u2019s always a sign of goodwill to be fully transparent with the team backing up a project. And as a personal note, an up to date profile photo works wonders in terms of immediately increasing the project\u2019s legitimacy. Sadly this is not the case here.  \n\nConsidering all of the above, I deem four stars to be appropriate. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "You will not find many proposals that offer this level of detail about what the proposers consider to be  a successful project. Right from the start the team offers targets which are feasible, yet challenging, and if reached, would signify that the total cost of training one accountant or lawyer to a high standard in blockchain technology to be under 1k USD, which is a fairly good result in my opinion. So, the team sets out to train up 120 course participants in general industry standards and slightly less, under 100, in smart contracts capabilities. \n\nAnother interesting side story of the proposal is that they mention rolling out an internship programme, but we are unfortunately not offered any details about any partners for this. They also state as one of their success indicators the fact that most of the trainees should be paid market based wages following the course completion. We are however not being shown the actual way in which this will be implemented. Will they have access to country relevant statistics, have they thought about a long term follow-up plan to keep track of their trainees\u2019 jobs and current salaries?   \n\nAs a last point, the proposers also mention being able to sustain themselves financially after a one year period. While in itself this is indeed an excellent target, I would have liked to see a proper plan in place in order to reach financial independence so quickly. We are sadly not offered any indication that this topic was carefully analyzed: there is no indication of what kind of pricing would be involved, and what would be the addressable market, which of course is different from the similar market when the courses are offered for free. Do the practitioners have the means to pay for such courses, and is the market practice conducive to such practice in the target areas? \n\nIn conclusion, we have a good basis for ensuring auditability, but the proposal should have included much more details regarding the long term plans of the project, especially the financial sustainability and the internship program. For all these reasons, four stars I deem as sufficient.

I would suggest in order to mitigate the risk, to avoid real time lessons of course, and record the lessons to make them available on a later date. \nI disagree on the forecast of the unemployment rate reduction. Enrolling 900 students is not likely to decrease the unemployment rate of 80%, but at top 8% within the PA population.\nThe budget requested (around 80000 usd) is likely to bring the team to the project completion. \nI see the timeing being a bit too optimistics.

In this Zimbabwe country and the SADC region, I believe that the level of prejudice is very high due to the lack of education of the population, so it is essential that this type, of course, is created and changes this reality.

The proposer also delivers what is necessary for us to know with solidity how the development process of this project will take place. At first, they objectively inform us what will be done in the first 2 months (phase 1) and then until 7 months (phase 2). In addition, they also provide further explanation, inform us about the milestones they are aiming to achieve, and also how each front of the project will work to achieve their goals. Therefore, I consider that we are very situated in the project development process, as we know exactly what will happen so that every little thing is achieved, and what necessary activities are coming. Talking about the budget, I disagree that the amount is well justified, asking for 79,183 dollars, which the total amount would be divided should be better explained. For example, in the business outreach part, why do you need three thousand dollars for this? In the onboarding and admin part, they would add up to 4 thousand dollars, even though we know the total number of weeks, we have no idea of exactly how much time they would dedicate to the project, working part-time or full-time\u2026 By doing that, we could calculate the hourly value of their work and see if it would be a fair value or not.

Their areas of expertise are explained, however, it is not clear when they did not mention how they relate to Cardano.

However, in addition to these goals, I would like to know, for example, how we could follow the pre-production work of the course? We know that this will last for 9 months, and we know which tasks must be performed in two phases. With this, it is enough for one of the team\u2019s participants to carry out this monthly inspection and gather general information on how everyone would be working, etc. In this way, we would know not only if the goals were achieved, but also if the tasks necessary for this were performed most adequately. And I think we would need to do both a quantitative and qualitative analysis, it would be interesting for teachers in the universities, to give feedback to the company directors which the proponents said that they need to be on the ground.

", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team delivered quite a good auditability of this project. We have 7 KIPs provided as a guides to understand whether the team is going on the right way or not. Most of them are quantified which makes it easy not just for the investors to keep track but also for the team to know exactly what to do. The success picture seems very clear and achievable for me. The team set specfic KIPs and timeline for each points. I believe that with the team's experiences and ambition, they would definately be able to carry out this project.

Professional accountants and attorneys are always among the positions that need a great deal of experience, care, and the capacity to work under pressure, thus fewer and fewer individuals are interested in this sector. As a result, the project is being upskilled and supplied with blockchain knowledge with the goal of assisting not only students but all individuals with shared interests in Zimbabwe and the SADC area. To ensure that the students who complete the course get a job, the entire team will assist students in writing their CVs and even invite them to stay at the Trellis BPO system. In particular, to ensure the support and approval of the government, the project will also reduce the price for any officer who want to participate. Instead of just limiting the age and occupation of customers like many projects, this project is open to everyone, and of course Cardano will benefit from it. I also love that the project tries to combine with many organizations not only to support its cause but also as a way to promote to many people about the diversity of the ecosystem. In addition, I also appreciate how the proposer intends to solve future difficulties or challenges. For example, the participants who do not have basic knowledge of computers, instead of being excluded from the list, the project will provide a separate course to help them consolidate their knowledge as well as create opportunities for more people in having access to blockchain. Overall, I have absolutely nothing to criticize what the author presents here. Well done!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "According to the proposer, the project will be conducted in a phrase of about 22 weeks with details of each part being mentioned. In addition, it can be seen that the author has a lot of expectations for this project when he is ready to start the next course if the project is successful. And I believe that just by following this plan, the author will achieve what is expected from this project. For the project's budget plan, instead of just listing the items to spend as usual, the proposer divides the capital into two parts. We have the main activities that will take place in each phase, plus some information such as a breakdown to demonstrate to investors how their money is being used. And to do so well, the project must have a very talented staff. They all have experience and skills directly related to the project. One is the CEO & CFO of Dash Stone Advisory LLC and Dope Crypto, the other is the Director of Trellis Enterprise Holdings LTD. It can be seen that they all have very high positions in a corporation, so I believe they have the confidence and skills to make this project as successful as possible.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Author provides specific numbers when it comes to the number of professional lawyers and accountants, a plus point for the team as few projects do this. In addition, besides successfully supporting those who want to develop themselves, the author also mentioned the benefits that the Cardano ecosystem will receive if accepted for this project. Everything is very well prepared, but it would be better, if in the development part of the project, we get the timelines after each part is completed. This is very necessary because only then will investors be able to closely monitor the development progress of the project. In addition, I also have a question that, if it has been successful in the Zimbabwe and the SADC region, does the author intend to expand the market to other regions.
