The same applies to the budget, as it is detailed per job, per month with some additional one-time purchases for the server and a big bulk of $12000 for the fee and other legal procedures.

As the proponent says this activity is legal under the laws of Venezuela which would be very beneficial for the development of the Cardano ecosystem here, however, the proponent should add Sunacrip's connection to the regulator of the country. state or documents to understand Sunacrip's right to operate. Currently, in most countries, the cryptocurrency is unrecognized and only a few countries recognize it, so this is a big barrier to the development of projects on the Cardano ecosystem.

The problem statement talks about an entity in Venezuela that regulates crypto activity and that it is necessary to have a license to promote the massive adoption of Cardano. Right off the bat this is extremely vague. You do not need a license to promote Cardano (on Twitter or in person), you need it in case you are a legal entity maybe, but there is no mention of something like this in the proposal. The solution to this problem according to the proposer is to \u201cmanage our registration and licensing in the regulatory body, in order to build a platform that allows us to promote, train and freely inform about the adoption and use of Cardano\u201d. I find this already problematic, because it actually shifts the focus of the project from the legal aspect to the fact that the intent is to build a website. That means that the actualit challenge for this proposal would have been DApps, Products and Integrations, not Legal & Financial Implementations. The proper way to go about this was to have had a proposal dedicated to building a product and then a different proposal to request funds to help with the bureaucracy of allowing the product to function. But setting this issue aside, the proposer has not made it at all clear what the legal issue is here. If the plan is to make a platform that provides information and training regarding crypto, that is not something that needs to be regulated. You enter that domain when you start selling coins or perform similar services.\nAs a risk, the proposer only mentioned the bureaucracy in the country, which again, at the start of a project like he is proposing, should not actually have any impact.\nI find this proposal to be misdirected and much too broad in its intent, while at the same time being extremely vague with what it wants to achieve. I will expand on this in the feasibility section. Score: 1.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "One of the listed items in the proposer\u2019s solution is: \u201cDictate workshops in institutes and public entities on the Cardano network.\u201d. So this proposal, with the sum of 24000 USD, wants to do the following: solve the licensing issues at Sunacrip, design and develop a platform \u201cto promote adoption of Cardano\u201d, host workshops \u201cin institutes and public entities\u201d and also \u201cdevelop Dapps for use cases on the Cardano blockchain\u201d. This is all not only all over the place, but also vague and no details have been provided how any of these will be achieved. The proposer wants to do all these things in 2 months, according to the very brief timeline that was provided. To exemplify how underwhelming the planning here is, I will quote the following item: \u201cWebsite construction one (1) month.\u201d. No details on what the website will consist of specifically, no details about what technologies would be used to build it, nothing. I have 8 years of experience delivering software and first of all, you are not building a training platform in 1 month with 4 people. Second of all, you need an extremely strong and detailed plan of approach on what technologies will be used, who will perform what roles and so on. The team is said to be composed of 5 people with various competencies, but we do not have LinkedIn profiles for any of them, just emails. There is no way to verify their credentials. The budget breakdown is incoherent. The proposer lists the salaries for several positions per month, amounting to 6000 USD / per month (for a total of 12000 for the 2 months of the project), then 6000 USD for acquisition of technical equipment and finally, another 12000 USD for \u201cCost of registration, licensing and other legal procedures\u201d as an upfront cost, which they claim is a fee charged directly by Sunacrip\u201d. They have provided no proof that Sunacrip actually asks for this exact fee, which I find hard to believe. Leaving that aside, if you add up all the items in the budget, they actually amount to 30000 USD and the proposal asks for 24000.\nAll of these mistakes and lack of information lead me to believe that it is not likely for this proposal to be implemented successfully if it were funded. Score: 1.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The auditability section is also suffering from a lack of information. We do not have a roadmap or milestones to help us follow the progress of the project and no KPI\u2019s have been provided either. The metrics to measure progress that the proposer provided are just vague words: \u201cRegistration, licensing, web page design, activity in social networks, methodological document to legalize and operate cardano in Venezuela.\u201d. Likewise, the measure of success says that once licensed, the proposer and their team (\u201cwill be a support point for the Cardano community in Venezuela to operate freely and thus promote its adoption and usability\u201d). This does not even make sense, as if this license were actually obtained, it would be linked to a legal entity this team creates (such as a company). It would have no impact on other people who want to develop on Cardano.\nTo conclude, I do not believe that the information provided here is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal at all.
