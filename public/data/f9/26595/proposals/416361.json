It's about creating a Dapp for cyclists to interact, earn rewards and sell CNFTs that basically involve cycling activity. This is sure to bring a new audience to Cardano, because apps for tracking pedaling and physical performance have been around for years, so this new approach could be attractive to users, mainly because of the rewards involved. More detailing the idea: it is about creating an application inspired by those that already exist in the fitness universe, but that are saturated, have very limited tools; As proponents point out, the design is geared towards self-service, meaning that people don't interact with other athletes or people outside that small ecosystem (eg, Nike's fitness apps, which are very performance-centric). So the idea would be to create a platform that would serve \u201ccyclists to share, win, celebrate and connect with cyclists locally and globally. Provide new incentives to drive and inspire cycling in the community.\u201d This would be done through various tools, such as: systems that could extract more value from physical exercises through rewards: athlete A has certain goals and athlete B too, they bet on who would achieve their goals, and the winner would keep the rewards, while the other would have to make a transfer (it's not so clear if it would be in Ada, NFT or even local currencies). Another interesting feature is that athletes would be introduced to the universe of \u201cdigital goods, digital identity and the power of tokenized incentives\u201d. Bicycle-based CNFTs would be set up, as I understand it, and these could be displayed, traded and sold. Like a kind of marketplace. Athletes would also store their data in decentralized identities, and could interact with each other, creating a collaborative community centered on a common subject - cycling - but powered by cryptographic technologies. I think this idea is super interesting because it wouldn't be creating a technology from scratch, but taking something to web3 that is already well established on web2. In this way, new users would certainly be attracted to ours, and the specific objectives of the challenge would be addressed, as 1) new digital wallets would be created - for athletes to receive their rewards and place their bets; 2) new CNFTs created, minted and traded on the Cardano blockchain; 3) certainly a new audience would be added to our community.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In terms of script, I thought the proposal could be better detailed. Little information is given about each part, for example: \u201cJuly 1st: *Pre-sale NFT*s. August 1st: Alpha App store release for NFT holders. Onboarding NFT Holders: All NFT holders can link their wallets to verify ownership and begin riding. Syncing Apple Health and Fitness: Users will be able to allow access to their health data to verify rides from a variety of sources, from Zwift to Strava\u201d. As you can see, what is said are the results that we expect to achieve based on a certain time of year. For example, as I understand it, as of August 1, the aim would be to create the \u201cAlpha App Store version for NFT holders\u201d; integrate these holders; link them in digital wallets so that they had an identity that could be used for pedaling; apple health would be synced; etc. That is, we would have several products to be conquered in that time interval (between August 1st and September 12th), but in my view the script would be more in-depth if we knew not only what it would have to be done, but how it would be done. What would the process of developing each of these metrics look like? How could we audit the work of the professionals involved, understand what their daily life would be like with the development of the project? From the way the information is passed on, we can understand what would be done, but we don't have such a solid understanding of what would need to be done to get there, I think that maybe it's not the best way to have the information we need to understand to understand the all solidly. Moving on to the next topic of analysis, which would be the budget, a total of $84,000 is asked for project costs. The value is high, but it is explained in a very detailed way. It is divided into a few parts, each of which is specifically detailed. For example, $30,000 is set aside for marketing; and what would be included in this part would be \u201c- social media advertising + content creation + narrative + PR campaigns + promotional content from influencers (Tik Tok, Instagram, Youtube, Twitter, Medium) + specialized press articles (bike press , crypto press, tech press, business press)1\u201d. Like this part, the other expenses of the project are quite justified, for example, we know that the legal part would include NFTs and market laws, private data, etc. So the monetary explanation is very well argued, the value seems to have been thought out to the smallest detail and a lot of sense of necessity is conveyed. Finally, talking about the team, there is a lot of confidence in the members involved due to the degree of detail that is said about each one; we know their names, roles in the project and a brief r\u00e9sum\u00e9 about them. We know that Romain Pomarelle is already involved with Cardano, which in itself already conveys a lot of confidence. In general, the proposal is very viable, deserving only a few improvements in the script.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Finally, when we analyze the auditability of the project, unfortunately the topic is not as suitable as the previous ones. We know that progress would be measured by some metrics, but they are basically quantitative: number of app downloads and daily active users; in addition to the number of kilometers/miles traveled by active users and also the trend of the NFT price in the secondary markets (I didn't understand this last point very well, it would be interesting if it was better explained). In my view, these data help us to have an idea of \u200b\u200bwhether what was being planned was being adequately accomplished and as expected, if partial results are being observed in practice. However, such parameters are not useful for us to understand if the script was being followed, if the work schedules were being followed, how all the work behind such final results would be being done, whether in the construction of Dapp (programming and design part), in the advertising campaign, in the organization of legal aspects, etc. In my view, it would be necessary for all this data to be gathered, studied and summarized in monthly reports, which should be made known to the Cardano community, either through social networks (such as discord, telegram, twitter and etc - they will work with social networks , then it would be interesting to choose one to be the communication channel with the public); or even through after Townhalls. Success is summed up by building a huge daily user base and accelerating people adoption of web 3.0 (especially Cardano) + a high quality NFT project, we also aim to see increasing value from our NFTs in secondary markets + become a global digital \u201clayer 1\u201d on health tracking and cycling tracking apps.\u201d What happens here is quite common, it is said that it would be success, but not how it could be verified, perceived and proven. It would be necessary for the team members to do a final study, gathering the pertinent information to understand if this Dapp was really able to bring users from web2 to web3; increase the number of active Cardano members, new digital wallets, more CNFTs circulating and etc; how it impacted both the fitness market and the growth of our blockchain. We would need more information to understand whether the challenge-specific KPIs (\u201cIncreasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases, Increase the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products\u201d etc) would be contemplated. Finally, I think that the auditability could be, as a whole, better reviewed and built, so that we have a deeper understanding of how to monitor these projects, in several ways.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 373, "q0": "W3:RIDE are proposing an application that helps to bring together cyclists and pool data across multiple platforms to give a new experience of riding to mint NFTs as a reward for cycling. The proposal looks to use unique art and collectibles which currently includes bicycles and rider NFTs to bring together the cycling community around a common interest and also help to foster the growth of community clubs. A key thing that is not covered in any depth in this proposal is around the data of the rides. Currently cyclists give their data to these centralised providers and finding a way for cyclists to own this data themselves would be a key factor towards making it easy for them to use whichever platforms gave them the most value with their existing data. In the risks this is not mentioned at all that existing platforms have the benefit of adoption and a small form of lock in due to historic data. Another risk that could have been covered is that is vital is the economics of the ride to mint, is this sustainable in perpetuity? If anything valuable can be extracted out of doing a ride as proof of work then this system is susceptible to being gamed - how do you truly verify that the ride that is being recorded is real and not spoofed? Currently people have little incentive to fake rides in existing platforms however if someone else tries to add economic value to this process the incentive increases and then this suggested mechanic could easily fall apart. Overall there is potential for this application with improvements that could make a more dynamic marketplace for cyclists and connected community, for this proposal more detail and specifics are needed to provide a higher level of confidence that what is being suggested will be sustainable over in terms of tokenomics and proof of work incentives over the longer term. The proof of work part should ideally have better coverage of how it could be gamed or spoofed by the community for their own benefit.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In terms of feasibility the team break it down into accurately dated releases roughly ever month. They've already begun the NFT release. The app release will allow riders to verify ownership of their NFTs, access their health data from the different platforms and then display their bikes, unlock rewards and start levelling up tiers by completing challenges. Afterwards they will start to introduce the community club experience, custom bike part NFTs and utility for purchasing with the $ride token. The budget is broken down into marketing, website development, app design, legal compliance and brand guidelines. The team list includes five people detailed with others on their website team section. The team has a mixture of experience in design, business, tech and development. No professional profiles are provided on the proposal or in the website making it more difficult to verify the backgrounds of those involved. The team has already show some signs of execution with the launch of NFT since submitting this proposal. Overall it looks feasible this proposal could be executed, in future proposals it would be advised to provide as much information as possible regarding technical evidence and professional background to remove any doubt for assessors of the feasibility of the proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "For tracking the progress of this proposal the team mention app downloads, daily users, NFT price trends, and kilometres cycled by users. It would have been good for the team to be explicit on how they intend to do updates to the community to share progress so the community can easily audit each phase of the proposal. Another useful area would be if anything is open source to provide a Github repository so development can be tracked. In terms of success they state they want to build a massive daily user base, an increasing value to their NFTs on the secondary market and to become a global layer 1 for health and cycling tracking. In terms of success I believe this could be improved by adding more specifics to this proposal itself. The success metrics are more long term vision for this project, the community is not expecting the team to reach this at the end of this proposals execution. However what the community would like to know is what specific measurable objectives are realistic and achievable in the short term after this proposal is executed? How were those numbers derived? Without considerations on this it is harder to have confidence that the team have thought about what the key factors are for early adoption with a strategy to measure and track those factors. Overall more specific auditability metrics are needed to increase confidence in knowing whether this proposal will produce positive outcomes.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2073", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 7, "ng": 7, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2408, "q0": "We can say that this proposal fits perfectly into the metrics established by the challenge, as we have the implementation of Cardano technologies in a market with great scope and potential to create new utilities and profitability related to blockchain. So, if successful, this project will be having a positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem, as well as introducing blockchain to people who might not know about it if not through cycling. Even with all these positive characteristics, we have that the budget being requested is quite high, but another encouraging factor is that the project already has a certain degree of construction, which makes the budget being requested $84,000 justifiable.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In line with the above, we can say that given the large budget requested, it would be expected that the action plan would be well defined. And in this regard, we found a good organization of the planned activities, we were also able to notice that they evolve gradually. As a positive point of this stage, we can mention that a reduced version will be released beforehand for the validation of concepts. As for the professionals who make up the team, we can point out that their experiences are related not only to development, but also to very important areas for the project, such as design and creative direction. About the details of the budget, we can say that the distributions of capital are consistent with what was developed, and in this context, it makes sense that the greater allocation of capital is aimed at marketing.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Regarding the ways chosen to follow the progress of the project, we see that in general good parameters were chosen that really demonstrate the adoption of the project as well as the engagement around it, but in a complementary way, it would be interesting if some way to measure citations about the project on social networks. Regarding the perception of project success, we see a correct description of what should be the result of a successful execution of the project, but it would be interesting if numerical goals were also defined to be achieved that would help us to define in the future whether the project was successful or not.

Riding unlock NFTs and riders can collect unique bike part designed by artists. Riders are also motivated by wagering tokens ($Power). By extending the capabilities of existing fitness apps and empower them with web3 ability, this proposal addresses the challenge by creating impactful dapp that will increase Cardano adoption.

The majority of budget $30,000 is spent on marketing. Although I agree with their marketing strategy, I think the amount spent on marketing is quite big and should have a breakdown by each medium they use. The pay rate should accompany the website redesign, the App design, legal & compliance, brand guideline. The team should have included their linkedin profile along with their responsibilities for the project. The team has background in cycling, tech, finance and software & web 3.

The solution belongs to the move-to-earn category, biking in particular that meets the challenge settings (i.e., build new NFT marketplace and tokenize physical products/bikes). The proposer articulates the benefit to the Cardano ecosystem, comprising a unique art and collaboration platform on Cardano (i.e., the NFT marketplace). It also meets Fund9's startegic goal (i.e., prepare a group of people/the cyclists who are able to make contributions to the ecosystem - by minting and exchanging NFTs). The proposer is requesting funds for their branding and marketing effort only, as the product suite (including white paper and tokenomics, first version of the website) has been developed. This is a special point of this proposal that there is a shorter time to realize its impact versus other proposals where product development has not been started.

The team provides a timeline of 3 months to launch multiple product initiatives (e.g., NFT pre-sale, in-app bike store). However, the proposer misses providing the timeline for the marketing campaign they are asking for funding for. For example, I would expect to see a planned timeline for their social media advertising, website redesign, app design, and brand guidelines. It would also be helpful to estimate the man-hours required for each task. Moreover, it is not clear from the proposal if the project has already had the infrastructure to launch their collaboration platform on Cardano; if not, how they plan to build one.

However, the value adds for the Cardano community is not clearly verifiable from the proposal. As this is not a Cardano-native dApp, I would suggest the proposer be more explicit and comprehensive regarding the impact on Cardano. Two thoughts I have for consideration are (1) to add metrics that measure the impact on Cardano (e.g., new Cardano wallet from the W3 community, NFT transaction volume on Cardano), and (2) to establish communication channels such as participating in the Project Catalyst Townhall to update the Cardano community on the project's progress.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2558", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9322, "q0": "Your team's suggestion is consistent with the reported issue.
