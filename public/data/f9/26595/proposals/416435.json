The idea is to produce a series of animated videos that teach the general public, in a fun and educational way, as defined by the proponents, about the Cardano ecosystem. The problem raised here is that there is already a lot of \u201cjunk\u201d content on these subjects, and higher quality content is needed. With this statement, it would be very interesting for proponents to argue what would be the difference between the contents they were going to create compared to those that already exist: why would they be so superior? What strategies would be adopted to ensure that the target audience understands the content being passed on, why would these videos be more accessible than the others, which are already available on youtube? They would be created in five 2-minute videos, so we would need to know exactly what would be covered in each video. The proponents suggest some themes, namely: what is a Catalyst? + how does the Catalyst Swarm Fund work? (what would that be? I evaluate Catalyst proposals from the bottom 5 but I'm not sure about this concept\u2026); + easy quick guides for PAs or VPAs + fund guidelines (how could they talk about the challenges, as I understand it, since they change over the funds? Maybe they would comment on the fixed challenges, like for example dApps and developers?). It is also said that the videos would be dubbed into 6 languages, but not informed which ones, it would be necessary for us to also know this information so that we could better understand the different audiences targeted here. In my view, the smartest thing is that the videos are made available in the languages \u200b\u200bmost spoken by the Cardano community. It is also said in the part of the budget explanation that there would be subtitles in another 5 languages, so in total the videos would be available in 10 languages, from what I understand. It would be very important for us to know what they would be and why they were selected. Although we are not so clear about the topics covered in each video, we have a good range of examples of what the group has produced so far, available from the website where they have attached it, so there is a lot of confidence in the statement that \u201cuse of characters animations enhances a site's ability to inform above the usual domains of text and images [\u2026] We've been making animated explainer films for years and we have a well-defined process for developing the design and script for each animated video\u201d. Although I think the idea is very good, I would like to make two suggestions that would raise the level of impact: the first would be to define exactly what topics would be covered in each video. What we have here are some options, but it would be more appropriate if we were given concrete information. I also think the team could focus more on Cardano than Catalyst, covering some basic topics like what is blokchain, what are cryptocurrencies, how to create a digital wallet, how to withdraw Ada and turn it into your local currency, etc. The other suggestion would be to put more emphasis on the issue of dissemination, as the proponents suggest that community members themselves present the videos at meetings, events, etc. in addition to posting on youtube and vimeo.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Talking about the script, we can understand how the project development process would be through a link that is provided, where there is a graphic that divides the creation of each video into parts: script, storyboard, transcriptions, locution, layout, animation and edition. Some of these tasks would be done by the team and others by the defined artists and animators (eg artist 1, animator 1 and so on). We also know what the schedule is for these activities to start and end (for example the script of video 1 would start on September 12th and end on September 15th, by what is planned). This table is very good when it comes to understanding what the divisions of tasks would be for each video to be created, giving us a good understanding of the audiovisual issue of the proposal. However, some information is not included, for example: who would be the professional who would do each activity (it would be better if this was already defined); we also don't know about topics that do not involve audiovisual creation, such as the definition of the topics covered in each video; we also don't have information about the disclosure process, both to the Cardano community and to outsiders, which I believe is our main target audience. However, this is the topic that is best established in terms of feasibility, as the degree of specificity in the next ones has unfortunately declined. When it comes to funding, for example, we have a basic explanation of how the $19,000 would be used. However each part could have been explained better: what would the layout be, exactly, and why would it cost $2500? Regarding the voices, how would the professionals who would work here be hired, what would be the price of their working hours? It's asking $6000 for that, and it's 6 languages, so $1000 per language, the video would be 2 minutes, so $1000 is charged for 2 minutes of dubbing? In my view, this value is a little high, not very compatible with the payments requested in the other proposals. The same question is raised for subtitling: would it be 1000 dollars for 2 minutes of subtitling in each language? They provide a table, but it contains the same information as the proposal breakdown. And finally, speaking of the team, unfortunately we don't have information about the members involved, we know that the team is experienced in producing animated videos (we see several videos on the attached website, as I mentioned in impact), but we are not sure how they will go. transmit the blockchain information as we do not know who the Cardano consultant would be. It would be necessary for him to be properly presented, his name, how he works in the community, projects he has been involved in previously and etc - so that his experience with our blockchain would be clearer. In reality, the ideal would be for all members to have information attached, CVs that would allow us to better understand their professional backgrounds. Although we have some basic information, the proposal still needs several improvements on the feasibility part.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The way proponents suggest that we do auditability of progress is valid, but in my view it doesn't cover all the information we should audit. Through the link provided, we were able to understand what activity would have to be done, when to start and when to end, but we could not have any more qualitative understanding of the process, that is, how would these activities be being developed? It would be necessary for us to know more exact information about the daily work of the professionals involved, whether they would be in addition to carrying out the activities on time, if this was being done in the right way too. It would be very positive if we had access to the partial results as well, for example, the script, the voiceovers, the first drafts of the animations... In short, if in addition to knowing what would be done and when, we could have access to how these things were being done and which small successes were being obtained. So, in my opinion, for the auditability of this part of the proposal to be truly adequate, a combo should be made available to the Cardano community: in addition to the available link, the team should have meetings at the end of each month (we know that the project would develop in September to November), and from these meetings reports could be prepared that would include more information on how the month's activities were performed and some finished products could also be included. These reports must be sent to our community, either through discord, telegram or any other means of communication chosen by the team. Talking about the success scenario, finally, this is well defined through several concepts, in addition to the creation of the videos, an increase in the \"conversion rate is expected to increase the number of people who understand and start new projects\", the videos must be easy to distribute, reaching the maximum number of views possible and also the content created must be easily understood by all consumers. Okay, we know what success looks like, but how can we verify that all these expectations were achieved? In my opinion, it would be necessary for the team to do a very detailed study on how people would be absorbing the videos, if where they were distributed a higher rate of adhesion of Cardano technologies was observed, if more people would be participating in Catalyst projects , or they would have become proposal evaluators\u2026 If more people would have been buying and delegating Ada, using dApps\u2026 In short, if the challenges of the challenge would have been achieved. For these reasons, I think that 1) the auditability of the process is not very complete, as suggested by the proponents, as it lacks a more qualitative analysis of the phases; 2) it is necessary that the information gathered about the final success be proven, and that this information comes to the knowledge of the members in our community. So some changes are needed on this topic as well.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3450, "q0": "The idea of having short videos in different languages to explain Cardano topics is really good and can certainly help to attract more people to the ecosystem. Regarding challenge fit, although this is not a Dapp, it can fit in the definition of \"product\" and aligns well with metric of \"Increased quality of existing products & integrations through suggested improvements that is supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community.\". \nRegarding the proposal itself, the proposer explains well the value proposition, considers the variety of languages to expand Cardano outreach and presents already some topics that will be in the videos. As suggestions, an advertising/communication strategy to make the video reach new people could be added to better assess how they'll impact the potential ecosystem. It could mention, for examples, what countries will be targeted, what type of audience, etc. The 6 different languages could also be mentioned to better understand this.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There's a very nice gantt chart provided in the link showing the project schedule.

However, none of them have any targets, which makes it hard to evaluate success.
