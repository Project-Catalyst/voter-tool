The developers behind RootsWallet have \u2013 in my view \u2013 correctly determined that despite the advantages and technology and security, all these apps also need to feel good and be \u201csexy\u201d in order for ordinary users to really start to use them. Hence the team wants to work on the user experience (UX) side of things so that the users can see less of the complex Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) technical concepts, jargon and technology and smoothening the learning curve for users of the RootsWallet \u2013 who just want to manage their decentralized identity. This is a valuable proposal in my view as most of the complexity of blockchain-enabled technology really needs to be hidden behind a friendly user interface \u2013 as new users are not developers and need not be enthusiasts. They are primarily users who should spend as little time as possible navigating through complexity. This proposal is for improving an app and integrating it further into the already complex Cardano ecosystem. It fully addresses the objective of this Challenge and is well aligned with the Fund 9 goals of Catalyst/Cardano.  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team that is putting forward this proposal is the RootsWallet team that has been breaking new ground in Cardano\u2019s Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) space \u2013 through practical implementation. The team has already proven its capability to deliver complex solutions. However, this time around the team is requesting to improve the UX of RootsWallet \u2013 however the budget is modest. The team does state it wishes to consult expert UX designers from IOG for this purpose, what I question is wouldn\u2019t it be better to have a larger budget and then also pay an expert UX designer who would consult with the IOG team. The user experience aspect can be a make-or-break aspect of the end solution and \u2013 if I may be frank \u2013 the RootsId website (https://www.rootsid.com/) also reveals a need for more care about the User Experience (UX). Hence, with a low budget of $ 7800 and no dedicated UX person for working on the UX of RootsWallet \u2013 we might end up with a UX that will improve but \u2013 as the team acknowledged in the risks section \u2013 \u201cwill it be enough for new users to feel comfortable with their identity wallet?\u201d Unfortunately, it seems the risk has not been fully addressed in my view \u2013 the team states its confidence that it will \u201cWe believe that it will\u201d \u2013 but maybe a somewhat larger budget and one more team member would guarantee it. As regards the implementation plan and the budget breakdown, they are very good \u2013 and correspond to the scope of the project. I would also like to commend the team for their detailed explanations and excellent presentation. If the proposal is not approved this fund, I would advise the team to resubmit, possibly increase the budget and engage an additional team member with maybe a more extensive and ambitious plan to improve the UX to become a trailblazer in bringing SSI to the Cardano masses. A budget breakdown for the 13 weeks of work has been provided with clear explanation of how it will be utilized. The timeframe for completion is snappy, but realistic.

The team states that all work for this effort will be planned and tracked as issues on Github, while monthly (kudos for committing to a certain cadence of updates to the community) updates will be given on the RootsWallet github wiki. Although the team has opted to rely on some UX know-how, advice and support from IOG team members, it would be good \u2013 if the proposal is not accepted this fund, to resubmit and maybe engage a UX expert & team member who would be able to help implement the UX proposal with ideas of his own as well.
