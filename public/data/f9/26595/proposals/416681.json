This proposal has the potential to have a huge positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem as a whole by allowing any dApp and projects to read the data of each Handle and use it to deliver a personnalized the experience - every handle user could benefit from organisations to simple users. The data is owned by the handle owner and can point to a smart contract. From there, possibilities are infinite. The proposal clearly articulates how it will add value to the handles, how it will scale. The solution is designed to be flexible and future-proof.\n\nThis update will bring value to the project, and allow it to compete on the crypto scene with the more known competitors by delivering a unique and very well thought-off set of features. This proposal addresses the challenge effectively, thus I'll rate this proposal a 5/5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team at Ada Handle has given a good and clear account of what experience/skill sets will be necessary to deliver on the proposal, as well as a complete description of who the team members are (PapaGoose, Conrad, Goose and BigIrishLion), including their roles and some past work.\n\nThe budget is outlined clearly and is broken down into identifiable items (hardware, dev time, project management, marketing and other ressources) and the amount requested seems reasonable to achieve the set goals. I would argue the marketing budget could be increased as adoption for this project is key to its success, and the marketing budget only accounts for 5% of the total budget - especially as the main risk identified is the adoption curve for the Personalization Standard. \n\nThe roadmap is otherwise very detailled and clear, broken down in 4 stages that make sense - from private testnet to public launch. They provided the details of the tasks, the order of execution, the timetable for completing the project is realistic and the resources necessary are listed. The Ada Handle team has indicated some the risks they identified with the solution they want to build and has given some indication of how they will mitigate them (how to combat users adding profane or obscene images, look-alike phishing attacks). Given the experience and plan presented by Ada Handle team, it is very likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team has provided a clear and detailled roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement. The metrics that define success are presented and make sense - but some targets would have been useful. How many expected users/dapps/projects will use the personalization feature, how many handles will be personnalised after 1 month/6months, what proportion of handles do they expect will be personnalised.\n\nThe team has explained how they will track the progress of the development of their project - using an internal ERP software, daily meetups, monthly and weekly reports and an external third-party audit. The information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal, and this is why I give auditability a 4 out of 5 rating.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2040", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 4, "ng": 9, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 376, "q0": "ADA Handle present a proposal to introduce handle personalisation to the handle standard. As part of that personalisation holders of a handle would be able to prove ownership of the NFT to a smart contract that then can be updated to include personalisation data such as a profile image, social media info or other data values. DApps and services could then read, parse and use this data to give a custom experience to the user based on that data. One idea that the team shares is that one idea that could be applied to this standard is the encryption of data to be used by another party by giving them a key to decrypt the information. The example provided was it could be information about how to use the transaction data for tax purposes yet the handle personalisation would never have personally identifiable information attached to the standard. A notable and important risk that is identified is the importance of adoption amongst the applications that integrate the handle standard. Without use cases adoption could be slower so having use cases that applications want to integrate are important to get a sufficient amount of users utilising these new capabilities. The proposal is very well thought out and highlights a number of ways the personalisation data could be used and all the implications of who would be involved in the usage of this improvement to the handle standard.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team have broken down the roadmap for this proposal into four phases. They focus on the different development stages and environments they will use to get from idea through to main net deployment. The phases are well explained and articulate on what is involved.

The hourly rate is fair considering the location and salary average in the US and time scale also seems achievable. In regards to the team break down details are provided on each individual and their background. Some more evidence of their backgrounds would have been good to see such as LinkedIn profiles just to more effectively verify who is involved. The team has a strong track record of delivering a widely used standard in the community. When combined with the well articulated plan and team members involved it appears highly likely that this proposal is feasible.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team outlines a number of ways in which the progress of the proposal will be tracked. Many of these are internal to the team but the ones more relevant to the community are the weekly project reports, monthly status reports and the external audit on the software created. The audit will be vital for ensuring peoples handles and funds are safe when using these smart contracts - having public audits will help in providing confidence to the community that the outcome of the proposal has been delivered and professionally verified. The team also details a list of success outcomes they want to achieve with the personalisation standard. It would have been good to see more specific outcomes in usage they may track, however they have already articulated a number of use cases in the proposal that could see adoption. There is a public Github repository that showcases work that is open source for the community - https://github.com/koralabs.

The challenge, for developers, is to reduce or eliminate that obstacle by creating an easy and intuitive user experience. \n\nAda Handle has already demonstrated its utility by simplifying transacting on Cardano through the adoption of human readable addresses and the introduction of rudimentary blockchain personas in the form of personal monikers or \u201chandles\u201d. Enhanced customization and further development of these handles is a straightforward step along the path from select usage to mass adoption. \n\nProviding a more immersive and personalized Cardano experience, from recognizable addresses to customized exchange and website interfaces to unique gaming personas and seamless sidechain interoperability\u2014the possibilities are virtually endless\u2014greater customization encourages greater usage and participation both from those familiar with blockchain technology and others less so.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The solution to store a user profile within a smart contract associated with a given handle and allow respective applications to reference the profile and implement applicable user preferences, is well explained and feasible.\n\nHaving already established itself as a premier product designed by an expert team with decades of collective experience, there is little doubt regarding the implementation of the proposal.

Furthermore, success would be evident in obtaining a pass and high-assurance score on the external security audit and delivering an uneventful launch on MainNet allowing for smooth utilization of the Personalization portal, with the ultimate goal of setting the Personalization Standard on the Cardano blockchain. For future iterations, it would be interesting to perhaps include numerical aspirations if user base projected to utilize the personalization standard within the existing Handle owners, as well as alternative specific engagement metrics (percentage of payments made within Cardano using the Handle Standard, amount of developers working on improving the Standard, among others).", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2636", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7184, "q0": "The proposal is attempting to solve an underlying problem between the AdaHandle Standard and it's Personalization options for their holders, in order to express one's unique assets such as NFTs owned or simply allow other members of the community to easily identify one another by connecting these to social media profiles revered by the community i.e. Twitter. The solution to the problem would be solved by enabling each Handle with an associated Smart Contract which will contain datasets of pointer records, that can be personalized to be used through Cardano Dapps, wallets and gaming platforms to express one's individuality. The AdaHandle Standard has a massive community that's adopted over 120,000 NFT handles. This still growing sub community within Cardano have been wanting the option to define themselves beyond characters, such as displaying an NFT, or maybe a new project launching on Cardano, the opportunity to brand one's handle would be like a personal billboard of advertisement or just a simple fun way to interact with others. This could have a huge impact on the Cardano ecosystem by allowing for more engagement among members and bring more worth to future investors on the blockchain. The risks with any form of self advertising can invite bad actors to exploit personalization by imitation or the use of profane or obscene imagery.

The team has been working with countless partners within the Cardano community and integrating on chain technology to build an easy payment option for users to feel more confident in using, rather than copy and pasting traditionally long and complicated wallet addresses. This has created a massive need not only for the individual but for companies looking to take advantage of what Cardano and it's vast ecosystem has to offer. The proposal does also have a sister proposal which would help in the aid to creating an additional solution to this problem, offering sub-Handles to groups in need of multiple addresses for use cases within their business or branding strategy. Link to that proposal here: (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/416678).

Your proposal is well written, concise, and contains every piece of information that I look for in a proposal to feel comfortable voting it 5 stars across the board. Expanding on the already revolutionary idea of ADA handle into fully customizing profiles associated with your handle will be a huge step to preventing phishing and fraud. I couldn't think of a better project more deserving, especially since you had secured funding through your original NFT sales and the only reason you are lacking funds is a result of the market drawdown.

Social media engagement is a very important part of getting the word out and most projects completely overlook this aspect. Your team took a lot of time and effort getting all the facts and stats put together into a proposal that is straight to the point, but full of information to go off of. I love the way that every section is broken down into subsections to help answer any questions that I would normally have for a project like this. Ada handle is a project that all other projects should take notes from as far as the way to build a platform. This proposal expands on an idea that is already perfectly executed, and I am excited to see what will come from continued funding. Your team is doing all they can to secure funding on their own. Even though the market dropping has an impact on the funds your company needs to continue to operate, I know that you only come to catalyst as a way to help offset the market crash.

The community is kept informed every step of the way, and to me that is something very important when funding is asked for here at Catalyst. I believe the money will be well managed simply by the way the proposal is broken down and compartmentalized. Projects like Ada handle are the projects that will take Cardano completely mainstream and help mass adoption, along with preventing scams and other vectors of attack at the community's weakest point, which is the user themselves. I normally try to put in a note or two of ways to improve the proposal, but I literally cannot think of anything that would make this more detailed or more to the point of what you are trying to accomplish.
