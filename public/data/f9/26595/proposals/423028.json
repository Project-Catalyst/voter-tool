I confess that when I read the proposal, I initially did not agree that this would be a good idea because in my view it is always delicate to deal with vulnerable populations; it is necessary to guarantee the integrity, respect and benefits that the homeless population deserves to have. It is also difficult to draw a possible bridge between Cardano and people who do not have any means of accessing the technology (eg, do not have a cell phone or a computer). But as I continued reading and understanding how the program would work, I came to believe that yes, it is a good idea, since: 1) at the beginning the program would be focused, in addition to producing entertainment, on providing information about blockchain for both the public and for the participants of It is very positive that the homeless population would benefit greatly at the end of the program, as we can see in the excerpt \u201cone team will win, but both homeless people will win the prize of six months of paid housing , mental health services, job placement help and a mentoring program\u201d. It is said that the program would present information about Cardano and blockchain to both challengers and audience. The idea is good; But how could homeless people, who have problems as serious as hunger and lack of shelter on cold days, for example, become interested in blockchain? How to awaken their interests, in what way can this be part of their realities? I believe it is necessary to clarify how Cardano could make a real practical difference in their lives. In my view, it is not enough for us to make this audience understand what blockchain and Cardano are, but how these technologies can make a difference to their everyday lives. Other than that, it is not explained which subjects within the cryptographic universe would be addressed (I believe they would be very introductory topics such as what is blockchain, what is a cryptocurrency, what is the Cardano ecosystem, what is Ada, how to create a digital wallet etc., but it would be appropriate that such topics were clarified). Apart from that, we also don't know how the topics would be approached, through which methodologies the subjects would be passed, how to make them as simple and accessible as possible. Already in \"If the show's audience grows in size, we may have big names in the crypto community as guests on the show, as well as people outside of crypto.\" Who would these big names in the cryptographic community be, and what role would they play in the show? Would they be advisors, mentors? In the excerpt \u201c2 teams compete against each other in challenges that are a cross between incredible race, survivor and minute to win. The first half of the episode will take place in downtown Chicago, where they will fight to complete challenges for points. The second half of the episode will take place in a warehouse set up with demanding physical and mental challenges.\u201d It would be beneficial if we had more detail about the challenges themselves, what the race would be, the survival test, etc. about these steps, so that we could better understand what we are talking about). What would the physical and mental challenges look like, and how can we ensure that especially mental challenges are achievable for underserved populations? In the sense of being within knowledge that they, in a way, have already come into contact, or would they be challenges of the logic type? Would blockchain knowledge be covered here? In \u201cWe hope to generate a lot of buzz for the cause, the show and the Cardano and blockchain community. If it takes off, we'll raise the stakes and introduce elements of a higher concept in each successive episode\u201d: the proponent would need to better explain the publicity campaign, to have more certainty that the expected impact would be generated. Some excerpts cause me some concern here, the proponents claim that they will introduce Cardano for example, teaching participants to interact on social media, create digital wallets and etc. I also didn't feel very firm in the snippets \u201cbut maybe we can have some kind of business incubator inside Cardano where we can send the contestants to and they'll be guided remotely\u2026 We'll try to use Cardano technology wherever possible on the show\u2026\u201d. What would these incubators look like? How would Cardano's technology be used in the program? Therefore, I thought the idea was good, but some aspects could be better clarified.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal's script is average, I say that because we are only superficially informed about what would be done. The proponents state what the durations of each phase would be, let's say, but in my view it would be more appropriate for them to place us in relation to which day of which month the actions would be scheduled to start and to end, so that we would not have a way to understand only how long the actions would last but also at times of the year they would happen; for example, the visual and audio style could start to be defined on September 1st until October 1st (something like that). Speaking of the descriptions of the activities themselves, as I mentioned, they are explained in a very shallow way, it would be necessary for more details about each of them to be provided. I will cite examples to illustrate this: \u201cIn 1 month we will lock the visual and audio style of the show. We will provide updates on social media to spread the word about the project throughout each stage.\u201d How would the visual style be defined, who would work on it and using what parameters? What social media would updates be posted on, and how often? In the next stage, it is said that \u201cwe will have the materials acquired and the cast and crew hired. More blitz on social media.\u201d How would the team members be chosen, would there be a kind of interview, criteria to be considered? In \u201cWe will block locations and set filming dates\u201d, again, what would be the criteria and selection of filming locations and recording dates? I also think it would be positive if we had a better idea of \u200b\u200bwhat the film sets themselves would be like, how the scenes would be shot, how the groups would be conducted and so on; What would be the observation party they mention here? As you can see, the script part is not bad, but it still leaves room for many doubts. In terms of financing, US$ 29,500 is requested as an investment. The value is divided through a table, it is possible to understand well how it would be divided and which parts would make up the whole, but I think that some parts could have been better explained, as they also generate spaces of doubt. What would be the legal costs that would represent $250 of the budget? How many hours would the camera people work per day to get paid $250 a day, what would the hourly rate be? How can we already define the cost of transport (300 dollars) if there is still no definition of filming locations? Why would some team members stay in hotels and others in airbnbs, wouldn't it be fairer for everyone to have the same level of comfort? A very high amount is requested for the construction materials of the challenges - 2260 dollars. What materials would these be and why would they cost that price? So, like the script, the budget part is ok but it would still need more detail to make it better understood. About the team, I thought it essential that a person who guaranteed the interests and rights of the homeless participate: \u201cJon (defender of the homeless): Ensure that the interests of the homeless are better served and make the connection between the said community and the show production. As I said at the beginning of the impact, it is delicate to deal with marginalized populations correctly, so his participation conveys a certain tranquility, in that sense. The other team members are presented ok, we usually have a superficial detail about their careers (except Jo\u00e3o, who presents himself in a more extensive way). Two important things are missing here - both linkedin profiles and especially someone who has experience with Cardano, some expert consultant in our technologies, some active member of the community who also works on projects, for example develop smart contracts, knows how to program in plutus and etc. How can we be sure Cardano's technologies will be well supported? For these reasons, the proposal is viable in an average way, improvements would be necessary.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Unfortunately, the ways proponents suggest for us to audit processes are only about partial results, not the processes themselves. How could we monitor roadmap activities? The first thing that should improve is the level of detail of the actions, we need more information about what would happen in each phase, so that we would have better conditions to verify that everything was being done as planned, in the correct way, at the agreed time, by the people assigned to each task, and so on. I also think it would be beneficial if that issue of dates were attached, if we knew exactly when each activity would have to start and end. During the explanation of the script, the proponents state that each phase would have its updates provided to the community through social networks. What would those social networks be, how often would these posts be made, how will our community learn about new posts as updates come out? Speaking then about the partial results, they are defined as \u201cif we manage to get the competitors off the streets and, after the end of the contract, they are able to maintain a job and stable housing on their own + community and public response to the episode. We want the community energized and excited about Cardano and its possibilities to change the lives of those who suffer the most.\u201d In fact, this seems to me to be a definition of success, it would be interesting if we had smaller goals such as: first day of filming carried out successfully, crew hired on time and with the expected number of members, etc. Speaking then about the final results, the definitions given by the proponents are quite broad, talking about the greater visibility of the participants and the homeless community and also when the spectators have a \u201cgreater connection, understanding and awareness about the homeless community and the challenges they face and overcome. And what about Cardano's processing? It would be necessary for proponents to carry out more focused research on: who would have really understood about the blockchain and would be making use of the technologies in their daily lives, who would have become an active member of the community; and also in what way: what would these people who came to add be doing within the ecosystem, would the specific objectives of the challenge have been achieved? There is a lack of a more focused understanding of the benefits that Cardano would have from this initiative, and also of having more clarity on how such aspects would reach the members of our community. The topic is average, it needs more depth and better clarification in several situations.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 4, "ng": 1, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Impact / Alignment\n\nas per the campaign brief\n\"Any other idea, product or integration that someone thinks should be built in the Cardano ecosystem!\"\n\n\nIt calls me Jo\u00e3o?

The proposers made it clear how the project should be run. The Solution part of the project has been described in great detail by the proposers and often has in-depth technical explanations.
