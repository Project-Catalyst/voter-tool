Simply put, it is a product that aims to bring transparency to mission-driven SPOs and their delegators. The purpose is stated clearly, and the proposed solution addresses this problem. \n\nThis type of integration or improvement for people invested in mission-driven SPOs might seem non-impactful at first, but I believe (personal opinion) that this integration has the potential of attracting more users than most would think. For example: Let\u2019s say person A invests in a charity organization, wouldn\u2019t that person want to (1) ensure that the investment goes directly to the intended purpose, and (2) want to know if there are other organizations that could provide better support? That is where the relevancy and strengths lie within this proposal, in that brutal transparency. It will also benefit both delegators and SPOs, targeting different \u2018roles\u2019 in the Cardano ecosystem. As the proposer states in the proposal, it will also \u2018incentivize the creation of quality projects and provide tangible ways to measure their performance\u2019. \u2028Considering that many mission-driven SPOs are focused on improving the environment, I agree with the proposers statement that it addresses the challenge by increasing awareness, and potentially incentivising people into changing from environmentally damaging habits. \n\nI love the plan of using an outside framework for measuring impact (by using the GIIN-network, linked in the proposal), by looking at things from another perspective it will increase the credibility of the framework and might also inspire new ideas. Another potential risk is mentioned under the same section in the proposal, what if SPOs are interpreting the framework as competition, and refrains from using it? A change to a more constructive and positive mindset will definitely be needed, and I would\u2019ve liked to see a paragraph in the proposal on how the proposer aims to explain to SPOs what the benefits will be for them personally, without just seeing competition and challenge between them. \u2028\u2028There is definitely a long term plan to keep developing the proposal, and on the Cardano Blockchain. In my experience as a researcher, it is also see KPIs that not only measure the success of the product, but also the method used. In my 4 rounds as a PA, I think I\u2019ve only seen it included once (which speaks very well for the competency and commitment of the proposer.) Overall, I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal includes a clear roadmap (divided in 4 stages) with milestones included on a timeframe of roughly 5 months. As a researcher, seeing analysis being dedicated time and effort in each phase, with a steady progression towards the final product speaks well for the expertise and commitment of the team. The methodology is also given a lot of time during development, which probably will minimise the potential risks or hinders that are found during the development phase. \n\u2028The budget breakdown is VERY well put together, and doesn\u2019t leave much room for guesses. We are presented with what responsibility profiles are needed, the forecast hourly rates of these along with presentation of the estimated work hours for each responsibility. They even include a paragraph on which responsibilities that will be under heavier pressure during what phases, which is exemplary. The team is transparent with them having two other proposals for Fund 9, and reassures us that the potential risk of work-overload (if all of them are funded) have been considered into the calculations. The total budget asked for is also relatively small in comparison to other projects. \u2028\u2028The team is presented with responsibility areas, expertise and experience. All of them have LinkedIn-profiles linked, so we are able to verify all of the information listed. The team definitively has the competency and experience to complete this project. A nice addition to the team presentation is that they choose to include tiny bits that tell us that they really are idealistically motivated in trying to create a better world. The proposal also includes the official website of the proposing team (Impactscope). \u2028To top it off, they have started discussions on potential collaborations with two very well-known groups within the Cardano ecosystem (Cardano4Climate and Carbon Neutral Cardano), which fits very well into the core values that seems to drive the team forward. It will be interesting to see what collaborations that may come out of this. \u2028\u2028I don\u2019t want to sound biased in my rationale, but I have no suggestions for further improvements of this proposal. I strongly agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As stated under \u2018feasibility\u2019, the roadmap has very clear milestones, and the time horizon is as well. The proposing team seems to have experience in research given its methodical process (will share a public document for each proposed steps that will follow metrics that focus on both method and development progress). \u2028They will investigate the dashboards ability to cover at least 50% of the SPOs, which is ambitious but not impossible. It depends on whether or not they are talking about mission-driven SPOs (probable) or not. \u2028It is a good choice to measure not only how many SPOs that will use the dashboard, but also how many of the delegators who also check the dashboard (as the proposer intends). \u2028The measurements of success is once again hinting at the larger picture of the project. They intend to encourage more mission-driven SPOs that will impact more and more people in the world, through Cardano. It is potentially difficult and a bit intangible to measure this type of impact on a larger scale, which might be something to think on for future proposals: How will we measure what impact our framework or products will have on the world? \u2028If I would make a suggestion, I would just include some links on where the community could follow the development progress (I\u2019m assuming it will be the official website or their official twitter channel) and communicate directly with the proposing team.\nIt would also be nice to see if the proposer aims to include the community in providing feedback and if so, to what extent (and where). \u2028\u2028Conclusively, due to the reasons listed above: I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2504", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 4, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 391, "q0": "The team outline a plan to create a dashboard for SPOs that showcases the impact of each operator so that delegators can make informed decisions of where to stake their ADA. The team outline the methodology they intend to try and follow from the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) that has three main elements of intentionality, additionality and impact measurement. The proposal does not outline the way in which they will measure impact and have added this as part of the research phase for the proposal. This makes it much more difficult to understand and provide feedback on the potential impact of these impact factors and how they could apply to the impact focussed SPOs in the ecosystem. Another piece of information that would have been useful to try and determine whether this would be impactful is how many impact SPOs would be relevant for this application today? This would give some indication towards the realities of potential adoption and the amount of complexity faced by stakers to make decisions on which SPO provides the most impact.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team provides an existing business they have been involved with called impact scope (https://impactscope.com/). A number of phases is provided breaking down how the proposal will be executed. A break down of the budget and hourly rate is provided and they have also mentioned existing climate initiatives that they have reached out to in the community. The background of the team is provided with professional provides, the team members have a mixture of experience in finance and software development. The budget is very reasonable for the proposals intention. The difficulty with this proposal is without any mention of the types of metrics that the proposal intends to track (as this is part of the research phase) it is hard to know with any confidence whether they will be able to feasibly extract this data at the implementation stage once these are defined. This gives the proposal a lot of unknowns. Overall if the team can find some suitable metrics that are sufficient effective and realistically attainable then this proposal could be feasible given the plan and team details provided.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In regards to tracking project progress the team outline the intention to document the different stages of the proposal delivery. This includes the first stage of the impact measures that need to be defined. This will be an important thing to document and showcase to the community as it will help to reveal some of the issues faced in trying to measure impact by defining what could be measured and any difficulties in tracking and extracting that data. The team also outline how they would intend to track the usage of the dashboard by SPOs. Success for this project is helping to identify the impact based SPOs in the ecosystem and start to help with creating benchmarks in which to compare and improve the impact being delivered. Given the evidence of previous execution with impactscope, the github source provided and the plan outlined it appears that this proposal should be auditable for the community and the intentions of the proposal have sufficient clarity.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2073", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 3, "ng": 11, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2020, "q0": "The idea of the proposal is to create a website that has a control panel so that potential SPO delegates related to social and environmental impacts can see the ROI and other comparative metrics. \n\nThe problem observed is that the delegator who wants to associate his ADA with some SPO that has an environmental and/or social impact cannot make a comparison of its ROI, that is, what is the efficiency of that staking made for a given SPO. \n\nThis proposal aligns with the challenge in two different ways: a) directly: creating a new staking possibility, adding \u201cfeatures\u201d to the blockchain; and b) indirectly: the more efficient the investments (the delegate will have the ability to choose the most efficient SPO, and the SPO will have the ability to verify their own efficiency and create strategies to increase it), the more visibility Cardano will have for society in general. Due to the increasing global concern about climate change, any institution that has sound and efficient investments in this area will bring attention to itself (and it may bring new people to contribute and use the blockchain). \n\nThe objectives and metrics are correlated with the success and construction of the proposal phases. Therefore, on the objective side, they explore the ability to deliver the four phases of the project, generating something concrete for each of them. In terms of metrics, the proposal presents two subdivisions: methodological and impact. All these aspects are correlated with the challenge and aim to fulfill the ADA's mission. \n\nIt should be mentioned that the project aims to create the PoC. Therefore, the scalability of the project will be related to future development. However, once it is tested and approved, it will be an essential tool for everyone who wants to make a difference by allocating their ADA in SPO with this social and/or environmental bias. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In order to verify its feasibility, we need to verify the following aspects:\n1 \u2013 roadmap: The roadmap is well written and has its activities well defined and limited in time, which is good. There are some suggestions that can be considered as points of improvement for the elaboration of this part. I believe that, especially in phase 3, which is the development of the platform itself, it would be very important to explain the plan to achieve this result (what was stated is the expected result and not the steps and tools that will be used to achieve this result. this particular objective). Therefore, although the team has specialized people to develop this part and already has money allocated for this purpose, it would be important to break each task down into smaller tasks, emphasizing what would be needed to complete them and the expected time. \n\n2 \u2013 budget: The budget shown is well explained. However, it only has an allocation for hours worked, which leaves me in doubt about the need for any software or material needed to perform this task. Also, as a suggestion, I think a resource for a marketing specialist could be added, since the success of the platform is correlated with the awareness of the idea in the community.\n\n\n3 \u2013 team: The team gathers all the necessary skills to carry out the tasks described by this project. However, as mentioned before, I believe that adding a member who has knowledge in marketing would be interesting to increase the project's growth rate. \n\n4 \u2013 risk management: The risks seem to be mapped out. However, what worries me is the engagement of the SPOs which, as mentioned, may not see this project with good eyes, since they would have to expose their flaws and risk losing staking. Once again, as a suggestion for improvement and mitigation of this risk, it would be interesting to add someone to the team who knows not only marketing, but marketing associated with sustainability, to create and unify the course and positive points of this proposal (which are diverse, especially the opportunity of the SPO to create strategies to improve). \n\n5 \u2013 self-funding/scalability:The project has everything to be scalable after the PoC.

The proposers aim to create an SPO impact dashboard that can show people the social and environmental impact of mission-driven pools using the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN). These mission-driven pools use staked funds to do things like environmental conservation/restoration and education. From the dedicated web portal, users will be able to see the impacts generated by these stake pools. This proposal provides a unique solution to a problem on the Cardano blockchain \u2013 people who want to delegate their stake don\u2019t have a way to measure whether their staked ADA will actually make an impact through these mission-driven pools. The proposal addresses the environmental part of the challenge setting by measuring the amount of awareness being produced and the number of people changing an environmentally damaging habit. Generating more interest in the mission-driven pools will increase the number of delegators, which will, in theory, provide more funding to the SPOs to follow through with their missions. This project is a great integration that will provide much utility to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThe proposers addressed the concern that SPOs may be hesitant to adopt the dashboard since they may see it as a way to generate competition. However, it is more beneficial for the SPOs to participate because they can generate more awareness for their causes. The proposers also addressed future sustainability (more on this in feasibility rationale).\n\nOverall, I do not have any critiques for impact, so I can give it a score of 5. (score given: 5)\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Based on the information provided in the proposal, I believe that it will be successfully implemented. The proposers listed out a very thorough roadmap that lasts 5 months, and it was very clear what tasks would be completed at what time in the plan. The first two months involve research and engagement with SPOs as well as impact dashboard structuring. Key points from this section are analysis to determine the \u201cminimal common denominators of impact for SPOs focussing on impact staking,\u201d \u201cdiscussion with SPOs to determine reusable impact measures,\u201d research for the GIIN framework and how it applies to impact stake pools, and coming up with a strategy to engage impact stakers. The requirements for the dashboard will also be determined during this phase. In the next three months, impact dashboard deployment and launch, monitor, and lessons learned will be the focus areas. Developing the methodologies to pull data from the SPOs will definitely be one of the more challenging parts of this section, but I think the proposers were smart to give themselves 3 months. Overall, all of the tasks in the proposal seem very reasonable to complete in the given amount of time, so I do not have any critiques about that part of feasibility.\n\nFor the budget ($12,975 total), there was a very good breakdown of the costs associated with this proposal. There will be two main people involved: the project manager/sustainability analyst (65 USD/hr) and developer (85 USD/hr). The entire budget breakdown was based on those two pay rates and the overall costs were forecasted by multiplying estimated work hours with the pay rates. I think the pay rates seem reasonable for the positions, and the overall budget makes sense given the scope of the project \u2013 it is not incredibly large and does not involve too many people, so the budget seems fine from my perspective.\n\nThe proposers themselves are already part of a team, so they have a general sense of project execution. Michele Soavi is the project designer with 14 years of experience with finance, blockchain, and sustainability. Mehul Derodra is the sustainability metrics lead and has 15 years of experience with an extensive background in traditional investing and FinTech. Bencze Levente is the developer for the project who has experience with smart contracts, backend, frontend, and databases. All of those skills will likely be necessary for this project. The project auditor, Sean Murphy, has over 15 years of experience with emerging technology and impact investing management. Overall, all four members of the team have the necessary skills and expertise to make this project successful. \n\nThe proposers said that this proposal will be to construct a proof-of-concept and that they hope this project will become a longer term collaboration with the Cardano community. As a result, they will return for more funding if things are successful with this initial part of the larger project. \n\nI did not have any critiques of this proposal for feasibility, so I can give it a score of 5. (score given: 5)\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Based on the information provided in the proposal, I think that this proposal is mostly auditable by the Cardano community. The proposers mentioned that they will have a document or deliverable for each of their 4 phases. Phase 1 will deliver a method to derive impact measures adapted for SPOs in Cardano. Phase 2 will deliver the requirements for the impact dashboard. Phase 3 will deliver the PoC testing the feasibility of the general proposal. Lastly, phase 4 will deliver a report on the PoC from both the technical and user-engagement perspectives after 2 months of the dashboard\u2019s launch. \n\nSuccess for the metrics that will be used on the stake pools will be met if the measures/standards cover at least 50% of all stake pools, divided between the pools with social and environmental objectives. Success for the impact dashboard will be met if 20% of impact stakers use the dashboard to check their impact data. Both of these metrics of success are very good because they provide a concrete comparison number that the Cardano community can use to see if the proposal was successful. \n\nThe overarching goals of this proposal are to increase the interest in mission-driven stake pools and promote the development of SPOs that provide more impact-driven ROI. These goals are something that will definitely be trackable by the community and are also worthy goals to pursue. \n\nMy only critique of the proposal is that they did not mention how they will share out progress checks or documentation with the community. Is there a website that can be used? A GitHub page for the code? I see a GitHub page was linked, so I can guess that is where the information will be published, but explicitly stating that in the proposal would have helped me more easily make that connection.\n\nI did not have any other critiques of this proposal\u2019s auditability, except for the lack of mentioning where the information will be published, so I can give this proposal a score of 4 for auditability.

The author aims to pull back this curtain and let delegations evaluate the effect that their contributions have strengthened. This response to the issue from various viewpoints, one of which is the influx of extra money and traffic across the chain and greater adoption when users are given a tool to evaluate the aforementioned data. This could also attract outside actors looking for a way to effect change. Through this concept, Cardano might become a blockchain of people who care about the environment and increase people's knowledge of it. The main issue, however, would be the standard criteria used to evaluate the impacts, which can wind up being biased toward one over the other given that not all effects might appear to be significant at first glance.

The budget also makes up a relatively small portion of the total amount allocated, which is perfectly appropriate for a five-month timeline. In my perspective, the idea and another proposal titled \"Proof of Impact NFTs for SPOs\" work together to build a whole project.
