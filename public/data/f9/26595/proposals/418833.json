Therefore the proposed solution that this proposal suggests is a great step in the right direction. It will help SPOs to track their nodes easier on the go from their smartphones.

In their problem statement they mentioned gLiveView and say that it does not track all of the essential (they wrote it as \u2018essencial\u2019 but spelling is not the worst part of the proposal) data. gLiveView can track epoch progress, block height, number of transactions, forks, and even the RAM of the node. The script does not talk about what they view as missing parameters from other systems. Rest of the script and their website [adarocket.me](http://adarocket.me) only talks about the notifications and how their project will improve this.

Under this section they mentions that they have been working on this for 6 months, and just list what their next plans are. There is not a single word that is related to budget. It feels like they are doing the project somehow and looking for some extra bucks. But they don\u2019t even take it seriously. The absence of information about the team can support my claim as well. They just gave the titles for their team members but there is not a single information about the people will be working on this.
