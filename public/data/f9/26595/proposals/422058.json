It will increase the availability of tooling on Cardano, the liquidity accessed by all DEXs, and will provide users a very convenient approach to swaps. Currently, if a user wants to swap a particular token, they have to first find a DEX that has a liquidity token pair of that particular token. With this model, a user can go to one place for their swaps. Additionally, new DEXs or startups can provide their users access to greater liquidity without having to bootstrap the liquidity. Most importantly, the proposer offers this solution as an open source project, which means they will be providing a valuable and audited code base for batching, should a project wish to host their own DEX. This is a good example of a project that is showing how Cardano is different and better, in this particular case, than the competitors. Projects like this will bring greater adoption from other ecosystems. Muesli Swap team is a highly competent and trustworthy group, and I have no doubt they will follow through on their promise. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I have been a member of the community for over a year now, and from personal experience, I can say that the Muesli Swap team has already proven to the community that they offer value, and can be depended on to bring a product to market. They have been very open and honest with the community and are well respected. The proposal as written is highly likely of being implemented, baring any unforeseen challenges. I am not aware of any other protocols in crypto that offer this type of service. The proposers are asking for a modest amount of Ada and has made it clear they intend to use internal funding as well to get the project across the finish line. In addition, the team is well-connected in the community, and they will not have any issues getting other DEXs on board. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The Muesli Swap team has already proven that they do communicate with the community and are open about their intentions. The proposer in this case is going to offer communications through Twitter Spaces, an open GitHub repository so that the community can view the code base, will write a technical paper outlining the protocol, and will have it professionally audited and provide that audit to the community. As the proposer mentions, this project will be implemented regardless of funding, and will be introduced into major DEXs.

The team is proposing to build an open order book that can be used by any DEX to fill orders. This in turn will allows users to place limit orders and use the liquidity of all participating DEXs. As a consequence, traders will get better price outcomes and liquidity will be significantly increased. It is a novel application built on top of Cardano that will enhance the ecosystem through innovation and likely boost more adoption. The goals of the proposal align with the challenge settings since a successful implementation would mean a new product available on the Cardano blockchain that will attract new users and an increased number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless experience. Furthermore, I believe it would be enlightening to see a discussion on possible scalability issues that could arise when developing the solution.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal was made by the OpenSwap Technologies team, composed of 9 developers with experience in Haskell, Plutus and JavaScript, among others. In their website you can find short descriptions for 7 members of the team but no links to LinkedIn pages or more detailed curriculums. In the budget breakdown they estimate the number of hours of work that will be required to implement the plan but they don't get to identify how many and which type of members will be necessary. On the other hand, the budget is clearly outlined and it is easy to spot how much each item will cost. However, I found the estimates a bit overpriced. The average hourly cost of development is roughly USD 90 and the audit cost is USD 15k (and they say this amount actually won't be enough to cover all the audit costs). The timetable, in turn, sounds achievable and realistic. In total, the project is estimated to last roughly four months (the audit phase is the hardest to predict and could stretch the project). Finally, they appropriately discussed the risks of the proposal and identified the risk of other dApp protocols not being interested in using this approach. However, to mitigate that they will use this approach in MueliSwap so smaller DEXs can fulfill their order with their smart contracts. They also plan on operating their own bots to be able to fulfill the orders with liquidity from other DEXs meaning that they will be able to offer the shared limit order approach anyway.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap provided is a bit too simplistic. They estimate the development phase will last from two to three months, the protocol corporations will happen in parallel to that and the audit phase will last around one month. However, they could have better explained what they are expecting to happen during these three months of development. In the budget breakdown section, we can get a gist of that but it would be better if that was also on the detailed plan and if each smaller task inside the development had an estimated beginning date and an estimated finishing date. Another downside of the plan is they do not have explicitly defined KPIs to track the project's progress. Some suggestions of KPIs would be number of DEXs onboarded into the protocol, total volume traded through the protocol and total number of new users in each of the DEXs participating in the protocol. Finally, they mention their intention of updating the Cardano community weekly via twitter but it would have been more convenient if they had provided the link to their twitter account.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2513", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4583, "q0": "The prospect of a shared order book between DEXes is an intriguing one, and could potentially address the three problems listed. Further, creating a shared order book is an opportunity to leverage Cardano's particular infrastructure and further distinguish it from its competitors. \n\nMuch of the impact, unfortunately, revolves around issues not entirely within the project's control such as whether individual DEXes will want to, or fear to, cede some of their control to a \"centralized\" order book. Nevertheless, the order book doesn't need to corner the market to provide a good case study for the pros and cons of such a system. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal is from the team that built MuesliSwap, so they have substantial experience developing infrastructure for DEXes on Cardano. The budget is more than reasonable for the task, with the team making up for any shortfall. \n\nThe main question, as noted in the proposal's risk assessment, is whether DEXes will shy away from using a centralized order book. MuesliSwap's commitment to using it themselves should help build some confidence. Forming relationships, particularly with smaller existing and upcoming DEXes, will be key to this project's ultimate success. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal makes transparency a high-priority, not just for the completed project, but during development itself. Development will be open source with code available to examine on repositories. \n\nUltimately, it will probably take time to see what kind of effect a common order book has on the DEX-based ecosystem within Cardano. The proposers, however, plan to hire external auditers to evaluate the effects of the product, which should hold the project to account quite well. \n\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2564", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6729, "q0": "MuesliSwap returns to Fund 9 with a very interesting value proposition - the creation of an open order book that can be used by any Cardano-based DEX to fill its orders. This solution will act as a meta-dex protocol as the team calls it, or as a mem-pool of orders, a pond in which all DEXes can fish. If such a meta-protocol is built and even if a few, not all, DEXes adopt it, this can only mean a better order execution for users, which can potentially increase liquidity and decrease execution time. \n\nThere is no real downside to this, except perhaps the open question of whether the meta protocol can be used by an automated market maker like SundaeSwap as well (a type of DEX that does not use an order book, but rather liquidity pools). Irrespective of the answer to this question, there are only upsides to building such a protocol and definitely a scalable solution if it will be used by multiple exchanges. Five stars.

The takeaway here is that this proposal would only cover partially the project\u2019s needs - which is excellent. \n\nThere is a clear value proposition here, an established and well regarded team, so no need to beat around the bush. A highly feasible and potentially useful project. Five stars. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team is trying to be very transparent. Once they finalize the technical proposal they plan on releasing a report with the proposed model and a discussion around advantages / disadvantages of each finding. They plan on having weekly updates released through their Twitter page. Of course, the build would be open source and available in a Github repository. Another excellent point is that the team is consulting with external parties before selecting a third party auditor - a very modest approach compared to other proposals who are not offering indications of shopping around for the best deals when selecting an auditor. I have all reasons to believe that this will be a highly transparent project and very easy to monitor by the community.

This would unify the market/limit orders lowering the risk among all the DEX's users and prevent any uncertainty of price throughout the market. The Impact that this could have, if the major DEX(s) on Cardano agree to implementation, is quite significant if successfully launched.
