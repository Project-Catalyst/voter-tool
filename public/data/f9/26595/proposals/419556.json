Specifically, players play games and receive NFT rewards depending on their playing level. This is a gaming trend of blockchain and it is sure to thrive in the future.\nCurrently the game play to earn on ETH, Solana is quite rich. However, due to the new smart contract from September last year and the more difficult technical characteristics to access, the number of games on cardano is still small.\nPlayers in this game, depending on their level of play, can receive their NFT or Borgz tokens, these NFTs and tokens can be bought, sold and exchanged for real money. This gives a great boost to the players.\nTherefore, supporting, and attracting game development teams on cardano is necessary and suitable for the needs of the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Roadmap of the project is divided into 4 main phases. Phase 1 has been deployed by them before. In this fund 9 will be counted from the 2nd phase from the 3rd quarter of 2022.\nTheir plan focuses on developing 3D game character design, creating and minting NFT, developing game environment, releasing and distributing game tokens. They will have Pre-Alpha testing in the third quarter of this year and alpha testing in the fourth quarter, later this year.\nThe project has a total cost of 31000 USD. mainly for NFT creations and getting 3D characters for the game.\nThey have 3 main members with full linkedin link publicly and they have additional collaborations with design artists (3 game developers, 1 2D artist, 2 3D artists, 1 3D animation specialist).

They outline parameters that can be included in the report: number of downloads, number of new ada wallets, number of newly created NFTs...\nAlthough they used to launch a public sale, the communication to the community was not really successful (sold 29% of the sales target). Therefore I hope they will have a better connection with the cardano community through regular meetings catalyst. And they should also have professional marketing personnel in the team to make up for this shortcoming.

I think, this is interesting idea and it consistents with the Challenge. The proposer explains clearly about the battle game, the NFT characters, how to play and earn BORGZ token. BORGZ Token is a Cardano Native token, earned by winning the battle that can be converted to Ada and then fiat currency, or used to upgrade your characters and buy special items. I appreciated that proposer shows the Token cycle in picture and NFT characters in video that community could have a better visualization of the game, and clarifys their targeted customers that shows their seriousness in implementing this project. As we know, there are relatively lacking of high-quality \"Play to earn\" games on Cardano blockchain, so their solution will focus on both improve the gaming experience for users to attract new games and keep loyal customers, eventually contribute to the implication of Cardano blockchain where transaction fees are negligible and levels of security is high. I would like to give them full mark for this part because of a very interesting idea. I fully support their project. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility script is good, but it could be better. First, the proposal roadmap is very clear. There are 4 phrases in their plan, with Phrase 1 completed, other 3 Phrases will start from Q3/2022 to Q2/2023. Somehow, the team shows their ability of implementing this project with proof of works in Phrase 1. Therefore, I am more convinced that this team is able to do well in the next phrases. Also, the proposer clarify exactly what activities they will do in each phrase, mainly about minting, 3D character development, NFT staking, Borgz token, marketplace development. I think, their plan is detailed enough for community understanding. For the project' expense, the cost required for each item is clear about the required amount, how long it will takes for finish each task, and required budget is $31000 in total. My only recommendation is that the proposer should include exactly who will be in charge of each task. For the team and partners, I think it is okay, but this part could be better. The proposer mentions about 3 members, shortly introduce their experience as project manager, game developer, game experts and how they are related to the Cardano blockchain with provided social link for more information. However, the proposer mentions that there are 3 game developers, 1 2D artists, 1 3D artist, 1 3D animation specialist in their team, but I do not know exactly who they are, I would be appreciated if the proposer could introduce them a little bit that shows their internal team are fully established for carrying out this project in the long term. In general, with all the above analysis, I believe that the proposer and his teams are able to implement this project well. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In my opinion, the auditability suggested by the proposer is useful, it needs to be more detailed. So far, after finishing Phrase 1, the proposer have measured community interest in their token sales through KICK.io launchpad, it showed 29% of available tokens were sold. However, the proposer should clarify exactly where community could check this information? After finishing Phrase 1, whether they will make reports and share it for community? How and where this report be shared? (in social media channels, or their offical website). Besides, I suggest the proposer should give Github link for community to check product code. As we know, currently, they have almost 2000 followers on Twitter, over 700 members on Discord, and my question is when community is getting larger, what tool will they use to communicate effectively with these people? How to make everyone in the community to access the information instantly when there are new updates about their project development? by sending emails or by weekly, monthly reports?  Should they have professionals in marketing? By what I mean, the proposer should have a solid communication channels between the team, information and the community. Besides, community could base on some key indicators: the number of registered wallets for NFT mints, the quantity of NFTs generated, the number of application for beta testing, the number of delegated wallets, the number of Ada wallets linked to the game, the number of game downloads. I think, this quantitative analysis could help community to have a general overview of the project development. After all, it is possible to follow the project progress, but it could be more perfect with my above analysis.

The proposal states \"The traditional relationship between game developers and players is one-sided.  There needs to be more legitimate benefits for players.\" This is important for a growing ecosystem because there is a need for engaging content that will include more users. The proposal intends to address this challenge by receiving funding for their project so that the team behind Battle Borgz will be able to create a high-quality game that will reward users in the community. I like the idea of this game because it brings something new to the Cardano blockchain. However, the question has to be asked. How will this game specifically add value to the Cardano ecosystem. Will it bring utility to other projects as well? Or just for the project of Battle Borgz. For these reasons, I give this section of the proposal 3 out of 5 stars. I am still unsure of how beneficial this project will be to the overall growth of the Cardano blockchain in these early stages. Especially given that the majority of this fund is allocated towards this challenge setting of Dapps, Products, and Integrations. The proposal should have a more specific approach to how it impacts this challenge setting.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal does a great job at including a lot of important information.

There is a very detailed roadmap that gives details on how long the team will be working on the project. Their project is split up into 4 different phases.

Something that should be considered by the team and implemented into this proposal is the idea of a loyal community. There needs to be a form of a community behind this proposal so that they can be held accountable by someone.
