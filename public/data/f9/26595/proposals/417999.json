I'm not a collectible NFT lover myself, but this proposal make it clear how NFT swapping service can foster adoption and development of this very important blockchain use case (second after DeFi). The closest real-life use case I can think of is \"Magic The Gathering\" collectible play cards, and indeed swapping is very much needed in addition to just selling and buying.\nAs the project is open-source, every developers in the Cardano NFT ecosystem will be able to use this work, therefore this project meets the challenge criteria with a high level of impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposing team include CENT as the main developer (smart contract, back-end off-chain and front-end templates).

The proposal  includes link to a user story and project's GitHub (no smartcontract code published yet). \nAs it was in F8 proposal, the road map includes concrete milestones. This time a detailed project timeline is also provided. Deliverable was expected in june are indeed user stories that will drive the development. Unfortunately at the time of this assessment, the timeline ends up in june, and no details are given for this Fund9 proposal. I expect it to be updated soon.\nVoter should notice that the proposers NFT Guild are creators of NFTs themselves (Trybbles collectible NFT), and they have a market place ready to test the 2  smartcontracts.

This is the 2nd proposal of the series that the proposer addresses the pain point of NFT holders (not being able to swap their NFTs, instead, they have to sell then bt=uy, encountering frictions). The use case being built here is clearly meets this challenge's goal (i.e., build an impactful use case that helps drive more adoption) and Fund9's strategic goal (i.e., an open-source project that attracts more developers). The proposal clearly articulates that it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem by (1) driving the adoption of Cardano collectible NFTs - the largest segment of NFT; (2) making Cardano NFT ecosystem stand out with this unique swapping infrastructure; (3) encouraging developers' activities on Cardano with open-source Cardano-specific code. This project is also significant as it boosts capabilities for NFT transactions which currently NFTs overall represent the largest use-case segment on Cardano.

The team's roles and responsibilities are defined clearly. Potential timeline overlaps with other funded proposals are raised and addressed sufficiently by the team. The proposer presents a comprehensive implementation plan that includes already built user stories, a roadmap, and key outputs. The budget is broken down into functions and sub-functions, with specific and reasonable hourly rates for each function (e.g., $120/hour for development and $65/hour for market research). This level of granularity is quite rare among the proposals in Catalyst. The proposer demonstrates a clear understanding of their implementation plan and the technical requirements for the solutions. Last but not least, the proposer puts thoughts into the potential key risk (widespread adoption) and proposes two mitigations for it.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I strongly agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals. The proposer sets out several channels for the community to meaure the project's progress: the project's GitHub (for deliverables), detailed GANTT chart timeline, user stories board on Micro, Catalyst Monthly Reporting form, NFT Guild website and Discord, and quantitative KPIs (e.g., # of GitHub commits, # of interactions with the project's repositories by outside developers, # of a project launched on their platform after the first month). The clarity provided by the problem statement and solution statement is also helpful for auditability.

It's an interesting and genuine truth that a seller will often sell one NFT in order to purchase another NFT from the same collection. NFT swapping might reduce user costs significantly and boost chain involvement. Not just for Cardano but for blockchain in general, a focus on NFTs as a tool for adoption is particularly crucial, and this idea could support the same. The danger that this technology won't be widely accepted and used worries the author as well, but they appear to have some reliable mitigating methods in place. However, putting this into practice would require the collection owners or creators to make some compromises regarding the royalty fees. Some of them would be wary and confused by this idea, but in my opinion, if it meant making their NFT collection more accessible and well-liked, they would be willing to make those concessions. The impact of this tool on the ecosystem and blockchain, in general, might be significant given that the other conditions of the challenge are flawlessly completed and the team's plan appears to be on track.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer lays out a clear strategy for the readers and demonstrates how much prior study has been done.

The proposal also takes sure to mention any potential hazards the team may encounter as well as the risk reduction strategy in place. The team's roadmap is well-defined, realistic, and clear. The proposal also includes a thorough budget breakdown, which again appears reasonable and appropriate given the amount of effort required to make the idea successful. The plan is the second phase of one that was previously financed, so the practicality certainly seems promising. The team also mentions potential funding increases in future rounds in case the community asks for more features, demonstrating the dedication the team has. Given the evidence at hand, it is clear that this idea has a good chance of succeeding.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "NFT Guild has already shown signs of promise based on the diversity of proposals the team has presented for various challenges.

The proposal is enhanced by the success measures and their meticulous detailing, especially when it has been specified phase-wise. Code documentation and code deployment over GitHub are glaring signs of a proposal's effective implementation. Numerous contacts with the project's repositories, the showcase DApp, the integration, and the adoption of their tool undoubtedly help the audit process to be efficient and successful. Additionally, the author states that frequent updates will be published on both the NFT Guild Gitbook and their website, https://www.nft-guild.io/nft-guild. which will facilitate community tracking.

In my opinion, the proposed team budget is completely reasonable and explained clearly and coherently. At the same time, the team presented an analyzed budget sheet for both periods.

The scale of the impact of this problem is relatively large. The NFT market is growing stronger and stronger, despite the sharp drop in the cryptocurrency market, the NFT market still has a strange attraction.\nThis proposal will create a dapp on the Cardano blockchain to introduce open source NFT swap smart contract templates (This smart contract was created in phase 1 of the project).

In addition, the swap process is simpler, saving costs and time for users. That will attract many new users, driving Cardano's adoption.\nApparently, this proposal responds to the \"Dapps, Products & Integrations\" challenge. It created the dApp on Cardano, which attracted many new users, it is suitable for execution now and has the necessary infrastructure in place to do so.\nThe author has stated that the biggest challenge that can be encountered when implementing a project is the possibility of not being widely adopted.

The problem statement is both a little confusing and questionable, as it\u2019s a little oversimplified. Still, it does provide two ideas that is unique to the Cardano NFT space and this well aligns with Catalysts mission to pursue the highest levels of community innovation. The concept of NFT swapping is not unique to the Cardano ecosystem (with services like Trading Tent) but they do not use smart contracts in their services, so the smart contract model IS unique. The NFT randomization swapping feature is very interesting that is not found anywhere in the Cardano ecosystem (smart contract or not). Where I (and voters) might hesitate on this one is whether or not the $49k price tag is worth this development, considering there are alternative solutions that already exist and this amount could go to other more average priced proposals.

The hourly rate for the developers is set to $120/hr, which translates to $234k/yr (which is well over the higher end of developer salaries right around $140k). In their defense, smart contract development (on Cardano) is HIGHLY specialized work and there\u2019s a good reason nobody has developed this feature yet. For project manager salary ($95/hr - $197k/yr) and UI Designer salary ($75/hr - $146k/yr), I don\u2019t have a defense for.
