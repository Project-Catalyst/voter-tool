Therefore, a new search engine that specializes in finding the metadata traits residing within particular NFTs does sound necessary and intriguing. I can\u2019t help but relate to this situation since I did find myself in this tangle not long ago when I was grinding through the Internet looking for a laptop that has powerful internal components packed in a lightweight and portable chassis, but my searchings gave me nothing but a awkwardly long list of ultrabooks and gaming laptops from various brands such as Asus, Acer, Lenovo, HP, Alienware, Razer, etc. It\u2019s worth keeping in mind that there is only a finite number of laptops out there, but the metadata storage is immense, so this example should fortify the necessity of this project even more. However, from the information provided in this section, I believe that this project is still so far a concept, since there are only details depicting the main functionalities, while other features are still left out and the existing components, which are sophisticated pieces of infrastructure, have not been dived into details, either. As a consequence, there lacks the key metrics needed to determine the success of this project, which is a crucial part of this section.\nThat being said, the team has managed to give a more thorough description of the possible challenges they may face in the execution of this project, which is the concern to deliver a desirable search engine that lives up to the expectation of the community. And they intend to resolve that by integrating complex search algorithms that have been successfully tested, which I suppose makes up for the lack of main component listing I mentioned earlier. As for the scalability to tackle the long-term implementation, the team hopes to put in use more sophisticated elements to further strengthen the engine.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Straight from the beginning of this section, the team claims that they have already had a proof of concept made prior to this proposal to mitigate the above challenges and they are expecting to deliver the project in a time span of just 3-6 months, which is probably a good sign of things to come. \nIn the first milestone, which is nearly finished work in progress, they hope to deliver a first look at the architecture and core functionality of the project, which is also the proof of concept that they have mentioned in the Impact section. To be specific, there will be working web app with a text search field for users to look for the applications the want, with the returning results ranking in order of relevance and each result containing information that relates to the components of the Cardano application, such as images, summary of the metadata, minted NFTs, etc. \nThe second milestone, supposedly taking place in June 2022, will carry on the achievements from the first one, focusing on the given feedback from users and strengthening the performance and architecture, and hoping to deliver overall faster and more conclusive searchings. \nThe third milestone, supposedly occurring in September of the same year, will continue to improve the project further based on the combined feedback of two previous milestones, this time concentrating the most to the result relevance compared to the search keywords to offer more precise and up-to-date results. And the proposal has also included the team\u2019s dedication to continue integrating new components and enhancing the overall functionality and features, further solidifying a good chance of getting the fund approval. Therefore, based on the performance so far in this section, I would say that the requested budget is somewhat justifiable, and I say \u201csomewhat\u201d because the infrastructure costs are the only ones getting a clarified deduction compared to the other costs, all of which curiously have the same number of $8,866.\nAs for the team members of this project, It was mentioned at the beginning of the proposal that this project currently has 2 hands on deck only. Nevertheless, they both have had a significantly long amount of 25 years to accumulate their experience and expertise for this project, so while some may doubt that only 2 members will prolong the time needed to deliver the project, I believe that they have more than enough capabilities to pull through. And the proposal also claims that the duo is also looking for at least one more professional developer on deck, so when they do, I think It won\u2019t be too much of a stretch. The only small thing I would love to suggest the team adding to the proposal is the dedicated profile or portfolio of each member for further verification.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Taking this standard into consideration, while the team claims to encompass best project management practices for milestone tracking, pace reviews and predictions, they haven\u2019t gone into specific details of what those practices, pace reviews and predictions are, and also mentioned whether those details will be accessible only to internal parties or will be available to the public community for observation as well.\nThe desired success would of course be the launch of a fully functional, bug-free and feature-rich site that allows users to find exactly what they look for, leading to more and more people adopting this search engine for Cardano NFTs. In theory, that would benefit Cardano by introducing an effective Cardano-based search engine and inherently introducing people to Cardano as well. Still, I would love to see some estimated figures demonstrating a particular vision of success by the team.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2974", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 4, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2057, "q0": "I think this proposal is quite promising as it develops an application to search metadata in Cardano blockchain using Cardano-node, Cardano db-sync, PostgreSQL, IPFS and web technologies. By creating the NFT Search Engine, it will allow those interested in Cardano NFT to easily find NFTs with the characteristics they are looking for. This proposal, if successfully implemented, would address the challenge by enabling an easy-to-use, responsive website for deep metadata searching. Results will be announced via Ideascale, social networking sites, as well as via messaging apps. The author also recognizes the challenges and difficulties that may be encountered during the implementation of the project, which is always positive because prevention is better than cure and fortunately he also has a solution. Redundancy is great for overcoming those challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the roadmap of the proposal, according to the author, the roadmap consists of 3 milestones and the proposal is in the process of implementing milestone 1 (60% complete: deploying a working web application with a text search field) free, for now just tweaking the user experience and fixing bugs). Milestone 2 will start after Milestone 1 is completed (about 2-3 months) and Milestone 3 will start after Milestone 2 is completed. We know each milestone will have what tasks to accomplish as well as the ultimate goal of each milestone. However, if the timelines are defined every month and it is detailed what will happen in each of those sections, I believe our visualization of the process will be more logical and straightforward.\nNext is the budget, in this section, I think the proposal could also be elaborated further. We know the total required budget is $35,000 and it's broken down into sections like: \"$8,400 infrastructure costs, $8,866 Developer / Sysadmin, $8,866 Sysadmin / Management, $8,866 Searching find another developer\". In general, we know how the total amount will be divided into large parts, but each of them can be explained better. For example, why is the cost of infrastructure $8,400, and what does it include? Similar to $8,866 asking for developers: how many developers does the proposal need, how much time will they spend on the project, and what is their hourly salary???\nAnd finally, about the development team, the team is described as having 2 members with about 25 years of experience in IT infrastructure and application development, besides currently looking for more members to take on the role of developer. In my opinion, this section needs to be added as we only know about their expertise, Linkedin link profile can follow them more easily through this link. However, it would be better to have a small board for them to introduce themselves...How can we measure his experience and relationship with the technologies related to the Cardano ecosystem? Overall, the author of the proposal provided us with a basic assessment of this: roadmap, team, and budget, but it was not enough for me to judge the feasibility of the project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "And finally, about the ability to measure project progress, it is mentioned that \"We will incorporate project management best practices for milestone tracking, velocity assessment, and prediction, and focus on focuses heavily on using LEAN techniques (e.g. Kanban)\" perhaps this is how the team can track the progress of the project, the key is \"project management best practices\" Which method is that? How do we have a basis for an audit? And then maintain regular communication with the Cardano community, to give us regular feedback on the development of the project in action. I can't see how this proposal could be easily audited because, other than being unable to track the project's progress, we don't know in detail any KPIs to determine the success of the project. So even though the success of the project was clearly defined as the release of the website and users started using it as a Cardano NFT search engine. But as mentioned above, we have no basis to measure whether this proposal is successful or not.

Moreover, a responsive, easy-to-use website for deep metadata search is promised to be developed, though the author does not explain how the team would create those characteristics. They should describe some common features such as: what categories and information the final website/application provides for the users, what further actions can users take after searching for a specific NFT, what features would attract new users efficiently,... To conclude, I believe this is a great idea for widening the Cardano ecosystem and potentially onboarding more members to the community, yet some criterias should be improved to draw a better imagination about the project for the Catalyst. Beside the content offered, the information presented is quite confusing and incomprehensive, since one paragraph is copied and pasted to answer 3 different questions included in this section. My suggestion is that he/she should rearrange that paragraph to bring about a clearer overview.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "A very detailed plan is offered in this section, which includes 3 milestones with key ambitions for each one. Overall, the final outcome would be conducted within the final quarter of 2022, with the first milestone being 90% done. Every function and feature that this application contains, as well as some further integration in the future are offered thoroughly within this roadmap, which I find very interesting and efficient. The mechanism to approach each target is also explained comprehensively and particularly. Furthermore, a budget breakdown is provided accordingly with the techniques required. Nevertheless, they should provide some information such as: the total working hour throughout the project, the salary required per hour, the total working hour per day/month,... in order to help the Catalyst easily assess the quality and process of work. Finally, a brief introduction about team members is also given with details on working experience. However, I believe they should describe more about name, education, previous achievements/project or an affiliate link (LinkedIn, Twitter, CV,...) to present background information for a better assessment of their capability.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In this section, the author answered properly how they are going to keep track of the progress, and stated some reasonable success measures, yet I believe that it is still insufficient. Particularly, they should give some specific KPIs, such as: the expected number of users in the first month/year of operation, the number of searching activities performed daily, the quality of users\u2019 feedback,... These aspects would help them a lot in evaluating the success and improving the platform. Moreover, some sustainable development goals should be settled and followed to ensure the long-term growth of this application and show the Catalyst what their future visions are.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_4118", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 3, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "We will develop an app to search metadata in the Cardano blockchain utilizing Cardano-node, Cardano db-sync, PostgreSQL, IPFS, and web tech.", "experience": "Our team consists of 2 team members with around 25 years each of IT infrastructure and application development expertise.
