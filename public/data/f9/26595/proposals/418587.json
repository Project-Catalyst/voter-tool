I say loosely, because the only connections I can see in the proposal are \u2018putting the logo powered by Cardano\u2019 and hiring a \u2018Cardano expert\u2019 to do who knows what.\nThat being said, the proposal does have a potential impact outside Cardano, in the education sector in Argentina in particular. The proposer wants funding to create virtual tours of museums and institutions of significance in the country. Having 18+ years experience in the education sector I can vouch for how amazing museum tours in 3D can be if students do not have the means or ability to attend a museum in person. The proposers mention that not only students in Argentina will benefit, that the platform will be open to reach thousands outside the country as well.\nOverall, the potential educational impact to students and others alike around the world is palatable, I rate it 3 stars for impact.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal lists adequate details of the proposed timeline, budget, and staff required to achieve success. \nThe timeline lists 5-6 museum tours completed within 3-4 months. Following brief online research most virtual tour recorders offer a timeline of about 10-14 days from start to finish for a project, this fits within this average. It\u2019s a nice detail that the proposal includes the stages of the post-processing which some readers would not be familiar with, so adds confidence that the team understands the project requirements realistically.\nIn regards to the budget feasibility I think the proposer has requested more than enough funding to complete this project. Purchasing a new laptop, when they are already completing similar projects, a whole year software subscription for a 3-4 month project, and $5,000 worth of marketing should be considered as whether this solution provides good value for money. \nI\u2019m curious how the proposers plan to spend that much on marketing to schools, as an educator, send an email to a teacher \u2018Amazing Free Museum tour\u2019 and it\u2019ll go viral! I\u2019m also concerned about the \u2018Cardano expert - $2,000USD per month for 3 months\u2019 with no clear explanation of what they will do, only to put a logo on the final rendering of the museum.\nThere are some details provided about the staff currently involved in the project, with biographies in LinkedIn available, with enough experience between them to successfully complete it.\nOverall, I rate this proposal 3 stars for feasibility, it is feasible, however, I think the budget to workload ratio may need to be explored carefully by potential voters.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There will be clear auditability on completion of the project, hopefully 5-6 museums in Argentina (in addition to one I\u2019ve already noticed is free and available) will be available for people to explore in 3D at home. These museums or institutions are not listed, so it\u2019s of some concern how the team will choose and get permission to attain the most worthy buildings for the project.\nStated in the proposal is that \u2018virtual tours work like websites\u2019 so they will be able collate metrics of visits and time spent exploring. In addition I think they will offer a recorded, guided interactive tour, which possible schools can request as an extra, however, it\u2019s not clear to me how this will occur.\nIt would be nice for the proposers to present some sort of public channel, a website, social media or even a simple Google doc of their expenditure along the way. This will make it clearer for the Cardano community and ensure the money is spent more wisely than they currently have planned.\nOverall, I give this proposal 4 stars for auditability, in that once the museums are online in 3D, we will know the project was a success.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3840", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "I'm offering a hyper-realistic virtual tour with 15K definition, which will be free and complemented by the live accompaniment of a teacher or guide.
