The proposal to identify the problem in the challenge that needs to be solved is in line with the challenge presented. The language barrier separates the activities of members of the Catalyst community around the world, which greatly affects the Cardano ecosystem. The proposal is the right solution for the Cardano community to come together. The implementation of the project will have AI Solutions in natural language, really great with AI the translation and definition suitable for the native languages will help the best interaction. Building a Collaborative Platform in the Cardano community achieves many of the same goals as the proposal stated. Creating knowledge exchange cooperation and also competition in accordance with this is in line with Cardano's development. The implementation solution of the proposal has very clear objectives, implementing the installation of the appropriate software: HYPEinnovation, IdeaNote, Concept, SDKs thereby performing an evaluation of language concepts. Integrating Miro, Audio, Video, Messaging helps to make language communication. The proposal implemented will have a tremendous impact on the Cardano ecosystem, where people are exchanged easily without being deterred by language. The implementation solution of the proposal depends quite a lot on external software, worrying about the risk of compatibility with the Cardano platform. The author has taken measures to minimize the risks because by applying open source tools this is reasonable. Establishing relationships with partners who jointly support the development of DAO platforms will make it easier to implement the proposal. I have an opinion on the need to identify the risks posed by the fluctuating ADA that affects the amount offered to not be sufficient to implement the proposal. To solve this problem, the author needs to reserve some money in case of risk.\nRating: 5\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan is described in detail, how to implement it in accordance with the expected details that have been given in the solution section. The proposal is the first phase of the project, the implementation in the first 3 months can affect an entire project implementation process. The author planned to lay a solid foundation from the first step, the implementation of the selection of the planned interactive communities. The content of the work given is logical from the time of implementation until the test product is available. Implementing community-interactive UX building is built through 6 important steps, each of which is specific tasks. Installing and integrating software on the Cardano platform is made, HYPE, SDK and Miro tools, Spacial chat etc. will be integrated. The planned community building makes up catalyst town, community conferences. The plan needs to be more detailed for sampling from Rats DAO, ADAO, Snapbrillia and the purpose of use. In addition, the timetable for implementing the proposed plan in 3 months requires a specific time for the work to be completed, helping the manager understand the work is being done on schedule. The proposal has identified the number of people implementing the 12-member project. Implementation members have clear information that indicates that they are capable of completing the intended plan. In addition, the proposal also adds members to make connections between the hemispheres, in collaboration with Cardano communities to implement the project successfully. The total required budget is $57,000 allocated and spent on jobs in a reasonable manner, and the salary per hour of labor is $50. The budget table shows that the performance of the work is calculated according to the hours of active labor, there are reasonable calculations for the installation, configuration, integration of tools, the community connection takes place in 6 weeks with 220 hours i.e. spent $ 11000.

In order to audit the implementation of the plan, the author committed to monthly reports submitted via GitHub, clear research data.

I think this part is okay, but I would like the proposer to clearly tell more about their quantitative goals of the project such as their KPIs for reaching communities like how many numbers of users, communities use their platform, how many members joining their platform,..I think this would help them to have a clear picture of where their project stands.
