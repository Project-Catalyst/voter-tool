The more SPOs, the more decentralized, so the proposed team committed to provide a financial solution aimed at supporting the target groups that are new and small SPOs. so based on the rationale and commitment of this proposal, it's completely up to the challenge.\n\nThe main purpose of the proposed group is to provide a bond service for SPOs, that is, groups of shares with a small number of ADA shares that do not have enough shares to ensure that Block closing is consistent with each epoch. use smart contracts to borrow the trusts of the stake pool provided by the proposed service. this is great as I am an SPO owner myself but the ADA salary is not enough to guarantee ongoing rewards, so the operating expenses will not be enough income to cover, so If this proposal is successful it will be a way of important opening up for targeted SPOs. at the same time the arguments and examples given are reasonable.\n* however following the proposal's documentation I would like to have a few questions to elaborate on and to better understand the lending mechanisms offered by the proposed team.\n- If I need to borrow a group of shares, how much do I need to borrow to ensure that the number of ADA trusts in my SPO will be minted continuously?\n- And if I borrow, how much interest do I have to pay for the interest and how is it calculated?

This is in spite of the fact that I know the importance with respect to decentralization. The prosper\u2019s solution removes those risks for delegators, and removes the need to scrutinize the SPO models, as the operators themselves are willing to absorb those risks. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I feel confident that the project plans and budget supplied is feasible to deliver. To start, the proposer has communicated that they have already developed approximately 2,000 lines of code that are readied for auditors.

The proposer does not provide direct evidence of the relevant skills of the two auditors they intend to contract with, however these entities. Furthermore, the budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable terms, all that seem reasonable to achieve the goals of the project. The timeframe to complete the project seems reasonable, but even with slight delays on the auditing track, I have every reason to expect that this project will be ready for the community within six months. \n \nWith that said, the proposer could have made reference to the potential need to remediate some of the audited 2,000 lines of code, and explained whether that would be handled by their internal developers, or by one of the auditing entities (e.g., MLabs).
