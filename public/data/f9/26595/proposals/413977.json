The proposal addressed the challenge by creating a CO2 dApp that is scalable, less-resource-consumed and sponsored by 2 major European agricultural businesses. Not only that, the integration bridges stakeholders (multiple) and plutus developers which will highly contribute to the Cardano Ecosystem.

In order to prove to the PA that the project has been highly linked with other partnerships, there should be an exchange between the team, business and university and the outcome so far.

By that, looking at their roadmap in miro and the proposal it\u2019s highly comprehensible that they project aim so sequencely breaking it into 3 phases with the main focusing on identification and description. As it might suggest, in Phase 1, the proposal stated \u201cThe Edify team will conduct a series of interviews with the executive teams\u2026\u201d and the targets here are the said European agricultural business that should include the interview methods, criteria and proof that the outcomes will be open to the public for people to audit the project convincity. While there hasn\u2019t been much technological protocol that could be seen, but for a proposal which aimed to produce a white paper between the week of 15 - 24 (9 weeks) this is consider approvable with clear stages between each timeline, but again, for some Technical PA they might question about the proof of authority,ID links to blockchain that were listed in the miro board. The team should verify the criteria they used for specific titles of the Indicative project plan. There is a wise point for the project to only put Phase 1 into the proposal but in terms of risk management if the delay of Fund 10 happens it\u2019ll take a vast amount of time to build the app as funding budget is very important. Therefore, the project has to prove that they\u2019re capable of financial backups for the project (can include how the project is sponsored by the partnered organizations) and the continuation of the project even without Catalyst funding. Looking into risk management of the project there are consistency of time delay, key technical partners and the delivery of solution\u2019s description which followed by their mitigation method. For the first risk, there should be specific proof about the intensity of the pressing commercial business in Europe since the constant situation in terms of political, economical features have a huge impact on the agricultural system in general. By identifying this feature, it\u2019s more measurable of how the project will scale the application after the white paper. As it could be seen in the second risk section, the team ought to describe the characteristics of assistance from their technical partners in the Cardano ecosystem and would it arise additional cost for this process or what type of benefits would be exchanged?  For the third risk as it could be seen for the need in a comprehensible scope of work, it appears that there should be training for the developers team and the proposer should specify the amount of time that they\u2019ll put in for this stage and would it arise at any cost. Speaking from experience, the team should have their risks supported by adding an additional reserved budget in the proposal to prevent the fluctuation of ADA price and adapting to mutual needs while the whole process is executing. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The project is detailed in their KPI references, this include the milestone and numerical metrics.
