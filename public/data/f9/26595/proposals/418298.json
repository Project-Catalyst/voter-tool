Supported features will include direct donations and links to other fundaring tools. An extra feature is directing the donations to a stake-pool dedicated for each NGO.  \n\nIn itself it is a very laudable undertaking to support the activity of NGOs working for social causes, and there seems to be a very good plan behind the proposal, with many technical features in plan for the future. Another strength of the proposal is that they plan to set-up a governance token in order for the donors to also get involved into the governance of their favorite NGO should they want to do that. The team promises to be very methodical when building this feature and they plan on using the help of an external consultant in order to get the tokenomics just right. \n\nI do feel however that from a Cardano adoption standpoint, the impact won\u2019t be extraordinary, and I don\u2019t see a real connection between joining an ecosystem only due to the possibility of benefiting a good cause. On the contrary, for the NGOs being onboarded on the platform it will be terrific news, since any additional source of revenue is obviously welcome. Of course, many challenges will exist on their end too: managing crypto volatility, understanding the ecosystem, handling the tax implications and perhaps the downsides of having less fiscal deductions than fiat donations offer, etcetera. \n\nFor the lack of a value proposition that has the potential to increase adoption beyond any reasonable doubt, I offer four stars for the proposal\u2019s potential impact. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There\u2019s a great team behind the proposal, comprising three Italian system engineers and developers and a fellow linguistic expert from across the Adriatic sea. Their project spans across six months, and they have offered very clear milestones for the development. Initially I think that the project was meant to last one year but perhaps having a shorter timeframe is more palatable for the community, especially voters. I truly hope this will not be a case of overpromising and under delivering or even worse, poor quality due to extreme time pressure.  Their budget is likewise easy to understand, and they split the captions functionally by type of activity (front end, back end, SPO set-up, etc) with hourly rates between 50 and 80 USD. \n\nI have very slight worries about the overall reasonableness of the overall budget versus what will be delivered as a platform as well as similar worries regarding the short timeline, but since I am lacking any other concrete data or benchmarks for costs of similar portals, I\u2019ll call this a 4.5 review and err on the optimistic side, so five stars. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team makes a good argument for how to track the project\u2019s development over time, and they offer the following metrics: number of NGOs interested in joining their platform, donations collected, wallets created, level of engagement with social media. They also offer valid expressions of what success actually means: an enjoyable experience when navigating the platform, extensive social media engagement and NGOs joining the platform. Overall a strong case for auditability so five full stars are definitely the way to go here.

This is a unique and real-world use case that has a positive influence through getting NGO\u2019s more funding, which in turn can help those who need the most help. The funding mechanism appears solid, well thought-out, and completely doable. \n\nI do want to share that I believe there is a risk of seeing minimal adoption among NGOs. In my experience many NGOs are highly risk-averse as they have to do the most they can to fulfill their vision/mission with the limited resources they have. So unfortunately, for many with no concept of blockchain, this will likely appear very risky. There are ways this the team can overcome this, and I believe they have the capacity and experience to navigate this. But, to me, the risk of minimal adoption is high which would lead to less of an impact. \n\nOverall though, this proposal goes above and beyond meeting the challenge goals. This is the sort of project I would want to be part of.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal looks 100% feasible. The team definitely has the experience to carry this out. This is especially true because they intend to use other providers to help with the project in addition to their own team. The budget is high, but it looks fair and is sufficiently detailed to assess properly. There is funding for travel to court NGOs. There is funding for development and for other areas too. The hourly rates are clear, and the hours, while not explicitly stated, seem fair. Overall the budget should be sufficient to accomplish the task in the timeframe listed. The road map is also detailed enough for assessment. It is thorough for the proposal to be considered feasible. There is also the long-term goal of being self-sufficient. This is a positive mark of feasibility. Overall, this proposal is likely to get completed so long as the team follows through on their proposal, and I have no reason to think otherwise.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal lays out a clear goal that will take a whole lot of work. The team intends to complete it within a year's time. They are very clear about their plans to remain transparent and have provided measurables and a plan for publishing them. They will make their monthly reports to the Project Catalyst community. They will be tracking long-term metrics, such as how many NGOs they are able to on-board, value of donations and wallets, and community engagement. These are the right metrics for measuring this proposal\u2019s impact. In addition to submitting monthly reports to Catalyst, they will also publish them directly on their existing website and social media channels like discord and twitter. \n\nOverall, this is a clear proposal, with a clear goal in mind, a well-experienced and skilled team capable of delivering, and a detailed plan to make it happen transparently. Other than voters' feelings about the risk of seeing fewer NGO\u2019s onboarded, and a budget toward the high side for something with such a risk, this proposal is good investment for Project Catalyst.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3016", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14938, "q0": "\"Their intention is clear, which is to make the Cardano ecosystem more connected to real-world activities and to leverage micro-transactions to gain additional funds for their humanitarian campaigns. \nThe outcome will directly benefit the Cardano ecosystem by attracting adoption from millions of small benefactors and also support organizations by deploying single stake pools. \nIt is very clear how ShareLink will work and who it will benefit.

One thing is, I would expect KPIs to be more specific. For instance, I don\u2019t know their expected figures for these metrics to be measured and the timeline for measuring these metrics should be defined instead of \u201cin the long run\u201d.\nAnother thing is, I wouldn\u2019t say there is sufficient clarification regarding KPIs for evaluating impacts of this project on Cardano.\nIn terms of definitions of success, I understand what success would look like in the short and long term.

A NGO is a non-profit organization and adheres to some restrictive conditions when they deal with the money they gain.
