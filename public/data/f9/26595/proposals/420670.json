However, I still believe that greater clarity regarding how Cardano's technologies would be used would be welcome. Speaking of problematization, the auditors point out that there are no tools that precisely contribute to human growth, to the organization, etc. web3 expands, but the issues of well-being and productivity are left behind - the psychology of this situation is complex, as they define it; which can generate a simplification and commodification of well-being. So the proposed solution is to develop a cognitive assessment that uses artificial intelligence to map the skills and well-being of the team. This would all be related to Cardano, as the solution \u201caims to use artificial intelligence. Cardano partner SingularityNET hosts a blockchain marketplace for AI services.\u201d Explaining in more detail what is suggested here, a \u201c6-minute psychological assessment that provides the user with insight into their cognitive style will help guide the types of micropractices they can benefit most from, as well as serving as a framework to organize web3 teams according to skills that can be most synergistic and complementary\u201d. The goal is that machine learning can, in a deep way, \u201canalyze the relationships between cognitive assessments and wellness practices, in order to provide more targeted and personalized recommendations for individuals and teams\u201d. The idea is very interesting, it certainly fits with what is looking for the challenge, as it will generate a new use case for our blockchain technologies. However, it is not so clear how this would be done in practice, the proponents explain in a very rich and detailed way what this solution is, but not how the technical work would be used. Maybe they chose not to provide this information because the integration is probably quite complex, not easy for readers of the proposal to understand - but even so I would like more information about this more technological part of the proposal, even if they were briefer and more superficial explanations . In other words, I would like to better understand how Cardano's artificial intelligence and technologies would be used here. However, other than that, the way proponents summarize what would be done is still very satisfactory (for example in the excerpts \u201cget users to engage with the Pathform micropractice application (full working prototype); get users to do the Architex cognitive assessment; analyzing correlations between user preferences and patterns between the two apps\u201d; and also what is to be expected from this (\u201cenhanced well-being and enriched targeting and personalization of micropractices (i.e., Precision Awareness)\u201d) ; experimentation and adoption by web3 teams interested in adopting wellness tools for their DAO's and psychological tools for better team building and organizational dynamics\u201d, etc.) It is also important as the proponents already identify what would be the possible challenges to be met and outline some ways to mitigate them. Therefore, the only improvement that I think could be made was in relation to the integration of the same Cardano technologies, but otherwise the impact is very good.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The script of the proposal is ok, but it is not ideal because of the way the temporality is divided. Very large intervals are used here (initially month 1-3, then 3-6 and then skip to the last month of the year). It would be necessary for the time to be divided into shorter intervals, the ideal would be to know what would happen exactly in each month. The way this information is arranged, it is not possible to understand well what would happen and when. Talking now about the activities, I believe that the level of detail here could also be greater. For example, how would users who would test the micropractice application be called upon to embark on the project? In what way would they be engaged to participate, would it be necessary for these people to have a minimal understanding of blockchain? In the second part of the script, which reports what would be done after 6 months, all activities are more about technical tasks, technology development, as can be seen, for example, in the excerpts: \u201cI developed a repertoire of micropractices specific to the developmental paths for each cognitive style (from the Architex assessment); Added artificial intelligence/machine learning to deepen understanding and standardization of the relationship between micro-practices and cognitive styles.\u201d I believe that these more technical activities cannot be better broken down, as they are something internal to the developer team. But talking about the \u201cEvaluation, validation and initial optimization of the complete ML/AI model and production-level Architex-Pathform synergy available to all users\u201d: it would be beneficial if we knew more details about how these parts would play out. How would the dApp be released to the public? How would a marketing campaign be done? Moving on to the next topic of analysis, which is the budget part, I think here we should have a better breakdown and more information about each small part. I say this because the total amount is very high (234 thousand dollars), and each part is also expensive - for example in the development of biosensors - 5 thousand dollars are asked for 6 months of work, how many hours would the professional delegated for this task be working, what would be the hourly rate? What would the biosensor equipment be and why would it cost such a high $15,000? Why are cloud computing costs $12,000? How would the marketing campaign be done, why would it cost $4,000 a month (that's a pretty high amount for that, almost the asking amount for the developer's work). About the team, yes, a lot of confidence is transmitted in them, they provide a small summary about their professional performances, their linkedin profiles and some projects they have been involved in before. My only suggestion here would be about involvement with Cardano - I would like more to understand the team's experience with our blockchain.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding auditability, the proponents establish two metrics, which they call primary, for monitoring progress: \u201cnumber of micro-practices integrated into the Pathform app; and the number of direct relationships achieved between micropractices and cognitive styles\u201d. In addition, they also say that they will track the number of users of the application internally. In my view, these ways are a good principle of auditability, but they don't fully correspond to what we should be doing to monitor the progress of the project. Ideally, first, it would be better to define what would happen each month. Thus, we would have a better idea of \u200b\u200bthe path to be followed, of what needed to be traced, of the development process itself. It is necessary that we know what would be done in relation to the activities, so the first question is to better understand what would happen and when. After this became more explicit for us, the ideal would be for some member of the team - Gabriel, who seems to be the leader - to bring updates to the Cardano community on what was being done - both in terms of tasks and partial results, for For example, how many users would have participated in the survey, faster feedback on what their experience would have been like, and so on. The success scenario is well defined, through two scenarios: 1) \u201cParticipants will experience enhanced well-being embedded in everyday life and work, with personalized curation of micro-interventions suited to their cognitive style, targeted at cognitive-experimental functions\u201d specific underlyings\u201d; and also 2) \u201cTeams on Web3 will experience improved suggestions for organizing and teaming (eg DAO and sub-DAO) according to cognitive style\u201d. But how can we know if these successes were in fact achieved? How can this information reach the members of our ecosystem? And I also think that it lacked to be explored a little better here how Cardano itself would benefit, in what way this dApp would have brought explicit gains to our ecosystem - such as the increase of active members, NFTs minted in Cardano, Ada in circulation and etc. It would be necessary to understand how the suggested neural assessments would have contributed to a better organization of companies, how this came to reflect positively for Cardano and so on. Therefore, I think that auditability is the part of the proposal that needs a little more attention, the proposal is auditable, but as precisely and specifically as I would like, and it is also not so clear to us in what way it all would come to the attention of the Cardano community.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 8140, "q0": "Web3 is growing and being widely accepted all over the world. However, an important issue raised by the author in this proposal is that when individuals and groups join Web3, the right tools for people development, organization, and growth are missing.\nThe solution of this proposal is a creative idea to solve that problem. Use Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistance for cognitive assessment, skill mapping, and insights for teams. Currently, AI and Blockchain are proving to be quite a powerful combination, improving and upgrading everything in human life. This proposal will build on proposals previously funded by Catalyst. It is the Pathform application and the integration of Pathform with Architex (The author also detailed information about Pathform and Architex). This proposal will apply deep machine learning AI to analyze the relationships between cognitive assessment and well-being practices to make more targeted and personalized recommendations for individuals and groups. Besides the solution, the team has also foreseen some risks that may be encountered when implementing the project. Each risk has been calculated and there is a suitable solution to reduce that risk.\nI find that this proposal perfectly meets the \"Dapps, Products & Integrations\" challenge. It increases the adoption and utility of Cardano, benefiting Cardano and helping to attract more users. Not only that this proposal also brings value to people's lives. It is also meeting the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG): \"Ensure healthy lives and promote happiness for people of all ages\".", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This plan is implemented within 6 months, with a specific roadmap and timeline. The author also detailed the work items to be performed. But better, I think the team should break down the timeline, maybe by month (or week), so it will be easier for the community to track the progress. In addition to this proposal, the team has several other proposals also submitted in Fund 9. I had a chance to read the team's proposal \"Dynamic mind-brain NFT design\". As well to this proposal, the team had a work management plan and a reasonable time allocation to meet the workload of the proposals. They also have experience implementing proposals in previous Funds. The members are all qualified and experienced people suitable for the purpose of the proposal. Their identity is easily verified through the personal profile link the author provides.\nThe proposed budget accounts for 2.98% of the total Challenge budget. This amount has been broken down and allocated to expenses. All costs have been explained and calculated in detail. The basis of calculation is calculated according to the average cost of 1 month and the total number of months of implementation.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The author has outlined 2 main measurement indexes to monitor the project. That's the number of micro-practices integrated into the Pathform app and the number of direct relationships achieved between micro-practices and cognitive styles. However, to make it easier for the community to follow and show more transparency, my opinion is that the author should add a plan to report progress and update the latest information on social media channels project association.\nThe success of the project is determined when the participants will experience enhanced happiness in daily life and work. Teams in Web3 will experience enhanced recommendations for cognitive style grouping and organization, and tailored micro-interventions to complement and balance their styles. The success of the project is also increasing the number of transactions on Cardano due to AI service calls and the goal of 12 months of unique active users: 1000~3000.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2956", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9055, "q0": "The successful completion of this proposal  would have a huge positive impact on the goals of this challenge.

This AI-fueled, neuroscience-based,  behavioral evaluation tool  has the potential for a massive market audience on and off the blockchain. The details and specifics of this proposal as it regards the purpose, the goals, and the background information are incredible. The proposers have been working for a while to accomplish this project oh, and while this is continuation of past funds,  it is a different scope of work. The final product has the potential to be used in a broad number of situations and circumstances. The goal of creating an AI based tool for helping people discover their cognitive learning style could become something incredibly popular especially for those of us who work from home, online, in large collaborative teams. Decentralized autonomous organizations all over could benefit from this sort of testing and analysis as it would help them identify the skills, strengths, and weaknesses  to make the best use of their human resources.  I believe this proposal to have the maximum impact score due to how large and positive this tool could be used.", "q0r": 5, "q1": " This proposal appears to be feasible, but there could have been additional details added regarding the budget and the time frame. That is why I'm scoring this at a 4. This team is obviously well experienced and capable at delivering on projects.  They have experience, qualifications, skills and knowledge to carry out this proposal.  They have provided enough detail to assess this as feasible,  but not as much as other proposals. They have been very transparent throughout the proposal regarding responding and their progress on previously funded proposals. That includes this section as well as there is detail regarding whether or not the scope of work will be completed in the time frame or they will have too many tasks at the same time. The primary detail that's missing in my opinion is an estimation of how many hours need to be worked and what the hourly wage is regarding their budget. Had this detail been listed I could have given this a score of 5.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal has a clear goal and this team has a desire to be transparent. They have already been making regular reports to Catalyst regarding previous funds.  Having said this I would have preferred have they given some progress report metrics. their timeline did not have a clear roadmap in terms of how they were going to accomplish work within the three month periods listed. Likewise their auditability section did not have information regarding how they were going to maintain regular updates regarding their progress with their community. Other than that their metrics were clear and obvious regarding the desired output of this proposal.

Understanding what is going on in our brain in different situations, and tools to practice for positive improvement, enable us to use digital infrastructure in a more beneficial way. It also helps at designing more purposeful services.

Most of the money goes to R&D work. Considering the scope of the proposal, the six month timeline seems ambitious even though the project as a whole continues after that. This naturally requires more funding but the team has choices for it. The big picture roadmap is consistent and well under execution. \n\nRegarding the commercial side and adoption, Pathform has an opportunity to start integrating customers to the platform from Architex and other SingularityNet circles. Before that, within three months it should be possible to see some real user engagement with the service. \n\nArchitex has a strong history and track record in the neuro assessment field. Inside the SingularityNet ecosystem, Pathform certainly has access to AI talents needed to solve potential technical issues. The roles in this project and general information of the team members are well documented. I see the proposal highly feasible to get implemented successfully. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Quantitative measurable metrics are the number of micro-practices developed and the number of users on the platform. The former is a really important KPI because the AI backend utilizes the information to form connections with cognitive styles. Over the long term, the success can be observed in the enhanced well-being of the users.  \n\nThis proposal is part of a larger endeavour which is mostly in the R & D stage so there are not many visible advancements to the audience yet. Some kind of very short regular updates about the work that has been going on since the last update would be really nice. Pathform-project as a whole can also be followed on SingularityNet media channels. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3138", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 15109, "q0": "This proposal is perfectly written.  Perhaps a little *too* perfect?  I think you know what I'm getting at (wink wink, nudge nudge).  I, for one, welcome our new robot proposers and wish them much luck in this and future funds.\n\nSeriously, this proposal has taken what this Neurotools team did in Fund 7 and then in Fund 8 and has continued to hone the actual structure and delivery to the point of leaving no stone unturned.  The idea itself deserves mention, as well as how it ties into past and future work by the team:  this is a proposal to fund integration of an AI/ML framework into the existing and continuing Pathform-Architex integration.  Pathform is a curated mind and wellness prescription for \"mini-practices\" (things like meditation, focused mental effort, even types of physical exercise), while Architex is an empirical map of short and long term \"states\" of mind and wellness in an individual (via their unique testing protocol).  Pathform can create more optimized prescriptions for individuals if they have more precise information about their state, and Architex integration adds that capability.  However to get precise optimization that matches the precision of the data Architex provides, the complexity of the task requires better computation than human architecture can provide.  And that is where this proposal comes in, with an AI/ML architecture to strengthen and support the integration.\n\nThe users of this platform (and the targeted community for its initial development is the SingularityNET community with 32k+ members) will all be transacting on chain via the $AGIX token in order to use these tools, which means increased adoption of Cardano.  In addition, they are actively integrating the SingularityNET community to Catalyst via Swarm, so Catalyst is seeing participation benefits as well.\n\nAnd a final note to check out https://wssnow.org/social-movement-engine/ to get some idea about the ethical backdrop to the efforts of this community and projects that originate in it.  The strength of long-term Cardano values alignment should not be underestimated.  5 stars for impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team consists of a tight group of core developers (and here I refer to developers in a holistic sense, not just programmers) with a tremendous support network around them which includes Ben Goertzel, founder of SingularityNET.  They have delivered on the first proposal for this project, having completed the prototypes for Architex and Pathform, and are well underway for the 2nd proposal that integrates them together.  On their websites you can already see the results of this integration, and I have no doubts that adding the AI/ML component at this time is not only feasible but highly efficient.\n\nThe budget is high level and directly integrated to deliverables.  While most of these items are self explanatory ($15,000 for biosensing equipment), some of the largest would have benefited from being broken down into milestones, to both make the ask ($66,000 for Micro-intervention/-practice development in-app, a small proposal in its own right) more granular, but also to make the timeline (6 months overall for this budget) more accessible.  For example, the $66k item noted could have been presented as monthly milestones over the 6 months of the funding, whether that was a %complete metric, or specific deliverables for the architecture itself, such as backend/frontend or UI/UX iteration, etc.  In fairness, one of the big items is the hiring of the right AI/ML engineer, which they have properly set as a critical item to assure feasibility (top end wages, specific requirements), and much of the eventual milestones around the development will actually be best described by that person.\n\nBecause the overall project roadmap and budget seem reasonable for the tasks being undertaken, and because the team is ideally situated to take on the challenge, I feel this proposal has a solid foundation for feasibility.  But because the very high budget deserves extra-critical attention, and the lack of granularity in several line items affects both the budget and milestones, I am marking down feasibility by one star.  4 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPIs presented here are adequate to describe both the progress and success of the project, but it is worth noting that if they adopted the milestones practice suggested above, then each of the metrics they provided here would have had sub-metrics that may make it easier to meet the monthly reporting requirements.  (For example, the \"Number of Micropractices...\" item might be divided up into categories of micropractices, or stages of micropractice design and integration, and expressed on the monthly reports as stage at %completion, etc.)\n\nThe team is well known and available through the SingularityNET community and increasingly via their own projects as well.  They have hosted AfterTownHalls and Swarm meetings, and are always willing to discuss their projects and their progress.  The multiple communication modes presented here exceed both Fund7 and Fund8 presentations, a sign about the growth and adoption of the project.\n\nBecause the team is transparent and accessible, and because the provided KPIs and metrics are adequate for the deliverables that have been presented, I see no reason to mark this proposal down for auditability.  5 stars.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "AI-assisted cognitive assessment, skills mapping, and insight for teams.", "experience": "2 neuro PhD's, startup founders.
