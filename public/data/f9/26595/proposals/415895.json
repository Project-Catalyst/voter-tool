This tracking model is becoming illegal and sacrifices users' privacy.", "f6_no_assessments": 7, "f6_rating": 4.238095238095238, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1639, "q0": "The proposal is very interesting and is well aligned with the objectives of the challenge. The problem here is the fact that companies serve ads in which users are obliged to provide their information (cookies) to third parties, even if they do not want to, so that they have access to some type of content. According to the proponents, this practice would be becoming illegal, but even so, it is something quite common nowadays. With this, we observe that the proposed idea is precisely to solve this problem through a Dapp, from what I understand, called Profila. The idea would be what they called \u201czero-knowledge advertising\u201d, a solution that preserves users' privacy. This would be done through specific ads that would not place the data that is normally requested. The platform would be decentralized, using Cardano's blockchain for such information to circulate (at least I understood that; it would be beneficial if more explanation had been given regarding how this platform would use Cardano's technologies in practice). I believe that the platform would be very useful mainly for end consumers, as they would use several advantages, such as \u201cdecide when to see an ad (if any), which company can send such content (paid), if the company has any information about you (or if it is done in complete anonymity)\u201d and so on. Not enough, other advantages would be presented to the user, for example, they would receive an amount paid per ad they would watch (I found this idea very innovative. Would the amount be paid in Ada, would it be that to use Profila users would have to create digital wallets ?) The platform would also present advantages for companies, as mentioned by the proponents, such as: \u201cobtaining anonymous but accurate and perennial customer data directly from the customer connected to your brand, sending personalized offers/advertisements to the customer without data leakage, improving targeting, reducing ad fraud and adhering to regulations as the customer remains completely anonymous\u201d and so on. Overall, the idea is fantastic and sorely needed to break the cycle of bad publicity that has been going on lately. However, I really think it should have been clearer how our blockchain technologies would be used. Proponents claim that the proposal addresses the challenge since the ads would be linked to the blockchain for audit reasons such as fraud. Like this? Overall, the proposal meets the objectives of the challenge well, as is clear in the excerpt \u201cThe challenge is this: \"What dapps, products and integrations can be implemented to bring impactful use cases to the Cardano ecosystem that help drive more adoption \"? Profila's DeMar platform will provide businesses (small to large) around the world with a new privacy-preserving alternative to communicate and advertise to their customers.\" Due to this lack of clarity regarding the technologies of our ecosystem, I will give it 4 stars, if more explanations had been provided about this relationship, the note would be maximum.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The established roadmap is moderately satisfactory. Mainly in terms of understanding how long each activity would last, the past level of accuracy is good. One suggestion I can make regarding temporality would be to establish when the activities would start. In what period of the year would the first week of work be established, and the second? Another comment regarding this part of the proposal is: the activities could have been better explained, in more detail. For example, we would have 4 weeks (from week 2 to 6) that would be devoted to design research. This is very relevant for the development of the project as a whole, so it would be important to better understand how such a process would take place. Another example: week 10 to 36 would be development, integration and testing. We have 36 weeks here, many months, and few words describing what would happen. Again, it would be important to have more information. I believe that the way the script was presented to us, I have an ok knowledge of what would happen, but not such a detailed and solid understanding of how the process of developing this proposal would take place, in practice. So my suggestion is that each activity was better unraveled and also that we were sure about which period of the year (from 2022 and 2023, probably) this would all happen. In terms of financing, in my view, this part is very adequate, because we have detailed information on how the money would be spent. 174 thousand dollars are requested, a very high value. Well, speaking of the amount requested, it is divided into 4 parts that are also quite expensive, namely: Research and PRD development - USD 25,000 + Business analysis and UX/UI design work - USD 14,000 + 3. Project management and reporting overall - USD 15,000 + 4. Development and testing to delivery - USD 120,000. We also have some details about them, for example about the project management (30 days of project management and reporting @ 500 USD per day (2 weekly coordinator calls, monthly reporting, AMAs, townhall videos, closeout reports, medium articles, updates in weekly newsletters etc); the developers' work part is also very well scored. From the way this monetary information is passed, we can judge whether the value is fair or not, as we have information so that we have a solid understanding of how that money would be divided and spent. Finally, speaking as a team, from what I've observed the information is passed differently according to the team member. In some cases I fear an extensive and very detailed curriculum about the person; for others, we only know what role he is delegated in. Ideally, we would have the same level of detail for everyone. However, some team members have very rich detail about themselves, such as example in \u201cMICHIEL VAN ROEY, (Co-founder, Crypto-legal and decentralization expert and Chief Legal Officer); Belgian, 10 years XP as EU-qualified business lawyer in international law firms, an international organization (CERN), and a multinational company (Cisco), etc etc\u201d. With this we managed to have a good degree of trust in those involved. Overall the topic is good but we still have things to improve.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Speaking of progress monitoring, we have good information on that. Proponents are concerned with outlining various KPIs, as well as clarifying how this information would reach the Cardano community. There are really many different ways we could track the progress of the project. For example, the technical parts could be directly followed through updates to the Github repository. The general aspect, that is, details about the daily life of the professionals involved, would probably be presented during the participation in a call with the Catalyst coordinator; not being restricted to it, however, since newsletters would also be prepared fortnightly. In general, in relation to the audit of partial results, I believe that there are no observations to be made and what is said is enough for us to carry out a good follow-up of the phases - both in relation to the partial results and the tasks that will be developed, so that these can be achieved. Finally, in relation to the final success, this is defined with the creation of a \u201cviable prototype for replacing third-party cookies\u201d, as well defined by the proponents; this is further detailed in the excerpt \u201cPOC success is a targeted ad served from the Profila Ad Server, through a peer-to-peer mobile network to an anonymous person in the Profila app, with the ad server/brand and people Anonymous Ad engagement (impression and click) connected to blockchain for auditing (reducing chances of ad fraud). It is noticed that the proponents think about the final goals totally focused on the realization of the Dapp, or at least for the launch of its prototype (\"TRAFFICKING STRATEGY - Mid-to-high market contextually relevant open exchange inventory with reasonable balance between reach and quality + AUDIENCE STRATEGY - Start with contextual targeting and then retarget those that have given permission with run-of-exchanges, etc etc). However, it would be essential that they also look at how to perceive everyone in advances in relation to our blockchain. How would this project contribute to the popularization of Cardano? It would be important that some data such as: 1) if new digital wallets were created, linked to Profila users 2) if they would be receiving rewards in Ada 3) if these people somehow became more interested in the blockchain universe and started to explore other projects and aspects of our ecosystem\u2026 In short, if the objectives of the challenge would, in the end, be met. So I think auditability is pretty good in terms of progress, but fundamental issues aren't thought through for the final scenario analysis.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 8, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1457, "q0": "Very few projects have the potential to disrupt a a trillion dollar industry. Profila attempts to do this while simultaneously empowering individuals to own and monetize their own data. If successful, this bold project could result in a perfect marriage of Self Sovereign Identity and personal control of advertising exposure. Brilliantly constructed to adapt to the necessary regulatory threats to data mining, Profila seeks to subvert the dominant paradigm by engineering a mutually beneficial alternative. Participants of this program can choose between payments in fiat, Ada and Zeke (ZKA Token) as a reward for allowing advertisers to share only the content the end user agrees to. This could very well become one of the most creative and impactful uses of Atala Prism, and could also lead to mass adoption of the Cardano blockchain. Their revolutionary concept of Zero Knowledge Advertising (ZKA) shields individual identity from advertisers that individuals choose to receive ads from.

Any time you attempt to slay a behemoth, success in not assured, but for the task at hand, this team certainly has the qualifications. After successful completion of their first project, some of the deliverables were temporarily stalled, and the leadership of Profila stepped in to clear the obstacles. No other project I have reviewed has captivated my attention as has Profila, so after a very deep dive and extensive communication with multiple team members, it was made evident to me that the organization had the dexterity to pivot, and all the pieces were in place to assure success. The core team has demonstrated a strong commitment to progress as they have not been afraid to upgrade their team when necessary, despite having a very strong team to start with. IOG support at an institutional level combined with long term research partnerships with the Universities of Luzern and Madrid instill even greater confidence in this assessor that failure to execute will not be tolerated.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Having a perfect monthly reporting record with Project Catalyst never hurts, but attention to detail mandates that a quality assessor must leave no stone unturned. After a rigorous audit of Profila\u2019s KPIs, a few areas of concern were noted and the Profila team was contacted. Core leadership personally responded very quickly and provided a clear, comprehensive and transparent rationale that adequately addressed all concerns presented. For example, the promised deliverable of the newsletter was difficult for the assessor to locate and after an inquiry, all of this years newsletters were delivered directly via email. This current project specifically funds marketing, reporting and community engagement in the form of project management. Every effort is made to establish and maintain a high standard of KPI\u2019s, and in the event of any concerns, the project leadership is willing to go the extra mile to provide whatever information is requested.

The platform is live and the project has already received  funding from as far back as Fund6. A strength of the proposal is the fact that Profila has teamed up with a research team from the university of Madrid and with the Santander Big Data Institute. Having academic partners next to you when implementing a business solution can sometimes be a very smart idea, especially when the feasibility and I think even the mathematics behind the solution are not one hundred percent complete. \n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the proposal is complemented by a research paper and general presentation, and there are sufficient details for anyone to understand how the business model is designed to work and what kind of activities are necessary to finalize the project. The timeline is extensive and stretches over 54 weeks, out of which the first 10 would be preparatory / research focused, and week 36 would see a first mvp ready for testing.  The development part would be performed by Mlabs, while Steppechange, a Silicon Valley company, would assist with the zero knowledge solution. \n\nThe budget is reasonable given the complexity of the solution, but I would have liked to see at least some exploratory figures regarding the long term financial sustainability of the product. Will the team be able to roll it out successfully, what kind of pricing can such a solution entail, and how long until financial sustainability? \n\nIn any case, one aspect that I really appreciate is that Profila recognizes that this will be a long term effort and the following financing rounds will see additional requests from their side. This is a very good attitude, especially since they haven\u2019t, like other enterprises, crowded this funding round with several proposals which can only be implemented in succession, and not in parallel. \n\nProfila is already a known name within the community, and here we have again a very feasible proposal from their part, with a good team, great partnerships and a budget that makes sense.
