The revolutionary concepts proposed by DeMar and Zero Knowledge Advertising were so captivating that I have spent many hours investigating these proposals in great depth. The quality of the solutions offered to address the problems identified, combined with the formidable strength of the Profila team led me to assess with the highest scores possible.

The request for additional funding for these prior funded projects, is a direct result of undispersed funds denominated in Ada losing up to 75% of their original value. As these proposals met the selection criteria of the given challenges and were ultimately funded, project completion is perfectly aligned with the original impact statements and the strategic goals of the current funding round.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "At first I was critical of additional funding for a projects that were funded in the past rounds but not yet completed. Upon lengthy research and conversations with veteran members of Project Catalyst, the feasibility and necessity of additional funding is demonstrably warranted. Certainly the extremely well qualified team with over a collective century of experience indicates a high possibility of success, and recent additions to this team strengthen that argument. Well placed professional relationships with the University of Madrid, University of Luzern and IOG push the envelope of likely success to nearing certainty. By applying the standard of past funding feasibilities to the current proposal, the required threshold is well exceeded. Any concerns I did have were sufficiently addressed by the core leadership of Profila, and their accessibility greatly aided transparency.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Perhaps the most encouraging metric towards auditability of this project was the willingness of the projects founders to meet and discuss any aspect of the project and it\u2019s funding on very short notice.

For the few metrics that were in not sufficiently completed, new team members were brought in to achieve the desired results.

This proposal gives us a lot of hope for a good platform everyone should control usage. use their data and get benefits from it. The issue is clearly defined by the author by the fact that people today cannot control their personal information and its sharing by public companies. company or other interested entities this is a problem that needs to be solved and it fully meets the requirements of the users. The solution is defined by the ability to control what personal information is shared with consent-based data warehouse application partners (D) with integrated DID, which records which companies access your data, allowing you to license it and compensate you for your data and attention. As for someone having their credentials available through Atala's PRISM with blockchain's security features, companies and users will be able to manage how their identity is used on the web through multiple apps. ease of use. Data protection is a serious issue that is key for individuals and companies in different fields of activity this recommendation I think would be the best in finding solutions It meets current needs. The risk in this challenge is that some of the functionality that we need for the Decentralized Marketing (DeMar) platform to work in the future, is not ready yet. Currently, users provide vast amounts of data to companies but once submitted there is little control over how it is used and by whom. Limiting the data to only users can give them confidence that they won't be benefited from existing sales and marketing tactics. The integration of Atala Prism into the Profila app, a bridge between companies and citizens, is the goal of the proposal.

Instead, this is a proposal, with is nearly identical with the last one (funded), only a few sentences changed.

The implementation of Prism Atala into Profila - a bridge between companies and people is the goal of the proposal. ProfILa is one of the interesting proposals and has received funding from previous funds (starting at fund 5). The problems solved by Profila are inseparable from Cardano's mission. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a core value of our community, and the use of DIDS (Digital Identity Managed and Controlled by Individuals instead of Corporations or Governments) allows people to End users control who sees their information and exactly what information they will have access to. Successful implementation of this project will also greatly benefit the Cardano ecosystem as the adoption of Prism Atala will be greatly accelerated.

How many hours a day do they work, and what is the hourly wage?
