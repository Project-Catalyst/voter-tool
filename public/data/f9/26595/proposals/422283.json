In addition, the expansion of sales channels could include setting goals such as increasing the number of craftspeople and the number of crafts handled.\n\nAlthough this proposal overlaps with the evaluation in the other section, I believe that the essence of this proposal is not only to support the revival of traditional crafts on this occasion, but also to take a long-term perspective on the revival of traditional crafts and realize it through a fusion of old and new solutions in the form of the NFT market. \nTo this end, we feel that the proposal would be more attractive if it includes the establishment of an organizational structure for sustainable independent management as a goal setting.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2061", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "For Feasibility part.

The important things for our project is that the some traditional crafts partners certificated by Japanese Government  agree with our project. In japan usually, the crypto currencies are considered as only scam like tools. However, the Kittamu project and RANKET2 activity get the trustness of our Cardano project. And this is also important that the Cardano NFT can be distingushed from other miner chains. The traditional crafts NFT should be on the long lifed chain. So We want to ask to aepal long lifed chain characters of Cardano for the Crafts partners. The 1000 $ / month include such kind of the ngociation and sometimes it also use for the NFT mint help fee. Apparently to these traditonal crafts activity, we also appeal to Jpg store to make Crafts market. We also ask to our activity for Japanese PR compony or group. They are also related to widely NFT community and Crypt currencies. We already start some co-working with them, but it not related to our Crafts Project directly. However, after funded our project we will promote PR of our NFT project. Finally, we want to demonstrate the future plans after 6month. We are goint to appeal this system for other crafts componies who are not understand the Crypto , NFT and/or Cardano. Probably the Cardano NFT appeal by the profession from same field will work as effective method. We will scale up Crafts NFT market. Then craft NFT market work as a new way to sell their product and it wll be quite fascinable news for ordinaly media. If such kind of new market development will bu succeeded, we will develop automated storage system based on block chain technology to make standard for our market.

Likewise, I'm unsure that NFTs have the value to save/revive the Japanese crafts industry or re-inspire the declining Craftsman population.

However, traditional crafts are facing the danger of survival in Japan because the average age of skilled craftsman is around 50- 60 years old or older, and the group of new people who want to enter the skilled class is quite small, so it is the proposal to propose an idea that is to build an NFT market supported by the value of handicraft items. NFT sales will be used to buy back handicraft items and when NFT holders have a need to convert to real products, they can easily do that and their NFT will be burned. This idea would further encourage handicraftsmen to preserve the unique culture of Japan, and at the same time create more opportunities for young people to enter the craft. On the user side, investors will realize the value of NFTs backed by real-life valuable products, making the prices of NFTs impervious to the price of cryptocurrencies. That will attract more users to this product. Make the NFT exchange active on the network, increasing the number of transactions as well as the transaction volume on the Cardano network.
