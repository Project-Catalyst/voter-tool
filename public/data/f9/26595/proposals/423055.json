I do believe that there is some value in me still assessing this proposal, because it might provide an indication of how understandable this project is to the general voter. \n\u2028The idea of combating scams, corruption and non-transparency (and making it understandable) is definitely targeting a problem within the ecosystem, with a sensible proposed solution. If done correctly, it has the possibility of being a go-to-place for both new participants of Cardano, and old. \u2028\u2028I would have liked to see some discussions clarifying the potential risks connected to the development of this project. The proposer explains why and what they want to achieve, but (in my opinion as a PA), it would be nice to see more information on how. For example, the proposer states that it will be easy to verify if a person is a non-scammer, and that a wallet is created in order to follow other users. (Potentially stupid) Question: What will stop a scammer from creating its own ecosystem of fake accounts, connect the wallet and have a decently looking profile? Does this project plan to make use of DiDs, etc? Explanations like this would further strengthen the clarity of the project (at least for the average user). \n\nThe KPIs seem to be very ambitious, targeting 100 000 wallets registered at the end of the year. I\u2019m wondering if there are smaller steps on the way that could represent the proposals success? And will the future of the project after release only focus on outreach and management of the platform? What potential improvements could be made in the future? How will the project be marketed in order to reach stated 100k wallet users?\n\u2028Overall, I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "We are provided with a roadmap with milestones divided into 4 phases (Following/outreach, translation, Sync, Discovery), the complete project estimated to be ready for delivery after 3-4 months. I have no doubts that the team will be able to release the product within the set timeframe, especially since the work was started before this proposal was submitted. Since the project is already underway, it would have been nice to see an update of the progress included in this proposal, but more on that under \u2018auditability\u2019. Here, it would be nice to have some more information on each phase. What does \u2018discovery \u2019mean, and what is the reason for it having 280 estimated working hours in comparison to the \u2019sync\u2019-phase? Will the whole team be working on all of the areas, or will they be divided between responsibilities? \n\nThe budget is divided between the 4 phases from the roadmap, and includes an estimation on working hours for each responsibility area and a calculation for the estimated costs. The hourly rate is estimated at 60/hour, which seems reasonable in comparison to other projects.  \n\nWe are provided with official links to two projects (only one of the websites working), and a GitHub link, and LinkedIn-profiles to the lead proposer, and team members of the two partnering companies. Further details on who will do what part of development could beneficially be included in the proposal. \nThe proposer has 2 other projects submitted in Fund 9, so it would be nice to have seen a discussion on the potential workload management that would be needed if all 3 proposals were to be funded. \n\u2028Due to the reasons listed above, I neither agree nor disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team aims to communicate with the participants via their Discord server, a widely used platform by many. I love the fact that the proposer intends to involve the community by letting them vote on platform design, features etc. Weekly updates are also always appreciated. I would suggest to add links to the official website and social media channels (if any) that are solely linked to this particular project, this way the community doesn\u2019t have to navigate between the other projects created by the same team (it might be a bit confusing). \n\nAs mentioned previously, the KPI-factor of reaching 100 000 users at the end of the year is (from my experience as a recurring PA since Fund 6) might be a bit too ambitious. If I were to trust that information, I would have liked to see a lot more details that focus on outreach and communicating with participants from the Cardano ecosystem. Also, how far has the project progressed between start of development, and submission of this proposal? And if that information was shared, where was it shared?\n\nAs mentioned under feasibility, the few KPIs designed to measure the success of this proposal is more designed to the completion of the project, and since the outreach plays such a big part I would see more details on that reflected in the measurements of success (apart from planning to reach 100k wallets before EoY). Maybe each phase could feature its own KPIs, so that the community could follow development even more easily? \u2028\u2028Conclusively, I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2504", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 4255, "q0": "The cryptocurrency market has experienced tremendous growth in recent years.\nHowever, this growth has attracted numerous scammers, who take advantage of the low level of regulation and limited technical knowledge of the newcomers. In particular, the eUTXO model (used by Cardano) is not easy to understand for a last-minute arrival, I myself was struggling to read the blockchain at first. Many times it is precisely the latest arrivals to be scammed which leads them to move away from the blockchain space, perhaps talking about it to friends as an environment of scammers.\nThe purpose of the proposal is to create an application that allows you to intuitively and graphically show the history of the transitions of an address / project or NFT, (translated into) activities, network and follow-up.\nThe user connects his decentralized wallet to follow others. This will help users avoid scams and increase the adoption and growth of the Cardano blockchain as it will be much easier to navigate based on social discovery.\nIn this sense, I find that it would be really interesting if you evaluated a copytrading mechanism on the model of Etoro for the future.\nI agree that the proposal falls into the category of the challenge, being able to make an impact use case for the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind the Internet companies Ratecard and WebFeedback will work on this project, led by founder and developer Jeroen Sakkers whose linkedin (victormundi) references are signed and who followed the Plutus Pioneer program.

The development plan has four defined phases and a lead time of 3-4 months is provided for the realization of the platform, which seems more than reasonable considering the size of the team and the total number of hours. The hours of work for each phase are clearly delineated as well as the hourly cost ($ 60 per hour) which is in line with what is required by other proposals financed in the previous funds.

This acts as a crypto graph and user will need to connect his/her wallet before following others. The solution wants to prevent ones from being a victim of rug pulls and scams. The proposer doesn't really explain technically how this could be done although the solution will be very beneficial for the users to be able to tell the project apart if they are real VS. rugpull. Also one wallet can generate many addresses in an instant. How could it be possible to keep tracking if the rug pull project also changes their addresses or create multiple addresses to prey the users. The proposer will have to explain more technically and provide answers to these questions for the proposal to effectively address the Dapps, products and integration challenge. Also the apeproof.io link doesn't work and the link might contain more information on the proposal but it can't be sure.

The metric for this project is 100,000 registered wallets and following at least 10 addresses per account. The proposal still needs to address more on technical implementation, roadmap and milestone.
