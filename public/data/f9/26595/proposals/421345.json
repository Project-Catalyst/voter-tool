To solve the above problem, this proposal was born to build an information platform based on Discord called CEVI, with a core group of members initially being software developers, project managers, and translators... have in-depth knowledge of the Cardano blockchain. In the beginning, the core team will fill the learning platform to monetize the Cardano ecosystem with information, documentation, and knowledge about Cardano, the Catalyst fund. The platform attracts new members, educating them with the above in-depth knowledge. After a while, the members all understand the Cardano ecosystem. In addition, they also built an English club, attracting members with good foreign language skills to support developers to develop dApps on the Cardano blockchain and support Proposers and PAs to participate in Catalyst. Members will earn additional bonuses by using their knowledge and enthusiasm to contribute content to the platform. To have a high income, members need to continuously learn to improve their knowledge and contribute that knowledge to the foundation to serve the community. The learning, sharing, and monetization loop will create a community with in-depth knowledge and insight into the Cardano ecosystem. In addition, this proposal can expand service and attract users from many markets with translated content. From the way of developing and engaging the community above, I consider this proposal to have a strong impact on the development of the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponent has built a Discord channel with many active members discussing and sharing the latest knowledge and news about Cardano daily. This proposal is aimed at helping members earn rewards based on contributing quality content to the platform and educating members on how to monetize the Cardano ecosystem. Currently, this Discord channel is in phase 1 of the proposal. This is the stage where the channel collects, synthesizes, and regularly updates information and knowledge about projects in the Cardano ecosystem. Along with that, training on blockchain knowledge and Cardano's programming knowledge in Plutus language for a set of members is also being worked on. The core members of the team that built this proposal have completed KYC and publicized the information in their Discord channel, each with expertise relevant to the assignment. Some members of the proposed team have been members or project owners funded in previous funds, which proves that they have the practical experience to contribute to the completion of this project. Therefore, I appreciate the team capacity of this proposal. This proposal applies for a fund of $28650, divided into 3 phases in 9 months; the budget of each stage is also divided by each job, which is completely reasonable. Each stage has a different workload and importance, so phase 1 has a budget of $ 12850, accounting for the highest proportion, and is broken down into the parts of building the initial foundation, Bot, knowledge training, Article synthesis, marketing helps the manager of the proposed group to determine the budget to achieve the set goal. Similarly, the budgets for phase 2 and phase 3 are also broken down for each item, and this will help determine with the requested budget and nine months of construction time, this proposal will be successful. As stated by the target. When the proposal is completed and put into stable operation with two Vietnamese and Japanese-speaking communities. The proposal team also has a plan to grow, bringing the platform to many other non-English speaking communities, so it is normal for this proposal to appear in Catalyst in subsequent funding rounds; this is a plan well built. However, the proposal is excellent, and there are still certain risks; the proponent has also identified three risks and solutions. I see this as a plus for foresight for this proposal to be completed.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal provides a 9-month roadmap for completion, which is a feasible goal with the existing staff. The proponent also has a plan for each month, each phase with the number of jobs and KPIs giving specific numbers, based on which the community can track the progress and which stage of the project has been completed. Completed in the most intuitive way. The KPI measuring the success of this proposal upon completion is also specific numbers such as 60 documents in Vietnamese, 60 documents in English, 60 documents in Japanese about the Cardano ecosystem, and more than 500 newcomers to the CEVI community\u2026 above are the stats that anyone can check live on CEVI's Discord channel: https://discord.gg/SBaz2kUe.

The idea here is to build a win-win model around providing value to students when participating in online learning on the platform. Students when they register to study and then contribute to the platform with quality articles or contribute translations to the content of the articles. When completing the above tasks, students will receive a number of bonus points, which will be used to upgrade members or buy higher courses. Overall, this is a model that benefits both sides: developers and students. The platform will help the knowledge exchange to take place regularly and contribute to adding value to Cardano. Attract more new users to the platform.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provides us with an implementation roadmap with full information and at what timelines. Regarding budget breakdown, I think that's quite reasonable. For example, at the cost of translation, 0.02 USD/word is reasonable. The training cost is 200 USD/session, but I would like to suggest that you can be more specific about the number of hours for a session. Regarding the challenges and risks involved in the project implementation, the proposer also clearly indicated the problems that will be encountered and prepared measures to respond.

The first aspect of information verification, I suggest that the proposer should more specific examples of individual members' profiles (such as Facebook, Linkedin, Telegram) The purpose is to increase the credibility and transparency of the project. Second, it can be quantified Numbers to measure the success of the project such as:\n- Acquired 10 developers and investors with knowledge of the Cardano blockchain (for example)\n- Library resources contributed from students reaching about #50 articles, translations (# can be replaced with another number)\n- #referrals from former students\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2771", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7800, "q0": "The proposal provides a platform for the community to learn from Cardano and make money from it.

The proposal addresses the problem of the lack of places to gather information about Cardano, especially for those who are not fluent in the English language. They have come up with a relatively convincing solution that is to create a platform to share information, everyone joins it to learn and make money together. The operating mechanism of the platform has been given clearly and with great enthusiasm. This is a good product, pushing users to learn more deeply about the Cardano ecosystem, and helping Cardano products reach wider and deeper to users. The scale of the impact of this project is huge, not only on the current user community and projects on the Cardano platform, but also helps to attract new people to Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project has established a full personnel apparatus, including those who are capable and experienced in implementation. I watched the project's discord channel, it's really impressive. The project has come a long way by building many high-quality channels, especially channels related to learning and sharing information. In terms of communication, the project has built a few relatively reputable channels to attract the community such as Facebook and Youtube. The project asks for a fund of nearly 30,000 USD, an amount of money in my opinion is enough for you to continue to develop the project successfully.

The given plan has indicated how to come up with the amount of costs for each phase and also the total number for the whole expenditures that are included in each part of the cost. Moreover, I think those mentioned costs here are quite reasonable and acceptable such as the translation cost that counts per word is only $0.02 so it means for 1000 words there will be only $20. In other words, there would be about 1.5 pages translated with the cost around 20$, and obviously, it is not an expensive amount. On the other hand, I am quite impressed by the experience of each member in the team. By the way, the ability of this team is appreciated by my recognition as they are experts in each divided team. For example, members in project management with experience working on blockchain, or the managing programming team who are expert in using programming languages like C/C++, JavaScript, and crypto. Also, they have an English translation team who are experts in the English language as well and Mr. Lam Nguyen used to be community advisor since Catalyst Fund 8. Furthermore, the Japanese translation team is also mentioned here with such a tremendous profile. The information provided is really impressive.  However, it would be more perfect if we have the attached profile link like Telegram, twitter, or Linkedin maybe as the attached link with their profile will increase the reliability and the confirmation about the teammates\u2019 identification.

For example, 70% of users participating in the survey are satisfied with the platform or 60 Cardano Ecosystem documents in each language (Vietnamese, English, and Japanese). This is not a large number for a 9-month duration, so I appreciate the successful proportion of the proposal and expect to see their later products especially after 9 months.
