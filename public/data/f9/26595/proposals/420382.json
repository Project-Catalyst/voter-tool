Currently HAZELnet helps with the verifying wallets and NFTs that members hold or stake pools they are delegated to so that roles can be automatically applied to them in Discord. This verification also helps with securing the Discord channels. This proposal looks to provides administrative users a way to manage the Discord functionality on the website. This feature helps for users who want to do this on a mobile application due to the difficult of using the slash commands on Discord mobile. The team also want to introduce Twitter functionality into the application and finally extend the audience that user this application. There is already evidence that this application is producing impact for the ecosystem by providing ways for communities to use existing social media tools and integrate them into the utility of Cardano. This proposal helps to extend the functionality available and based on existing demand makes it likely this could create a high impact for the ecosystem. The proposer outlines the risks of the proposal of being to safely authenticate users from Twitter and Discord, effectively engaging with additional communities and projects and the speed of development. Each of these risks has a section that addresses the concern and how they intend to tackle it. Overall it looks likely that the continuation of this project could produce a high impact for the ecosystem due to the existing and growing demand for tools such as this that make it easier to utilise Cardano native assets and on-chain data.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Project roadmap is broken into three phases. The first looks at hiring developers to help with the process which has the backup of the proposer doing this work as they are also a developer, they also will build in wallet signing into the website. The second phase looks to onboard any staff and work on the website administrative interface and plan the project outreach and onboarding. The final phase will do the Twitter account integration and do project outreach. The plan with rough time estimates provides sufficient depth to understand how this project will be implemented. The budget is broken down into infrastructure costs and labour costs with the number of months and monthly rate. For the team details the proposer provides their own professional link and mentions the rest will be hired. The website already shows that the proposer is able to handle the implementation and execution of this proposal in the event they struggle to find a developer to support the development. Due to the evidence provided of existing working implementation and the plan outlined it looks very likely that this proposal is feasible.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposers outline a number of metrics in which they intend to track the final result of the proposal mentioning active projects, number of users who have atleast one verified wallet or connected via the website and number of accounts signed up by each social media integration. These metrics will be easy to measure as they mention. Another part they could have added is where their progress updates will be posted such as videos, AMAs etc so people could follow along. On their website they do have a change log which helps with the community verifying this. Being explicit on what will be open source could have also been added that would be good for the community to know and verify as the project progresses. In terms of success they are looking to sign up atleast four new projects to start using the service with some testimonials. This goal seems more than achievable - if anything slightly conservative! A survey will also be sent out regarding sentiment from the community to get more feedback after the proposal is executed which will be published to the community. Overall it is easy to audit the existing work that is happening for this project with both the website change log and the Github repository available, the metrics seem sensible and tracking the success of the outcomes will also provide useful information to the project itself and wider community.

The solution is that HAZELnet is an existing tool in the Cardano Ecosystem. It allows projects to verify the wallets of their community members and the blockchain information associated with it and does not reveal any blockchain-related information to Discord administrators and moderators, keeping users' personal information to be kept confidential unless explicitly shared. This proposal is perfectly suited to the challenge because it solves the problems of connecting existing technology to Cardano and the new ecosystem built on it. By enabling better user experience and faster entry, new projects entering the ecosystem will be able to focus on their core competencies (such as building Defi solutions, utilities, or technology). the technique of the NFT project...)\nThe proposal listed a few challenges and risks that can be encountered in the process and the great thing is that there are all solutions to face those risky challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In terms of planning, this project is divided into 3 phases, each with identifiable timelines. We know how long the project will take and what will happen during that time, so our visualization of the process is pretty solid. The $67,425 required budget is extremely detailed, well-defined numbers let the community know what the money will be used for. And finally, about the project team, this part is also very well described. We were provided with the LinkedIn link of the lead developer on this project and also understand his role in the project. In addition, the proposal also announced that hiring a part-time social media and community manager and hiring a Frontend Developer could speed up our progress on the site. It can be seen that the proposal has provided enough information for us to evaluate the feasibility of this project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability to audit this proposal is excellent. Because of the feasibility of building a work schedule, we were able to orient ourselves well on what to expect so we could track the development process. develop. The proposal also shows us how the community can gauge a project's progress. Some well-defined KPIs include:\n-Number of active projects leveraging the Discord bot\n-Number of users with at least one verified wallet\n-Number of users who connected their wallet via the website\n-Number of accounts registered via the website (Twitter OAuth or Discord OAuth or both)\nAbout the successful presentation of the project.

By seamlessly integrating wallets, communication (Twitter or Discord) and signing (OAuth), this could potentially even work for budding DAOs or collabs more serious in nature, where on-chain information might be critical but has to remain private. The proposer provides as possible beneficiaries of the extended features: Stakepools, NFT projects, DeFi technology, DAOs and hybrids. I agree.\n\nThis proposal could in my opinion easily have resided in the Cardano Loves DAOs or Developer Ecosystem categories, but is a very good fit for the Dapps, Products & Integrations challenge description as well. First of all, almost any idea, product or integration are invited to pitch in this category. \"Social media\", feedback system and projects giving new tools to the community are explicitly directions for the challenge setting, so this proposal is highly suitable. It is also potentially highly impactful in moving on from a world of disparate old-school tools like Google forms, Zoom proof-of-life, IdeaScale kudos and mini transfers to \"test\" funded proposer addresses to a future where more and more important interaction happens on the blockchain and we are otherwise tool-agnostic. In summary, this project is asking for additional funds to make an existing tool better and future proof while giving Catalyst projects a unique tool to engage with their communities.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The main proposer has provided his Github profile, HAZELnet repository and website and showcases an impressive body of work and relevant experience with API integration, wallet signing and Cardano. He has completed the Plutus Pioneers program and has experience as a Stake Pool Operator. Partnerships with well-known Cardano ecosystem projects exist. This all gives me a lot of confidence about the ability to finish the proposal.\n\nThe only skills that need to be contracted externally are frontend development, website and social media management, which as far as I know have no skills shortage and should be the easiest part of the project. The Twitter API and OAuth integration could provide one possible hurdle for the on-time delivery, but I consider this risk as very low given the broad, relevant experience of the proposer with related integrations.\n\nThe business plan is clear and the additional features compared to the existing HAZELnet features and roadmap clear-cut. The budget is broken down into items and a timeline is presented separately that matches the budget and milestones.

Integration of the Hazelbot has already been seen throughout the Cardano based project & community discords, though having Twitter profiles being able to link through the website proposed in a secure and easy to authenticate fashion, would eliminate many if not all bad actors within project's servers giving them an additional layer of security. This is a much needed solution to the countless scams that plague the crypto communities at large, and bringing this type of leveraged security to the Cardano blockchain will be a testament to the future of it's user base and allow for more confident building from new & veteran users alike. Having been a member of discord for over a decade, it can be overwhelming for newer users by not understanding how clever some scammers have gotten. Utilizing Hazelnet.io and it's discord verification services, this could be a brilliant solution to solving some major issues individuals, groups, sub communities and project administrators within the Cardano ecosystem faces on a daily basis.

He gave fair warnings to viewers and investors when noticing problems which needed solving. As his security concerns towards Cardano communities continued to grow, most noticeably within NFT Communities, he went ahead and created a solution with the development of the Hazelbot (https://www.hazelnet.io) for discord administrators, which I personally saw gain great traction within the last 4-6 months (right around the time of his last posted video*). It has been a welcoming tool by Project managers who found that CNFTbot* was not up to the Cardano standard of service. The proposer also shared his Linkedin page (https://www.linkedin.com/in/nils-peuser-437784a/) where you can see his 300+ connections and credentials. Other members which may be needed for front and backend development will undergo a hiring process by Nils in phase one of the proposal, along with a potential community and social media manager to retain a Twitter/Discord presence, link to that candidate here (https://twitter.com/kdevpls).

Observing the user base of the Hazelbot and it's adoption from new projects after implementation of the solution proposed, will be a good indicator of early success. The use of surveys and overall general feedback from the community and projects who sign up, will help gauge what ideas may arise for any other improvements. The results being publicly available to Cardano & Catalyst communities for further transparency. Challenges along the way mentioned by the proposer, in regards to finding candidates for hire is the only concern that a delay to the roadmap may occur.
