This reputation system has the features: open-source, community-driven, decentralized, immutable, transparent, highly scalable, marketplace-independent, and secure. In the proposal, the Pay&Rate reputation system includes four components: Pay&Rate smart contracts, Governance smart contracts, Governance DAO, Governance treasure. These components are interconnected: the creation and update of reputation smart contracts is the task of governance smart contracts; Pay&Rate contract is created by interacting with a governance smart contract via the Governance DAO\u2019s website;  the governance DAO controlls and operates the governance smart contract, and manages the governance treasury. The functions of the Pay&Rate reputation system in general or of the Pay&Rate smart contract in particular is supporting payments and maintains the ratings, reviews, and reputation score regarding sellers with respect to a specific service or product that they sells. At once, with the reputation smart contract, the buyers can also retrieve the latest reputation score of the seller with respect to the service or product, then they will provide a new rating and review to the reputation smart contract using the rating token. \nThrough the Cardano smart contract and the eUTxO model, the proposer gives the Pay&Rate reputation system for marketplaces in Cardano eco-system, with the outstanding features when compared with the reputation systems commonly seen in web 2.0 online marketplaces. The features as \u201copen-source, community-driven, decentralized, immutable, transparent, highly scalable, marketplace-independent, and secure\u201d build users\u2019 trust in the Pay&Rate reputation system, but haven\u2019t clearly shown their results able to affect how the KPI/Key metrics of the challenge. \nThrough the proposal, the major risk which the project will be meet is a lack of adoption from marketplaces. The proposer has already advanced how to mitigate by incorporating an incentive mechanism into the governance DAO tokenomics that incentivizes marketplaces in the Cardano eco-system to adopt the Pay&Rate reputation system. With this solution and the Pay&Rate reputation system outstanding features, the proposal entirely aligns with the challenge\u2019s objectives.\n\"", "q0r": 4, "q1": "\"The information is exposed above that the Pay&Rate reputation system is built with four interconnected components: Pay&Rate smart contracts, Governance smart contracts, Governance DAO, Governance treasure.

Futhermore, the proposal have\u2019t get a detailed plan and a clear roadmap with specific milestones for developing these components, as well as the explanations for the technical aspects to implement the plan. \nThe budget breakdown for the project in phase 1 is too general, there is no division in each payment item. With this undetailed budget breakdown and a spare timeline, the plan given by the team isn\u2019t enough to achieve the desired targets. In my opinion, the proposer should clearly bullet the expenses pay for what items, as salary, equipment, marketing,\u2026., and these expenses must be suitable for the rewritten detailed plan for developing every component.\nFor the team members, people who work on the phase 1 of project, author didn\u2019t identify the relevant information, as name, position, skill, experience,\u2026 None of the team is working on any other proposals from current or previous Funds, even we didn\u2019t have any evidence of their ability to carry out the activities mentioned in the proposal.\n\"", "q1r": 1, "q2": "\"Through the proposal, the writer will track the progress on Phase 1 of the project by measuring the level of progress in percentile on the tasks: development and test of Pay&Rate smart contract and of its corresponding off-chain code, of governance smart contract and of its corresponding off-chain code, development and test of the website and deployment of it. At once, they also measure the level of adoption by the clear quantitative indicators as the number of marketplaces adopting the Pay&Rate reputation system, the number of reputation smart contracts created, and the average number of ratings and reviews reported to reputation smart contracts. However, they haven\u2019t shown how they will measure these progresses, and by what manners.\nThe success of the project is shown after the project has completed in both phases: in phase 1, a working website is available so that sellers can create and initialize Pay&Rate smart contracts by using the governance smart contract, and working Pay&Rate smart contracts are running on Cardano; and in phase 2, a well-designed governance DAO tokenomics integrate the incentive mechanism, a working governance treasure and a working governance DAO are running on Cardano, a working ballet-box stuffing attack detection system and a open collaboration platform. The project also succeeds based on the clear quantitative indicators that the largest successes are shown at least 1 marketplace adopting this Pay&Rate reputation system within 3 months after the completion of Phase 1, and the expenditure to operate the governance DAO and its revenue breaking even 3 years after completion of Phase 2 and subsequently becoming self-sustainable in finance.   \nThe team is really serious and clear about their goals, the results expose sufficent for indicators, milestones, Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), Key Performance Indicator (KPI),\u2026..

Basically any track record may be used to build up a reputation if there are tools available for it. I find experimenting and developing practical reputation tools very important. The proposal defines a reputation system infrastructure which is structured to different elements. This approach gives it a wide applicability to many different services. Each type of action which can be rated has its own smart contract governed by a governance smart contract governed by the governance DAO which' operations again are funded by the governance treasury. When implemented, the utility of integrable DAO tools increases which is well aligned with the challenge. \n\nAll kinds of reputation systems can be expected to grow and evolve rapidly alongside self-sovereign identities. Reputation is primarily an identity linked asset. By combining the purchase (transferable value) and reputation rating (identity linked value), this proposal integrates these two different information systems. That again addresses the challenge perfectly. \n\nThe DAO element described in this proposal enables the system to work dynamically and keep updating itself when new solutions become possible as well as increases its objective resiliency over the long term. The risk of becoming stagnant or corrupted decreases. If successful, this project provides additional incentives to use applications and marketplaces embracing this solution and thus bring them new customers and grow the ecosystem.

I see the risk that there is not enough interest (and thus funding) in this second phase. However, it is not required for a successful implementation of the proposal in the extent as it is described in the phase 1. \n\nThere are directive time estimates for implementation available.

The use case for an e-commerce focused reputation system definitely has the potential to positively impact our ecosystem and industry. A functioning reputation system creates trust and can improve the quality in the e-commerce sector in terms of ratings in particular through broad acceptance. This is especially important for a decentralized system.  The team has elaborated the proposal well and derives the solution approach well.

However, since the buyers/sellers are anonymous, there are risks of scammers. I agree with the idea that Cardano needs a decentralized reputation system for e-marketplaces. \nPay&Rate offered this solution. The proposers described in-depth about the Pay&Rate system and how does it work. The Pay&Rate system includes four main components: Pay&Rate smart contracts (support payments & maintain ratings), Governance smart contracts (update smart contracts), Governance DAO (operation system), Governance treasure (place to keep the asset). Each component played a vital role in the Pay&Rate system. \nIn terms of the risk, I agree with the proposers, that there is a lack of adoption of this system into the marketplace. I think the Cardano system should advocate the use of this system (if the platform is successful) since this is a win-win situation. The Cardano system will be beneficial by a boost of users to join the ecosystem, since the e-marketplaces with blockchain-based attract great interest nowadays.

Overall, the information offered in this section is well-prepared and explained thoroughly. The general mechanism of Pay&Rate is to build a reputation system so that sellers can reach more customers through increasing their credibility and buyers can make a worthy purchase among different choices. The application is based on 4 components, which are: Pay&Rate smart contracts, Governance smart contracts, Governance DAO and Governance treasure. These 4 components interact with each other to automatically upgrade the system and limit as many flaws and bugs as possible. I feel like the intention of the developing team is to reduce as much humans\u2019 intervention as possible in order to create a community-driven and transparent marketplace environment, and I totally agree with it. One outstanding feature that the application contains, which impressed me, is that the reputation smart contracts are made for each product and service that a seller provides. Not only does this help customers avoid unrelated ratings and consume carefully but also it shows sellers what product or service needs to be improved. Other features being mentioned are open-source, decentralization, immutability, high scalability, marketplace independence and security. All of these resulted from an effective application of block-chain technology, which makes the project special and creates a big competitive advantage. I believe this proposal is well-aligned with the challenge settings, potentially widens the Cardano ecosystem and attracts more users to Cardano. One and only minus point, in my opinion, is that the risk stated by the writer was not mitigated properly.

However, I suggest adding more specific dates or timeline for each milestone to clarify on when the first steps are actualized. Besides, I think the budget breakdown is still too general. My suggestion is that the developing team should explain more about some concerned problems such as: what programming languages would be used, what the website would look like and what categories are contained in it,... Answering these questions would be very helpful to evaluate the amount of money requested. Finally, the proposer mentioned a team of 2 for developing and deploying the first phase, though, I do not think it is convincing enough.
