This would increase the number of users on Cardano, from what I understood the transactions would take place as smart contracts, making it much easier for companies, since the bureaucracy would be greatly simplified. However, I found the tool's explanation a bit confusing. At certain points, it is implied that the tool can be used in both Web 2 and Web 3 (at least I understand that). It is not so clear how the electronic identity would be created and the data stored. What kind of data are we referring to? Could clients attach some sort of r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to their corporate accounts? I thought it was positive how the proponent makes it very clear what the benefits would be for customers and companies, and especially the effects of this platform for the Cardano ecosystem; but some points here could have been made clearer, more fully explained. How would Atala Prism DIDs be involved in the project? Could it be that in order to make purchases and transactions, customers would necessarily need digital wallets from Cardano? What transactions would take place in Ada? A very important point that I think should be addressed here would be how to educate people about the functioning of the mentioned technologies. For example, let's say that a legal professional is looking for a job and wants to use this Dapp, but doesn't know much about blockchain, doesn't know how to create an electronic identity, etc. Would the interface be simple and ergonomic for him to perform these actions, would there be some kind of tutorial explaining the first steps? In general, my opinion about the impact of the proposal is that yes, this idea is quite relevant and interesting, however the explanations that make up the proposal still leave some doubts about the functioning of Dapp, even though the proposer has dictated a \u201c path\u201d that would be followed by a client, and citing an example, I still had some very pertinent questions to be answered. A very positive point in the proposal is that the proposer is quite assertive when it comes to marketing. He already has an idea of \u200b\u200bseveral places where he intends to promote his Dapp, being aware of the importance of this facet of his project. He is also quite aware of possible challenges, already outlining ways to overcome them. In summary, I liked the idea, I think it is a very practical way to bring new members to the Cardano ecosystem, since the lack of opportunities and job vacancies is a reality for a large part of the population; but it would be necessary for everything to be explained very clearly, so that we could have a full understanding of the project to be done.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Regarding the feasibility of the project, we have some issues to be improved here. Starting with the script, the author's temporal and task division is quite abstract. It divides the temporality very sparsely into quarters, delegating some tasks that would be done in each of these. However, they are a bit abstract. Ideally, he would have divided the time into smaller intervals, and these were more detailed. For example, in the first quarter we have the activity of founding the company. Certainly, a series of measures must be taken for this to occur, it is a complex activity and full of facets. So I believe it should have been better detailed. Another example would be the last quarter of this year, the self states that it will do \u201cproject outline, break the project into viable tasks\u201d. I think it would be more appropriate if this division had already been made and presented in the details of the proposal. The impression I have is that the proponent explains very richly what would be done, but not how, as the script part could be better explained. When we go to the budget division, a very high amount is requested, most of it being delegated to the construction of the company (32 thousand dollars). This value would need to be more detailed, explained, divided into smaller parts that were adequately justified. Within the construction of the company, small actions would be made and each of them would cost a portion, which added together would give this total amount. How much would they cost, and what parts would those be? It is also calculated a monthly value of 777 dollars for 1 person, but certainly more professionals would have to be added to the project, so how would the payment of those who would arrive? And how many hours a week would that person work, so that we could understand the value of their work hour? Overall, the financial part of the project still seems quite uncertain, which is worrying, especially given the scale of complexity of this project. Talking about the team, finally, we only have the proponent as a defined member of the team, he claims to have developed the idea but he cannot be responsible for the technical part. This is quite serious because we don't have a team already defined, we don't know who the professionals involved would be, so there's no way we can trust their preparation to successfully carry out the project. So, in many ways, the feasibility here needs to improve.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Regarding process auditability, very little is suggested. All we know is that it could be done via the \u201cPlatform Tracking / Business User and Project Management: Site Roadmap\u201d. does not provide safe and detailed means for us to follow the development of the phases. What is said is not enough for a careful and complete monitoring. I suggest that he define some means of communication with the community, first, be it a discord channel, some website, some online tool like Notion and Miro, for example. And then, with the communication established, he could constantly update us on the advances, what has been done each month, for example, who would be the professionals who would to add to the team, what their work routines would be like. Anyway, keeping us abreast of all advances, this is always necessary, but especially when it comes to such a complex proposal. exa, which requires a company to be created, professionals from various technical branches to get involved and etc. Unfortunately, security is not conveyed in the way in which the bidder suggests that we do this follow-up. Regarding the final results, the proponent suggests very interesting information (\"the success of the platform from business points of view: high user and company traffic on the platform, high turnover, high interaction with the platform, etc +the definition of success From user points of view find a Job they love, find the right candidates, easy operation of the platform, etc\u201d). That is, what would be considered a success with regard to the platform, or even for customers. There are several indications, and that can give us a good idea if the desired fruits are being harvested. I have two suggestions to make, in light of what has been said 1) it would be interesting for us to understand how these customers would be using the technologies learned, have they become active members of the community? 2) it is not very clear which means of communication would be used here. How does the proponent intend to make the Cardano community aware of this information? Sure, reports would be created, but would these be sent to us? If yes, how often and through which channel? I think the auditability is average, I see some hits and points that need real improvement - of course, especially the first part, which deals with monitoring the phases and small advances.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 7, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1504, "q0": "As the COVID-19 pandemic draws to a close, there will be an increased demand for people to be able to find work from home and work online.

There are solutions to these problems, but in the risk section of your post, I did not see you mention the possibility of ADA violations occurring after you have been funded. We are all aware that the current market is experiencing a significant decline, and the ADA coin has also followed that trend. Because of this, I would recommend that you mention the slippage of approximately 5 percent of the project's cost, as we are experiencing this issue as well. It is not possible to predict accurately in advance what the price of ADA will be in the future.

In my opinion, you need to provide additional details regarding the project's roadmap.\n\nConcerning the cost of the construction of the project: all of the amounts that you have mentioned are on a broad scale and are not specific. For instance, the establishment of a company, what costs are required, and software development (this is the most important step), are not specifically mentioned by you, such as the cost of hiring people, how much time it takes, and how much it costs to finish the steps of writing software.\n\nYou mentioned finding a technical person to develop the project with you as one of the features of the proposal, and you stated that you have experience in product development, marketing, and platform building; however, I haven't seen a link to a web page that leads to your personal page.

You have presented accurate and specific measurements of the world's labor situation as a basis for the development of the platform, but you need to attach more references and sources of information for higher reliability.

The title of the proposal is \"Job board cardajobs\" which also gives us some idea of \u200b\u200bthe problem of the proposal. According to the author, currently, many unemployed people are looking for suitable jobs, besides there are many vacant positions that cannot find suitable people => and supply and demand cannot meet each other. The solution is to create a job board based on a global decentralized platform that provides electronic identities for employers and employees, allowing companies to search for employees worldwide and apply for jobs. job applicants worldwide. The proponent has estimated that currently there are about 220 million unemployed people, and about 50% are unable to work/do not want to work, this number will be 110 million people looking for work, this is a number huge. If this solution is successfully implemented, it will give people around the world the opportunity to develop themselves and apply for jobs they are qualified for and love, as well as companies around the world the opportunity to find Find the right candidate. Both the applicant and the company benefit from this proposal, it is easier for people to find each other anywhere in the world, and of course, Cardano also benefits from this because it will become more and more popular with more and more users on the Cardano network. Regarding the risks that may be encountered in the project, the proponent has given 3 main risks and measures to reduce them.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\"Regarding the roadmap of the project, I think the proposal can be explained better. According to the presentation, this roadmap is divided into 3 phases by quarter from Q2/2022- Q4/2022, however, I don't know exactly when the steps will be taken, and how long will it take in months or weeks? Each month will take place, who will work at which step. Although they explain the basic operations to be performed, without placing us in what time and space (and who will do each task), we cannot fully understand the development of the project judgment. For example, in the second quarter of 2022, the author said that he would quit his current job, but did not mention what month he would leave, then when he would establish a company, or what would be the size of the company? As the risk section presented by the author is a lack of technical staff, how many employees do you plan to hire, how many co-founders are needed and what are the criteria you need? I think when you make it clear, it will attract a lot of people to you through other projects on Cardano.\nAs for the budget, the total request is $87,018, I know this money will be spent on expenses such as company establishment, business idea, software development, project management costs, and expenses. legal fees. However, this part of the cost can be analyzed in more detail, for example, the cost of building a company is $ 32,000, what size will your company build, and the cost of construction materials should be listed. List in more detail, as well as which city in Germany will the company be located? The same goes for the other expenses you listed such as \"\"Software Development / Project Management Cost: + Homepage: 20000-30000$\"\" how many real members will there be. In this section, how many hours will they spend as well as what is the hourly rate? I think the more detailed it is, the more beneficial it will be for your project.\nAnd finally, about the team, as mentioned above, I know that he is going to form the team, looking for good technical members as well as project co-founders, this is highly recommended because it is an important factor for the successful implementation of the project. Although the project is currently only a proponent, I hope he can reveal his identity, we know he will be the leader of this project, but we don't have enough information to believe about him. Regarding relevant experience, we are told that he is a person with more than 3 years of product experience, process experience, industry experience, customer experience, and candidate.

Second, the proponent should prepare reports, at least monthly, with project updates, and share them directly with the community. The proponent mentioned that the project will be web-based, but I'm not sure if the web updates will be internal to the project team or public to the community?\nAnd finally, the successful outcome of the project is divided into 2 parts, one part from a business point of view (including High user and company traffic on the platform; High revenue; High interaction with the platform; High number of apps and ads on the platform) and partly from a consumer point of view (including Find a job they love; Find the right candidate; Easy operation of the platform; Easy money transfer ) but how can we believe this has been achieved?

The second interesting feature, is the possibility of connecting people all around the world, touching a large number of people and possibly introducing them to blockchain technology and cardano. However, aside from these 2 aspects, i struggle to find how this project will be meaningful in creating more impactful usages for cardano. This project could entirely be done on any other platform aside from cardano, and lacks any meaningful innovation. Furthermore, it uses very little cardano technology: no cryptocurrency usage, no blockchain usage. Furthermore, the people who will use this platform (jobseekers and employers) will have very little incentive to leave the job seeking platform, to look at any other apps in the cardano ecosystem. They will only need to post their offers, and never look at the platform again, as they can contact each other through email. I do not think this project is very relevant to the challenge.

The aforementioned experience is also not particularly relevant to the project. Having only one team member with very vague qualifications does not give me faith that this project will be done successfully. The second point that is problematic, is the very vague budget breakdown. The budget states 32k$ for \"\"Building company\"\", this could encompass the entire budget, and gives us no details on how the funds will be used. The software and development costs show no hourly rates or planned number of coding hours. The author having no coding experience, I do not believe this part of the budget is correctly assessed. The final problem I foresee for this project, is the lack of interested users that will use the platform. What are incentives for companies to register on this platform, as opposed to the thousands of other well-established job posting platforms? Companies usually prefer to hire localemployees, with whom they can set up a face-to-face interview. There are very few jobs currently that is suited for remote working or working from home, as many companies believe productivity much higher at the office. Furthermore, connecting people all around the world will pose several issues: language barrier, working culture difference, timezone issues, difference in labour laws. What solutions can the author offer for these issues? Lastly, the author offers no system to ensure authenticity of job offers and employees.

However, most of the time, the result is still not satisfactory. Hence, I find that if this idea can actually gather a certain number of users, then it will become a great solution. With the example of different aspects and some key metrics, I agree that the idea aligns with our challenge. We can see a vision of the idea in real life and how it will benefit the users and Cardano. I also agree with all the risks that the team pointed out; however, I don\u2019t find that the team has a solid direction to solve them. For instance, with the risk of the lack of technical staff, the team says that they will find people who want to tackle this challenge. Isn\u2019t it too obvious?

In my opinion, it\u2019ll be better if the team can show us a timeline that has all the tasks and deadlines to finish them. That way we can see how your idea is doable. And also maybe a long-term and short-term roadmap to show the potential of the project in the long run. The budget breakdown somehow closely follows your roadmap (which is a good thing) but it\u2019s better to have a clearer cost explanation.

Almost half of the budget would be spent on incorporating a company in Germany - which to my mind is an excessive amount and not a good use of funds. Second, the software development, project management are bundled together for a rough estimation of 20-30 k USD required, without any split according to the actual tasks, applicable hourly rates or any description as to who exactly will be actually building the platform. On top of this, there is another 7k USD caption to include another project management, but we are not being told what is the difference between the two. \n\nWe have a similar problem when it comes to the team behind the proposal - sadly there isn\u2019t one. The proposer simply says that he will ask around for people interested in building the platform with him. One sentence later he tells us however that \u201che is the visionary with the idea but that he cannot implement this from the technical side\u201d. So a bit contradictory even between two sentences.\n\nA similar experience hits us when looking at the roadmap. The project would be split in three quarters. A big surprise comes in the Q1, when the proposer informs us that the necessary steps of the project will be to (1) quit his job, (2) finish the whitepaper and (3) incorporate the company. So in other words one third of the project would involve offering time for the proposer to cut his existing attachments and finish the idea behind this proposal. Needless to say that this is very unconvincing. A similar poor experience exists when going into the details of Q2 or Q3, but I shall spare you of the details. \n \nAll in all there are extremely high chances that it will not be feasible to finish this project according to the existing plan.

We are not being told. A moderately good news is that the proposer offers a few definitions of what success will mean for the project, but they are less than ideal and could have been a bit more applied. For example \u201cthe definition of success for a user is to find a job it loves\u201d. How will you measure this love? Through user surveys after being employed for x/y/z months or years? Again, the proposal does not go into these details. \n\nSo far the team is a one-man-show, so there are of course no communication channels open for the Cardano community to interact with the project, if funded (Telegram Twitter, etcetera).
