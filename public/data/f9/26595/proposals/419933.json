What the proposer is presenting is a platform project owners can distribute theirr token to the community in a permissionless manner. This will enable anyone to distribute their token without vetting. For the reader who is perhaps unfamiliar with this process, the tokens do not get sent directly to your wallet. The user needs to claim them by submitting a transaction and paying a small fee.

Taking that risk requires the proponent to hire a developer who can write Plutus smart contracts. The catalyst will be the one to make that decision. Nevertheless, I would also like to contribute an opinion about your risk part, specifically the issue of the ADA slide when you are funded. Because the market for cryptocurrencies is currently experiencing a bear market, it is impossible to predict in advance what the price of ADA will be after receiving the funding, even if it falls by 5 percent within a period of one year. What about at night? That kind of activity on the cryptocurrency market is perfectly normal. As a result, your precautions regarding the degree to which the ADA is being violated should also be taken into consideration.

The community is looking forward to and eagerly awaiting the success of, as well as using and experiencing decentralized applications (Dapps) to the fullest extent possible, as the roadmap calls for nearly one year of building and perfecting the application.\n\nIn terms of the cost of the proposed proposal, there are two costs: $ 80,000 over the course of six months to hire an engineer to write a Plutus smart contract, and $ 20,000 for an audit of that smart contract, in my opinion. Both of these costs are separate from one another. In my opinion, it's not really detailed, and the author needs to be more specific about the different price points for each individual item. It is highly recommended that you conduct a capacity assessment in light of the fact that this project is in the process of being finished and is still in the development stage.

To evaluate the success of the project, however, you absolutely need to include some key performance indicators (KPIs), such as the number of additional users who will use and utilize the services provided by the companies. Your fees will remain the same, and you should also specify how many additional projects will be able to claim their project tokens within the Cardano ecosystem. These are the kinds of numbers that you should probably include in your proposal. It is my opinion that with the success of the project, it will be possible to persuade developers to issue tokens through Tosidrop more frequently due to the superior features that it possesses.
