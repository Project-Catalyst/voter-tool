We know that in the era in which we live, our data is collected in a forced way (the famous Cookies of the website, we need to provide our information to continue browsing the pages, for example). And for this situation to be resolved, the proponents intend to create \u201ca blockchain-based platform to allow people to store their data and also selectively allow companies to access selected parts of their personal data in exchange for compensation.\u201d The ultimate goal is precisely to achieve greater transparency, participation and control over our personal data. The development of this dApp is directly related to the following specific objectives, present in the challenge summary: \u201cincrease the number of integrations that unite existing solutions for a more integrated and connected experience between different products + higher quality of existing products and integrations through of suggested improvements that are supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community\u201d. In this case, we would not be working on a new problem, but rather we would be improving the user experience when browsing the internet and providing (or not providing) their data, that is, it would be the improvement of existing solutions, which would increase the quality of these solutions. through customer feedback. This project is very interesting because it could attract an audience from outside the crypto bubble, since the subject discussed here is not about blockchain itself, but uses Cardano technologies for a purpose that is of general interest. Proponents are very successful in explaining what exactly the situations would be to solve: in addition to the control of big tech companies over our personal data, there is a situation that for the improvement of machine learning and artificial intelligence applications it is necessary that more data are provided. So they propose the creation of a \u201cDatapod\u201d, which would be a storage place where people would control various information (such as \u201cvisited websites, credit card purchases, exercise routines, streamed music\u201d and so on). A point that I think could be better explained would be from the following excerpt: \u201cOur blockchain platform allows everyone with a Datapod to selectively share parts of their data with stakeholders.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the proposal is good, more specifically the roadmap is excellent, but the team's presentation and the budget explanation could be more detailed. Regarding the script, first of all, this is without a doubt the best part of the proposal, as we know in great detail what would happen at each stage of the project. Ideally the timeline should be divided into months (as is done with the first, second and sixth month), but months 3, 4 and 5 are commented together, I would like to know exactly what would happen in each of them about the development of the platform and about marketing. Some very technical actions, such as the activities proposed in the first two months, do not require further details, as we are told what would be done in a specific way, allowing us to have a very solid view of these parts of the project. However, some less technical parts could be better explained. For example: \u201cwork to get full legal green light for the platform + start writing about the problem and our solution, increase customer awareness + look for early enterprise customers as test testers\u201d. How would the legal \u201cgreen light\u201d be sought? How could this be defined more precisely? How would a first contact be established with the first business customers, how to present this project so that they understand well the benefits proposed here? During the explanation of the impact it is said that customer trust would be worked on (\u201cwe will publish detailed blog posts about the data ecosystem, leading to a greater understanding of the customer about the problem and our solution\u201d etc); so it would be important for us to know the content of these posts, how the marketing would be executed. Some parts of the budget are well explained (for example the salaries of the professionals involved, there are 4 professionals who charge 30 dollars per hour), the amount requested here is very fair. However, some other expenses could be better explained: would the 1200 dollars monthly for the office cover expenses such as rent, electricity, water bills, etc? Why would the marketing campaign cost $7,000? What licenses would be needed to run the project within all compliances? Talking about the team, in turn, unfortunately this part is not adequate as the group members are presented very succinctly, all we know about each are their names, roles in the project and linkedin profiles. It would be necessary for us to know better about their curricula, projects they have developed to date and especially how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem. For these reasons I think that although we have basic information about the feasibility of the project, some improvements are still needed.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Proponents state that \"updates on programming, community and other progress will be provided regularly.\" But how? In addition to the accountability metrics provided by them (e.g. completion of the development roadmap and whitepaper, number of users in the beta version, amount of data in Datapods, etc.), do they intend to keep the community updated on the work routines of the professionals? In my view, it is necessary that both the partial results (which are exemplified here) and the activities that would be developed each month and would result in such successes should be reported to all members of our ecosystem. The first thing to do would be to define which communication channel would be adopted between team members and the Cardano community (maybe they use some already established channel and with many people like our Telegram groups, or participate in breakout rooms after Townhall , create a youtube channel, post updates on twitter\u2026.). Anyway, many ways can be used to build this bridge; after that, it would be necessary for the team to better define what content would be informed and how often this update would be made. As much as they already demonstrate the intention to do what is necessary for the auditability to be solid, more detail would have to be given to understand how this would be done, in terms of progress. Talking about the end results now, success can be defined by creating an \u201cenvisioned platform that would change the way the current data ecosystem works, from the current model without transparency and participation, to an individual-centric consent-based model where everyone receive their fair share of compensation for their data.\u201d But how could we deepen our understanding of this scenario? Two things are necessary: \u200b\u200b1) We understand how users would have benefited, what rewards they would be receiving, how their navigability experiences have improved, they feel more sovereign in relation to their data, etc. In my opinion, the most logical way to understand all this is to keep in direct contact with users, carrying out a survey to collect their feedback regarding the use of the dApp. It would also be necessary to understand how they got used to Cardano's technologies, how they learned to do simple things on the blockchain. 2) More specifically about our ecosystem, we need to be sure that the objectives of the challenge were achieved, that more people became active members of the community, if somehow they would be participating in other Cardano projects outside this dApp, if they would be participating Catalyst (they heard about it because of the teachings about our ecosystem) and so on. Both aspects must be taken into account, so that we can have the most complete auditability possible. Therefore, the topic is also good, but like the previous one, some improvements could be made.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Honestly, i really like this assessment, and agree with most, if not all of the points raised.

The transaction is facilitated with smart contract (payment arrived in wallet, then temporary access to the data). The user will be identified using Atala Prism. Users can choose to self host their Datapod or use any cloud providers they choose. The proposal also mentions the possibilties of using stablecoins and oracles for payment and smart contracts accordingly. There might be some distinctive difference in detail but the concept of 'you control your data' and 'you can sell it too' does exist for some time already with a few startups applying the blockchain solution to entice the users. However, other than the risk that they team specify in term of technical challenge, consumer trust and regulatory compliance. There are risk inherent in data valuation (different data types and different data ownership dictate data value). It is an ambitious project and surely one that the community should keep an eye on for development. Right now, it is in early stage and limited in term of future scaling, the impact that this DApp will bring impactful use case and increase Cardano adoption as per the challenge goal is there but it will take some time to realize its full potential.

After which they will look for more funding. Most funding will go towards product development and office space. The team is also comprised of data engineer and should be very adept in data handling. The team will needs to generate enough interest both business users and individual users to use their platform. One way would be to ensure that users are rewarded well enough as people might not bother to use the platform if that is not the case. While the tech giant enjoys economies of scale of data volume, this might not be the same for companies and it is likely that the users will be rewarded minimally from their data. Also considering the possibility that the team would need to secure legal opinion regarding GDPR and other data protection law, it is likely that the project might take longer than 6 months to complete their MVP.

The team should consider the channel they want to use for informing the community on project progress like social media (discord, twitter), report or bi-weekly meetings etc. The team has a very clear understanding of the issue in lack of control on personal data.

The problem statement is also very clear and honestly reflects reality. In general, the proposal\u2019s intention is to build Datapod, an application that assists individuals to keep their own personal data as well as to manage them properly. Technically, this platform is based on Blockchain technology, which ensures transparency since even the application\u2019s developers can not access or take any information from the users. Moreover, a smart contract mechanism is also applied into this platform, which means that every data-related transaction will be automatically performed without any threat of scam. In addition, one uniqueness of the project is that it helps users take all the personal data back from giant Tech-companies to control on their own. The proposal also offers a part that answers some FAQs such as: where the data and metadata is stored, what other partners that they are incorporating with, how users are identified and how data access is granted. In my opinion, this is an innovative idea since data is one of the most valuable assets in modern society nowadays, where technology has been on its fastest growth and the playground for Tech-companies has expanded larger than ever. However, I believe they should add some explanation on how they are going to make profit from this project, such as: whether they would charge any service or commission fees, whether they would approve advertising activities, whether they would provide premium accounts or cloud storages,... These questions if answered properly would help the Catalyst understand more about the platform\u2019s potential. To conclude, I think the proposer has successfully brought about a very convincing solution to solve the problem mentioned, which is also well-aligned with the challenge settings. I agree that this application, if developed correctly, would widen the Cardano ecosystem, satisfy the exact needs of the community and eventually, bring more users toward the system.
