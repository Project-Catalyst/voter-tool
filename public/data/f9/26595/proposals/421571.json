Marlowe will introduce Domain-Specific Programming language for writing smart contracts using visual programming using blocks. This is expected to reduce the learning curve in writing smart contracts and will enable domain experts in finance to directly see and audit smart contracts. The proposal is for creating a fractional NFT minting system using Marlow and GameChanger Wallet. The benefits include opening up of NFT minting with smart contract functionality like fractional NFTs in a user-friendly manner. There are a large number of innovative features that can get unlocked using Fractional NFTs. The proposal is to add this support to a specific wallet which is GameChanger Wallet. The market share of this wallet might be low, however, there is always a good reason to have more than one wallet in the ecosystem to support redundancy and provide users with options. With these considerations, I feel that the proposal is very much in alignment with the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers had built a wallet with rich functionality and have been operating the same for more than one year. The team has also provided the GitHub account and the LinkedIn profile for references. The experience and the demonstrated capability in building a wallet are technically sufficient to prove that the team is capable of delivering the proposal. Marlow is also likely to reduce the threshold for generating such projects. The github profile is moderately active and demonstrates sufficient capability. The team also has claimed to IOG organised courses in the related subjects. With these credentials, it can be said that the team is capable of delivering the project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "\nThe proposal is requesting 8000USD with justification as $3000 for Marlowe Development and $5000 for Gamechanger Script Development and Automation. There is no estimation of the effort and time required, which is understandable. Marlow is still in development and the exact effort required to complete the project will not be known till a reasonably stable release with all toolings are available. However, the proposal is asking for approximately 2 months' pay for a developer, which I feel is a reasonable request. Moreover, the availability of the woking project in Marlow will improve the rate of adoption of the same and will be a major catalyst in moving the system. The output expected of the project is well defined and the progress and the success of the proposal can be accurately audited.

Providing tooling for the community to fractionalize an NFT is new to Cardano, and would increase the ability of everyday users to get exposure to high value assets. However, I would recommend the proposer describe in greater detail how this product will officially be available. For example, please make it clear to the voter if your intent is to provide free and opensource tooling that is fairly portable, or whether you are intending to make this available only to GameChanger wallet users. Additionally, more could be added to describe the entire functionality from start to finish with a user perspective. For example, how would a fractionalized NFT owner swap back the tokens for Ada? Will they use an exchange, or will they be able to send the Ada back to the contract? Most Cardano centric users will not know exactly what a fractionalized NFT is, so it would be important to clearly convey this to the voter.

In addition they have made it clear that the use of Plutus is not available yet and that the product will be built out on the test net first. This would give plenty of time and leeway for the proposer to  tweak the product. Additionally, this seems like a fairly straight forward build.\nFinally, I would recommend the proposer provide more detail in their roadmap and budget. Saying 3000 for Marlow and 5000 for Plutus is too general. There are more steps to this process and you need to convince the voter you have the competence and level of planning necessary to accomplish these project goals.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Because the proposer has not provided a detailed roadmap and budget it would be hard to measure the success of the project.

I googled it and read up, and imagine experienced developers would know better then I do, however you are going to get a lot of proposal assessors who may not have the needed level of experience or knowledge, so maybe play it safe and give a bit more info on what it is? Just a thought, might not be necessary.\n\nThe experience looks to be very relevant, however we would need more info. Did you have any objective results on successful projects in the past? How many years experience?\n\nIs 8K USD enough to build and roll out this functionality?\n\nThe video clip shared looks very interesting and helps paint the picture of some of the benefits. Would be good to have more of this if available or in the future. Or just screen shots with explanation.\n\nIn terms of how this will impact the specific challenge, i agree with everything said in that auditable tools should be priority, i just think this section needs more time and built out better.\n\nTake a look at this last proposal I just reviewed.

I still remember CardanoBits being launched via GoogleDocs! All CNFTs were cheap back then. Now the floor prices for blue chip Cardano NFTs have skyrocketed in just a little more than a year. Even in a bear market, a SpaceBud will cost you at least 4,600 ADA. A DEADPXLZ floor is 2,350 ADA and a Clay Nation by Clay Mates floor costs 2,960 ADA. Most people, especially newcomers cannot afford these prices. So how can a new-comer or someone who wants to own a blue chip CNFT get their hands on one\u2026\u2026or in this case a piece? The proposer\u2019s solution is fractionalized NFTs. A simple explanation is taking an NFT like a SpaceBud and splitting it up into fractions of lets say ten pieces. A buyer can now purchase a 10th of a SpaceBud to own a piece of a blue chip CNFT.\n\nI have seen lots of people in discord regret not getting in on SpaceBudZ and DEADPXLZ when the project launched. Others are still bitter that they sold their NFTs for so cheap even those they made 20x on their money. This project can bring those people back in the \u201cgame\u201d. \n\nSince this project lowers the barrier to entry to get a blue chip CNFT, it will attract more investors looking for a safer NFT investment. This project creates a WIN:WIN:WIN. The platform wins by generating revenue for its fractionalizing NFT services. The user wins by getting its hands on a scarce blue chip NFT. And lastly the owner of the blue chip NFT wins by charging a higher price and bagging some profits.

This proposal doesn\u2019t do anything to make the voters care about the innovation of fractionalizing NFTs on Cardano. I have a colleague that spent a lot of time working on fractionalizing NFTs over on the Ethereum blockchain and he explained that this helps to bring more liquidity into an illiquid market, which is a bigger issue on Ethereum than it is currently on Cardano. If this functionality could be brought to the Cardano ecosystem before this becomes an issue with highly unaffordable costs of NFTs, the industry of Cardano NFTs can effectively sidestep some of the hurdles that have been historically troublesome for other chains. There are a lot of functional reasons to fractionalize an NFT that I think should be articulated here. After answering the question of what use case this brings to the Cardano ecosystem, the proposal should spend some time explaining how big those impacts could be. With information about the Cardano NFT market, the quantifiable benefits of fractionalized NFTs on other chains, and the adoption potential of implementing features that other chains have.

While the dev team are both graduates of Cardano courses like Plutus Pioneers and Marlowe Pioneers, my colleague (another graduate of Plutus Pioneers) tells me that the program can sometimes be a little more advanced than what someone with the minimum acceptance criteria would be able to fully comprehend. So, when I\u2019m reviewing proposals, I look for additional software development skills to demonstrate some preexisting competency. From this section, I can\u2019t find anything that confidently speaks to that. Though the production of these graphics/demos might speak to some kind of demonstrable capability, so voters can choose how confident they feel in that. Sometimes the roadmap can help demonstrate some technical capability if it\u2019s detailed enough to show actionable steps and hours of labor allocated but this proposal isn\u2019t able to give us that either. Then, as far as the budget goes, I would normally say that this proposal doesn\u2019t properly breakdown the budget to prove efficiency in spending. In this case, the overall budget is too extraordinarily low to be anywhere in the realm of \u201cexorbitant\u201d spending.

As innovative and exciting as the potential finished product could be, the completion of the product doesn\u2019t enable access to any of the potential benefits/impacts. In order to access those benefits/impacts, there needs to be KPIs on usage data to show what kind of outcome we could be seeing that would lead to actual impacts on the Cardano ecosystem. These metrics could be the number of NFTs fractionalized, the number of users that are fractionalizing NFTs, the number of projects that integrate this technology, and as much other information that can be provided on post-proposal performance.
