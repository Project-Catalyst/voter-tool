They are sports with added value. very large and global.\nThe proposal focuses on building a betting platform based on the features of WEB3 and allowing it to work on the Cardano blockchain. An excellent idea and solves a lot of problems such as incorporating blockchain into a traditional betting platform, making betting transactions transparent through specific blockchain transactions on ADA cryptocurrency, Increasing identity security for players, and ensuring ownership of player assets on the blockchain and is a decentralized platform for betting players.\nThis is a bold proposition and will impact a wide range of participants in this ADABET.iO platform. I can see ahead of time: ADA holders can participate in playing on this platform, people who like to bet on sports, people who want to experience Cardano's DApp ecosystem, or simply traders investors can be objects when the project is implemented. The proponent has a very broad market view and observes the size of the market and the most natural approach to this project.\nI can quote a few important pieces of information about the market that the author team mentioned: the proposal aims at a betting market with a value of 100 billion dollars per year, in 2021 the global value is $76.75 billion and will continue to increase 10% each year after that. That is a very impressive statistic about this industry that the author gives. Even better when a part of that value is converted or participated in ADA coins on the Cardano platform, ADABET.iO is a pioneering project, maybe it is officially from the launchpad of the Cardano ecosystem to participate in the market. global betting market.\nI congratulate the author team for having a good and intelligent idea when combining many elements for their project from Technology to markets and players. If you need some advice I hope you implement it as soon as possible.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I have looked through the list of members participating in this project. They are really technology lovers, experienced or more precisely they are creators of digital content creation products on the internet platform. They have experienced many jobs such as mobile application development, game development, and entertainment contents, applications on mobile platforms. In addition, they are also IT specialists of large companies in Japan and they have worked together at some point. With an average of more than 10 years of working experience of the members, some of whom have participated in the proposals from fund8 before, I think that the author team is completely capable of implementing the project. based on their previous experience.\n\nThe roadmap of proposal is really detailed and given each small item only those who write the project and think carefully can do such details, they understand very well what the ADABET project needs to do. A variety of tasks are listed such as system design, front-end programming, backend, computer graphics, software testing, or blockchain programming...\nIn a short time of 3-6 months, the team launched the MVP version of ADABET dApp which is completely achieved.\nThe details of disbursements are mentioned in full by sections and teams: here the proponent presents sub-teams and tasks to them (System Design, Blockchain dev, Frontend, Backend, Graphics Design, Marketing). ...)\nwith a total project budget of $12,5005 including a 10% provision for risk management in it, this is a very modest number for the development of such a large Betting platform. I understand that you have estimated costs in the most reasonable way to compete with projects up to $ 400000 or up to $ 800000. Really, you have a team that works and completely evaluates the exact capital needed for the project. Not many projects have as detailed a budget allocation as the team that wrote this proposal.\nI believe that you are doing a good job, and look forward to being the first customer to experience your project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I have read very carefully the audit and tracking section of this ADABET platform proposal. You have come up with the necessary indicators to measure the success of the project such as:\nThe number of functions of programmed platforms.\nThe number of accounts registered to the ADABET platform.\nThe number of people participating in ADABET's community channels.\nThe number of ADA wallets connected to the platform.\nAttached is the GitHub for the project as well as the management team and chat community for this project.\nThese are absolute indicators that the community can easily see and track throughout the project's formation and development.\nThe most intuitive is that the success of the project will be implemented directly on the main website of the ADABET.iO project, which is great and ensures transparency for those interested in your project.\nThe proposed team has extensive experience in developing software projects and learned to apply scrum workflow for this project, which is a modern and fast process for solving software projects that need many participants. They define the main tasks and the small tasks that need to be completed that not all teams are aware of.\nFurthermore, the definition for the successful nature of the proposal is also mentioned as:\n\nBuild the platform with servers that connect and operate the Cardano node directly, Cardano-DB-sync for project development; Complete data communication APIs in the system; Build a wallet of the ADABET platform that serves customers to create and manage their assets; Fully built betting features of the platform; Build smart contracts in staking transactions; Build ADABET's community channels; Design tokenomics for the platform and release $ABE for games in ADABET.\nThese success criteria are very important in the project and you guys have focused on them. You guys are doing the most meticulous work in each stage of the project, which is very good and makes ADA holders like me feel secure about these Cardano-based projects.

Usually, we bet through our live tickets with the bookie. Compared to your idea, this is a very useful and convenient proposition for bettors like us. It is true that traditional betting platforms are often limited by many things, be it rates, payouts, systems, and security all potentially unsafe and lack transparency.\nCentralized systems can be subjectively compromised by these restrictive properties.\nWhen I read your project carefully, I see that ADABET has great potential to replace traditional betting platforms like we are participating in. The features you mentioned like live bet, prediction bet, pear -to-pear bet finds that very attractive. Especially when your proposal allows you to bet in crypto without the need for a credit card, which will be more accessible to customers due to fewer barriers from traditional methods. You incorporate many techniques into this project such as Cardano Blockchain Technology to ensure the decentralization of the platform, and Web3 technology features to ensure the ownership of customer assets on the platform, they are all suitable technologies and can realize your project.\nI am envisioning a scenario where players own ADA coins and play sports betting games on this ADABET platform, they will have exciting and completely new experiences, fast trading, and asset management. 24/7 full time. It has a strong impact on betting enthusiasts as well as those interested in crypto transactions. Given the size of the crypto market and the sports betting market, it's an overwhelming resonance beyond the Cardano community in particular.\nIn this proposal, the KPIs are mentioned as The number of accounts registered in ADABET; The number of regular players on the platform.\nThese indicators are easy to measure and define, you are in the right direction with the target and the market size is good enough to develop this proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This is one of the most well-thought-out proposals I've seen on this Fund9, the sections are clearly written and all elements are clear. The first thing to mention is the roadmap, the proponent mentioned every small detail to do with the timeline for completing those tasks. Here you are divided by quarter with accompanying tasks, in addition to listing the teams involved in developing the listed tasks. I very much agree with the way you guys do the roadmap for such a project, it always ensures that all work is not left behind. The short-term and long-term successful goals in the proposal such as Complete the functions of the ADABET platform, releasing the PC version, integrating the ADA wallet into the system, and programming the betting transactions. Those are the core of the project that the proponent has laid out and are very well timed with the original roadmap. I tried contacting the team that developed this project, it happened to be an excel file they shared and needed to request access. I contacted them and got a response from them a few minutes later. This shows the member\u2019s Team members are very active and always ready for their project. \nA good point in this proposal team is that they have listed the participants in their proposals, I see there are nearly 20 members and they are divided into project teams to make proposals in this Fund 9. The human resources that the team has used have many skills related to the work in the proposal, they are people with extensive experience in software development and smartphone applications. With the achievements they have achieved in previous funds I believe they will develop this ADABET platform well. The required budget for the project is listed with the task and the team performing that task. Real-time work with hourly rates is very reasonable, with $40/hour for the software QA department or $55/hr for the graphic design team as a low price according to our survey. For me, it's usually around $100/hr. Also mentioned is the tax =0% for your jurisdiction, which is a good opportunity to develop potential projects.

In this audit, the project success metrics are listed such as the number of subscribers to the ADABET platform, the number of people integrating the ADA wallet, and the number of players and betting transactions on the platform. Those are numbers that are easy to measure and know the evolution of this proposal. The proponent of the SCRUM process for project management, task management, and my team, I find it feasible because the scrum process is very useful for developing technology projects. It defines work items clearly, continuously, and seamlessly from design implementation to product deployment.\nThe success of the project is determined by replacing the traditional betting platform with the ADABET platform that the proposed team wants to build, creating a new and useful experience for the end-users. The proposal will bring more investors as well as sports betting enthusiasts to trade in ADA tokens in our Cardano ecosystem. This is a very laudable prospect and it is open to many communities to participate.\nFinally, this is a very good proposal that I assess in this Fund 9.

The report provides a detailed analysis of drivers & opportunities, top winning strategies, competitive scenarios, future market trends, market size & estimations, and major investment pockets. A very potential market for the Cardano dApp ecosystem to enter. The proposal opens up a huge opportunity for the liquidity of ADA cryptocurrency, as a channel to attract investors to the Cardano blockchain. Regarding the solution to the ideas, the proposer explains in detail each option very logically, there are not many problems in the way they come up with it.

Their participants still accept huge risks when participating on web2 platforms, the number of winners is very small but the loss rate is very high, which is due to the lack of transparency in the management of bookmakers. WEB3 technology I believe will completely solve this problem.\nPlayers can bet using ADA, which has a huge impact on the development of the ecosystem because the features of the project are capable of attracting a large number of participants. It is recommended that you explain these features in more detail to get a better understanding of the betting mechanics. ADABET also mentioned the issuance of tokens, I think this is really necessary as it can become the main source of the project's budget in the future.

If this is combined with an open and dynamic cryptocurrency market like the ADA community, the market cap of the betting market is even larger in value. So this is a proposal that impacts a wide range of participants and communities beyond Cardano.\nThe second: ADABet is an advanced technology platform, it is built with the best features that Web3 is forming, in addition to a Cardano blockchain platform famous for its decentralization and security. These technologies and techniques make the ADAbet dApp platform somewhat superior to conventional betting systems.\nThe third: The goals and implementation solutions are carefully calculated and there is no contradiction, the risks are all hedged (in terms of development team, technology, or ADA coin price).

Q4 designs the functionality of the platform and develops the content on it, along with integrating the ADA wallet into the platform. Q4 programming the software has designed and built the MVP trial version, And there are many related task items in this roadmap. The entire required budget for this platform is not much, about $125,005 to spend on all the development work of the project (smart-contract programming, dev-frontend, dev-backend, system, design, QA, marketing ...)\nThe members of the proposal are programmers, founders, and content designers.
