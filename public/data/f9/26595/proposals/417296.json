In addition, the reach of a new native token will do, with no backing value, with no plan beyond distribution, has little direction for it to go to.  This sounds like a creation of meme token (which there are already plenty of CNT meme tokens) and doesn't have a place to use Catalyst funds for the development of this.  They can simply advertise Hosky, Bison, Clams, or the littany of other near-zero value coins and doesn't require a new token for what they are trying to accomplish.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The project is feasible, as there have been other meme coins created successfully and with ease with some of the newer infrastructure being developed in the Cardano space.

The proposal also seeks to create a native Token for incentivization. The impact to natives will be high awareness creation which leads to increased onboarding and adoption of Cardano as a Blockchain of choice. \nThe participants also get explore the countless possibilities in the Blockchain space and also contribute to the ecosystem in several ways, and also a way of attracting developers. \nThis proposal scales to solve future problems like poverty, joblessness, ignorance etc. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have given a timeline about 3 months for initial outreach program, recruiting of influencers and promoters, creation of native Token and collaboration with catalyst team to work of incentivizing setting.

I disagree, everyone who engages with Catalyst is rewarded in a certain way, such as Ada payouts for PA and vPA. I don't think it's necessary for us to create an incentive token aimed at this. There are also several points in the detailing of the impact that caused me doubts and questions. For example: \u201cWe will reach different market segments and audiences using highly targeted marketing campaigns\u201d \u2013 it is not said how serious the campaigns would be. \u201cMaking this open source would help new integrated individuals become new developers\u201d \u2013 this already happens, most projects at Cardano are open source.

That said, this part of the feasibility needs no improvement. The explanation about the budget, in turn, is very basic, it needed more details included. And finally, the team is presented in a very detailed way, so that we know richly who are involved.

Success is defined well, through various aspects such as \u201cCreating an effective native token that has value for everyone involved + Creating a dynamic, fast-growing culture where everyone works and is encouraged by their onboarding work\u201d.

I have a few very serious issues with the proposal from the get-go: first of all, I think it\u2019s in the wrong challenge (Dapps, Products & Integrations). To quote what success looks like from the challenge brief: \u201cNovel and viable applications and products get built on top of Cardano attracting users. Integrations manage to pull in more adoption.\u201d. This proposal includes none of that in my opinion, especially since the plan is not very robust. Second, it\u2019s become commonplace nowadays for everyone to suggest the creation of a new token for almost any project they have in mind, even if the token makes no sense, or it\u2019s not needed. In this particular case, I found no explanation in the proposal why this token is necessary, how its value would be determined, no information about tokenomics, nothing. The final thing I have to say is that the approach the proposer wants to take is also extremely vague: seeking out everything from primary school students to senior citizens and recruiting them to become influencers. The proposer named so many categories of people here, that basically they could have simply said: \u201cwe will seek out random people and recruit them to be influencers\u201d. There are no details on how these people would be convinced to become Catalyst evangelists, except a few vague statements such as: \u201cThrough native tokens each influencer is incentivized to onboard new prospects, and they in turn will bring in more new prospects.\u201d.\nTo Dimitri, the proposer: please use a tool to assist you with writing next time. The proposal is full of linguistic errors and even nonsensical statements.\nBased on all my arguments above, I completely disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. Score: 1.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "There is a rough timeline (3 months) and Dimitri lists the actions that he intends to take over the course of each month, but again, very vaguely. The details of how these people will be onboarded into Crypto are not hashed out and Dimitri thinks that in 3 months he\u2019ll have multiple people ready to work in Catalyst and bring in even more people, just to obtain the mentioned onboarding token (which is expected to be created by the end of month 2). The budget of 39000 USD is fully allocated to 3 unspecified programmers (200 hours for 60 USD per hour + a 3000 USD contingency). There is no mention of who these programmers are, or how they will be recruited. Dimitri only mentions another person who seems to have some technical expertise, named Uditha Bandara (https://www.linkedin.com/in/udithabandara). Dimitri\u2019s experience is in running a translation agency and starting multiple other companies, but I searched on Google for his translation agency (\u201cJedidiah Translations\u201d according to his LinkedIn) and I could not find anything at all.\nDue to the very sketchy information we are provided with I disagree it\u2019s likely to be implemented successfully. Score: 2.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Dimitri lists a lot of ways to measure progress, but none of them are key progress indicators in the proper sense of the term. For example: \u201cNumber of segments identified, Number of new prospects who become influencers, Amount of native tokens earned by each influencer\u201d. Without estimations beforehand, the proposer can just report any number each month and then say that the project is on track. We needed hard numbers here, such as \u201cX people onboarded by the first month; X people active in Catalyst as PA\u2019s in the next fund as a result of this project etc\u201d, if this project were to actually be auditable.\nHowever, like I mentioned in the two sections above, I think this proposal is deeply flawed in its approach (it\u2019s listed in the wrong challenge, it has a very vague plan and sparse information in feasibility and auditability) and I do not think the information we have is sufficient to audit its progress and success.
