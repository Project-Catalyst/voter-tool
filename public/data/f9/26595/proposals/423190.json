The proposers further claim to be a \"provider\" to Louis Vuitton and in a position to leverage this contact to benefit their Catalyst project \"Luxury CNFT Platform\". As this proposal is asking for a significant share of the budget, $1.5 million, I think that it is in order to ask critically if this approach is the right use of Catalyst funding and apply a high bar for impact due to the alternative of funding many other proposals asking for less funding in this category. I am not opposed to making bold claims, such as funding this proposal with 1.5 million dollars could result in a $10 ADA price, a market cap increase of over 300 billion dollars, and will look at the likely impact purely in the light of the facts presented, taking into account the size of the requested funding.\n\nFirst, I do not agree that Cardano has a disappointing NFT ecosystem. By the end of May, Cardano has seen 5 million NFTs minted, more than doubling its stock in five months in an unfavorable business environment, after an impressive start after the Alonzo hardfork being a relative latecomer to mass-market NFTs. It now boasts a vibrant ecosystem with low fees and relatively active NFT marketplaces. Second, it is my perception that Cardano is at heart an impact-orientated and non-conformist community, made up of people who treasure decentralization, technical and academic rigor and critical thinking over glitz and materialism, consumerism and glossy presentation. Third, I do not see any credible real world examples where existing multinational corporation-branded NFTs have managed to create the same cult status as more offbeat and crypto-native alternatives. Therefore, while I think nicer presentation and better graphics can never hurt, I do not see a highly impactful match between ZOOMLOOK and Cardano when put in context of the funding requested. I do neither agree nor disagree that this is effectively addressing the challenge setting of boosting adoption and creating \"bang for buck\" DApp use cases, new user onboarding or a meaningful expansion of the ecosystem.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers have an existing company delivering more immersive photography for mobile devices and websites. They have been accepted in the LVMH \"La Maison de Startups\" accelerator program and therefore believably claim to \"work with Louis Vuitton\". The Lindkedin profiles of the team are presented and we get the picture of a successful early-stage company with skilled members successful in their current domain of activity. With the large budget requested, it is further likely that sufficient development talent can be recruited to create an integration at least at the MVP stage somewhat in line with the vision provided by the proposers. It is likely that if funded, this proposal would generate a positive user experience and connect luxury brand NFTs with the Cardano ecosystem. The proposal uses a lot of marketing speak and bold claims to make this proposal sound attractive, some of which I address in the Impact and Auditability sections. I have, however, no doubts that the budget is sufficient and the experience of the management and creative staff adequate for the project.\n\nIt would be nice to see a further breakdown of budget and timeline, or other means of conveying the business plan and implementation strategy, such as rapport with potential customers, a customized video specifically for this Catalyst proposal or other evidence that the proposers are serious and motivated and the funds would be in good hands.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal presents as its key deliverables that the price of ADA will go up, more developers will know Haskell, and Glyphosate herbicides will be phased out globally. None of these goals is supported by evidence or a business plan-like approach of getting there. While the proposal has many milestones and may well result in a meaningful working DApp, these self-proclaimed goals seem totally beyond the control of the proposers. The price of ADA will be determined by a myriad of factors, including the performance of 100s of other teams building on Cardano, the actions of IOHK and, certainly, the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, regulators across the globe and hundreds of thousands of people with discretionary ADA holdings. Nobody in the proposer team knows Haskell or has previously developed on Cardano, so including Haskell adoption as a key deliverable seems a bit odd. \nGlyphosate use will not be meaningfully affected by the implementation of this project. \nAlthough $120,000 are allocated to \"Management\" of the proposal, very little is done to present a sophisticated project management plan or detailed marketing strategy.

It is to extend the range of what NFTs are used for specifically to expand into multiple use case scenarios that the Fashion and Luxury world are looking for. Effectively adding a layer of truth and authenticity to to products so that when they go into the circular economy, they may be tracked on the block chain. The hype over NFTs has been up until this point mainly focused on the artsy imagery. ZOOMLOOK is not aiming to amplify various ape images and hope to add value with resolution. Far from it. our goal is to redefine the standard of NFTs as CNFTs which will have a more visceral impact on the general user and sync with the growing complexity of business needs that can arise from an NFT platform with greater complexity and sounds planning of Smart Contracts. A lot of growth needs to happen in this space. The first phase of hype around NFTs is over. It is time for the second phase of real world usage. The ZOOMLOOK Luxury CNFT Platform.  \n\n\n\u201cSecond, it is my perception that Cardano is at heart an impact-orientated and non-conformist community, made up of people who treasure decentralization, technical and academic rigor and critical thinking over glitz and materialism, consumerism and glossy presentation.\u201d \nThis is a personal perception and a judgment about the nature of the community, which while valid does not take into account the need for that community to utilize funding derived from the value of ADA to generate solutions at the grass roots level. \n \n\n\u201cThird, I do not see any credible real world examples where existing multinational corporation-branded NFTs have managed to create the same cult status as more offbeat and crypto-native alternatives.

We have been interviewing companies and individuals that do have great experience with Haskel and Cardano. A Swiss company that builds NFT platforms on Cardano and an Australian developer with an excellent YouTube channel. The Team Building phase in 20222 Q4 speaks of this.

A special feature of this platform is supposed to be the Zoomlook tool. This tool is a development of the company of the same name to present images and videos in very high resolution on web pages to zoom in very close in single frames. The development of this technology has - as far as I understand - enabled Zoomlook to participate in a startup incubator of LVHM. Among other things, this startup incubator promotes a whole range of Internet startups that revolve around the presentation of luxury products on the Internet. The core of the idea is to link this zoom functionality with NFTs. This combination is indeed an interesting innovation, but from a technical point of view, it is nothing more than a special viewer for viewing high-resolution images or videos. This viewer could also be used on any other existing NFT platform for the time being.\nHowever, to highlight the idea as distinct, the relationship with LVMH is emphasized and it is suggested that brands like Louis Vuitton would decide to mine NFTs in the Cardano ecosystem or otherwise become active in the Cardano ecosystem because of the contacts through the startup incubator as well as the technology of the viewer.\nUnfortunately, there is a lack of clear evidence and details for this: First, the Zoomlook company has existed since 2017, and neither the proposal or website, nor my own research, has shown that the tool has any truly noteworthy use at LVMH. There is no clear evidence that LVMH is using the tool, nor that there are any relationships with LVMH other than participation in a startup incubator.\nIn addition to creating an NFT platform, this proposal also intends to create a \"Cardano Coding Academy\" to learn \"Haskell, Plutus & Marlow\". While this is commendable, it has relatively little to do with the idea of creating an NFT platform. To make the proposal clearer, the team would be advised to concentrate on one idea and work it out in detail here.\nOverall, the proposal is interesting to bring luxury brands like LMVH into the Cardano ecosystem, but it lacks a clearly laid out strategy. Instead, there are a lot of buzzwords in the proposal with no content. This also makes it unclear exactly what the proposal is: Is the proposal to develop an NFT platform with integration of the tool, or is the idea to leverage the relationship with LMVH to bring them into the Cardano ecosystem, or is it all about the coding academy?

Programming, content? Who is creating this? To what extent? Then there is to be an IOS and Android app. For what exactly?

The first notable thing is that the proposal promises a unique technology which sets it apart from the rest of the NFT platform: \u201cWe produce remarkable photos, animations, 360\u00ba/3D objects, 8K Video & SphereVR immersive spaces\u201d. This will definitely give the project a competitive advantage and may later draw more attention from the community due to its one-and-only feature. By utilizing this technology, a series of products will be built to meet the community needs such as CDN Integrations, Contracts with Luxury Brands, Cardano Coding Academy, etc. The community benefits are also discussed in the proposal. It has successfully targeted specific subjects including luxury brands, general public, and Cardano community. However, these benefits are still not discussed in detail. It is advised that they should provide detailed KPIs to illustrate the outcome they want to receive. As for the risks the project is facing, one which the proposal fails to address is the partnership with luxury brands. It is hard to ask them for cooperation unless they thoroughly understand the benefits that they will receive. Therefore, I want to know whether the project already has a partnered brand and what they will do to attract these fastidious customers.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "With reference to the plan, even though the proposal does arrange the work for a certain period of time. However, it is not detailed enough and some of them are hard to understand. For instance, during Q4 of 2022, they did mention the work which related to \u201cHaskell\u201d but what exactly they are going to do using this programming language is unknown. As for the budget breakdown, the money is logically distributed to specific work such as Integrations, DAMs, marketing,etc. However, the budget of $40.000 for Cardano Coding Academy is rather vague to me. What exactly the expense they are going to purchase is unknown and they should discuss this in more detail. Finally, the proposal does a great job in the team member list.

Instead they should provide more quantitative KPIs such as the number of brand partner, the amount of produced NFTs, etc. Besides, not only The Rotating Cardano Advisory Board but also the whole community should have the right to track the project development, therefore, they should provide a different method to publish the statistics relating to the project development.
