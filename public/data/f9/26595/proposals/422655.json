", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Proposers completed Plutus Cohort 2 and 3 and share an active GitHub code.  I accessed the proposed testbot (EndubisTestWallet in telegram) mentioned in the proposal and was not able to do anything with it, if you press the menu it just writes start in the messenger. As proposers are working on top of an existing proposal that was funded in F7, I would expect to see something tangible and/or FAQ on how to use this bot, but I was not able to do it. Attaching a short video on bot functionality would resolve it and at least demonstrate progress made to date, as it might just bad timing when I accessed the bot or it has to be used in a different way. Also, proposers planned to include P2P transfers in the original proposal, but include it in this proposal again - I understand it's called out in Auditability section below link to the original proposal, but it would be good to call out parts of functionality that were underestimated in the original proposal and included in this proposal again.\nPlan provided is a quarterly one, which is hard to track and I would prefer to see a weekly plan. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Proposal lacks clear milestone descriptions and, as mentioned in feasibility section, more frequent updates are expected (currently quarterly updates are provided). For instance, it is saying that Release of wallet on mainnet for Q3 2022 - but which functionalities will be included ? \nAlso, I'd like KPIs to be defined with some numbers that proposers want to achieve and timelines for achieving those KPIs e.g. 5 payment methods integrated, 2000  users of the wallet by 1st of January 2023", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2905", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8316, "q0": "This project is an extension from an already existing and functional project from Fund 7, which is a wallet called Endubis. Endubis was the proposer\u2019s way of bringing a more accessible method of ADA payment to the country of Ethiopia, and evidently their target audience was the newcomers of the crypto world or those not in favor of centralized apps. Based on this preference, the proposer brought Endubis to Telegram, one of the most commonly utilized chatting platforms worldwide. And it has been quite a hit to the people of Ethiopia, appealing to a good number of individuals in the community and 200 people currently trying it out on the testnet, which you can also test it out if you wish since the team does provide the link to the testnet. With the official version released on July 1st, the team expects to onboard an increasing number of users over time, proving the dedication and positive outlook the team has on their project. \nThis project will be an upgrade to Endubis, bringing additional features to further solidify a smooth and convenient user experience. Those features include a P2P exchange, integration with Fiat payment methods and integration with Defi platforms to enable asset swapping, lending and borrowing and guarantee security for those making the trades. All those features will come to the existing Endubis wallet in the form of an \u201cupdate\u201d, meaning it will still be functional and available as the new features are being merged into the mix. \nThe team has also brought up a potentially threatening risk to the challenge in the foreseeable future, which is the rumors of an upcoming ban on crypto trading in Ethiopia. Therefore, the team plans to tackle this problem with the P2P exchange feature itself, and to ensure that the project will not violate any national laws, the team has also enlisted the help of a lawyer. A thought-out move for the team in my opinion. \nNevertheless, there is one small flaw in this section. Even though there are estimated numbers put up to demonstrate the desirable success of the project, this section lacks the key metrics necessary to come up with those numbers. So I would suggest the proposer add those metrics for maximum clarity.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In this section, the proposer has managed to present a well-detailed description of the timeline they have for this project delivery, along with tasks needed to be accomplished in each quarter and milestones hoped to achieve from each quarter, with the set of new features expected to arrive in the first quarter of 2023.\nThe budget requested will be portioned out to cover the payments of individuals involved in the project, legalization expenses and the cloud hosting fee, combined to a total of $17,600. Personally, I would have loved to see more depictions regarding the activities taking place in each quarter and the costs for each and every one of them.\nThe 2 project members come with their respective online profiles that briefly describe their relevance and dedication to the project. Once again, I would prefer to have more details to dissect further and have a more conclusive assertion.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Right off the bat, the proposal immediately presents the KPIs for measuring the progress of the project, which I commend since they are must-haves in any proposal. The proposers also mention that they will be communicating with their customers and measuring the progress via the group chats and the contact-us section on the bot to maintain a satisfactory service, which is another commendable thing. \nSuccess for this project would evidently mean the people of Ethiopia would start welcoming Endubis and the added features with open arms and they will find convenience while using, at the same time learning a thing or two about Web3 and Cardano. The main SDGs and subgoals describe a gradual and steady growth and perfection of Endubis, affecting other aspects such as productivity, job creation, entrepreneurship, etc. And there are KPIs to measure those SDGs as well. Everything seemingly fits comfortably within the scope and objectives that this Dapps, Products and Integration challenge sets out for the proposals.

Only around 7% in the world are aware of this new technology of which only 3% know the underlying block chain technology. Hence it is very important to have an easy to use interface. Telegram is one of the most popular online chatting platforms around the world and is known for having useful bots. So the idea to introduce a wallet bot in telegram will be easily adaptable by many. The challenge strives to add more features and better user experience and upgrade the existing Endubis wallet. \nThis is exactly what the challenge is looking for and this proposal when implemented successfully, will help a lot of new comers to learn and be a part of the community.

Since the team has already pulled off the previous project with great success, more likely if funded the team will also be also to add the new features without much challenges. A clear road map is also provided by the team to a plan lasting till 2023. The budget breakdown was also clear. Note that the team aims at registering in 4 different parts of Africa and have asked for $6000 for the same.

The success and key milestones are carefully chosen and clearly match the success of the challenge in hand. The team has provided a link to check out the current condition of the wallet. The team has given number of users and payment methods as a means to track the progress. But there are the end results after completing the project. To track the progress , I would suggest the team to keep a record on a monthly basis. This would also help the team to have a strict deadline of the individual tasks and also to make any crucial decision further along the line and help in overall implementation of the project. Kindly do add few methods for auditing and tracking the progress of the project in the future project catalyst funding and do keep a record of the progress if the team gets funded.

The rumors of a potential ban on purchasing crypto in their country would be an important issue, being the mitigation proposed is the p2p exchange, which is indeed a good action item to work on.

However, the spending is calculated in 4 months only. The explanation of the time can show the logicality of the proposal, which hooks the voters vote on the proposal.
