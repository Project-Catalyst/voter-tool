According to him, the problem is that the cryptographic universe is growing very quickly and in a relatively disorderly way, which results in a lack of communication between projects (which could be very positive). In theory, this idea would be very beneficial for Cardano, from the moment that the projects (that is, their teams and collaborators) are better connected, being able to exchange experiences and benefiting each other. This relates directly to the topic, present in the challenge summary: \u201cintegrations with other existing services, products, and protocols that improve the end-user experience whether that's giving the user more options or making something easier to use that benefits the wider ecosystem\u201d ; since the idea is to organize projects/products/communities that already exist. This could contribute to the strengthening of the Cardano ecosystem in general, and perhaps with the success of the projects, new members would be attracted to our community, increasing the number of Ada in circulation, smart contracts and active tokens being minted on our blockchain, etc. that is, contemplating well the specific objectives of the challenge. However, in my opinion, this proposal was a little abstract, a little in the theoretical field. The proponents that \u201cwe are a group of individuals experienced in all aspects of the NFT generation, game development and Cardano ecosystem. We want to leverage this experience and put it into the development of an alliance that benefits IOG, Cardano, the projects we partner with and, most importantly, the users of the Cardano Ecosystem.\u201d With that, we know what the idea is, but through what activities would it come to fruition? How would this transparency and interoperability be put into practice? How would the projects interconnect, how would a bridge be established between them? I think these issues should be better explained, so that we could understand in practice what was going to happen and how. Another problem that I found here was the question of the challenges to be overcome, the biggest challenge, from what I understood, would be to convince other blockchain projects about the advantages of migrating to Cardano. The bidder claims that his team has the resources to deal with these obstacles, but what are those resources? It would be important to make this clearer. A very good way to understand what was being said is if the proponent brought us a practical example of how the alliance that would be created here could help some Cardano project (he could take as an example some group that already exists, for example the Catalyst School, or Wada, Cardano4Climate and so on. In summary, in theory the idea is fantastic and very well aligned with the objectives of the challenge (because I understand that this alliance would be established in some kind of Dapp, some interface); but it lacks important details, explanations about how these great ideas would be put into practice. Therefore, my note will express neutrality, it is not a bad proposal, it is in fact something interesting, but it lacked a more tangible content for it to be understood and confidence in its impact is conveyed.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Yes, in general the proposal is applicable in practice. But, analyzing what could be better, the proposal script is not as specific as it should be, I say this because the time chosen to separate each stage from the other is very long. First Q3 2022 is talked about and then Q3 2023: \u201cQ3 2022: Complete full team onboarding, increase marketing and awareness of Fluxus NFT & Gaming Alliance, grow NFT/Gaming partnerships to a total of 12 or more. Q4 2022 - Increase NFT/Gaming partnerships to a total of 20 or more, increase indirect partnerships (DeFi, Launchpads, etc.) to a total of 5 or more. start the integration and migration of NFT projects and games outside the Cardano Ecosystem.\u201d. In addition, the activities mentioned are only punctuated, as can be seen from the excerpts that I have attached here to demonstrate what I say, and not explained. There would need to be more detail about what will happen, how the development process would take place in practice. Speaking of the third quarter of the year, what would happen in each month? How would the process to complete the team go? And how would marketing be emphasized, how would this alliance be better publicized? How would partnerships be defined? This quarter is poorly specified, but the situation is even more spaced out next year, there are 6 months to develop project integration methods and increase the number of partnerships. In my view, the integration method is the heart of this proposal, so it would be important to have it defined at the moment when the idea is published on ideascale, because it constitutes the main part of the activities. So, unfortunately, the script still has a lot to improve. Now talking about the budget explanation, all the parts are explained in a superficial way (the best is the coding, we know the hourly rate); but otherwise, everything lacks detail. For example in the excerpts \u201cmarketing: $4,000 / artists: $3,000 / writer: $3,000 / producer: $4,000\u201d. How many artists would be hired? What would they do? How many hours would they work? How would the requested 3k dollars be split? How would the project coordinators act, how would commercialization be constituted in practice? It would be necessary for each part itself to be better detailed, so that we have a more specific understanding of the use of funding. Finally, analyzing the team, this is certainly the best part of the feasibility, we know the names of the members of this team, a small resume of each, we understand what their professional paths are and how they relate to Cardano; and with that, a lot of trust is transmitted, because they are given a lot of information and details and also their linkedin profiles, so that we can actually see what they have already done, checking all the information passed. I believe, based on the arguments presented, that the proposal is somehow viable, but it needs more detail, especially in the script and in the financial explanation.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is auditable, in general, but some improvements could also be made here. The auditability of progress is very good. We know, in detail, what the success metrics would be. The proponent is concerned with numerical data (such as \u201cnumber of Cardano NFT projects and games that partner with the alliance\u201d and \u201cnumber of other projects or platforms (DeFi, RealFi, Launchpads, etc.) that partner with the alliance\u201d; and also qualitative ones, such as \u201cPartner Satisfaction Scores\u201d and \u201cPartner Effort Scores.\u201d I believe, however, that two important things are missing here. Will the information reach the Cardano community? It would be necessary to know which channel of communication would be established, or telegram, discord, participation in Townhall, etc. Another thing would be the fact that the analysis of tasks is not so thorough, the proponent explains that if will guide you through the activities and orders listed in the script, but as I mentioned in the previous topic, the explanations are superficial. dictate the progress of the phases. For this problem to be resolved, it would be positive if the activities were better broken down, and the community had easy access to this data, as well as the partial results themselves. Now talking about the final success, the scenario outlined is accurate, which can be summarized in the excerpt \u201creach a sustainable position where we would not need to seek more funding from Project Catalyst, have more than 30 high quality projects/platforms and partnership [...] and develop a thriving, high-quality NFT ecosystem within Cardano for projects and users.\u201d I believe this sentence pretty much sums up what would be expected, but how would this greater result be proven? How could we be sure that this information will be palpable, verifiable, that the challenge's objectives were in fact achieved? I would like the proponent to be more specific on this point, also drawing a bridge of direct communication to the community. How can we be sure that the specific objectives present in the fundamentals of the challenge would be met, such as \u201cincreasing the number of dapps and products available for use by the community that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases + the number of integrations that bring together existing solutions for a more integrated and connected experience across different products + higher quality of existing products and integrations through suggested improvements that are supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community\u201d That said, I think the Auditability is good overall, with just a few issues to work on, to make the topic perfect.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 9485, "q0": "I give this section a 4 for successfully proving potential benefits with modeling evidence of other blockchain based alliances. While I can believe and imagine the benefits of such an organization, I do not feel like the given impacts are tangible enough to give a full 5 star rating. The proposal outlines some good values that the alliance intends to pursue but it doesn\u2019t really tell the story of what this alliance does to lead to adoption, interoperability and transparency. Logistically speaking, voters want to know what this alliance is going to do and how other NFT projects are going to benefit from that. The impacts are very broad and I think they need to be more specific. Just as a suggestion for visual improvement, I think this section could benefit from some more subheaders and signposting. It might be too dense for voters to read all the way through without some orginaztional features. I also see some opportunity to expand on proposal risks, such as an overflow of applications or perhaps a lack of recognition from entities like IOG. This would help show voters that you have put deeper thought beyond what most proposals evaluate in terms of risk assessment and response preparation. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I give this section a 4 for demonstrating that they are well overequipped to organize such a collaboration and a clearly outlined roadmap. Where this proposal loses points, for me, is in the budget details. While $30k isn\u2019t a lot relative to other Catalyst proposals, there is some question about the efficiency of the spending here. The only category that identifies a hour to cost breakdown is for the 100 hours of coding, which is paid at a rather high $100/hr. At this hourly rate, the amount translated to yearly salary comes out to $195k (which is about 3x the average salary in California where a lot of tech jobs exist). Based on what we\u2019re given, this is what voters will be left to assume without deeper justification as to why this is the determined pay rate. This section could benefit from or more through breakdown of each category of the budget by hours needed and rate per hour. There\u2019s no question that the team is capable of pulling this off, and at a relatively low overall cost. This one is a win for me.

The identification of various points of gathering data is a good start but I do think there\u2019s room for improvement by providing more objective target metrics. It\u2019s one thing to show which areas a proposal will be paying attention to but it\u2019s a big step up to demonstrate where this proposal wants to be at different timeframes of the project. This shows voters that the proposal is intentionally aiming at a specific target for success. I also think there\u2019s room for other metrics such as social media engagement, website traffic, representation from different NFT categories, and a reference point for when self-sustaining revenue is achieved.
