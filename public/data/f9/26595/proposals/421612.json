The proposal shows clearly why this would be valuable by explaining how ISPOs are a great fundraising technique for projects on Cardano, but they require a good amount of technical setup to be able to pull off.  This proposal intends to streamline that process by creating a \u201cplug and play\u201d ISPO tool.  I believe what they plan to create aligns well with the challenge, and certainly would provide a lot of value to people who want to set up ISPOs but aren\u2019t sure how.\n\nThis proposal states they intend to be back for future rounds of funding because in its current state, the project is not fully monetized and the team has no way of sustaining development. Ideally this wouldn\u2019t be the case, but that doesn\u2019t mean the proposal is not worth funding.  This project can still have a large impact on the Cardano ecosystem and still need funding in the future.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The CardanoPress team, who are the team behind this proposal, have already built website tools and plugins that help anyone build their own dApps on Cardano.  They also state they have a working BETA version of the product they want to build in this proposal. This shows they definitely have relevant experience that would help when implementing this proposal.  They also provide Linkedin or Github links for each member of the team for full transparency on who the team is and what experience they have.\n\nThey acknowledge one of the risks of this proposal is it relies heavily on Blockfrost APIs, and that each project will require API keys to be able to use their platform. It\u2019s unclear to me if they mean each project that wants to set up an ISPO will need their own API keys from blockfrost, or if they just mean that any project who wants to use Blockfrost API will need their own API keys. Either way, it seems they have left this section of the proposal unfinished and have forgotten to include how they plan to mitigate this risk.\n\nThe roadmap shows five clear steps the team plans to take, however it doesn\u2019t provide a timeline for how long each step is estimated to take, or even how long the whole project is estimated to take.  These estimates would be nice information to have so we can know if we can expect this project to be complete in a few weeks or in a few months.  \n\nIn the budget breakdown they also don\u2019t clearly state how long they plan to take, but they do provide the amount of hours they plan to take on a few specific things like development and UI/UX design. If you add up all the hours it\u2019s only 64 total hours they plan to work on this proposal.  Since I\u2019m guessing that is likely to be split up among the 4 members of the team, that would mean the project would be able to be implemented in under a week. Even if that assumption is wrong it seems this project will only take a maximum of 2 weeks to be implemented successfully.  The requested amount also seems pretty reasonable since it\u2019s only 2 weeks max of work and they already have a working BETA which I\u2019m assuming means a good chunk of development is already done.\n\nDespite the unclear timeline of this project, I still believe this proposal would be implemented successfully based on the info about the team and the amount of progress already made on their project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal states that progressive milestones will be measured to track the proposal\u2019s progress, but it doesn\u2019t state what those milestones are.  The timeline does provide some milestones to watch for, like when community feedback on the BETA version happens, or when the stable version of the product is ready for deployment, but I think more could be provided between these two.\n\nThe team also doesn\u2019t provide any public channel for the community to receive updates about this proposal.  This makes it difficult for the general public to track this proposal\u2019s progress.  An easy fix for this is providing a link to an official twitter account or discord group where updates can be posted for anyone interested in following along with this proposal\u2019s progress.  \n\nOne thing that this proposal states would be an indicator of success is if they see projects install the ISPO plugin on their websites and run an ISPO from those websites.  I believe this implies that one of their KPIs is the number of projects that implement their plugin.  The metric they provide that they claim would indicate success is if new users are creating new wallets to delegate to ISPOs.  I think this is less of a relevant indicator for this proposal than the first indicator provided. I see it more as a metric that indicates the growing popularity of Cardano that this proposal might be able to effect, but just because the number of new wallets increases, it doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate this proposal was the reason for that.\n\nBecause of the basic milestones and implied KPIs in this proposal, there is some information that could be used to track the progress, however a public channel for updates is pretty necessary for the community to keep up to date on the project.  I also believe the milestones and the KPIs could be more clearly defined to help increase the auditability of this proposal.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2826", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1480, "q0": "As the Cardano community expands, new and unique products are being developed to expand adoption and create better user experiences.

The only area that causes any concern is the relatively high rate of pay, $150/hour, that is associated with this proposal. In all assessments conducted to date, that rate of pay has only been seen for the most senior developers with decades of experience and impeccable credentials. This team certainly is on that path, but in the eyes of this assessor, that pay rate constitutes what may be perceived as inflated. I would be remiss in my duties as an assessor if I omitted this analysis, and it should only be viewed as constructive, respectful criticism.

In addition, this tool brings integration with the most common Cardano wallets, allowing those who intend to delegate their ADAs to be able to do so directly from the website. They aim to lower the barriers to entry of any project by providing plugins that allow anyone to build a WordPress website connected with Cardano wallets.\n\nThe problems observed are precisely the difficulty, often encountered, of building any application that has a direct connection with ADA wallets (which need a Dev. To integrate) and, in addition, the difficulty of calculating the rewards of delegation of ADA to SPO or ISPO.\n\nThis proposal aligns with the challenge in question precisely because it brings a new integration of Cardano. Each project that aims to facilitate the usability of the blockchain, not only for the client, but also for the developer/entrepreneur, is a proposal that follows Cardano's idea of becoming the world's number 1 blockchain. And, to achieve this goal, it is necessary to do what this project is doing, integrate functionality and make the blockchain more and more simple for people to use.\n\nThe goal of this project is to release the final version with the help of this fund. However, I miss metrics that are directly correlated with Cardano's goals, such as the increase in the number of wallets (mentioned), number of sites using the tool, etc., I expected to see this in number form, objectively.\n\nIn the project it doesn't say, but in the LitePaper found on the provided website it says about monetization and scalability strategies. Therefore, analyzing the paper, it is plausible that the project will be able to remain perennial.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In order to verify its feasibility, we need to verify the following aspects:\n1 \u2013 roadmap: The ideascale proposal presents the division of the project into phases, however it is not presented in a clear way, not containing the expected times to carry out each of the tasks. Looking at LitePaper, it doesn't look like what is described here because it contains a lot more tasks to be done. Therefore, despite having the perception that the proponents know what they are doing, there is a lack of detail on how they will do it and when they will deliver each task.\n\n2 \u2013 budget: The budget made is in relation to the working hours of the team members and is reasonable. What creates a bit of strangeness is that in the description of the script to be followed there are no definitions of times for each task, however this definition appears here. As a suggestion, for each part of the project description to talk to each other in a simpler and more fluid way, it would be interesting to improve the detailing of the tasks so that it talks better with the budget.\n\n3 \u2013 team: The team looks competent. No evidence was given about knowledge and experience, however as the BETA version has already been released, it is expected that this team will be able to deliver the rest of the project.\n\n4 \u2013 risk management: There is a highlighted risk, however, there was no inclusion of actions that can mitigate this risk. As a risk that has a direct impact on the operation of the platform, as a suggestion I put the need to add a mitigating action.\n\n5 \u2013 self-funding/scalability: There are no ideas presented for monetization and being self-sustaining in this part of the project, however, in LitePaper, there are some strategies to monetize the project, including the release forecast for including some of these strategies is Q42022. Therefore, I don't see much of a need to go back to the bottom of Catalyst for more monetization.\n\n6 \u2013 tasks: The proposer knows exactly which tasks they must complete to finalize the project successfully.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In order to audit, we need:\n1 \u2013 roadmap w/ milestones: This part is very important so that we can verify the partial deliveries of the project and follow its development. Due to the lack of a very detailed script, not even in LitePaper, it jeopardizes this monitoring. Therefore, to improve the quality of this aspect, it is necessary to include more information in the roadmap.\n\n2 \u2013 Metrics and KPI: As the objective of the project is to move from the BETA version to the final version, the metrics associated with this process would be user feedback, for example, quantifying and qualitatively separating them. And when finished, you could add the number of customers using this tool. Adding these metrics to the project would be important.\n\n3 \u2013 Channel: They have their own channels that can be used to share news and information.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2298", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 1, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2105, "q0": "ISPO is a popular and unique way to raise funds on Cardano but requires technical setup and knowledge to query user staking data and calculate rewards and distributions.

At the same time, who will be the main responsible person in each of those stages? Followed by a budget presentation, the proposed $9600 request for this project is used to pay the salaries of professionals and a very thorough explanation of the activities involved.

That plugin allows the integrators to delegate the stake directly on the integration website. This is the necessary streamlined usability we need to have.\nThe plugin relies on other projects that are build on cardano and as a developer I really believe in this approach rather than doing everything yourself, trusting and building on top of others' work.\nOverall this is a really interesting proposal with decent KPIs and I'd really like to see it grow and I'm interested as to where it's headed.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There's a simple timeline and a roadmap that would iteratively develop the current proposal to it's complete state and hopefully success.

It's ok to say development in the roadmap but in the actual broken down tasks I was hoping for something more concrete. That is the case for the other points noted in the milestones as well. As I mentioned the time and the hourly rates are great, but as a voter I'd want to know what exactly will be developed and if I'm a developer, I'd want to follow along with the projects implementation and that's currently really hard to do given the lack of technical detail.\nI was able to verify the team members and they do seem to have the necessary credentials to make things happen and implement the proposal so we're all good on that front.\nConsidering all the mentioned points before I'd say the project has some flaws for sure, but the low budget does make it somewhat apealing considering what the end result could be. I'd leave every voter to decide, but the value/cost is good and risk / reward is decent as well, although there is some risk.
