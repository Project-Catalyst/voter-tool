All offer exceptional value propositions and are perhaps amongst the top 1% in terms of quality in this round. Let\u2019s dive in. \n\nBeginning with the problem statement, we find out that the tertiary education systems in emerging markets do not provide adequate access to jobs and only cater to those with the existing financial means to finance the lengthy process - only 8% of the youth population in Africa. The value proposition is to unlock access to higher education through income sharing agreements in which students agree to finance it through pre-determined payments after graduation, based on a percentage of their income. The link with the Cardano ecosystem is that Seedstars intends to build these agreements on-chain and to tokenize them. \n\nFor this proposal in particular, they are seeking funding for two complementary avenues. First, to run an in-depth analysis to fully understand the value chain of these types of agreements in emerging markets by looking at existing models and making sense of their efficiency. Second, to explore the blockchain developments and seek appropriate tokenizing mechanisms for these agreements. \n\nThere is a unique blend of circumstances that makes this proposal (and the other two) absolutely extraordinary in terms of impact: \n\n- a partnership between so many organizations, including Cardano native ones, is bound to offer excellent visibility to the project and access to additional sources of funding, competence, networking effects and the change of onboarding the best possible team\n- the use case is exceptional as well, since it is a blend of acting within the emerging markets, the youth population and it\u2019s a real life use case\n- there seems to be a slow and steady philosophy behind the project and the team, very much in sync with Cardano\u2019s ethos and its way of doing business, research and anything in between. \n\nOf course, five stars for potential impact. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Let\u2019s find out more about this joint venture. Seedstars is an organization with more than 80 members focused on influencing people's lives in emerging markets through technology and entrepreneurship. They are the lead proposers, and they have partnered with four other organizations for this project. ProofSpace is an identity network focused on issuing and verifying decentralized identity credentials with no-code tools. Cardashift is a (Cardano native) launchpad that raises funds for startups that are solving social and environmental issues. Smart Chain implements distributed ledger solutions. Last but not least, Chancen International provides financing for young people in Africa to access tertiary education. Of course, all of the teams have an excellent presentation of their core teams and as a second step you have their websites on which you can spend hours and hours while reading about their ongoing projects and past successes. \n\nTheir work plan is one of the most extensive from this financing round - it\u2019s only normal, otherwise it would be impossible to coordinate between five medium sized organizations. As far as I could tell the activities for this proposal would extend until at least 2023, and it has very concise actions and responsible partners for each of them. There are good indications that all partners have devoted time and resources into writing this proposal, and they will continue to do so in the future, having already accounted for the necessary time / human resources needed for it. The project plan is complemented by an extensive list of advantages for the Cardano ecosystem: possible charity staking pools, bottom-up adoption for the target markets or creation of new technical standards. The proposers are doing an excellent job at recognizing and planning for certain risks, and the entire exercise showcases that we are dealing with mature organizations that have extensive experience in running similar projects, so it\u2019s unlikely to encounter significant unforeseen conditions down the road.\n\nThe budget is presented in a separate sheet, and is very easy to understand. The majority of it would be spent on research (almost 500 h), with Seedstars performing slightly more than the other members (almost 200, vs under 75 for every other partner). The hourly rate charged is 200 USD, perhaps slightly on the high end considering the project will most likely include some junior or mid level analyst hours which should perhaps be charged at a lower rate. But voters are definitely the ones who should judge the value for money so no points deducted for this reason. \n\nAgain, a proposal that beautifully meets all the requirements of the guidelines and is a very easy choice in going with five stars in the feasibility section. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Given the research focus of this proposal, the team manages to come up with a comprehensive framework for understanding how to track the project as well as how to measure its success and put it in the right perspective. The novelty of the solution will be accounted for by its adoption through on-chain mechanisms, while quantitative metrics will be used to assess its popularity: number of agreements issued, organizations using that very model to issue their own agreements, as well as more traditional measures useful for web metrics: click through rates, unique visitors for their financial education content. \n\nThe deliverables will include a value chain map, gap analysis, potential uses for the tokens and future research avenues to explore. In conclusion, we have here a very strong joint venture of enterprises that are undoubtedly used to frequently reporting to their stakeholders and to offer transparency for their work, so there is no doubt that together they will be able to do an outstanding job in ensuring full auditability for this project if implemented.

This ambitious project authored by Seedstars, and supported by the likes of Proofspace, Smart Chain and Chancen International, does exactly that. The current stage of the development of this multi fund spanning proposal is to do the massive investigatory work necessary to tokenize and support Income Share Agreements (ISA) between learners in developing nations and funding institutions that commit to supporting the project. Primarily designed to suss out a Proof of Concept and answer a myriad of related and integral questions, this project could lead to mass adoption of Cardano, Atala Prism (or DiDs in general i.e. Proofspace) and onboard many individual learners and institutions from developing nations. The identification of talented individuals that could benefit from educational opportunities and are willing to strike an income based repayment agreement form the core integrations of this bold proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Seedstars, Proofspace, Smart Chain and Chancen International are all co-proposers of this project and are very respected organizations with a well documented history of delivering significant solutions to complex problems. There are too many qualified team members to include in an assessment, but the brain trust behind this proposal is quite formidable with a long trach record of success. If funded, this proposal will return for future funding as this phase is primarily dedicated to research. Given the organization framework and the strength of the individual team members alone, this project is both highly feasible and impactful. A clearly articulated vision and a past history of success push the boundaries of likely success to the limits of one\u2019s own imagination.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As this is a proposal geared towards research and the generation of Proof of Concept, metric analysis is a little harder to construct. Despite this constraint, Tokenizing Income Share provides both measurable and subjective KPIs that are more than able to provide the level of auditability required by Project Catalyst to be eligible for funding. Chief amongst these are the numbers of wallets created, DiDs issued, ISAs adopted, users onboarded to Cardano and numbers of Cardano users who interact the education finance providers. Long term metrics to be investigated include creation of the road map, usage of tokens generated by the project etc. Certainly there exists a vast array of metrics from which verification and auditability standards can be transparent and easily measured.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2252", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4532, "q0": "[My comment here has overlapped content with my comments for the other proposal in Fund9 from the same proposer since those proposals share a  portion of content] I strongly agree that this project has a great impact. The proposer provides information with a high level of clarity that the project meets the goals of the challenge (i.e., tokenization of real-world assets and building a marketplace for such tokenized assets and auxiliary Defi servcies that will attract a large new set of Cardano users, create other infrastructure that further increases the adoption for Cardano such as new technical standards for education-linked tokens). It also meets Fund9's strategic goals (i.e., prepare a group of people able to make contributions to the ecosystems, and build real-world solutions based on the Cardano blockchain). The proposer presents a metric that only 8% of the youth population in Africa could assess high-quality private education system, thus this project (with this proposal being the initial part) has a large impact by increasing the percentage of the population who can access better tertiary education. The proposer includes in their plan the consideration to scale this solution to other emerging markets. This proposal is the first stage of a longer-term project Understanding the current stage of the ISA value chain and exploring potential mechanisms for tokenization of education-linked assets is a crucial foundation to set the project for success.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "[My comment here has overlapped content with my comments for the other proposal in Fund9 from the same proposer since those proposals share a  portion of content] I strongly agree with the feasibility aspect of this proposal. The team (including lead submitters and co-submitters) consists of groups that have demonstrated their experience in relevant fields (education, training, startup incubation, digital identity, blockchain research) as well as their activeness in the Cardano ecosystem: Seedstars, ProofSpace, Smart Chain, Chance International.  The lead submitter - Seedstart itself, has a long track record of being able to scale its operations across countries (enabled entrepreneurs across 75 emerging markets, supported 37k+ entrepreneurs, delivered training for 2k+, and invested in 75 companies). The objectives of this proposal are to (1) understand the current state of ISA in the target emerging markets and (2) research potential mechanisms to build tokenized ISAs on-chain. The team has done comprehensive preparation work that includes the initial workflow and a detailed work plan. The work plan comprises planned activities to be carried out, their deliverables, their methodologies and tools, the team in charge, the hours required, the planned start time, and the duration of such activity. It is one of the best, most comprehensive work plan I have seen so far on Catalyst. One implementation risk I see is the coordination and project management risk, as there are four different organizations involved in this project, but the detailed work plan should mitigate that risk. In terms of budget, the team states an hourly rate of $200 per hour for all the roles.  $200/hour is a high rate. To put things in perspective, the fee to hire freelance consultants in the U.S. ranges from $50 to $150 per hour, with the upper price band corresponding to consultants with more than 20 years of experience. I would hope to see more details regarding the experience level and other requirements (location, degree, how difficult it is to hire such a position) of each role in order to have more information to assess the hourly rate. regarding the roadmap, this preliminary use-case testing phase will last for three months, from September to December 2022.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "[My comment here has overlapped content with my comments for the other proposal in Fund9 from the same proposer since those proposals share a  portion of content] I strongly agree that this project is auditable, thanks to the clarify provided by a comprehensive work plan and the set of key research questions being defined.
