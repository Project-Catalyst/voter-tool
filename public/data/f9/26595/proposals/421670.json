This proposal is certainly a great idea and a big deal for Cardano, as it represents a very strategic use case for our blockchain technologies to be used in the daily lives of a large number of people. Proponents state that investing in the travel sector is something that could be very profitable for Cardano, both in terms of getting more people to know and start using our technologies in case more is in circulation and in terms of the environment. This is made very clear in the excerpt \u201cReusable ID for international travel represents a current market opportunity of US$1 billion, with expansion upgrade to US$4.82 billion by 2026 (\u2026)\u201d. That is, an amount of money that circulates in this sector of the economy is extremely expressive, in addition, as Atala Prism DIDs were related to this activity, the number of active members in Cardano will certainly increase: \u201cAtala PRISM will become the dominant credential format in the travel and ADA sector and used directly to new users and transactions for Cardano through the ADA incentive sector of the use of PRISM credentials\u201d. The need to carry out this project is very clear: as travel agents (the \u201cOTA\u201d (Online Travel Agent) groups that include several companies in the travel industry, whether for tickets, accommodation, etc. your customers. If the travel data were from the data on the blockchain, a series of advantages to be designed, for having greater security, in addition to the fact that the data did not inform the privacy that it would have the same security sometimes. It is very important for us to have more confidence about the impact of the proposal that the group already has before and already has a project on the same theme being developed. Talking more about a proposed solution, it serves for government and travel-related business solutions to be of various types, such as \u201ctravel websites, tour operators, booking engines, hotel property management systems, rating systems, CRM, loyalty systems\u201d, can coin on the blockchain as information about travelers. As important sources for global businesses, Booking or Airbnb is a source that includes local and regional source sites. This will be an important showcase for the industry on the travel journey using the Atala Prism digital ID.\u201d Should these companies have been changed as a set of Private companies and adjusted to a market of advantages that will change, such as Cardano's chances of increasing significantly and more widely. A great idea: \u201cIn the pilot promotions, we propose to encourage the first 500 thinkers to think about the impact of the following Traveler ID solution with a payment of US$ 20 in ADA. This has the added benefit of also helping new users to Cardano.\u201d This, in my view, is essential for new users using Cardano technologies. I believe that most people are still not familiar with blockchain and that not everyone is easily/interested in learning new technologies, so having a dollar incentive is really an effective way to reach this audience right now. Then think that as people will realize the advantages of having a DID space, they will naturally learn more about and to the extent cryptographic. We have a number of positives without impact: the description of the workflow, a great breakdown of the proposal's impact for all parties involved, a statement of what information would be included here, and much more. In addition, bidders are well aware of the risks and how to overcome them. Without a doubt, top marks for the impact.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is very good, as is the topic of the script, but I have a few suggestions to make. Talking about the roadmap, first we have listed various activities to do (\u201cCompile a list of OTA early adopters, Onboard an OTA pilot partner, MVP Integration, Design and finalize the OTA workflow, including the ADA\" and so on); then we have information about what would happen each month, in terms of deliverables and milestones, respectively. In my view, when proponents present us with two separate types of information, the understanding is a little more confusing, in my view it would be more interesting if the tasks that were presented at the beginning were embedded in the respective months, and that they were also better detailed. For example in September, we know that the activities would be, in addition to receiving the funds, the complete market research and the definition of the pilot OTA partner. It would be interesting if more information had been provided for both sides. What would market research look like? The proponents already present us with so much information, that it would be interesting to understand what else they will study and understand about the scenario to be worked on here. I would also like to know how the partner company would be established, it would be positive if the bidders had listed the main options and also what parameters would be used to make this choice. In the months of January and February, we were not able to understand with specificity what would be done, as little information is provided. It is said that at this stage there would already be \u201cTarvellers on board + Final Use Case Analysis and Reports\u201d. How could we understand what the experience of the first travelers who would be using the final version of the product would be like, how would use cases be analyzed and reports prepared? In my view, the very technical parts of the proposal, such as the work of the developers and also the integration with Atala Prism technologies, do not require such detailed explanations, but some parts of the roadmap could be explained more precisely. A very positive point about the script is that they provide a link to an online document in which the workload is better explained, it really is quite rare that there is so much information and so much detail about it, and very positive. Speaking of the budget division, the asking amount of 39,150 dollars is divided into some parts, we know what the deliverables would be, the tasks, the hours dedicated to this and the total money that would be invested. Regarding the division of parts, the level of detail is very adequate since each deliverable is divided into tasks, so we know exactly what should be done for each larger part. Regarding the hourly rate charged by professionals, in my view it is an expensive amount, as most of the proposals that I evaluate establish a value of 50 dollars per hour for the work even of developers (in the case of smart contracts the value goes up a little). However, it is up to the Cardano community to decide whether in fact the value is fair or not. And finally, analyzing the team, this part is great, we know who those involved are, their names, linkedin profiles, we know who has experience with Cardano and also in what way (one of the members is even active in the Cardano4Climate community); trust is also transmitted automatically as they already have a proposal on the same subject financed and under development.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The way proponents suggest that we track progress is very good, if not perfect. They provide us with various KPIs that would help us understand the partial success of the project, for example \u201cPublish booking workflow completed, Confirm integrated OTA partner, Confirm any other integrated OTA partners, Integrations and configuration in progress\u201d. They also claim that all of this information will be made known to our community members through monthly reports that will be posted on community channels - what would those channels be? In addition to understanding what would have been delivered that month, it would be interesting if the proponents made a summary of the work routine of the professionals involved, what each one would have done to contribute to such milestones being reached. In my view, this would be suitable for us to have an understanding of both sides of the coin - the tasks and activities done and the products generated by that. Moving on to the second part of the analysis, which deals with the auditability of success, the proponents define exactly what is expected (\u201cto have a successful integration with an OTA, creating a new use case for Cardano and Dapp technology for the community. The travel industry is important and this proposal starts with an industry-critical connectivity use case. Online travel agents have the interface for a large number of travelers, which can lead to mass adoption\u201d, etc. ); and also how this could be perceived through direct data: \u201cThe integration process - the delivery will be the integration flowchart, API available to other OTAs, Use Case Documentation\u201d and etc. I think that we are already very well situated, I believe that the most important information that remained pending would be through which means of communication this would be made available to our community, for example if they would post this final research on social networks, or if they would make a video for make it available on youtube, they would participate in Townhall and so on. How would this information be palpable for the members of our ecosystem? I think a super interesting idea could be to bring some more information: reports of companies/clients that would be making use of the technologies presented here, how DIDs would be being used, in practice, what advantages mentioned in the impact part would actually be being presented to the parties involved. It would also be positive if the proponents brought us more information that said about the benefits of the project for Cardano - for example the number of digital wallets that were created from this project. For these reasons, I believe that the auditability is very good, it is possible for us to monitor the project with security, the suggestions I made would be to raise the quality level of this topic even more.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3481, "q0": "The idea of having a decentralized traveler ID based on Cardano blockchain brings many benefits for Travel operators and traveller itself. Proposal does a great job explaining this benefits for all stakeholders.

The scope of this fund is to develop the MVP and its very nice they start it with a market validation, engaging a potential early adotper in OTA to test the solution and testing it before making it available widely. This helps to minimze commercial risks later on. They also provide a engagement strategy for bring the travellers to test it, by rewarding them with a 20$ dollars in ADA.\nThe risk management part is fair, having them mitigated mostly based on the partnership with eRevMax, which already seems to have relationships with several hospitality players (at least by their website) and might facilitate their access to this market.\nIn a summary, its a good idea and a proposal well articulated, that might help to build new Cardano use cases. My rate is 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There's a good time-framed plan in place that includes good activities and provides a good sense on what is going to be made and how.

They provide a good description on the people of each company with multiple links to serve as reference. They all seem to have the capabilities necessary to execute this project succesfully. Besides this, they already had a project funded in past round near its completition.\n\nMy rate is 5.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As the scope of this proposal is only to develop a MVP/pilot, it makes sense not to have typical adoption kpis (such as number of users). Instead, it is provided several deliverables and milestones that will help to track this project progress. Its they include feedbacks in the last milestone. If an agile framework is adopted, srpint reports (in addiiton to the monthly ones) and product backlog could also be made available. \nOne smaller suggestion I'd make here is to make clearer what \"community channels\" are the ones mentioned (probably the social media provided), so its easier for everyone to know where to look for.

It also helps to increase efficiency of travel websites. The proposer wants to promote cardano by incentivize the first 500 travelers with payment is ADA.

The Traveler ID is issued by the Atala Prism application (a self-sovereign identity (SSI) platform built on Cardano by IOG company), while OTA's customer registration forms are built on the Spoofspace application (a no-code decentralized ID app). This proposal has many positive impacts on both travel agencies and customers, including: (1) For OTAs: (i) Expensive customer information integration systems from multiple sources are no longer needed; (ii) Quick and easy booking procedures (one-click), (iii) Simple creation of booking forms (using SpoofSpace App); (iv) Customer credentials are transparent and reliable; (v) in the future, OTAs can connect wallets, NFTs on Cardano platform to provide many other services to customers; (2) For customers: (i) Customers don't have to enter the same credential information too many times; (ii) Customers decide by themselves what information they want to share.
