This project would be very beneficial for both NGOs and Cardano. Firstly, this could potentially increase the number of donations being made to the most diverse NGOs, both because, once the donors understand how the blockchain works and understand all the transparency of the thing, they feel more motivated to donate, since that they would be sure that their money was actually being used by that NGO and for the desired ends. Another point that I think would help with the increase in donations would be the fact that on a single platform, several NGOs with different themes would be brought together, that is, different types of donors could perform these actions (whether for the animal cause, protection against women , fight against hunger, etc.), not to mention the fact that doing everything online would increase the degree of practicality, which could also contribute to an increase in the number of donations. This would be a fantastic way to introduce blockchain and Cardano to new audiences, as we wouldn't be trying to get new users to come through new technology; in fact, they would be people who would already be interested in donating, and Cardano's technologies would only be intermediaries. In this way, the specific objectives of the challenge would be solved: the creation of a Dapp (in this case, a platform, a website) that increases the number of users of our blockchain technologies, number of smart contracts and Ada in circulation, popularization and wide adoption of Cardano and etc. Theoretically, everything is perfect, but I think some explanations were pending so that our understanding was complete about the impact of the proposal. The first question that came to my mind when reading the idea was: how would donors who have never heard of (or who know, but do not understand about) blockchain learn to create a digital wallet and carry out transactions on Cardano? This is cited in risk 1 (\u201cthe challenges mentioned above are in the decentralized nature of the project, so we need to approach NGOs professionally and prove to them that blockchain can help them restore donor trust, as well as make the process of receiving payments easier and much faster\u201d); but it is not clear how this would be resolved, in the mitigation part. Would these transactions be done in Ada? How would NGOs that do not believe in blockchain technology be educated, how would they come to trust? I think these details are lacking in the approach to the idea, because in theory it is perfect, but in practice we would need more security in the sense that both donors and NGOs understand what blockchain is and learn to do the basic processes in the decentralized network. . The proponent comments on the difficulty with NGOs and says he will try to resolve this, but does not explain how. Therefore, if this were clarified, the grade would be maximum, but it is still an issue to be worked on.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Starting with my comments in relation to the team, I believe that this part is practically perfect, as the ideal would be if all the professionals needed to carry out the project were already defined. A lot of confidence is conveyed in the professionals involved who are introduced to us, as they attach detailed information about each. Their names are said, a short summary of their training and professional backgrounds and CVs, linkedin profiles (where we can find out everything that has been passed on and get to know them more intimately), in addition to the fact that the team has a specialist in Cardano (Mohammad Mneimneh), which conveys security that they are people prepared to deal with our blockchain technologies. It seems to me to be a competent and capable group, capable of carrying out this project successfully. Regarding the other parts of feasibility, roadmap and budget, unfortunately the information is not passed with the same level of adequacy. For example, the script: it's good, but it's not ideal. The project is divided into a few phases, and the activities that would be carried out and each one of them are listed in topics, as well as how many months they would take. We were able to understand what would be produced and approximately when, but not so precisely. Ideally, this division would be done in months, for example, phase 1, month 1: such things would happen; phase 2: month 1 would happen this, month 2 would happen that, and so on. The activities could also be a little more detailed. For example, in phase 2, the \u201cportal audit and implementation of best practices improvement\u201d would take place. How would this process develop, exactly? Which professional would be working here, and doing what activities? In phase 1, the marketing campaign would be carried out, but how, in fact, would it be built and disseminated? Marketing is a crucial part of this process, as it is necessary for people to know about this new way of donating, for NGOs to understand the tool and be willing to participate, it is necessary for everyone to understand how to do the processes, etc. So it would be important, in my opinion, for all of this to be better explained. It is a really complex and large project, which increases the need for a very detailed and specific roadmap in relation to the phases and what would be developed in each. Finally, analyzing the funding requested, the total amount is divided into some parts, but these are not as well detailed (some less than others, for example we know exactly the hourly value of the smart contract developer but not the UI designer/ UX). It would be important for all parts to be well explained, like the marketing budget, why would it cost 10k dollars, how would that money be used? In general, I think it's a super viable proposal, but a few more details would enrich this understanding of the script and the use of the requested funding.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability of the proposal is very good, but some necessary things could be added to convey more security in this part of the proposal. Starting with the analysis of the process, the suggested KPIs are all numbers and refer to the partial results, such as \u201cnumbers of NGOs listed on our platform, numbers of donors and amount of cryptocurrency donations\u201d. Certainly this data is necessary for us to understand in a practical and concrete way if the project would be succeeding in what it set out to do; but it is not possible to understand the unfolding of the phases and daily work of professionals based on this data. It is important to know if the professionals involved are performing their tasks as agreed, if the advances in production are happening as expected, that is, if they are working the hours that were defined, if the tasks necessary for such numbers to grow are being performed. . In other words, it is positive that the proponent and his team make us aware of how the construction of the platform itself would be, and not only of what is generated from this tool. In this regard, it is important that, together with the provision of the data he cites, we are told how the execution of the phases has been. I believe that reports at the end of each month could add this information, the important thing is that the Cardano community is aware of everything in a simple and direct way; such information can be transmitted either through a written report (as I suggested), or through illustrative messages disseminated in our community communication channels (telegram, discord, etc); in short, the important thing is that knowledge reaches the members of our ecosystem, in one way or another. Talking about the final results, I think the analyzes suggested by the proponent are great, but they are very focused on the success of the tool itself and how it would be contributing to the benefit of NGOs. The only topic specifically aimed at Cardano is \u201c2. Converting NGOs to Cryptographic Space\u201d. Therefore, my suggestion is that the team make a study especially to understand if the specific objectives of the challenge would be addressed, that is: if this platform contributed to new active members in the community; if all donations were made in Ada, if the number of smart contracts has increased considerably; whether the project has driven Cardano adoption, compared to other blockchains and etc. That said, in my opinion the proposal is very auditable, but some more studies should be included in the consequences analysis, too, to improve the topic even further.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3444, "q0": "The idea is very valid and addresses the challenge, by creating a new Dapp which will utilize cardano blockchain (increasing challenge KPI \"Increasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases.\"). At the same time, it targets a noble cause by delivering a solution to make donations to NGO more transparent and, potentially, increase them, benefiting both sides. Problem statement is clear and solution addresses it.\nIn regarding to the proposal itself, it is generally well written, highlighting very clearly the value proposition for all sides (Donors, NGOs, vendors and Cardano). Risk management is also well done, with several good challenges identified and properly mitigated. However, a few more information could be provided in the business model of the Dapp, informing how to stay profitable and where to act (globally? locally? in a specific region?), for instance. Naturally, initial scouting and contact with selected NGO would have to be done first and then a communication/advertising strategy would benefit proposal a lot. Other suggestion would be to get in contact with the NGO even before starting developing it to validate the concept and test if they would be interested.\nConsidering all of this, this is a good proposal that addresses challenges, can improve Cardano adoption might have positive sustainability (either social or envirmental, depending on the NGOs) impact, it just need some small improvements to make it more robust. My rating then is 4.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There's a very good time-framed plan proposed, with the main product deliverables listed and other development activities, all matching project scope. It is good to see that Marketing campaign is considered in the plan, this is key for this project.\nBudget breakdown is well done, with the main expenses listed and their hours required stated, giving more transparency to it. it also matches acitvites and deliverables present in the plan.\nFinally, in regarding to the team, there are 5 people already committed with background in business development, marketing, Cardano, network in NGOs and management experience. A good description on their experience, their roles and linkedin links are provided. The only reason that I'll not rate 5 here is because there's stilla technical team to be hired", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There are lots of good kpis provided to assess project success and they all have a pre-defined goal. there's also a very nice phased definition of success, with short, medium and long term milestones that do seem imporant to track progress.

In fact, some NGOs are losing fund due to misuse or theft. Therefore, to solve this problem, the proposer suggest a platform on Cardano decentralized blockchain to track transactions and vertify spending which is absent from donors and NGOs. At the later stage, the proposer would like to develop an extension platform to select and enlist vendors offering relevant products/services that NGOs need based on their causes; for example, for animal welfare NGOs provide food supplier, for kids education provide school material supplier,...I think, this idea is promising as it deals with real problem happening everyday in NGOs and create transparent environment for donors, NGOs, and vendors that donation could come to the receiver and used for right purpose. In addition, in my opinion, this proposal is suitable for the challenge \"Dapp, Products & Integrations\" as their solution will help NGOs improve in transparency problems, as a result, donations/funds are used properly to bring positive changes to different goals: environment protection, human rights, disadvantaged people,..hence, attracting individuals or organizations onboarding to Cardano ecosystem and more adoption of Cardano blockchain. However, this idea is ambitious and risky as the author has to deal with many challenges ahead:  Will NGOs willing to use blockchain and want to be transparent and how to persuade them? Where could you find the donors? How could you vertify vendors? What kind of influencers is willing to promote your platform? are they expertise in technology or celebrities? .....in which we need a strategic and professional approach to NGOs, from that they see its advantages to centralized methods and your platform need to be user-friendly, convenient, easy-to-use for users. My thought is that if we could persuade the donors first, then we could persuade the NGOs later becauses if the donors is only willing to donate via your platform, then the NGOs must accept that. The most difficult things is to onboard people who haven't had any idea about blockchain and its advantage could bring about in the long term. After all, I support their idea, I think it's good, I am looking forward to what the team could do in the future.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "From what the proposer presents, I think, the feasibility of this proposal is possible but not easy. In term of the plan, it is devided into 5 phrases with main focus in each stage. For each stage, I think the amount of work is quite large which requires great commitments and talented teams. As I know, the main focus on Phrase 1 is The Launch of the platform which requires a lot of technical works such as developing UI UX, use cases, user journey website, donation portal, but at present there are not professionals who in charge of technical work yet, and they are still recruiting UI UX designer, developers. Therefore, this make me wonder about the executing ability of this Phrase 1 on time? In addition, marketing campaign and social media engagement plan will be run in parallel with the development of the platform, but my question are: what kind of marketing campaign will they do for NGOs and donors here?  How could they engage audience via socia media? What kind of social media will they use?... Moreover, we are clearly about the completion milestones for Phrase 1,2,3, but for Phrase 4 and 5, the proposer haven't shown the exact milestone yet. For example, the author will finish Phrase 1 after 2 months. But the timeline for each phrase is not shown here: When will they start on phrase 1, from which month to which month? Regarding the project's expense, from the proposal, I know that, the budget is required for Phrase 1 only in 2 months. As I said, at present, the team do not have developers and designers, so from the consultation with Developers in Cardano community, the breakdown of budget is given, I think it is okay, but needs to be more detailed on: How many hours per day could designers/developers dedidate? How could you calculate marketing cost? Finally, about the team, the proposer shows quite detailed of 5 members' profile: I know their name, how many years of experience as a Business Developer, Marketing Expert, Cardano Expert, Anthropologist and Chief Financial Officer with Linkedin provided, but lack developers and designers. After all, their solution is still at the idea stage, therefore, at this moment, it's hard to know exactly how this platform look like and the chance of success of this project.

", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of this project is possible. To manage the development of the proposal, the proposer could base on some key metrics: the number of NGOs and donors enlisted, amount of crypto donations, amount of NFT and token reward to donors, the number of vendors, amounts of transactions,..Besides these indicators, I suggest the proposer to have offical channels for building strong community engagement and following the project such as social media, Discord, Github, website,..In addition, I recommend the proposer should have monthly report, might be in documents and share public to community to get more valuable feedbacks on improving your platform.

Mismanagement and embezzlement of global humanitarian aid and donation is indeed a real-world problem which has been around for a long time. Besides, current Web 2.0 methods of managing donations can be extremely inefficient. I believe Cardano currently has the necessary infrastructure to ensure global donations are managed in a more efficient and transparent manner. The proposal sets out to be one of the pioneering Dapps to do just that. \n\nThe proposal also articulates clearly how it brings value to the Cardano ecosystem in terms of bringing substantial, impactful real-life use cases to the Blockchain, using Cardano infrastructure to create positive impacts to nation governance systems. What all these set out to accomplish for Cardano is allowing the world to finally interact with the Cardano ecosystem and discovering its tremendous use-cases to remedy what\u2019s lacking in Web 2.0 technology. \n\n\tThe key metrics indicate a great potential impact for this proposal. \n\nI believe the proposal is highly scalable for future challenges as it is a rather neutral platform open to all NGOs of all nationalities and causes. Its neutral nature allows it to evolve over time. Besides, there are plans to generate team expenditure via 1% transaction fee for each donation, rendering it less reliant on future fundings. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "GIven the experience presented, this proposal conveys a huge confidence in the successful implementation of this proposal. However, given the technical infrastructure behind what the team proposed to build, I think the proposal can be greatly benefited from providing more explanation on the tech department. Specifically, what sort of qualifications are they looking for in their tech department? This is on top of the tech department being the most heavily funded department (at $64,000 out of the total requested fund of $84,000). \n\nI think the total requested budget of $84,000 is largely reasonable, given the amount of personnels needed in the tech department. However I think there should be more explanation on what entails marketing budget. Will the team be doing both online/offline marketing?; Are business trips to meeting stakeholders under the supposed marketing budget? These are the questions I have in mind while assessing the requested fund. \n\nWith regards to timeline, I think the team has done a great job in covering the best they can whilst providing a reasonable timeframe for themselves. Although Phase 2 - 4 are not detailed, it is completely understandable given the complex nature of this proposal such as requiring multiple parties from different industries and technical complexities. Besides, the proposal has conveyed greatly what they set out to do over the long-run. \n\nThe greatest challenge of this proposal is identified as many NGOs' potential unwillingness to participate in this project, rendering the project\u2019s effort to onboard NGOs a huge feat. However, given the team\u2019s capabilities, I am confident the team has what it takes to attract only the most innovative, sincere NGOs whose aim is to ensure donations and aid are utilised properly by their recipients. \n\nOn a side note, a factor that affects the proposal\u2019s feasibility is its affiliation with the team\u2019s proposal under Fund 9: DAO <3 Cardano. As this proposal is highly related to the aforementioned proposal, it should be expected that the success of this proposal will be heavily affected by the other proposal from the team. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There is clarity in description of the targeted problem and how it is tied to the proposed solution and proposal.

The proposal could have a big impact on the Cardano ecosystem because all the people who have an NGO can use it and also the people who want to follow up on the transparency of the companies. A number of goals have been drawn up with a breakdown between donors, NGOs, sellers and Cardano. The benefits are clearly listed and provide a clear picture of how this project can make a positive contribution. Future challenges are included in the proposal.

I find this proposal to be challenging and highly impactful on the Cardano ecosystem. They build a platform on the Cardano blockchain, connecting donors with NGOs from around the globe. With no option to edit or delete the blockchain database, NGOs will not be able to edit the amount once registered. They also come up with the desired outcomes after implementation, that is, after the introduction, the suppliers are linked to NGOs on the Blockchain, which incentivizes the vendors not to accept Cryptocurrency payments join the Cardano ecosystem as a new potential market emerges. Accordingly, the contributions being distributed will be shown transparently; increases the traceability of NGOs to avoid mismanagement or theft.

Blockchain technology produces a process that is quite secure and allows only precise execution without modification, I find the system to be quite strict and transparent when it comes to money. The team provides the benefits that the project brings as well as the example for the reader to easily imagine, I like how the team communicates clearly and completely. All transactions are provided with evidence, so it is completely possible to be authentic and work seriously without lying. I see that the team has not presented the results it brings, but only talks about the difficulties that will be encountered. . The team needs to mention some more consequences that will happen when the project is completed such as better people's lives or creating conditions for everyone to have better conditions. The project has a clear and quite complete KPI but has not yet stated the results in sync with it, it is possible to use the examples I mentioned earlier. But the team does a good job of bringing out each individual  and not missing anyone, which is a good thing that shows the connection between individuals. Each division benefits and operates fairly.The challenges they present are very good, showing the care and understanding in the project.

I think it should be added to the average salary of personnel. At the end of the team, the total amount is also shown very accurately and aggregated for easy tracking. Team members have a full profile of information including name, position and number of years of experience. The team is even more careful to have a very good link likedin for each person.
