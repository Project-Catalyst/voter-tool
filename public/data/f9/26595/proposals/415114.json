I don't think it provides enough detail and seems excessive in comparison to the typical income of the business. Vietnamese, For example, \"Content Creator $20,000\" is an excessively high number for one content creator because it includes a payment of $2,000 for a single piece of content and a total of 10 payments for individual pieces of content.

At the beginning, the course content will focus on practical topics in life such as daily spending, personal financial management, financial freedom for Vietnamese market. In fact, the proposer utilizes their strength as being an experienced training company in finance training, with over 100,000 trainee community, and would like to adopt blockchain technology for better solution for improving education quality. I think, this is a good model. Learners might feel more motivated as they could earn tokens when actively participate in the platform: finish the courses, create and sell their own courses, voting for courses,..and increase interaction between learners and teachers through VR, AR, and course tracking progress. Additionally, each listing course will have their own NFT for the intellectual property rights of the course. It means, if other parties would like to use the courses, they need to buy or rent these NFT, as a result, increasing the value of the NFT, and contribute to the development of Cardano ecosystem. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Well, I think, the feasibility of this project is ok, but some parts need further explannation and details. Considering their roadmap, the proposer gives a one-year vision to Q2/2023, quarterly planned, for developing this Lamo Dapp. As I know, Q3/2022 will be within the scope of this proposal, and I can see that some technical activities and marketing have been mentioned in this quarter so far. However, this plan needs a little more detailed, I think. I do not know how these activities be carried out, on daily, weekly basis? What is their targeted KPIs after the first quarter? In what ways/tools they will use to measure the development of this Dapp? It would be better if the proposer can clarify who are the trainers for these courses? What is their marketing strategy and price strategy for these courses? \nNext, speaking of the budget, via the provided link, I know the proposer calculates the project cost based on the monthly rate for each position for 3 consecutive months. I think, the required monthly rate is reasonable for each position, but other parts need further explannation. For example, for Content Creator position, the monthly rate is $2000 per month, but my question is Why the proposer states the number of unit is 10 instead of 3 months?, so I found the total required $20,000 is a little confusing for Content creator item here. Finally, regarding the team part, 4 main people mentioned here, they are all influencer as trainer, journalist, computer science expert, audit and security expert. I am more convinced that they are very talented as shown in their past experience of establishing a quite famous training company in Vietnam, link provided for community reference. Additionally, the proposer clarify their project's roles in Lamo project. However, from the budget sheet link, I know there will be a lot of personnels working on this project, but these people are not mentioned here. I just wonder Do they have a full team to work on this project at present? Who will be the Project Manager? Who will be the developers, designers, testers, content creators, video editors,...? Overall, from their website (https://lamo.info/), the proposer shows some proof of work which shows their seriousness in carrying out this project. With all above analysis, I think, it is more perfect if the informative is given in more detailed manner. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I think, the auditability part needs to be more detailed. First, the proposer states that the monthly report will be public on the Lamo website (lamo.info) for community tracking. But it is better if the proposer could clarify what is included in this report. Additionally, the proposer said community could measure the project progress by using KPIs, but do not provide exact targeted numbers/goals and deadline. Basically, I agree with the proposer that community could track the project development based on 4 key indicators: the number of download Apps, daily active users, Github commits, concurrent users at peak times. Besides, we could consider other metrics such as the number of courses added on the Dapp, the number of content/articles created for marketing,.... My suggestion is that the proposer should mention about how to keep community engaged in their project? I mean, what will be the communication channels between the team and community? I recommend using social media such as Telegram, Twitter, Discord, Facebook to increase interaction, receive feedbacks for improving their product,...Next, for the success outlook of the Dapp, the proposer visions that this Dapp would connect millions of learners with tens of thousands of content creators in a easy way, anywhere, anytime, with reasonable costs, and help everyone gain knowledge. It is quite ambitious goal, I think, the proposer should have clear KPIs for each period of time, such as after 6 months, after 12 months, after 2 years,...

Lamo Dapp implements the construction of a learning ecosystem in which learners can also create their own course. The intelligent educational platform will directly impact the learner, the content of the courses is diverse suitable for the choice of learners. Not only do you stop at learning, collecting knowledge will be an opportunity to earn tokens, tokens can be likened to coupons or free cards in advanced courses. It's really great that learners have course-building ideas to be able to NFT them and earn Money or Tokens. Doing learning with VR, AR is really exciting, the images on metaverse will promote the learning process. The night proposal values high \"Decentralization\", when learners are entitled to vote for the courses of their choice, which gives the courses the best quality. The solution for NFT-acquired courses is refreshing, however I have an opinion on the sale/lease of NFT on the course. Learners who join Lamo Dapp have been able to hold tokens, the purchase/lease of the course should be exchanged using these tokens, which helps us avoid legal violations in some countries. The number of learners wishing to be trained will be increasing, attracting learners will help to expand the proposal for the future. The content of Blockchain/Cardano-related courses is suitable for learners to help increase developers for the Cardano ecosystem, the developer who completes the course can contribute to many projects on the Cardano platform. Overall, the proposal addressed the challenges posed, which is in line with the challenge of installing the F9 ear. Determining legal limits is in line with the proposal, however legal research in countries to apply the provision of applications to learners is essential. Instead of trading NFT we exchange tokens and courses will be suitable for developing Lamo Dapp across all countries. The proposal has a Wed2 platform https://ask.com.vn attract a lot of learners to wake up course. ASK /Wake Up is the optimal solution for market competition, the course has access to AR and VR technology are the optimal points to attract learners. I have more opinions on attracting learners, We already have a superior learning foundation, the necessary courses.
