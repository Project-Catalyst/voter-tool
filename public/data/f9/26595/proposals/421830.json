The problem to be solved is the lack of access to higher education and quality education; the proponents, the seedsstars group, cite as an example the case of Africa, where only 8% of young people have access to quality education, which is usually offered in private institutions. To address this, it is suggested to unlock access to funding through a system called Income Share Agreements (ISA). The snippet of the proposal that best explains how Cardano's technologies would be utilized in this solution is \u201cSetting standards for the Cardano Community around tokenization of education financing techniques (i.e. income sharing agreements). For this, we will take advantage of our lessons learned about the value chain, efficiency and implementation of ISA in emerging markets. Explore the latest development in the on-chain domain to better create tokenized ISAs.\u201d Even so, it is not so understandable what would be created, in practice. How would a dApp be created for this funding to be done, through active tokens? Would the young beneficiaries receive these incentives through digital wallets, so that they need to learn about Cardano to be part of the project? In this case, this is all indirectly related to the challenge, since in my view it is not clear how to create an interface itself (and the challenge is to create dApps, integrations and products that are beneficial for Cardano). However, through this funding program, new young people would be instructed and educated to work with technology and blockchain, which would generate a qualified workforce in the future and that could make a difference for Cardano, since these new professionals would participate in projects and development even of dApps, which would promote further growth and consolidation of our ecosystem. In general, the objectives of the project are very clear in the excerpts \u201cCreation of new technical standards linked to tokens linked to education + goodwill and positive associations with Cardano as a technology, as it will be seen as a technology that can facilitate positive projects in the real world, instead of being a vehicle for speculation + may draw the attention of public, private and cryptocurrency organizations looking for better ways to transfer money to people in countries with little access to quality tertiary education.\u201d In fact, if the program manages to bring cryptocurrencies closer to people's practical daily lives, our ecosystem can only gain. Other positive points are that the proponents identify the target audience well, demonstrating that they are very assertive in relation to the tasks they will develop, and also identify possible problems during the project and how they can be mitigated. In summary, we know very well what would be done and why, what the needs of these projects are, but it is not so clear from which products (a dApp, some interface, etc) these technologies would be put into practice and could be used by the public target (student and funders).", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Feasibility is good, we have basic information needed, but unfortunately both the script topic and the budget explanation are not adequate. Talking first about the roadmap, no explanation is attached to the proposal itself, the information is passed through a table in an attached link. The problem here is that reading the table is not so simple and the information contained there is not enough to have a clear understanding of the development process of this project. Some information such as 1) what would be done 2) deliverables 3) tool/methodology is included, but we don't have the details of the activities to be done and we don't have deadlines either. Deadlines are essential to understand the temporality of the proposal, how the actions are organized with the passage of time, what would be happening each month and what are the phases of the project as a whole. One problem with this table is that the roadmap of other proposals was also included there, that is, it is not a table that allows us to visualize only this project, this greatly impairs our understanding. The ideal would be for the table to be 100% focused on this proposal (each proposal there had its own table), for information about temporality to be included and for the activities that were mentioned to be individually explained (how it would be done, who would do it and etc - I would like professional names too). Therefore, in my view it is not possible to have a good understanding of the project development process. In addition to these improvements in the table, it would also be positive if we had an explanation of what would happen each month in the proposal itself, this would allow us to understand in a more direct and simple way what was to come. As in the case of the roadmap, the budget explanation part should also improve. The borrowing amount is quite high - $154,400 - and it's broken down pretty basic, the parts aren't explained the way they should. Most of the money would go towards the development of smart contracts; a very high amount is asked for per hour of work - 200 dollars - this amount is 4 times higher than what I see being asked in most proposals for these activities, in general people ask 50 dollars an hour for the work of the developers. It is said that it would take 640 hours, which is quite a long time, so this total amount would need to be better explained - in how many months would this work be done? One of the expenses is named with \u201cseedstars\u201d, which is the group that would develop this project. What exactly would that expense be? What would be the \u201cchance\u201d expenses? What would the marketing campaign for this project look like and why would it cost 1500 dollars? What video would that be and why would it cost $9,000? In other words, it is not possible to understand well how the money would be used, and this would be very necessary, especially with the project being so large and in need of such high funding. Talking about the team, this is undoubtedly the most appropriate part, as the seedsstars group provides us with a lot of information about who they are, their mission and who the members are, individually, we know their resumes and how they relate to Cardano . Partner professionals, who are not part of seedsstars, are also well presented.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Unfortunately, I don't think the proposal is easy to audit, because, in terms of progress, we don't have as many details about the phases and activities (as I mentioned in the roadmap part, the table informs us insufficiently about what would be done and as). This makes it more difficult for us to understand what needs to be done, in what way and within what timeframes. The proponents also fail to provide us with some metrics that could serve as partial results to be delivered over time. Even if it is said that monthly reports would be made, we do not know what would comprise these reports, that is, the content of each; we also don't know how these reports would reach members of the Cardano community. As a result, a series of improvements needed to be made in this part of the proposal. First, the table would need to be reformulated (the first step is to leave only activities related to this proposal in it, to simplify the visualization). Afterwards, deadlines need to be established, so that we know when to demand certain advances and partial results. And then an individual detail for each activity to be done would be positive so that we could understand if things were being done the way it was planned, in the right way. It would also be necessary for us to have a notion of which products should be delivered according to the passage of months (for example - until month 3, the project would need to deliver such partial results, be developed to a certain point, etc.). Talking about the final success, it is said that it would be faced through the creation of the dApp that would attract new users to Cardano, with the success indicators being \u201cCIP Draft Validation + Final CIP Validation 9 CIP Use Cases (see our proposal on CIP cases of use and PoC)\u201d. However, these indicators say a lot about the success of the dApp itself, but not how it would affect the target audience (students) and our ecosystem. It would be necessary that, in addition to understanding the success of the dApp, we could confirm that the main objective of the project - which in my opinion is to provide study opportunities so that young people can qualify and have a promising professional future - has been met. How can we see young people benefiting in practice? It would be positive for the team to bring us some real examples of people who had their lives changed as a result of the project - names, who these young people would be, what they would be studying and what their perspectives are. It is also necessary to prove how all this was beneficial for Cardano and achieved the objectives of the challenge, such as increasing the number of members of our community - in this case the goal is skilled labor - and so on. This would all need to be studied and demonstrated directly to our community, through participation in Townhall, for example. I believe that, unfortunately, this topic has a lot to be improved.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Hi, \n\nThanks a lot for your thorough review of the proposal! Below are some clarification elements to hopefully shed light on some of the concerns raised: \n\n- \" How would a dApp be created for this funding to be done, through active tokens?\", \"unclear how the solution would be put into practice\" -> The explanation of how we will carry out the creation of a new application for the community can be better understood by reading two other proposals we submitted to F9: (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/418255 and https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/418254#idea-tab-comments). More practical details on the work plan can be found here (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uNajq4UyT0c-_tBXbBh0tb3psx3kZMOyB-nE-yUfK-Q/edit#gid=851358364) and our initial workflow here (https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOppf37M=/?share_link_id=825974830925). We hope this clarifies the roll-out of the tokenization exercise and the application that will be created. \n\n- \"development process of this proposal\" -> As you know, the aim of a Cardano Improvement Proposal is to propose improvements or solutions to challenges, receive feedback, and participate in shaping the future of the network. We deem that the use case preliminary testing & PoC that we will carry out in the education financing sector will give us a solid foundation to suggest a CIP for the wider use of the community. We are very eager to pioneer new applications and create new standards for an asset that is relatively novel worldwide on. The level of novelty and technicity we will deploy should - in our opinion - serve as a basis for the community. The CIP is a tool that will allow the community to benefit from our work without having to deep dive into the technicality of our particular project. In other words, through this CIP we aim to provide the community with informational proposals that provide general guidelines and structured information around the tokenization of real-world assets (such as ISAs). \n\n- \"Deadlines are essential to understand the temporality of the proposal\" / \"One problem with this table is that the roadmap of other proposals was also included there\" Thank you for your feedback on the spreadsheet. That being said this is a complement to the proposal therefore judging the quality of the proposal on an extra that aims at giving the big picture about the project is narrowing the reading of it slightly. That being said we take good notes of the feedback for upcoming proposals and thank you again. \nTo answer your point on deadlines,  as can be seen on the proposal an in this cell: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uNajq4UyT0c-_tBXbBh0tb3psx3kZMOyB-nE-yUfK-Q/edit#gid=851358364&range=T18. The CIP drafting will leverage the work done thourghout the project as a whole and should only take 3 to 4 days. Still, as per the proposal, the deliverable that will be done after a few days of drafting will be Cardano Improvement Proposal based on research led by Smart chain, most likely in partnership with organizations like Milkometa (L2), GeniusLabs (a DeX), and Mlabs (audit- technical architecture). \n\n- Budget -> The breakdown is provided as a comment on the workplan: 3 days of work (we added 1 buffer day as it is estimated by the Smart Chain teams it could take up to 4 d of work) from the four 4 co-submitters and will require the involvement of 4 team members. \nIndeed, the rates are on the higher end. This is mostly driven by the fact that projects staffed on rolling out the proposal are all senior staff and most of them C-suite and founders of the organization themselves (e.g. Pierre Alain Masson, Adrien Hubert, Nick Mason, Vincent Katchavenda, Batya Blankers). \nOther team members with very in-depth expertise, especially tech. For example: \n- Ruslan Shevshenko has 30yrs full stack experience additionally to being  the founder of several successful ventures (NBI, GradSoft, largest UA Scala Group) and having 10 publications in peer-reviewed journals. Also authored \u201cMethods of Algebraic Programming\u201d \n- Viktor Radshenko has 20+ years of R&D experience and full-stack\n- Alexey Hodkof has 17 years of experience in Web backend and frontend solution architect and developer \n- Slava Sheblokov has 20 years of experience in a wide variety of IT areas, including with PlayTech and GlobalLogic.\nMoreover, Smart Chain is Paris (France) based, Seedstars is Geneva (Switzerland) based, and these are locations where human capital is relatively expensive. \n\n- \"partners of seedstars are not well presented\" -> you have access to background, experience, and linked in profile of most members. The three profiles for which you do not have the hyperlink to the LinkedIn profile can be accessed directly on LinkedIn: https://fr.linkedin.com/in/adrien-hubert/en, https://fr.linkedin.com/in/vkatchavenda, and https://fr.linkedin.com/in/trishalasuresh. \n\n- \"marketing campaign\" as mentioned in the proposal we believe that launching such a high impact potential standard without having it resonate loudly in the community would be a waste of time and financial resources. We thus intend to produce a professional video with our team of producers and have it widely shared in our communities and mostly in the Cardano Community. To give you an example, based on the experience of the lead submitter only (though we strongly encourage you to also go check the communication reach of other co-submitters of the tokenizing income share - Use case and - PoC proposals such as the community native Cardashift), of how loud we have been able to resonate in the past through high quality audio-visual content, Seedstars Documentary was selected for the Cannes Film Festival in 2019 (https://www.seedstarsthedocumentary.com/), the Financial Times x SDG challenge (https://fttalent.ft.com/ftxseedstars/) had a media reach of 136 Million people and a social media reach of 187 Million other ones. Community reach of the FTxCardano Blockchain Challenge led by other teams at Seedstars under F8 can also be followed live (in progress).\n \n- \"auditability\" -> the auditability of the CIP drafting is limited to finalizing a draft and submitting the CIP in the sense that it will literally be a research and drafting work carried out over a few days, summarizing learnings and practices worked on during the preliminary use case testing and the PoC phase of the project presented in the two other proposals we submitted. The breakdown of these activities milestone per milestone is presented in the workplan and we will gladly answer any questions that arise from it. \n\nWe hope this clarifies some of the concerns raised and remain at your disposal for further requests. \n\nKind regards, \n\nThe Seedstars, Proof Space, Smart Chain, and Chancen International teams "}, {"id": 1871, "q0": "The current problem is that higher education in emerging markets is not suitable for the job market of the 21st century, and workers' access to quality education is limited, leading to underpaying.

Specifically: Seedstars is a team with a mission to impact the lives of people in emerging markets through technology and entrepreneurship. It consists of 3 programs: investment (VC fund), capacity building for tech startups (Seedstars Program), and startup education (Seedstars Academy). Smart-chain is a team tasked with designing and implementing Blockchain solutions to improve operational performance and create value in the ecosystem.

Let\u2019s dive in. \n\nBeginning with the problem statement, we find out that the tertiary education systems in emerging markets do not provide adequate access to jobs and only cater to those with the existing financial means to finance the lengthy process - only 8% of the youth population in Africa. The value proposition is to unlock access to higher education through income sharing agreements in which students agree to finance it through pre-determined payments after graduation, based on a percentage of their income. The link with the Cardano ecosystem is that Seedstars intends to build these agreements on-chain and to tokenize them. \n\nA prerequisite of launching this proposal, Seedstars will have to finalize two other projects before being able to implement this one: (1) their research proposal into the use cases and identification of the best possible implementation solutions for income sharing agreements and (2) the proof of concept of these sharing agreements, including a coin offering. Once these two parts are done, they can proceed to implementing this proposal: to draft a Cardano improvement proposal based on findings from the preliminary stages. \n\nThere is a unique blend of circumstances that makes this proposal (and the ones before it) absolutely extraordinary in terms of impact: \n\n- a partnership between five strong and mature organizations, including Cardano native ones, is bound to offer excellent visibility to the project and access to additional sources of funding, competence, networking effects and the change of onboarding the best possible team\n- the use case is exceptional as well, since it is a blend of acting within the emerging markets, the youth population and it\u2019s a real life use case\n- there seems to be a slow and steady philosophy behind the project and the team, very much in sync with Cardano\u2019s ethos and its way of doing business, research and anything in between. \n\nHence, the entire project should be finalized with a promising CIP that can bring so many real use cases to Cardano, and therefore five stars are reasonable for potential impact of this proposal, and the other two before it. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Let\u2019s find out more about this joint venture. Seedstars is an organization with more than 80 members focused on influencing people's lives in emerging markets through technology and entrepreneurship. They are the lead proposers, and they have partnered with four other organizations for this project. ProofSpace is an identity network focused on issuing and verifying decentralized identity credentials with no-code tools. Cardashift is a (Cardano native) launchpad that raises funds for startups that are solving social and environmental issues. Smart Chain implements distributed ledger solutions. Last but not least, Chancen International provides financing for young people in Africa to access tertiary education. Of course, all of the teams have an excellent presentation of their core teams and as a second step you have their websites on which you can spend hours and hours while reading about their ongoing projects and past successes. \n\nTheir work plan is one of the most extensive from this financing round - it\u2019s only normal, otherwise it would be impossible to coordinate between five medium sized organizations. However they should have perhaps translated the information from the sheet into the proposal itself to make it easier for stakeholder to better understand the relevant milestones.  As far as I could tell the activities for this proposal would extend until at least 2023, and it has very concise actions and responsible partners for each of them. There are good indications that all partners have devoted time and resources into writing this proposal, and they will continue to do so in the future, having already accounted for the necessary time / human resources needed for it. The main activities will include research, most likely in partnerships with organizations like Milkomeda, GeniusLabs or Mlabs and of course, the actual drafting of the CIP. \n\nThe proposers are doing an excellent job at recognizing and planning for certain risks, and the entire exercise showcases that we are dealing with mature organizations that have extensive experience in running similar projects, so it\u2019s unlikely to encounter significant unforeseen conditions down the road.\n\nThe budget is presented in a separate sheet, and is very easy to understand. 128k USD would be allocated to Smartchain while the rest of the budget is split between sundry items. The hourly rate charged is 200 USD, perhaps slightly on the high end considering the project will most likely include some junior or mid level analyst hours which should perhaps be charged at a lower rate. But voters are definitely the ones who should judge the value for money so no points deducted for this reason. \n\nThis is a beautiful proposal, too bad it\u2019s not timely too. And it isn\u2019t, since it heavily depends on the finalization of the two initial stages (research and proof of concept), since they are not the type of projects that can be run in parallel. Considering all this, I can only offer three stars since I believe that funding for this proposal should be requested when a clear picture emerges from stages 1 and 2 of their plan.

Success will be measured through the  viability of a new feature / type of smart contract possible within Cardano and the attraction of users / dapps to use it. \n\nWe have here a very strong joint venture of enterprises that are undoubtedly used to frequently reporting to their stakeholders and to offer transparency for their work, so there is no doubt that together they will be able to do a good job in ensuring full auditability for this project if implemented.

ISAs are a not well known or leveraged financial tool to allow students to learn without taking on legacy debt.  Instead the student agrees to a contract that effectively indentures (nasty word, but bear with me, please) a portion of their future wages or salary to paying back a sponsor of their education.  So far these types of contracts have been stewarded in a non-regulated environment, relying on the ethics of the actors involved, however it is clear that there really needs to be standards in place for privacy, security, fairness, inclusivity and other areas of concern.  They have a real opportunity to reimagine emerging markets, and underserved education/skills markets wherever they exist\n\nThe collaborators here are bringing an ISA portfolio and team to Cardano in search of just such standards for the safety of their sponsors and students, only to find that these are tricky questions that haven't really been answered.  So they are embarking on a huge research/PoC project first to discover and implement those standards before building an ISA platform.  This proposal is to fund that research/PoC and in the process to create a deliverable of value to all of the Cardano community:  an Informational CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) that expresses their findings on standards around ISA tokens and contracts, which the community can then add to, discuss, and perhaps push up to a Process or Standards Track if needed.\n\nBecause the target of ISAs is such an impactful area that is deeply aligned with existing Cardano projects that are focused on emerging markets, and because of the real change that it could catalyze generally in the economic and financial structures of education, I feel that this proposal merits a full 5 stars for Impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal has a few challenges here.  First off, the team seems ideal at first glance:  Seedstars is a multifund participant that has delivered lots of value related to improving, accelerating and incubating talent for Cardano, Proofspace is another multifund project that is building a premier Identity platform in Cardano (and elsewhere).  Chancen, which is the ISA specialist here, has almost a decade of experience on the ground, working through these tough issues, and Smartchain brings years of financial experience to the token engineering side of the project.  \n\nBut when you dig into the milestones and budget, it starts to get confusing (I believe because this is a side proposal of a much larger platform buildout that is underway, and the leadership and participation structure has been migrated to this proposal).  For starters, Cardashift is listed, but with no budget claims and no role explicated in the proposal.  Further, Proofspace and Seedstars together share less than 1% of the budget despite being listed as the primary submitter.  By far the vast majority accrues to the token engineers (640hrs which is a lot of research...) and the ISA specialist (64hrs)...  To unpack this, it should be noted that the actual project lead comes from the ISA project, Chancen, which seems appropriate to me.  Proofspace is likely only consulting on the role of Identity (and possibly the CIP formatting), but is more engaged on the underlying platform project.  And much of the data they need to explore these standards require the building out of a proof of concept for the token and governing contract, thus the heavy commitment to Smartchain.  The confusion is about the structuring of the proposal (likely a port of the platform proposals) versus the actual roles and where they are found.  I don't plan on marking down for this aspect specifically, but don't be surprised if PAs and voters looking at the budget sheet think it looks risky, due to apparent misalignment with the voice of the proposal.\n\nA final point, there is a process to not only creating a CIP but a process to submit it as well.  While I think the budget quoted is fair and could cover both, the breakdowns are inadequate to assess these development milestones of the CIP itself, and of the responsibility of the roles in going through this community based process.  More clarity on who and how the CIP will get stewarded to the end of the CIP process is needed, as many a CIP has stagnated after initial submission and eventually been removed without consideration.  I see step one here, but not step two (though I do feel the budget is adequate for both steps).\n\nBecause the proposal has a strong team with relevant experience, skills and insight I feel there is a strong feasibility component.  However due to the lack of details on the CIP submission itself, compounded by clarity issues and dependence on other proposals receiving funding in Fund9, I am removing a star.  4 stars for Feasibility.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "They lean heavily here into other projects, making the delivery of the CIP contingent on progress on what looks like 3 other proposals.  This is rough, as both would need to be funded for this project to have that necessary data.  Assuming that data is coming in, what they describe here would effectively allow for measuring both success and progress.\n\nThey do include the draft validation and final validation as two different deliverables, which is a good indicator that they understand the CIP process, however there aren't any more clues here about their participation in that process than there was in feasibility.  But delivery of the CIP draft and final validation does adequately describe the success of the project.\n\nBecause the proposal requires delivery of data from other proposals, I have to remove one star, but because they have described a solid audit protocol for if they do receive that information, I agree that the project is auditable:  5 stars.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 15366, "q0": "The proposing team is well-define the problem in the sphere of financing education in Cardano Ecosystem, especially since there is a gap in the job market in emerging African countries.
