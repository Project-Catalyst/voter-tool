The team does not specify why a token is needed and what its utility will be. The formation of a DAO around this token is then difficult to fully understand on its potential impact as the purpose of this DAO appears to be derived from the $FRACTALS token. On from this the integration of the token into existing platforms then also must be considered. The purpose and utility of the $FRACTALS token must be clearly defined to understand the potential impact of the work being intended. Due to the lack of information regarding the utility behind this initiative it appears unlikely that it will produce a high impact for the ecosystem. In a future proposal it would be great to see how the end user would use this token and why that may have either value or utility to them. Then using this explanation examples could be given towards why a DAO is needed to manage that token ecosystem - what types of decisions would need to be made? If the proposal is not funded we would kindly encourage the proposer to resubmit the proposal with better clarifications on the impact and utility of some of the intentions of the proposal. On a separate note, the previous NFT art work from the proposer looks great, keep it up!", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal team outline their experience as an NFT creator and involvement in many community initiatives, it is clear from the resources and links provided the proposer is connected in the community.

The proposer does not provide any professional profile links to verify the background of the proposal team members.

A final report will also be given that will be publicly available. The proposer mentions that they want there 'technological innovations' to lay the groundwork for other projects. It would have been useful to have more clarity on exactly what these areas are and what success would look like for these specific innovations. The proposal could benefit from some further refinement to improve the overall clarity of the intentions of what the proposer is trying to achieve with a new token, DAO and any other efforts.

The proposer has provided a budget which I think is reasonable and broken down into bits which gives us a clearer picture of how these resources are going to be used appropriately. But I believe it would have been better if the proposer had identified a few team members he will be working with should he be funded by upon careful study of the entire proposal I have not seen details of any team member which I think is an important component that has been omitted.

All proposals submitted to Catalyst in theory need fuding, so using this problem as a reference is not relevant to understand how the proposal fits into this challenge. The problem of a proposal is an important part of understanding the impact that the proposed solution can have on the challenge.\n\nThere is the intention to organize events, develop a faucet, carry out giveaways, build our WEB3 infrastructure and carry out integrations in marketplaces, these activities in theory can contribute to the objective of this challenge, however these objectives were approached in a very superficial, siloed and vague way, which makes it difficult understand the purpose and impact of the proposal. The proposal does not clearly articulate how it will add value to the ecosystem, the proposal seems more like a collection of ideas in different directions.\n\nDefinitions like: \"funding for brand integrations into immutable architecture, De-centralized exchanges, DAPP's, DAO formation, Native asset launches\" are confusing, so I recommend greater clarity for writing/communicating the concept.\n\nThere are no metrics/KPIs with targets that allow projecting the impact of this proposal. I would recommend including goals with targets so the community can understand what to expect as a deliverable. e.g.\n\n-Integration with 3 marketplaces after 6(placeholder) months...\n- 1000(placeholder) unique wallets interacting with NFTs over x amount of time\n- NFTS transaction volume over x thousands(placeholder) of dollars at the end of x months.\n\nThe team intends to be financially sustainable in the future and has not indicated any intention to request funding again, but there are no details on how the project will be financially independent in the future.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer described experience as a creator of NFTs, staking pool operator, artist, community advisor, among others.\n\nI am concerned that the proposer declares experience as a community advisor because this proposal is confusing and lacks essential items that should be clearer for community advisors (proposal assessors), such as links with information for the proposer's experience.\n\nThe links provided refer to different social media, but considering the context of the proposal we need to understand the proposer's expertise more deeply than social networks like Instagram/Twitter/TikTok and others allow us to check. We need to understad the proposer expertise in areas such as: smart contracts development/webdevelopment and marketing.\n\nThe INFI pool, which in theory is operated by this proposer, has not produced any blocks since creation 7 months ago, and has less than 7,000 in active stake according to Pooltool.io, so there is no way to indicate relevant experience of the proposer as SPO\n\nIt is not clear if there is more than one person behind the proposal or if there will be a need to hire more people for the team besides artists.\n\nThe deliverables mentioned in the roadmap involve creating smart contracts, integrating with other dapps, organizing events, marketing, creating documentation, creating a DAO, among others. There are numerous aspects involved in the plan, but none were addressed in detail, only superficially.\n\nConsidering the different steps mentioned above and the timeline of only 3 months, I don't believe this proposal is feasible, because we don't know how many people will be contributing and the development areas of this proposal need different skillsets.\n\nThere is a budget breakdown but there are no details on the development stages and time required for some stages.e.g.\n\n\"-DEX integrations and liquidity distribution - $1000\"\n\"-DAO Formation and functionality testing - $2000\"\n\nHow were the values \u200b\u200babove defined? This proposal will need at least one developer, how was the compensation defined for the steps above? Based on hours? By estimate?\n\nThere is mention of $1000 USD for artists and marketing but there is not enough detail in the plan about these steps (marketing/creation of NFTs) so there is no way to indicate if the amount is adequate or not.\n\nIn relation to Phase 2 the budget mentions:\n\n\"40 hours - @ $25 per hour $1000 - perform integrations - Community explanations and inclusion\"\n\nThere is no context to understand what type of integration will be carried out or their complexity, so there is no way to indicate whether the above amount is feasible or not.\n\n\n\"$1000 - in person events. networking and collaborations.\" (vague and no context to assess whether the budget is adequate)\n\n\"Miscellaneous expenses - $420\" (generic and there is no way to rate this part either)\n\nThe other parts of the budget have the same pattern, lack of context and an adequate plan make it difficult to understand if the budget of this proposal is adequate.\n\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposer will document number of posts, likes, comments, video views, to track engagement, in addition to document all achievements and contributions into a full report that will be publicly available, so there are some items to be used as a reference, but considering the different different areas of activity and deliverables such as integrations with other platforms, events, documentation, creation of DAOs and NFTs, the metrics are far below expectations to allow good auditability. The breadth of deliverables also requires more metrics to be monitored. It is important that data such as:\n\nIntegrations with other platforms, data on repositories and code development, community participation in events, etc...\n\nThe suggested metrics do not indicate a relationship with this challenge and are also not adequate to check if the definition of success of this proposal has been met, therefore it is essential that more metrics are added.\n\nKPIs with targets have not been defined.\n\nThere is a roadmap with several deliverables over the 3 months of development and although the timeline presented does not indicate that it is feasible due to the reasons I mentioned before, at least there is the ability of the community to follow the development objectively.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2048", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 15159, "q0": "The proposer is identifying the problem that \u201cFractal Fuzion\u201d lacks resources so they can develop and deploy their projects to Cardano blockchain, and that these \u201ctechnological innovations\u201d are required to improve Cardano and user experience. So in short \u2013 funding is requested for Fractal Fuzion, so they can fund the following \u2013 token launch and liquidity, then they aim to form a DAO, real life in person events, and integrations to NFT marketplaces and dapps. Even though all of these items are nice, and trending overall, I did not find the supporting information nor evidence for the following \u2013 1. What is the user base and demand for such products as for now? Is there a discord or any public channel with some followers/members, or it is having no traction as for now and funding is requested so the proposer can continue? 2. The main argument is that it will improve user experience \u2013 what is it related to? How will user experience be improved? Unfortunately, there is no information as such, thus, even it is aligned with the challenge, the potential impact is based on the traction of the community, and it was not mentioned anywhere in the proposal either with a plan nor current status. Not even \u2013 who will be the target group? User base?

During the first month, to highlight some technical goals \u2013 is to launch token and add liquidity to exchanges, form a DAO, develop smart contracts for DAO integrations, create immutable infrastructure. For the second month, the proposer plans to develop DAPP and smart contracts and during the third month, It is more about soft-skill tasks as in person events or NFT giveaways. Overall the plan seems somehow well thought \u2013 but to improve it, expected time consumption on each tasks could have been stated. At the same time, it is unclear whether it will be performed by the proposer alone or no, since some are requiring technical knowledge. The total budget is 9 420 USD, and it is nicely divided into each tasks in the respective month. Some items are having stated hourly wage \u2013 25 USD/H, but some not, therefore it is left for interpretation, whether the same hourly rate is applied by default to all tasks or some are having different one. At the same time, some requested items are not matching the timeline \u2013 e.g. 1k USD for prep art/marketing/videos \u2013 but it is not possible to link it with timeline item. Another 1k USD is requested for in person events \u2013 proposer could have outlined which one he plans to attend, or host.

As stated by proposer \u2013 the problem is lack of funding, and the solution is to fund it and therefore improve user experience. Since user experience will be hard to track, I am not sure if the proposal is having a well established problem-solution relation with respect to auditability. Nevertheless, the proposer mentioned that he will track engagements \u2013 I assume on some public channel \u2013 many of these can be found on the webpage stated in the proposal (discord, telegaram, twitter or even twitch or tiktok), which can provide the idea of the success of the proposal.
