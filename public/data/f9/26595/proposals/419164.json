In addition, I also appreciate the empowerment of this utility tool to other developer communities so that this solution will soon be integrated into many wallets and dApps on the Cardano ecosystem. However, this proposal carries a risk as the proponent's company is not officially affiliated with WalletConnect, meaning there are potential difficulties in the integration process.

The proposer cites the fact that Instagram declared they will not add support for Cardano NFT\u2019s, because Cardano wallets are not using the WalletConnect standard.\nIt\u2019s easy to understand what the benefit of implementing this will be: widespread adoption through partnerships with companies which already have large user bases.\nAs risks, aside from the standard ones which apply to all software projects, the developers also mentioned the fact that the team behind WalletConnect might not be as collaborative as we hope.

We don\u2019t have key progress indicators in the form of numeric estimates for certain things (like X number of commits per X amount of time), but this being a company with a good track record, I think that the public posts will be sufficient to audit progress.\nThe measure of success is also clear enough in my opinion: at least one DApp that would not have been able to have Cardano support without WalletConnect integration deciding to deploy on Cardano based on the work done here.\nI think the information here is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal.

The proposer vaguely suggests that dApps that \"start out\" on other chains integrate with this wallet solution, but there's no reason to believe that these dApps would be compelled to integrate/migrate to Cardano chain if Cardano were to integrate with WalletConnect. Again, the proposer vaguely touches on potential security benefits to the integration but doesn't elaborate in a way that connects to the problem or offers a narrative on why the security enhancements will be a positive impact for Cardano. Going further, the proposer vaguely touches on the issue of Instagram NFTs being integrated with WalletConnect and therefore Cardano would presumably miss out on social media exposure without it. While this may be something that warrants a solution, the proposer does little to explain why showcasing NFTs on Instagram should be a priority for our ecosystem.

The proposer does not give evidence of the relevant skills for the \"popular dApp\" that is interested, nor the WalletConnect team that would partner on the endeavor, nor even their own engineers assigned to the project. Going on, the proposer admits that it's hard to budget without knowing how much WalletConnect would request in funds, sowing further doubt that the budget and plan is feasible. Furthermore, I'm not sure that I would describe the solution as having an adequate enough impact on our ecosystem if it's only accessible through one wallet provider and one dApp irrespective of how popular they are. And finally, the proposer notes the possibility of including the technical specifications in a Cardano Improvement Proposal, a process all on its own separate to Catalyst.

There are no milestones or timelines given to the community. The proposer explains that they will offer the community two write-ups. One write-up, a blog that will report on the feasibility of the project. In my opinion, this is something that should have been considered and frankly completed prior to submitting the proposal. The second write-up will explain to the ecosystem how best to connect to the new solution. These two approaches are not robust enough for the community to track project milestones, and possibly even help.

Moreover, mobile phone probably will be the only personal computer one will have in their life especially in developing countries or regions such as Africa and SouthEast Asia, where a major portion of the population cannot afford desktop or laptop or not even familiar with it. The development and advancement of mobile phones performance and features are also much more rapid compared to desktops or laptops.\n\nAt the more core, hardware level, it is forecasted that ARM processors (all popular and general purpose mobile phones are built with this ARM architecture) will eventually replace x86 processors (desktop and laptop CPUs mainly use this architecture) due to its performance sufficiency for every day, general computing and energy efficiency allowing smaller, more compact and lost lasting device for every day, normal user. This is also evident in Apple stop using Intel\u2019s x86 CPUs for their device and deploying their new devices (iPhone, MacBok, iMac, etc.) with the brand-new, M1 proprietary chip which, you guess, based on ARM architecture. I digressed.\n\nBottomline is successful implementation of this proposal will be extremely impactful for wider adoption and more frequent utilization of Cardano blockchain technology due to, surprise surprise, you can use more and more Cardano dApps in your smartphone and probably be interconnected seamlessly with your favorite Web2 apps such as Instagram and Twitter.

Maybe Milkomeda as EVM-based sidechain can be good testing ground for this proposal before transitioning to Cardano main net implementation.\n\nThe lack of explanation in budgeting and cost breakdown, as well as the expected delivery time of the proposal is preventing me from rating this proposal higher since I have to be fair with other more detailed proposals putting some efforts in this aspect .

The proposer has provided a list of tasks that must be completed in order for the proposal to be implemented successfully. The proposal has taken into account the resources needed to carry it out.

They state that the amount requested is an upper bound for the cost of the integration and that if the costs end up being significantly less, they will return extra funds to Catalyst.

If implemented, this would lead to more adoption as Cardano is currently missing out compared to Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and more when it comes to NFT integration. When it comes to sustainability, the proposer mentioned the risk of non-cooperative actions from WalletConnect. However, I am inclined to believe the chance is low considering WalletConnect is planning to support more chains and wallets based on their website and I fail to see why an open source protocol would deny more integrations.

However, I can understand the lack of knowledge base when it comes to adding support to the codebase, which results in a vague timeline. As a result, I'll try to evaluate based on the components provided by the proposer and any safe, educated assumptions I can make. First, the proposers are the ones who developed the Flint Wallet, so they are the most capable when it comes to integrating the WalletConnect protocol into the wallet. Because the proposal consists of three major processes: researching the protocol; integrating it into the wallet and, eventually, dApps; and documenting the entire implementation so that other wallets can follow, I am more inclined to believe that the execution is feasible. I assume the first process would be doable because WalletConnect has supported many different chains and wallets previously and their Github is completely open so the proposer could dive into the codebase directly. That being said, we need to understand that since their official documentation isn\u2019t structured and fully completed yet, this process might take a significant portion of the plan. The second process would be very doable since they are the maintainers of the wallet, and the third is simply the cherry on top. I applaud the proposer's belief in the future of multi-wallets and their initiative to make other wallets' onboarding a lot easier. The most unfortunate section in the proposal is the timeline and budget section, because there is simply nothing we can analyze there. Again, I know it\u2019s hard to estimate implementation ideas like this, but we can certainly improve it by using a time buffer within the timeline. I would put the research item around one to four months because if it turns out the protocol doesn\u2019t support Cardano yet or the effort might be too high, the proposer can just return the funding for F10. For the other items, I think the proposer would have a better estimate since they do have more hands-on experience developing and documenting light wallets, but I hope the idea comes across. From those estimates, the proposer could then calculate the budget needed (of course with a minimum and maximum range too) based on their hour rate and the varying hours they have to spend. Overall, I still tend to agree with the proposal's feasibility, but I am coming from an optimistic point of view. I personally worked on adding integrations in my previous software engineer job (adding Slack workflow, Discord webhooks, etc.) and I can say the problem is usually just the uncertainty of the initial research.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I am content with the provided information for auditing.
