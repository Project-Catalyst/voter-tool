The solution is an infrastructure piece that enables other website/dApp to provide TokenGating capability (which does not exist on the Cardano ecosystem at the moment). This solution will serve as a building block for other dApps, websites, and brands to enrich their use cases and personalize their offerings, which in turn attract more users to the Cardano ecosystem. This proposal, therefore, meets multiple goals of this challenge (i.e., create an impactful use case dApp use case) and of the Fund9 (i.e., prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem). Moreover, this proposal has a global impact and is highly scalable on the Cardano ecosystem. The proposer also provides a thoughtful discussion on how they plan to scale it sustainably (i.e., will provide free maintenance for 5 years, then the technology will be retrofitted into a last-mile supply chain and the project will be open-sourced).\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I strongly agree that the implentation of this project is highly feasible with the previous pilot, the team's experience and commitment, and the detailed roadmap and budget. The team has been active on Cardano for more than 3 years. It comprises 7 developers with defined roles for this proposal. The team members have founded and participated in multiple Cardano events (Vietnam Cardano Summit 2021, promoting Cardano with Singapore's trade organization and government, No-Code Hackathon) and built multiple products on Cardano (e.g. No-Code Hackathon, CardanoService, DID Resolver, DID Controller). The proposal's relevant skill set is reinforced by the fact that the team has completed a pilot of the proposed product that crossed most of the technical hurdles and this proposal is the next step. The proposer provides a roadmap that includes the duration and the key deliverables for each phase. The budget provided is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable tasks and man-hours required. The hourly rates and the total budget are reasonable to achieve the set goals. The proposal clearly explains technical aspects like architecture, language, and technologies of the product with diagrams attached. In addition, the proposer thoroughly considers the risks that may affect their implementation plan and suggests corresponding mitigation measurements. The proposer does not plan to require further funding for this project.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I strongly agree that it is clear and easy how on auditing this proposal. The team proposes not only the metrics (e.g., # of CNFT collections signed up each month; # of projects using their codebase or cloning their GitHub) but also the tool that the community may use to keep track more easily (e.g., Google super proxy and Google Analytics). The success metrics are defined by both quantitative factors (e.g., at least 2 medium to large brands will use their dApp; # of CNFT collection owners who use their dApp) and qualitative factors (e.g., CNFT holders feeling excited using the tool). The solution space is very well articulated to solve the defined problem. The proposal's progress could also be tracked using their roadmap with milestones provided. There is one comment for improvement I would suggest is that the team may consider integrating their roadmap on a GANTT chart to make it easier to the Cardano community to identify where they are in the process.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2558", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5576, "q0": "The proposal to bring token gating to Cardano's ecosystem would directly address the challenge proposal for Dapps, Products, and Integrations. \n\nIt's also encouraging that the group is looking to make everything open-sourced. This means that they will deliver a fully functional product. It's also encouraging that they may not return to Catalyst, but they encourage others to apply for funding if they'd like implementations. This ensures the project will succeed long term. \n\nToken gating would help engage the Cardano community in ways you can only do on Ethereum and even Solana currently. This very type of plugin was discussed in my last meeting with Muse.Place, where I'm an official agency partner, and this integration would empower Cardano builders. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team seems well-prepared to complete and implement the plugin for Token gating. The team seems experienced enough to deliver an effective tool, especially as they are well-versed in many aspects of Cardano, as well as familiar with what is available on other chains currently. \n\nThe plan itself is thorough and seems viable, especially as the team has been involved in many Cardano projects that are valuable to the ecosystem. \n\nFurthermore, this proposal needs to be implemented so that the ecosystem can grow. If it is not this proposal that advances, sooner or later Token Gating will be needed in Cardano. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The information provided for auditing is suffifienct. The team has a number of milestones that include establishing the platform, building users, and marketing services. Success would be easy to gauge via usage of the open-source product delivered via this proposal. \n\nThe goal of onboarding major projects on Cardano is vague, but I understand the space enough to know that there really is a need for something like this. I know at least 2 projects looking for Token Gating on Cardano, so I'm confident voting for a team such as this with vast experience and strong likelihood for success.

The proposal is moving towards building a DApp that will allow admins to add information and create scripts that can be copied into their Website/DApp to provide TokenGating capabilities. The proposal aligns with the objective of the challenge and is argued in detail. The project aims to bridge the gap with the Swiss Army knife approach that allows people to connect with each other. Token Gating uses CNFT tokens for use by website visitors. Suggest a description, and detailed explanation, of Token Gating's capabilities. Also provide configurations so we can visualize and get a clear understanding of how it will work.

Milestones are set. Specific tasks are detailed in each time period to be performed. The detailed roadmap shows that the proponent has sufficient technical skills and put a lot of time into the project. About the budget. The proposal requires a budget of $50,150. In my opinion, the required budget is reasonable given the work and time of the project. At the same time, the author has provided 4 detailed budget tables for each job, time ... according to 4 important milestones according to the roadmap clearly. A transparent budget increases the credibility and sustainability of the project. Finally, the members join the group. Another strength of the project is that the members have a lot of knowledge, skills and experience in many fields. The members all have their own strengths and they come together as a professional team. Members have achieved specific successes and hold important positions. Teams are an important factor in determining project success. The above information shows that the ability of each member is the power to make the project's success possible.

At the same time, the detailed budget is analyzed according to 4 milestones (4 budget analysis tables) to facilitate the audit easily and transparently. Besides, the team are members with sufficient professional skills, will be able to complete the project on schedule. The author provides a series of metrics by which we can measure project progress. Specifically: Number of CNFTC Collections subscribed per month; Number of projects using codebase or GitHub clones; Number of Token Gating implementations on Cardano. One very positive thing is to ensure maximum transparency the team will use Google superProxy with Google Analytics publicly visible on the team's DApp. In addition, the team provides more information about superProxy and attachment links, and in YouTube Videos. Since we were provided with a lot of necessary and important information, the proposal is in my opinion a good auditability.

This NFT-based authorization feature is built into a lightweight javascript library and can be integrated into any web3 by embedding a piece of code in the header of the login page. Users can login to the website with QRCode or use a Cardano wallet. After successful login, the user will have access to the perks corresponding to the NFTs they have in their wallet. Perks may include exclusive content of the website, the ability to purchase limited products, tickets, discounts and vouchers etc. Providing an authorization solution through NFT opens up many utilities for web3 creators and builders. For example, artists can raise capital by selling NFTs and giving NFTs buyers access to their exclusive art work.

In my opinion, the budget is appropriate to achieve the set goals.\n\nThe proposal clearly describes how this dApp works. Technical aspects such as architecture, language, and technologies were clearly explained. The project's architecture consists of 2 parts, one is a lightweight javascript library and the other is a dApp. The NFT collection owner will register his collection on the dApp, then the website administrator will receive the javascript code and embed it in the source code of his website. Installation is done as easily as installing analytics tools on a website. The project has given a specific roadmap. Milestones and timelines are documented in detail. I rate the timetable is realistic to get the job done.\n\nAlthough the team has proposed one more project in fund 9, there is no overlap in the team members between the two proposals so I believe they can complete both projects on time if both are funded.\n\nThe risks that may affect the success of the project have been foreseen by the proposer and there are plans to reduce the risks.

This is a very interesting idea, and if done correctly, will definitely boost interest in NFTs and boost interest in the many aspects of the cardano eco system as a whole. A big point of criticism against NFTs is how they serve little purpose other than for collecting and showcasing. Offering attractive financial perks such as discounts and special deals will undoubtedly incentivise people to explore the crypto space. This is a very interesting opportunity for brand owners as well, as they can target a more specific clientele, and show support to NFT collections that stand for causes they believe in.
