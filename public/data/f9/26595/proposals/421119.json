This proposal is not entirely devoid of innovative thought but the main point of innovation on this project is the intentions on the backend of the project, rather than the game mechanics or UI/UX. From my perspective, this missing element poses a major risk to to the sustainable success of this project. My dad is a bank executive for a notable mutual fund in the US and he has told me that one of the \u201cno-go\u201d elements from loan applicants is business loans for consumer facing mobile apps (B2B mobile apps see much higher success rates). There\u2019s a Gartner study that found .01% of mobile apps saw commercial success in 2018. Of those failures, 42% reported the reason for app failure was a shortage of research about market need (which can be partly combatted in this proposal by providing market research - which also might add quantification/tangibility to potential impacts). The most accepted statistic in the last decade is that 99.99% of consumer facing mobile apps see success (success defined as generation of any amount of profit above the initial investment cost), though slightly more optimistic statistics like Fyresite find that 99.5% of consumer apps fail. From the consumer perspective, 23% of users abandon the app after a single use (77% abandon the app after 3 days - btw, these stats weren\u2019t meant to be added together. It\u2019s just a coincidence that they add up to 100%). So, my initial impression is that this proposal is entering into a space with a disadvantaged presumption. I could\u2019ve felt more confident in the chances for success merely by way of reputable partnership but I can\u2019t find any information on any of the investsors & partners listed on the website. Getting into the proposal, I think the framing of the problem statement is not thoroughly addressed by this proposal, as it adds an additional mechanism for aiding in solving environmental problems but it doesn\u2019t change the referenced \u201cfines & incentives\u201d from carbon markets. In regards to the play 2 earn & impact mechanics, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a clear reference to revenue generating mechanics that would support BOTH substantial user incentives to keep using this app with additional generated revenue to make the intended impact on the environment (which could also use some more explanation as to what ways this project would be impacting the environment. As in, which forests will be restored, what kind of trees will be planted,  or what regions will be targeted). I could see advertising, in-app purchases, or data monetization as sufficient mechanisms for achieving these ends but they would have to be done in a intricately UI/UX friendly way to maintain user retention. Lastly, I almost didn\u2019t notice that there is a lack of indication on which blockchain this game would be built on. I would\u2019ve assumed Cardano but the proposal doesn\u2019t actually mention Cardano anywhere in the proposal content, so it would be rather difficult for voters to link impacts of this proposal to the Cardano ecosystem. Upon further research, I found a medium article (https://medium.com/@oxyapes/oxy-token-reward-token-for-saving-the-environment-and-playing-games-71a34a63c4f4 ) that indicates this token being built on the Binance Smart Chain.  I can\u2019t vote positively on this proposal because of the major risk presented by the very high amount of requested funds, lack of indicated uniqueness that would make this proposal innovative an aligned with the mission of Cardano Catalyst, and the shortage of well-defined impacts that link directly to the Cardano ecosystem. I think all of these concerns can be combatted with with more depth/substance to this section. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "This feasibility section seems reasonably functional but some of the elements don\u2019t seem to add up, so I end up ranking this section a 2. The development team seems extremely well quipped to handle a variety of business endeavors, with professional experience in entrepreneurship, technology business development, marketing, and investment. Without direct contribution from technical skills in software development, blockchain, and game design, it looks like this team is outsourcing their game development to Bencin Studios. This game development company has made some small time games that are locatable on various app stores but Oxy Apes has yet to be cited. The roadmap is full of actionable steps that thoroughly outline different tasks that are planned to reach completion of the proposal in development, marketing, and community building but it doesn\u2019t give an overall timeline about how long it will take to fully complete everything. Based on the cited dates, it looks like a lot of these steps should already be done with an MVP version of the game completed. I couldn\u2019t find any access to it and the Discord and Twitter pages don\u2019t have any information on progress, so I assume it\u2019s very limited access. However, since progress dates back to previously completed actionable steps, voters don\u2019t really get a sense of what this proposal is funding specifically and how long those actionable steps will take to reach completion. The given budget also doesn\u2019t align with the requested funding, so voters arent\u2019 given the opportunity to evaluate efficiency in spending for the funding of this proposal. I think there\u2019s some feasibility demonstrated in different aspects of this proposal, I just can\u2019t vote positively because there are missing details that are essential for evaluating direct feasibility. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I rank this section a 3 because I can see definitions of success that are somewhat tangible but some of these tangibles should have already been delivered and cannot be found. I think there is room for further quantification in more short term timeframes related to direct links to impacts, such as beta testing stats, social media engagement, and user base at launch. I also think these metrics could be projected over different timeframes to demonstrate progress expectations over an extended time period. This will show voters a commitment to a certain level of performance and give them more tangibility to evaluate outcome vs cost. Lastly, I would suggest disclosing where updates will be posted so that the community knows where to look out for those updates. I\u2019m uncertain because it looks like some of the information in the proposal might be out of date, so I\u2019m not certain of what updated standards of success are being anticipated for the actionable steps of this particular proposal.

The proposal is more of a request for funding, which would provide $250,000 out of 4.5 million required to develop and launch the game. There are still many challenges and risks associated with this idea, which does not yet have a popular game developed, or proven tokenomics. It is not clear how much of the 4.5 Million the proposer will be able to raise through other fundraising efforts. Building a successful and popular game is a difficult and risky business. It it is expensive to hire professional game developers, and market the game successfully. Play to earn games add an additional challenge, as much of the potential income/profit will be paid back to the gamers. In this proposal they have added a third challenge by taxing the in game economy to fund environmental initiatives and I assume purchase carbon offset or pay to plant trees. While I like the concept, it is very risky, and there is a low probability that funding this game will result in a significant number of new users on Cardano.  Oxyapes also appears to be associated with oxymoon on binance chain, so its not clear how this would add any impact to Cardano if the game is run on Binance smart chain and not on Cardano. https://oxyape.gitbook.io/oxymoon-s-ventures/ \nhttps://coinmooner.com/coin/2122\nThe team consists of 3 people with backgrounds in banking and marketing (not game development, or environmental sustainability) So while there is risk they may not be able to raise the funds required to start building the game, the company hired to build the game does not appear to be a leading game development company. https://www.bencinstudios.com/games While It's likely they can deliver a game, it is difficult to know if it will be popular with gamers. The in game tax of 2% provided for sustainability initiatives seems like a small amount of $ that will actually be used for sustainability, while the branding of the game is very eco-friendly and P2E focused.  In summary, all the combined risks make this a low priority for use of Cardano treasury funds. I would suggest the proposing team re-apply at a later date when more work has been completed on the game, and additional funding secured from other investors. The proposal does not clearly explain how funding this early stage startup will help onboard new users to Cardano.

The budget does not explain how the $250,000 requested will be used, and the budget breakdown includes a much larger sum of 4.5 Million. It is not clear from the proposal if this additional required funds have already been secured by the proper or not. This proposal is dependent on millions of funding from unknown sources, and it is not clear what the plan is to obtain this funding. The proposal and plan does not include information about the tokenomics of the game, or the cost to play the game. It does not explain the technical architecture or even what platforms the game will be launched on, or what blockchain the underlying oxymoon / oxyape token will be on. The section of the proposal that addresses the risks does not appear to explain the many risks I have mentioned in this assessment. The proposer states: \"To ensure that what we create gets used we plan to involve our community as much as possible, along with having a strong network of talented people who can help if needed, if we need some further polishing and inputs or changes.\" However, there is no additional information on who this refers to or this network of talented people. It would appear that the Cardano treasury and investors would be taking on all the risk here in a very competitive market for P2E games.

In what way? By forming partnerships with companies that provide carbon offsets. According to a report published in Industry Research (shorturl.at/bimrY), this market in 2021 is expected to have a market size of US$ 755 million, with a CAGR of 21.3% between 2022 and 2028. If successfully implemented, I am certain it would be a flagship use case within the ecosystem, so yes, I believe it would add value and align with what is sought in this challenge. Nevertheless, when reading the entire proposal, the author leaves a number of loose ends that limit the ability to conduct a thorough assessment of the potential impact. There is no information about what has been built so far. A video is provided with some images that suggest how the game would be like, a link to the game website is provided, but there is no demo available, nor is there any indication that the game will be built in Cardano. Unfortunately, the impact metrics are at a very high level, it is mentioned that a $200,000 player base is expected by mid-2023, but there is insufficient information to confirm this.

Unfortunately it is not provided who would be the person from that company who would be the main contact so to speak. The budget is presented in a very confusing way, and makes it virtually impossible to properly analyze the team's rationale for requesting $250,000. It is not possible to align the intended tasks with the budget requested. There are two main milestones that, in my understanding, require the hiring of UX designers, artists for the design of the NFT collection, front-end, back-end, and haskell/plutus developers, marketing, and project management. Despite the positive intent of describing the general roadmap and strategic vision to the community, it is crucial for the author to explain clearly where the funds will be allocated, and what is the expected ROI (return on intention). Unfortunately the risk section could also have done a better job. There is no structured approach to an assessment of foreseeable risks associated with the solution. Most obviously, something common to virtually all teams wishing to build smart contracts in Cardano is the shortage of developers with the necessary skills.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Although I believe the author's vision is interesting, ambitious, and noble. The description made in the proposal is very confusing. It does not allow a complete analysis as it leaves a lot of key information very vague.

These are all red flags to me. Apart from that, the implementation plan is not very realistic: No developers are hired yet, there is an insane amount of tasks (half of which are just describing features added, no real development tasks) to be finished in a very short amount of time. Game development simply is not that fast.

This is not a red flag, but a concern, as it makes delivery of an overwhelmingly enjoyable game where mission, game play and NFT integration all come together less likely. It also in my experience increases the risks of the implementation. As this proposal asks for a relatively large amount of funding by Catalyst standards, $250k, and this is only a fraction of the 4.5mln budget, I am concerned that this project may not get finished without a lot more Catalyst funding and help from the community, or might be at risk from pivoting to other chains or VC funding that could water down the impact for Cardano. The demo video is in my subjective opinion slightly underwhelming, as it does not mirror the fun and action aspect of the great Ape NFT design. Neither does the environment the game is set in aligns with the impact aspect of the game by showcasing the nature setting as this endangered treasure worth saving. I really wanted to like this proposal, but the lack of verifiable credentials and unimpressive game demo / mockups make me neither agree nor disagree that this project is likely to be implemented successfully.

It will not be possible from the information provided to sufficiently track and assess this project as it gets underway within the ringfenced Catalyst funding. This is not always a must-have, and it is permissible to use Catalyst funding as a grant to top up promising projects with partial funding from other sources, but in those cases it would help a lot to provide much more accountability and background information, references or insights into the implementation processes.

The proposer starts by laying out the problem statement, that the fines and the incentives within the carbon markets are too low, that the regulations are enforced (this part is very unclear) and that companies are looking for loopholes. Okay. Now, the proposed solution is a play-to-earn type of game (or rather play to restore), focused on the carbon market. As much as I have tried, the word restore only appears scarcely throughout the proposal and it\u2019s not very clear what exactly will the users be restoring to earn. Probably degraded forests, since this phrase appears within the SDG goals, but it\u2019s rather outside the scope of the actual game presentation. Searching through the milestones we also encounter a carbon calculator tool and NFT medals in case you need more information. \n\nTo have turned this proposal into an excellent one I would have expected to find: \n\n- ELI5 explanations on how the game would function, where would the revenue come from and a very solid plan on connecting the game with the real world. None of this is trus in this proposal\n- eye catching graphics, teasers and sneak previews into how the game would look like. We do have some demos from other games (I saw a constant run one) but the level of detail was simply not very exciting and definitely not interactive\n\nGiven the very confusing problem statement and value proposition, it is very difficult to assess the impact that this type of game can have on the Cardano ecosystem, and whether it will actually be useful to drive adoption further and create a real use case, and I therefore deem two stars as sufficient.

They do a very extensive presentation for each of the members, where we can find their past experiences and areas of expertise, we are being offered social media profiles, and we can clearly see that we have in front of us a rather strong team, well connected and not at all strangers to the gaming industry. An excellent point is the onboarding of Bencin Studios, a gaming studio based in Smyrna, Tennessee. Judging from their website, they have a very solid team and an interesting portfolio of games.  \n\nLet\u2019s move on now to the elephant in the room. The team calls the game restore to earn, but they make no effort whatsoever to explain to us what the difference between restore to earn is from play to earn, and it\u2019s very easy to make this association immediately. So until proven otherwise, I have to act as if this game will be a play to earn. And, sadly, playing to earn games is rather unsustainable in the long term, and there are only two ways to keep the system in balance: the first, dangerous path, is when the inflow of new (paying) players sustains the rewards for the more veteran ones. The second path is when the game developers manage to focus on the gameplay features and turn the game into a really playable and enjoyable experience, which is easier said than done. \n\nThe choice for the budget layout is rather unfortunate. I think it is laudable that they have chosen to start with total budget breakdown of funds raised, not only Catalyst funding, but the captions and percentages presented it\u2019s not really sure what they represent. Is it the part of the budget already raised? Or the budget already consumed? Or the percentage for which Catalyst funding is seeked? Not clear at all. Sameer, a member of the team, is a CFA (a very well regarded certification), so the team really has strong finance and accounting skills there, but I honestly would have expected slightly more in terms of budget presentation. \n\nThis is turning into a long review so just a few words about the milestones. First milestone is in Nov, until when dev hiring should be complete and a bunch of other preparatory work done. The second milestone is one month later, when a smart contract should be in place with their environmental partner - but again no additional information on what actually is this smart contract or who is their partner. Anyway that\u2019s also the deadline for testnet launch and demo time. \n\nDespite the fact that the team looks rather strong, the game economics, budget description and roadmap are very very poor, and again, two stars are all that this proposal receives.

Besides this very ballsy goal, they state that a performance indicator is the shipment of the solution (but we don\u2019t know to whom - we are still talking about testnet right?). \n\nWe definitely have some material to work with in terms of auditability, but an excellent proposal should have also included actual metrics on the \u201creal\u201d part of the game, the \u201crestore\u201d, remember?

The money is divided into categories, however, this information has not been itemized into particular salaries or what the planned \u2018development and infrastructure costs\u2019 will be.  Their funding request from Cardano is $250,000, it is not described or shared how this money will be divided or used within the first few months, or within the project\u2019s overall goal of 2 years.\nThe team members appear to be all finance, environmental and business related people, with the addition of Bencin Studios as the game developer. It does add confidence that they have a quick mock-up game demonstration available on YouTube, so hopefully the game developers can create the dapp desired by the team.\nOverall, I can not see this project as feasible, how do they get the rest of the planned funding? How do they integrate the rewards, they have been rather vague on the blockchain usage and how they will create, raise and distribute the \u2018$OXY tokens\u2019? I give it 2 stars for feasibility.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "For a project with a planned budget of $4.5million there is no clear financial progress reporting documentation listed. There is no where itemized particular staff costs, how much they will pay themselves, and how much the game developers will need. It can not be financially accounted for and this is a worry for the $250,000 funding they are requesting from Cardano, to do, who knows what?\nThey do set a \u2018shipment of solutions\u2019 timeline in terms of product development goals. Some of which will be easy to find, particularly when the game is released. However, they have not listed a Github, website progress link or even a Google sheet where community members could follow this progress in more detail. \nThe main milestone they have set is to have a playerbase of 200,000 players by Q2 2023. What about the progress goal of their $OXY tokens? What about the carbon neutral and climate change goals - how will these be measured and accounted for?\nOverall, I don\u2019t feel this project can be confidently audited from the information provided in this proposal due to the lack of details and specifics. For auditability I give it 2 stars.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_3840", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "We believe we need to unite companies, communities and consumers to solve this big problem (climate change).
