For seniors of course this is not the case and more appropriate mechanisms have to be found if the aim is to increase their participation in the blockchain industry in general and within the Cardano ecosystem in particular. \n\nThe proposal is interesting from another point of view, namely that it better resembles a funding mechanism than a general proposal to build a solution. I would define it as a rather unorthodox combination of rapid-funding mechanism, alternative (or rather additional) review mechanism to Catalyst itself.\n\nMore specifically, the project intends to launch an incubator for projects focused on the senior market, with each project capping funding at 25k USD. Of course, this is something that Catalyst can do on its own, but let\u2019s see in the following section some of the advantages and disadvantages of this newly proposed mechanism. \n\nThe incubator would run independently from the Catalyst process and would be directed by five community members with the power to award funding. Overall there would be a positive impact for the Cardano community if this project were implemented, but with significant risks of overlapping the Catalyst function, so only four stars I deem as appropriate. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Governance is hard, governance is tricky and governance is important. This is valid across the entire world, when we talk about governments, institutions or even functioning smaller entities like small businesses or families. Charles has said it himself several times, and Cardano has in its DNA the governance-exploring and research gene: the many IOG studies in this area and the excellent level of debate in the Cardano communities regarding governance are a strong statement in this respect.\n\nI start the feasibility part with this governance introduction only because it is highly relevant for this proposal - since it basically asks for a certain portion of funds to be disbursed towards the community through an alternative funding mechanism. This in itself is a blessing and a curse at the same time. A blessing because imagining a better governance mechanism requires experimentation - and this proposal is exactly this. Different, agile, innovative, with unknown rewards in the end. \n\nA curse because there are big unknowns. We are not being told how the board would function. Will the proposer\u2019s place amongst the five be permanent, will there be checks and balances if he doesn\u2019t act in the interest of the community, and who can challenge that and what can be put in place? What about the other four members, how will they be chosen and what will be those mechanisms to keep their actions in check? How will the board handle conflicts of interest? Are there good enough selection skills within the team to make sure viable projects are selected? \nBudget discussions are fairly simple - the majority of the budget would be passed along proposers. So the system will be agile in this respect. Only a fraction of the budget would be used to remunerate board members.\n\nI am indulgently offering four stars in the feasibility section, but only because within Catalyst we are supposed to \u201cbreak things\u201d, and this proposal is possibly an excellent candidate for such a \u201cbreaking\u201d experiment. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "We have a rather weak, or uncertain case for auditability here, and I don\u2019t think that the projects funded this way would be subject to the same scrutiny that general Catalyst projects.\n\nThe team stars the section by informing us that they will be using an Agile system to make relevant information available. The transparency process will focus on three parts. First, a formation period is mentioned, in which the admin team would take shape. This is however an information not really connected to the auditability so it\u2019s not very clear how it connects to this section. Second, the efforts would go towards marketing the funding round, and we are being told that this would be a \u201cjoint community\u201d effort. My reading of this phrase is rather negative, since I understand that the onus will be placed on the community rather than the team behind the proposal to spread the word, and I\u2019m not sure this is a very constructive attitude. Third, there would be the proposal period, similar to the one Catalyst organizes, and a voting process. Another significant question mark, since we have not been given any indication that the team will be able to handle the voting process on and  off-chain, in a similar fashion to what IOG is performing now. A slightly positive aspect is that the team sets out a clear and simple success metric: over nine projects funded, focused on the global senior market, but this is all that we are being offered in terms of measuring success, so there is definitely a lack of clarity and loss of focus in this section.\n\nAn excellent proposal would have included perhaps relevant metrics comparing impact from similar Catalyst funded proposals to some funded through this mechanism, or a comparison of \u201ctime-to-market\u201d for products, building an argument that this mechanism is more agile / faster / better / more impactful than Catalyst.
