This is a fair and existing problem and solution will address, potentially also increase NFT adoption, as this feature my engage new artists and traders. This also fits very well in challenge as  a new product built on top of Cardano will be developed and it can potentially increase challenge kpi of \"Increasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases.\"\n\nAs for the proposal itself, it presents a very rich description on how the solution will work and what are steps necessary to get to it. it also does an excellente job on showing the value proposition for each stakeholder just as what are features and functionality that totally helps to understand the project.\n\nI liked that an agile life-cycle will be used for this project. As it is realted to a software development, this framework helps to collect feedback,validate the increments made and adjust the requirement backlogs after each 2 weeks (sprints), delivering value with a higher cadency.\nRisk management part is well done, identying accurately the main challenge (engaging artists on NFT) and providing an ellaborated mitigation plan. This mitigation plan also seems to be intrinsically related to the communication/marketing strategy that will be adopted in this project.\n\nIn concludion, it is a great proposal, based on a solid solution for an existing problem.

The proposer would like solve this problem by developing an easy-to-use, open-source toolkit that enables individuals, users, or communities to create 3D virtual spaces - known as Virtual Experiences (VES), and publish them directly within the marketplace. The toolkit will be integrated in their existing NFT marketplace -Galaxy of Art (GoA); MVP at galaxyof.art; and it will be open-source. I appreciate the proposer's effort for explaining in detail about 4 categories of VES and its general functionality so that community could visualize how it works, what users could do which differentiate their idea from other proposals. I think, this is a very good idea and fits well with the Challenge. Because this toolkit will provide an immersive experience to users, creators, or artists, enhance social interactions on further expanding the NFT ecosystem on Cardano. Besides, this proposal will also deliver a set of standards and best practices that can be used by Cardano community and marketplaces and speed up Cardano adoption and usability in the Web3 and the Metaverse space, as a result, attract users to the platform and significantly increase the number of ADA holders. The big challenge is how to convince artists, collectors, and users to adopt this toolkit solution, and ensure the implementation time and budget for the long-term development of the project. The proposer suggests some ways on mitigating these risks that I think, it is reasonable. In general, I am very interested and fully support their idea. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I think, the feasibility part is quite good, but some parts need a little more explanation. In terms of the roadmap, they plan to launch VES after 6 months, in which tasks will run in parallel and be carried out on a monthly basis. The proposer lists out their main focus, key tasks need to be done. These tasks include VES design, backend, frontend development, integration the toolkit into their current NFT marketplace (Galaxy of Art), testing, and awareness & community building. I think, this plan is good, because in addition to focusing on the technical development, the proposer also plan to educate community and prepare marketing materials regarding this toolkit. However, I would like the proposer to be more specific about the timeline for each task, I mean, estimating the starting date and finishing date of each task, and the tasks should be planned weekly. Next, reading the project's expense, in my opinion, it is not clear enough, and somehow does not match with their plan. For example, the proposer states the cost for Marketing, awareness and community building is (1,4 x $4000 x 6 months), but I do not understand how it is calculated? What does \"1,4\" number here mean?. Moreover, in their plan, the proposer states the duration of Awareness & Community Building is 1 month, so I just wonder why the proposer multiplies it by 6 months here? I think, other items of the budget part is not detailed enough for me too. My suggestion is that the proposer should clarify how many people involve in each task? How many hours they could dedicate and what is the hourly rate? So I think, the total required budget of $149,700 here is not clearly explained. Finally, speaking of their team, the proposer clarify their project' roles, and confidently introduce some key members in their team. Via their detailed profile information, personally, they are qualified and experienced enough to carry out this project, with provided Linkedin link for community to learn more about them. After all, with all of the above analysis, I think, the feasibility script would be better, if the budget part is given in a more detailed manner. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I think the auditability of this proposal is possible. The proposer would keep track of the project' progress regarding: toolkit technical development; and marketing & community building. Firstly, for the toolkit development, they will measure based on the given roadmap. The proposer will use Agile methodology to monitor, and hold weekly meetings to review progress and take additional actions if needed. However, the proposer should clearly tell Will this meeting be recorded, or meeting summary be shared public to community? How community could access this weekly meeting reports? on which ways, website, youtube or social media channels?. Even though the proposer gives some key metrics (the total number of pull requests in Github, Github commits, errors fixed, the total lines of code for the toolkit, the number of transactions, users joining the test phase), they do not provide the link or show how and where community could track these indicators? Secondly, for the checking of the marketing & community building, the proposer committed to have 2 posts per day on their social media (Twitter, Discord, Tiktok), 1 Youtube video per week summarizing the progress, 2 articles per week to their Newsletter, daily posts to Cardano and GoA community; therefore, these quantitative numbers make it easier for community to monitor the project. Additionally, by checking the number of daily visitors to their website, likes, comments, feedbacks, we could see how engaged the community to this project. In general, some mentioned above methods are sufficient for community to track the project's progress.

This will create alternative revenue and growth opportunities for GoA itself. In addition, thanks to its open-source nature, which will allow a wide variety of ideas and unforeseen use cases to be deployed, Cardano NFT marketplaces will be reusable.

Web3 and Metaverse are growing stronger and stronger. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a term that has been mentioned a lot in the past few years. The NFTs market is growing rapidly, especially with the participation of many celebrities and artists. However, for now, it still displays static information about digital creations, lacks 3D rendering potential, and limits interaction between users.\nThe proposed solution solved that problem. It's building a toolkit for creating 3D virtual spaces (VES), which is open source, easy to use, and users can publish their own 3D models that can be shown to other users through information. through the market. The toolkit's management will allow communities to collaborate to jointly create VES. The solution has been described in detail by the author and the method is rigorously argued. The first is to provide a video via a Youtube link to make it easier for readers to visualize. The author has provided data and evidence to describe the current situation of the NFTs market and presented his own solution. The features, functions and implementation process have also been detailed by the author.
