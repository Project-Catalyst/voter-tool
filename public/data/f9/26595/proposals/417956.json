RoundTable is a multisignature wallet - meaning that more than one person need to sign off on any transaction hense the name - multiple signature. This kind of wallet is fully decentralized and usefull if you want to make a treasure where funds are gathered and are not expended unless all signiture owners sign, meaning they're in agreement for the expenses. This project perfectly alignes with the challenge seettings as it's a continuation of an already existing decentralized application. \nThis project specifies a couple of ways to add value to the cardano ecosystem, because multisignature wallets will be used by multiple people to gather funds and democratically approve expenditures. That does mean everyone is included and involved in the expenses. Another nice thing would be automating payments for done work by having for example majority signatures and passing the automatic payment if owne signature minimum is reached.\nThe key metrics and goals like number of colaborators and contributors is an excellent metric for an open source project. As a developer I really like this proposal and don't see anything missing from it. It's really well defined and you'll be surprised at how diverse but spread out ideas and proposals are.\nThis proposal will add a way to cooperate and pay for goals together with mutual agreement. This will be an invaluable part of the future ecosystem and is a dapp we need to have.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I really like the separation of tasks and their estimation in hours because that makes it really easy to calculate later on. There is an iterative approach to the whole project execution. As a developer I can confirm the roadmap and set tasks are doable for the aloted time table.\nUnfortunately I wasn't able to verify most of the team members, because there are no linked in profiles provoded and no links to verify their skills and credentils. I wasn able to google them as well becuse only first nams and nicknames are provided. I managed to look at the code by \"Siegfried\" and him I can vouch for. He is the main contributor for the RoundTable github codebase and has done the most of the work up until now.\nConcerning the plan for implementation - as i mentioned it does seem reasonable and well put together, but it's hard for me to estimate if it's doable or not, considering I can't verify the skills, but If the listed ones could be trusted, I do think it's a reasonable timeframe to complete this project successfully.\nThe resources necessary for implementing the proposal are listed and the team members and their type are known and I hope they're requited already and not just listed as has happened in previous proposals.\nThe project seems to be in sync with what's already out there and it seeks to provide more mising functionallity and integrate with the already existing ecosystem. There's a mention of enabling developers to use the multisig wallet in their applications, so that's amazing. Adding a functionality to release funds given a signature majority cound would be great for future integrations as I know of multiple dapps that will take advantage of such functionality.\nOverall this seems like a reasonable and feasible proposals despite the few caveats I've mentioned.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There's an opensource github and a discord server, so auditability is not an issue here. \nThere's a clear problem statements suplemented by an even clearer and half implemented already solution, which is amazing.\nThe proposal is understandable usable, with good metrics and KPIs to chase so on the auditability front, it's all good and anyone interested in the proposal will be able to track it's progress - probably mostly developers although it has a somewhat userfriendly outlook.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2463", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 1, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3634, "q0": "This proposal by ADAO is to continue developing their open source tool called \u201cRoundTable\u201d which provides the infrastructure required for any entity to create a multi-signature wallet in Cardano.

The proposal is presented in the correct challenge, since the team is actively working on developing this dapp which is already in use and they want to integrate it with other projects who have approached them.

In the question if they would return for dunging on a later round, the team mentions this proposal is to fund four to six months of development upgrades and integrations. It would have been better if they provided more information on how they came to this conclusion. Regarding the budget breakdown, they list core activities and the hours of development they entail but it\u2019s not clear to me how they came to the total since certain amount of hours are multiple by 75 and other by 40.

They also state several success metrics to be achieved by Q4 2022, such as integrations with NFT marketplaces, metaverses and DeFi protocols. I\u2019m personally more enthusiastic about the staking functionality. To summarize, this proposal is presented by a skilled and proven team building an already used and loved tool by the community.

This proposal will enable more user friendly features with possible uses in NFT marketplace, DeFi protocols and Metaverses. The problem statement is closely aligned with the challenge and bring more uses to the Roundtable dapp and also reward the outside developer with their bounty system. The team has identified rightly the risk of developers not being able to work on the project and lack of interest.

The budget breakdown is based on technical hours with 2 pay rates.

The metrics chosen for their milestones are organized and detailed and can be audited quite easily by the community ie.

These updates are not described well enough for me to fully understand what this proposal is attempting to achieve precisely. There is mention to add in new features to RoundTable but there is nothing specific mentioned. As an assessor I would like to know what the initiatives are that are to be funded through Catalyst. The process of determining these initiatives are sound. Having community votes on development specifications is a good way to determine where the focus of application development should take place. It is difficult for me to personally support a proposal that appears to not have a precise development goal when it comes to application updates. \n\nThis proposal also makes claims to the RoundTable application being utilized by several other projects.

I do not understand exactly where the rates come from and what hours they are pertaining to. It may help to explain where the hours for those calculations are coming from.\n\nThe people described in this project are excellently outlined. Based on the described experiences there is no doubt that those working on this proposal have the skill and knowledge base to complete this project.
