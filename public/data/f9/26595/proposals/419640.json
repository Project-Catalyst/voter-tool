This proposal suggests building a platform where users can go to help them navigate through the Cardano ecosystem. This will allow them to recognize \"red flags\" and refrain from falling into the hands of a malicious developer. A project as described in this proposal could bring a lot of utility to the ecosystem. This will benefit many users who know where to find it. The main question to ask is, how will this be marketed? Or how will people find this project? For these reasons.

This is important to recognize that the proposers have significant experience and that they will be capable of building out \"Project Verify.\" There is a very specific roadmap that includes exactly what will be happening every 3 months. This funding event would sustain the team in building this project for over a year. The requested funds are very considerate compared to other proposals I have seen. It is also a project that will bring utility to other community members rather than simply funding a project so that they can benefit. There is also a detailed budget breakdown shows exactly where the requested funds would be allocated. Again, there is a specific timeframe that allows for them to be held accountable. Something that should be considered is how these individuals will be completely held accountable to ensuring that the requested funds are utilized properly. Is there a community behind this project already? I noticed that the \"Project Verify\" doesn't have any information included yet. It may be wise to gain a following and build a community so that there can be someone who will hold the team accountable to this proposed idea.

The second concept has been mentioned that before. It is crucial to auditing the progress of any proposal. That idea is accountability. It is hard to ensure that the requested funds would be implemented successfully without someone being held accountable.
