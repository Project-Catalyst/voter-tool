Is it difficult to evaluate how big of an impact this app will have and the size of the market. It would have been good to present some numbers on the commercial value of such an app and how many people you would initially target.\n\nThe KPIs indicated in the proposal match the ones indicated in the challenge (app usage numbers, number of users).\n\nIn my opinion, this proposal somehow addresses the challenge but not very effectively, this is why I'll rate impact a 3/5.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer did not give a clear account of what skill sets will be necessary to deliver on the proposal.

This is at the end of the day obscure and not reassuring in regards to the expertise or ability for this team to bring this proposal to completion.\n\nThe budget is outlined clearly, understandable and broken down into identifiable items (dev, legal, Marketing). The budget seems to be reasonable to achieve the set goals. The roadmap and the end product description is however quite unclear. It seems the product is (1) proprietary, (2) designed for the Future Fest metaverse but is marketed here as with future potential use for other metaverses. Is it an app? Is it a smart contract? Is it a website? The proposal doesn't clearly explains technical aspects like architecture, language and technologies if they are crucial for implementation.\nGiven the experience and plan presented, it is not certain that this proposal will be implemented successfully and this is why I rate this proposal a 2 out of 5 in feasibility.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal provided a roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement.\n\nThe KPIs that define the success of the proposal are presented and make sense ( how many people are using our system to work, total number of attendees and time spent in the metaverse.)

The proposal will enable people to work in Cardano metaverse and get paid in cryptocurrency. The proposal elevates social interactions of players and its dapp can also attract businesses to build on their platform which will increase utility and Cardano adoption.

Therefore, it is anticipated that applications and goods fulfill a specific standard and provide consumers with an exceptional experience in order to protect the reputation and integrity of the Cardano metaverses. By having real-time players perform mundane activities that are often performed by built-in bot characters, the author suggests that support for these concerns can be increased. As a result, the user experience would be improved and they would want to return. This would increase the general adoption of Cardano by users and businesses creating Cardano Metaverses. Additionally, the author suggests standardizing this approach so that it can be applied to different metaverses and even other chains. The only reason for reducing a point would be the concern with urgency in the need for such a solution when we require much superior issue fixes and other necessary features to be implemented over the chain.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In their proposal, the team highlighted being very attentive to the timeframe, and it appears that they have thoughtfully planned for it. The team has briefly described the milestones they hope to achieve in the next six months and the readiness of a working prototype. Nearly all of the monies donated are going to the developers, according to the budget breakdown, and all the numbers seem reasonable and encouraging. The team lays up a solid basis going into this funding round by providing the community with all the references to their prior endeavors and how well they have developed.

The success measures are a more developed subset of the challenge's main metrics and have been carefully crafted. The community may find it helpful to monitor the application and impact of the plan by having access to both quantitative and qualitative measurements. The team made sure to include all parts of their proposal because it was a new one, making it comprehensive.

The ability to attract and retain visitors to the metaverse space requires authentic albeit virtual interactions and engagement. The key to creating and extending engagement will be to provide interactions with actual human employees represented by avatars in the metaverse as opposed to NPCs (non-player characters).\n\nThe proposal also emphasizes that these positions must be paid positions and that wages must be fair and reflect the demands of the job. In order for metaverse jobs to be viewed and taken seriously, and in order for the idea of metaverses to take on a degree of legitimacy, efforts must be taken to ensure that those that keep the metaverse \"running\" and provide experiences are compensated fairly and appropriately for their time and skills.\n\nCreating jobs and hiring real people to work within the metaverse represented by avatars should improve engagement and retention of users but also attract those looking to work remotely and virtually from the comforts of their homes.

I see the legal side of things as one of the most significant areas to focus on as the blockchain/web 3 space evolves. Legal compliancy and advice in the emerging world of web 3 will be keys to the success of not just this project but others as well.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal covers the major statistical items that should be tracked using their analytical platform Mixpanel. The broad picture is there, but more specific metrics or further details on the items outlined would have clarified things a bit more. This is an especially important factor when it comes to the question of \"what success looks like\" for the proposal. I don't doubt the reliability of the metrics collected - and I think they can be easily collected, documented and audited over time. The validity of those statistics and the meaning attached to them are more of what I'd like to know more about. For example, how many attendees and for how long must they attend to be considered \"successful\"? How many workers employed/roles filled? How would you measure engagement? Is it as simple as time invested on a platform? Are there other metrics that we should be looking at?", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2820", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9149, "q0": "\"This proposal is from the creators of the first and largest NFT marketplace in the MENA.

This will encourage people who trust their brand to buy and use Cardano, raising knowledge of the currency in the area and boosting adoption, which expands the ecosystem. \nThey tested their MVP in the market fairly early on, gathered data and user feedback, and are now modifying and building their platform in response. People in the MENA region are seeking a solution that enables them to use Cardano in the NFT sector, in their language, and while respecting their culture, so this integration is appropriate for execution at this time. The above will contribute to creating value for Cardano and the wider ecosystem. \nThey say two possible risks:\n One, users don't know which blockchain to choose and the team solve this by framing their marketplace as a cross-platform NFT experience for the users and teaching them through the creation of written and video lessons, participation in events, exhibitions, and panel discussions, as well as through their media channel.\nTwo, customers don't know how to create an e-wallet, which reduces demand for Cardano. The team intends to mitigate this by incorporating Cardano wallets into their automatic non-custodial wallet creation at sign-up, as well as links on the homepage and tutorial videos on how to set up a Cardano wallet.\n\"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\"They have the great advantage of not having to create the entire market from scratch.
