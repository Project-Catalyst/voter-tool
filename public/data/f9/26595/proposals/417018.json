The proponent claims that it will be a marketplace aimed at selling these courses, a personalized environment where users can learn about blockchain technologies, with some courses being paid, others free and also available in different languages \u200b\u200b(which ones?). In theory, the proposal is perfect and fully aligned with the challenge, since the idea is to create a platform that allows a large number of people (it is said that the proposer already has a website with one million monthly visits, and that audience would be directed to new platform). The problem is that I noticed that it lacked further explanations, detailing how the site would highlight Cardano in relation to other blockchains and how the contents would be addressed. It is said that great teachers from the blockchain universe would be brought to the platform: who would these teachers be? How would they be associated with our community? It is also said that it would be a challenge to bring together vendors (teachers) to market their courses, and how this problem would be mitigated is not raised. Some suggestions I would like to make, so that the impact of the proposal could be a little more solid, would be the following: at first, it would be very interesting if the content to be addressed was more specified. There is already a lot of content about blockchain on youtube, from what I understand the differential of this platform would be both in terms of organization (perhaps the user would be able to navigate in a more orderly way in relation to the areas they want to learn better and delve into), perhaps the The language used in the courses varies according to the student's level (for example, if they already have some familiarity with the topics covered or none at all\u2026). But it would be important to highlight the differences between the approaches discussed here for the content that is currently available on the internet (more specifically on youtube). Another point that would be positive if it were better detailed would be the question of the different languages \u200b\u200baddressed: how could we guarantee diversity in this aspect? One idea would be to get in touch with representatives of some established hubs (for example, we know that the Catalyst School project has several ramifications, such as the Latin American School - perhaps it would be interesting to make some point with these community members). In this way, we could guarantee more diversified access to different audiences. It would be very beneficial if the proponent had posted a short video that demonstrated a preview of the interface they want to create, as the attached files don't give us a good idea of \u200b\u200bwhat's to come. With that, I believe that the proposal can bring new members to Cardano, reaching the objectives of the challenge, but it still needs some improvements.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In general, the proposal is viable. As in the previous topic, only a few questions could be further explored so that we have greater confidence in the feasibility, especially in the explanation of the requested budget. Talking about the script, I believe that this part is quite satisfactory, since the temporal division is done in months and several activities are listed for each of them, so that we have a very good understanding of the development process as a whole. I believe that the greater detail of some parts (such as, for example, a greater explanation about the design construction process and the developers' work routine) would have added value to the planning. But generally speaking, my only suggestion is for the proponent to include when the project would start (what would month 1 be? Right after funding is released). I believe that in general this part is ok, without many adjustments being precise. As I said at the beginning of the topic, the part that, in my view, needs more attention is the detailing of expenses. 33,500 dollars are requested, which are divided into several parts, such as the salaries of the professionals involved (Developer Front-end, Developer Back-end, UX/UI Designer, Teacher/Content Editor, etc.). Other parts go towards expenses like marketing, social media, maintenance of Amazon services, etc. But let's go by parts. I don't understand why a value of 3300 dollars is asked for teachers, if the courses would be some paid and some free, wouldn't the idea be to create a platform similar to Udemy, in which professionals profit from the value of their sales? So why would funding be asked for this part? In relation to the other workers here, it would be important that their work routines were better explained, so that we would know how many weekly/monthly hours they would dedicate to the project and with that we would have an understanding about the price of their work hours. It would be interesting if we knew what the marketing campaign would be like, what strategies the team adopted to publicize the platform, and why it would cost 2400 dollars. The expenses of maintaining Amazon AWS services should be better explained, what would these fees be? Therefore, I think that the explanation of the financing still leaves room for a series of doubts to remain open. When it comes to the team, this part was very good, we know who the members are and what they do, what their resumes are, linkedin profiles and how they relate to our blockchain. Although some (like Ot\u00e1vio) have provided more information than others (like Gino), in general it is possible to have a good understanding of who is responsible for the project, which generates a lot of confidence in the team.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Unfortunately this is the topic that leaves the most to be desired in the proposal. I say this because the information provided for both how we could monitor the development process (progress) and the final results (success) is quite short and is mostly based on numbers. For the process, the observation of the number of accesses to the site, of people registered for available courses would be used. However, this data serves to understand how the engagement of the site itself would be; and not how it would be built. Because our script is satisfactory here, this monitoring becomes simpler. It is possible to get a sense of what is planned to happen when, as the months are precisely divided and activities are delegated to each. So, what was pending was that, in fact, this follow-up is done by the team, so that we know what would be happening over the months. In this sense, it would be necessary for some communication to be established between the team and the Cardano community. Monthly reports could be prepared, detailing the progress made in the different parts of the project, such as the issue of development (back and front end for example), design, marketing, creation of the courses themselves, etc.; how the work routine of each professional was being performed, if the tasks were being carried out in the way they were planned and also within the predetermined period. And talking about the success scenario, the suggested metrics (number of completed courses + number of certificates issued + number of salespeople (teachers) with registered courses) once again fully relate to the performance of the platform itself, but it is necessary we go much further so that the auditability of success is done properly. It would be necessary for us to understand how the students of these courses would be learning about blockchain, which would be generated from the accumulated knowledge, so that they would be putting into practice what they learned... It would be important to keep in touch, after some time, with such students . One idea I had was: when buying the course, the student could consciously agree to, after some time (2 months for example) give feedback to the platform, nothing too long or complex, just to understand if he became an active member of the platform. Cardano community, if you started acquiring Ada, CNFTs, getting involved in Catalyst projects, using Dapps and etc. That way, we would have a more solid understanding of whether the challenge's objectives had, in the end, actually been addressed. Therefore, I think this topic needs to be better formulated to make it suitable. More information needs to be passed on so that we can make sure that the challenge KPIs (\u201cIncreasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases. Increase the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products.
