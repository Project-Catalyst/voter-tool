In short, the idea is to create a platform where musicians can transform their creations into NFTs, so that they have full control over them; and at the same time so that fans can acquire these NFTs, supporting their favorite artists and still making a kind of investment, as NFTs can come to value if the artist acquires enough fame. Through the development of the NFTs, it allows artists to \u201cpermanently lock their original files, allowing them to become independent and develop their careers\u201d, as well as \u201chelping original artists follow how their tracks are used, protect and help them to collect unclaimed royalties if necessary\u201d. The difference of this platform, according to the proponent, is that it is not necessary to have previous knowledge about the cryptographic universe to understand the minting process and the creation of digital wallets, as this would be done in a more automated way, from what I I understood. This would allow a public that does not have knowledge about blockchain to take advantage of our technologies. From what I have also gleaned from this proposal, NFTs could be purchased both for Ada and for consumers' local currencies. The idea is that no one is \u201cforced\u201d to carry out transactions with cryptocurrencies, but that people can gradually understand the advantages of using digital assets compared to traditional currencies (and for that, some advantages would be offered in purchases made in Ada, such as a lower percentage of fees). My only issue here would be regarding the price charged by NFTs. Let's say that each NFT is a new song released by your favorite artist: depending on the asking price, it would be a little expensive to buy an entire album, for example. However, I may not have fully understood how these payments would be made - perhaps the album itself was considered an NFT and charged a one-time fee for that set of songs. Anyway, in general, I found this proposal a little more complex to understand than the other one from the same proponent (Rythmeet:P2P music network platform); however, even so, from the explanations provided, it seems to be a very smart use case for our blockchain, precisely because it would be seeking to attract an audience based on musical taste and not necessarily by interest in the cryptographic world (use Ada, buy NFTs and make transactions through smart contracts would be part of the whole, but not exclusively the content of the project). Therefore, I believe that the proposal can align very well with the objectives of the challenge, as it will generate a Dapp that has the potential to greatly foster the Cardano community, increasing the number of active members.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "We have several ways to understand what the development process of this project would be like. Starting with the definition of stages, which is done in the topic of impact: stage 1: Project Definition; 2: Planning; 3: Design; 4: Content creation; 5: Development; 6: Test; 7: Maintenance. Apart from that, we also know what would happen according to the weeks, the activities are well situated, although they are explained in a very summarized way in this part of the script. However, if we add one thing to the other (the steps with the roadmap), it is possible to have a very solid understanding of how the project development process, in practice. Another part of the proposal that allows us to better understand what the practical construction of the Dapp would be like are explanations about the coinage feature (\"linking the original file containing the Arweave musician's creation to the contract / payment of the artist's minting fees. We want the fees are minimal to allow all types of artists, famous and otherwise, to use our platform. These fees will be lower if paid in Cardano versus other currencies/etc). In other words, even though we don't have a super detailed roadmap, we have several sources of information that together allow us to adequately understand what would be done, how and why. Now talking about the cost division, the detail here is the same as in the previous proposal. There are 73 thousand dollars divided into parts, which correspond to the salary of all the professionals involved. And in my view this part is perfect, because the total amount is divided into parts that are, each of them, respectively, well explained. For example in \u201c2 Developers (Cardano Blockchain): $55/hour: (2x 1,925/week x 8 weeks = 30,800)\u201d and in \u201c1 Technical Project Manager: $45/hour ($1,500/week x 4 weeks = $6,000)\u201d; we know a) the amount that would be spent b) for whom this amount would be destined c) what would be the hourly value of this professional's work and how much time he would dedicate to the project. And speaking of the team, it's very rich how we're introduced to proponent Alan Hegron; he describes very well his area of \u200b\u200bexpertise, what he has been doing so far in his professional life and what are some examples of work developed by him previously. The other team members are also presented satisfactorily, even if not as detailed as was the case with the bidder. It is very positive how it filled the important gap that was missing when it comes to the developers who are experts in Cardano (one of the problems to be mitigated was precisely the absence of experts in our blockchain, and we realized that the situation was resolved). So the topic is also ideal, as is the impact part.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The monitoring of progress is very well assured, since it is said that the team would constantly contact the Cardano community, stating what the advances were (partial results) and also what their \u201cstruggles\u201d would be (and with that , it is inferred that they are talking about their work routine and the processes that would be behind these partial results). It is said that a contact would be established through twitter and github. In addition, the proponent states that \u201cwe also plan to participate in Town Halls to inform the catalyst community about the progression of the platform and receive feedback from them / Once the platform is launched, we will continually inform our members about all news involving Rythmeet through publications on social media\u201d. Therefore, he makes it clear that he will establish a constant communicative bridge with the Cardano community, which in my view is the most solid way to monitor if progress is being made as it should, if activities are happening on time, in the agreed way, etc. . Finally, when it comes to final results, success scenarios are defined for 6 months (\u201cthe platform has been launched online, all technical issues have been resolved and the site runs smoothly. We reached 3,000 users and 15% of them use Cardano currency\u201d People start minting and selling their NFTs and we reach $20,000 sales on our platform\u201d) and for 12 months (\u201cWe reached 20,000 users and 50% of them are using Cardano currency. More people are selling NFTs and we reach US$ $500,000 in sales on the Rythmeet platform\u201d). Proponents claim that solid outreach work would be established once the project was well established, so that it grew exponentially and could become increasingly recognized, attracting new people from outside the crypto bubble. I think it would be really important that a constant investment was made, and that we could understand how Dapp users would be relating to Cardano beyond this project. Have the musicians started to acquire NFTs from other projects, or are they interested in learning more about the technology? In general, I think that both this and the other proposal are well structured on all topics, it is clear how the proposer took care to evaluate the criticisms and suggestions provided previously so that he could raise the level of his proposals, and in my opinion, he got it.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 8305, "q0": "Initially, I\u2019m really impressed with the quality of this proposal. It is meticulously written, extremely detailed, the methodology and intention are clear and by stating the current situation of music platforms on blockchains, this project should be able to address this Challenge setting.\nFrom the beginning of this section, the proposal has managed to set itself apart from competition by bringing up the 2 details that other projects often neglect, which are the proper method to attract people with no prior connection or knowledge of crypto and NFTs, and something I\u2019m particularly interested to know more of, security. For the audience-appealing method, the proposer aims to create Rhythmeet as an user-friendly and social platform for an easier and more enjoyable user experience, and focus on interoperability with other projects/platforms as well, all of which I believe to be suitable for long-term use. I must admit that I\u2019m a big fan when it comes to security, as I always value privacy and product ownership rights, the two things that the tech giant Apple also has their eyes set on the most. The proposer plans to impose this feature using their own in-house platform called Arweave to integrate the music into Cardano, so that artists will be able to retain their intellectual works permanently, and buyers and investors won\u2019t have to lose the investments for their favorite items. \nAs for the description of the basic functionalities of Rhythmeet, this is another part that the proposal nails. It\u2019s true of what the proposer describes of the current situation of the music industry, how music labels whip up contracts for artists\u2019 cooperation, whose clauses and terms will benefit the labels the most in the long run. Therefore, the proposal suggests that switching to Rhythmeet is a wise move, since artists won\u2019t have to worry about the components of the platform and spend their time focusing on what\u2019s important at hand, their music, along with keeping tabs on their works and potential upcoming successes. The minted in-app NFTs will not only stand for the progress that the artists have made, but also it will be a substantial source of income for them and at the same time benefit Cardano by adopting new individuals into the mix. Another tempting feature of this project is that it allows for payment in conventional currencies rather than just the native CNFTs. Users won\u2019t be restrained from having to convert to CNFTs to use the platform, but they are welcome to learn about cryptocurrency and the blockchain should they wish to. An additional bonus would be the lower transaction fees, as stated in the proposal. The listed stages of the minting feature are also detailed and comprehensible, and seemingly doing the best to support artists all the way. \nOne highlight of this proposal that I have to mention is the deduction and explanations of the execution process. Not only is this proposal one of the rare few to include an execution process, it\u2019s also one of the most accomplished. Every single stage includes the essential information that the project should be expected to have for that stage. For example, the first stage is the conceivement process, which includes what needs to be delivered, the target audience in mind and analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the competitors. And stage 2 will continue the works of stage 1, to create a sitemap and a wireframe. Then the design in stage 3, content creation in stage 4, development in stage 5, testing for public release in stage 6 and ultimately, maintenance and updates for a fully functional music streaming platform in the final stage. The order of the stages is logically put together and represents how a normal project should go down. Therefore, I have a very optimistic belief that this project will meet with great success in its future installments.\nI continue to be wowed by the way the team handles their shortcomings and obstacles for the project. To be specific, the proposal has managed to bring up a number of challenges that stem from the execution process of the project itself. However, every single one of those challenges is being mitigated and dealt with by the team. I feel like the team has thought of everything, as depicted in the difficulty of inviting artists working for a music label to Rhythmeet. Here they have enlisted the help of marketing specialists from Shinetech, a company based in China. And they also include the possibility of Shinetech being non-operational due to the Chinese government\u2019s concerns of cryptocurrency, which is immediately handled with the confirmation that Shinetech is also based in other nations, so Shinetech won\u2019t be limited by its Chinese roots. Still, the only flaw in an otherwise flawless performance, for the biggest concern of music frauds minting NFTs for the unauthorized works, the smart contracts that the team plans to use as a solution have not had much information for me to come up with a conclusive statement. But in general, a very well-crafted description indeed!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From the roadmap and milestones provided in this section, I can safely say that the team is sticking closely to the execution process delivered in the Impact section above. I\u2019m still amazed that this project is expected to be publicly released in just slightly more than 4 months, and additional content will be applied as we go down the road. The requested budget will be allocated to the payment of 7 current team members, and based on the calculations provided, I would argue that this budget is fairly justified. As for the team members involved in this project, I honestly could not ask for more details. The proposer himself gives us a brief yet sophisticated introduction and description of himself, his educational background, relevant past experiences and expertise, along with an affiliated LinkedIn profile for a closer look. The same set of information also applies to the rest of the team members, but instead of LinkedIn profiles, they have respective CVs attached, which are just as effective. All in all, a well-composed section.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As far as this standard is concerned, I suppose there is a certain level achieved here. The team chooses to measure their metrics by sticking to the roadmap and milestones delivered in the upper Feasibility section, therefore completion would mean a functional game ready to be launched to the public. \nNevertheless, I would like to say that the envisioned success for this project, depicted by the proposer, feels rather temporary and short-term, as that version of success sounds more like the expected initial success for the Beta release of the game. Instead, I would love to see a more long-term version and growth in the future of the project, the milestones and estimations of a user base and revenue the team hopes to gain, and most importantly, the benefits and profits that the Cardano blockchain will be able to reap from the project.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2974", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1179, "q0": "\"In order to entirely eliminate content theft and duplication from the music market, this project will use smart contracts on the Cardano platform to encode tracks into NFT format. long time ago\nDue of the usefulness they offer, I think the proponent has identified a market that could become the next big thing in the NFT ecosystem. It is conceivable that an artist with a network of fans already existing if a platform can be successfully built, giving the essential tools to market their creativity without the need for intermediaries.

Among the major protagonists of this revolution there have always been services for listening to music in streaming.\nAccording to the IFPI GLOBAL MUSIC REPORT 2021 (https://gmr2021.ifpi.org/report) In 2020, recorded music revenues amounted to $ 21.6 billion, an increase of 7.4% compared to 2019 and the sixth consecutive year of growth.

To reduce this risk the team will develop smart contracts, in this regard I suggest to evaluate a collaboration with Atala Prism, the idea is that when an artist blocks his own artistic creation in an rmNFT he has to provide at the same time his own DID which will be recorded along with metadata and media in the smart contract.\nIn this way, the identity of those who created the NFT will remain anchored to the NFT itself so that if legal disputes arise, it is possible to establish who is responsible for any violations.\nThe funds requested are divided in a clear and identifiable manner, as well as the timing of implementation is precisely delineated\nThe amount of funds requested is slightly high when compared to the average salaries reported on https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#overview), however it must be emphasized that there is no rule for the backend development cost and front-end and the team has ingrained experience, which justifies higher cost.\nThe proposal requests:\n- $ 1575 / week for a back-end and front-end developer, multiplying this by the number of weeks in a year we get 1575 * 52 = $ 81900.\nThe median salary of a backend developer is $ 56723 (> front end = $ 49725), dividing this by 52 (number of weeks in a year) I get an average weekly salary of 56723/52 = $ 1090\n-1925 $ / week for a developer carding blockchain, multiplying this value by the number of weeks in a year we get 1925 * 52 = 100100 $\nThe average annual salary for a Haskell developer is $ 67021, dividing this by 52 (number of weeks in a year) I get an average weekly salary of 67021/52 = $ 1289\n-45 $ technical project manager.

This hypothesis is supported by me. To address this issue, the proposers present Rythmeet, a platform that allows musicians to network, mint and sell their songs using NFTs, and permanently secure their original files, allowing artists to become independent and further their careers. Because there are several cases when musicians are overcontrolled by huge corporations under a music business contract only to start their own career, the idea is ambiguous and worthy of praise. The issue solution is reasonable and justified for the challenge. It is also promising that further information be offered, such as how the platform will function or how to attract musicians to cryptocurrencies, as the music industry is highly complex. Integrating music and artists into the NFT realm has been discussed and tested several times, but there has yet to be a truly viable platform built. The fact that one of this proposal's development aims is to reach out to people who are not already active with Cardano, hence assisting the community's growth, is rarely highlighted inside proposals.

Overall, I am confident that the project can be completed effectively based on the information presented in this proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is a presentation about potential risks and obstacles that may arise throughout development, which increases the credibility of the team's understanding of their project and, as a result, increases trust from those on the outside. The author has referenced social media platforms such as twitter, github, telegram, and instagram and have provided real links where the community may track the progress or activity of their projects, which deserves an applause. There is no ambiguity in order to ensure the project's traceability and auditability. The metrics and KPIs are quite thorough, which is unique. After 12 months, more than 20,000 users and more than $50,000 in sales are achievable. It is also in line with the requirements of the challenge. Another thing I liked is that the team has a wonderful definition of success that appears to be intelligible to both tech and non-tech individuals.

In this proposal, the authors want to add a feature that allows musicians to mint and sell their creations through NFT. As explained in the previous proposal, the platform integrated on Cardano will further increase the interaction and adoption of the Cardano blockchain by encouraging transactions to be paid by ADA and those who pay with ADA in the first transaction will receive lower-cost incentives compared to other payment methods. The author will also build an integrated ADA payment wallet integrated on the platform and create sets of instructions for new users. The only advice I want to offer to the proponent here is, that the description for the platform development idea should be summarized or linked instead of repeating the same and alternating descriptions for the development idea of the mint NFT feature. Or if in more detail, the author can mark what is the job description for part 1 and what is the job description for part 2. This will help anyone who has not read your proposal for part 1 before being able to differentiate and understand the developmental focus of this part 2 proposal.\nDescribe the idea to allow artists to mint NFT from their creations including how NFT minting will occur; how to encourage more mint and sale of NFT; the benefits will be for the artist, buyer, and Cardano from minting and selling the NFT are fully presented and understandable by the author. There is no demo for this feature yet, but what is described is enough for the reader to visualize what NFT production and consumption will be like. Technical risks and copyright issues are also reviewed and reasonable mitigation measures are taken. My previous review of part 1's idea is completely in line with Challenge key metrics, developing more features in this part 2 is also perfectly reasonable and increases the overall competitive advantage of the platform, attracting more users because of its diverse and unique features, leading to the growth of users and interaction on the Cardano blockchain.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This proposed development plan seems to be Part 1's plan for the overall development of the platform, the plan sheet has not really focused yet and shows us how the NFT minting feature building will take place. There are two assumptions made by the author: If both proposals are financed concurrently in Fund9 then the 2 work segments will be developed simultaneously or developed independently and then merged; If only part 2 is funded then part 1 will continue to be called for the fund at Fund10 and developed after that, but I still don't see the assumption that if only part 1 is funded and how part 2 proposal will be? The coherence of these two proposals will bring the risk of extending the project development time as expected if only 1 in 2 gets funding.\nI've seen this budget allocation table in your proposal part 1, the costs seem to be estimated based on the efforts/resources needed to develop the overall platform instead of the independent development NFT minting feature. And like the advice I gave you in part 1, the cost of staff allocation can be shown in more detail based on the number of hours worked x the corresponding remuneration during their work to demonstrate personnel's efforts are justified.\nRegarding personnel, I have no further questions as the brief descriptions and references are sufficient to prove your competence in running this project. The recruitment of more Blockchain experts reinforces the viability of the project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In this section, I have found information that really focuses mainly on the main idea of \u200b\u200bpart 2 - NFT minting. Audit capacity for this proposal is easy as 2 core pieces of information have been provided. The first is a tool for monitoring project development, which has a variety of convenient ways for those interested in the project to have access to Rythmeet's progress reports. The second is the sketches of the success of this proposal after 6 months and 12 months, the metrics included the number of users, the proportion of them using ADA for trading, and sales on the platform. However, the figures regarding the NFT minting feature are still quite vague, hinting at how this metric could be after 6-12 months, an estimate of how many NFTs are minted, and how much NFT transactions will contribute. % to the overall revenue of the platform, etc.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2996", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 3, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10563, "q0": "\u201cPerma-music rmNFT Marketplace\u201d is a good idea and it meets the challenge of \u201cDapps, Products & Integrations\u201d.

This is a proposal that NFTS uses Cardano solutions for the music industry, thereby helping to make Cardano information available to many people, it will help the number of people participating in the Cardano community to consume NFT increasing and increasing the volume of transactions on the blockchain. This proposal is presented very clearly and in detail and will feature open-source minting to help develop. In addition, the steps are also fully presented and logical to make it easy for everyone to follow. The solution presented I found identified most of the problems of the challenge, thereby underscoring the impact of the problem allowing musicians to network, mint, and sell their creations. through NFT and permanently lock down their original files allowing them to become independent and develop their careers.

The proponent has broken down the first phase into smaller timelines, namely, 17 weeks in length. Each week has clearly defined goals as well as tasks to be completed. However, in my personal opinion, the proponent should give 1-2 weeks more time to adjust, and create the most perfect content before moving on to deeper business analysis and adding features and capabilities based on user needs in the coming months. Regarding the budget, this part, as I see it, the proposal is presenting a fairly simple content, focusing mainly on human resources, this part I have a question that is the cost of paying developers equally divided or paid according to the level of completion and performance of each person's work. In addition, this part of the budget, in my opinion, should add other costs such as infrastructure, etc. Regarding the project participants, the proponent has provided full information related to their full names, title as well as work experience of each person. The participants are all experienced people in different fields such as project managers, PHP developers, user interface designers, senior software engineers, etc. Incorporating each specific piece of work has an expert in charge, which will help the project develop more comprehensively.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In order to measure the progress of the project, the proponent will update the content and progress of the Rythmeet platform through media such as: Twitter, Github, Telegram, and Instagram so that everyone can monitor and evaluate. In addition to their successes, they are also willing to share their difficulties with the community, thereby showing a relatively high auditability. As for what the success of the project looks like, the proponent also presented it very clearly and divided it into 2 milestones: success after 6 months and success after 12 months. At each of these stages, they came up with specific metrics regarding the number of users reached, the percentage of them using the Cardano currency, and the revenue achieved in each of those stages.

Generally, the team is developing Rhythmeet, an application that functions as a NFT marketplace, which is a great opportunity to bring together music lovers. Not only does this project help independent artists to reach a bigger listener community, but also it supports other activities such as meeting between artists, performing or funding scholarships for music students. Some bright spots that I love about the project is that it focuses on users\u2019 comforts as well as adapts their recommendations. I believe this would increase awareness of crypto, NFT and their features in the community and, as a result, attract new flows of users into the Cardano ecosystem. Moreover, one outstanding point that the proposer mentioned is the collaboration with Arweave, a platform that allows artists to integrate their products into blockchain without any risk of being removed. I agree that the music industry is a big pie that is taken over by only a few large entertainment corporations. It is necessary that a platform of musical NFT marketplace appears to support local artists and bring potential talents into the light without being under any control of contracts. Also, the developing team mentioned the methods they would apply to attract the use of Cardano, particularly: Making the application easy to interact without any knowledge about crypto, reducing the integrating fees when paying by Cardano cryptocurrency and providing simple tutorials about how to use the Cardano crypto. I believe these are great incentives that help promote and widen the Cardano ecosystem efficiently. In addition, a very detailed plan is also provided, which contains every stage and step to be done, coming with specific key metrics and targets. Last but not least, the risk statement is also very comprehensive and concerned thoroughly. Every single risk is prepared with a convincing action to ensure that the project is under control.

In general, the project will take about 16-17 weeks to conduct the final product. In my opinion, this is quite a short amount of time to complete such tasks and, to some extent, they might face some proper risk. Moreover, I believe adding some specific dates on when to actualize the first steps would help assessors and investors have better visions about the progress. Besides, the budget breakdown is provided sufficiently with the total amount of $73,000, which I think is a figure that needs thorough considerations. The team members are listed with a brief introduction about education, work experiences and achievements. Additional CVs attached and affiliate links are also provided for further background checks.

The team mentioned the use of social media to inform members of the latest news, though I suggest using other convenient tools for management such as JIRA to also help investors keep track of the progress. Apparently, the measures of success are different between 2 stages: short-term (after 6 months) and long-term (after 12 months). In both stages, every key metric is clarified enough. The KPIs about the number of users, amount of sales and proportion of Cardano users are settled obviously. Nevertheless, one small suggestion of mine is that the team should describe more about what actions should be taken in case the plan does not go well, or the actual KPIs are disappointing.
