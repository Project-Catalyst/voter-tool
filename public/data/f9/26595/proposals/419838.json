The traction NFTs bring have on-boarded lots of new blockchain and crypto enthusiasts. It is a great first step to on-board new talent and the mainstream crowd. By making Cardano a main driver in this department, we will increase the possibility of maintaining Cardano as an integral part of the blockchain ecospace in the future. The proposal aims to develop a public API for NFT data, this will save other developers lots of time so they can focus on other productive tasks. This will bring immediate  value to the Cardano ecospace. However, the proposal is objectively better suited in the \u201cDeveloper Ecosystem\u201d challenge which specifically requests for API\u2019s and oracles to the developers. A score of 4 points will be given. This is because the proposal is placed in the \u201cDapps, Products & Integrations\u201d challenge which has a somewhat strong coupling but a proposal assessor should also take into consideration if the proposal aligns with the challenge setting and it is better suited in the other category mentioned. One point will be deducted as a result, but overall the impact is rather good.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposing team have developed cnftjungle.io which already is a great addition to the Cardano ecosystem. Their credibility is high as a result and the feasibility is high. However, the job of a proposal assessor is to assess the proposal against the criteria set up by the Cardano community. And there are some points that are unfortunate, which could be avoided by further refining the proposal. For a starter the main risks are ignored by the argumentation \u201cNothing could prevent us from delivering the public api.\u201d. This is simply not true, all projects pose risks in some way or another and it could be interpreted like ignorance from the proposers. A few examples of risk on the top of mind are bad cost estimates i.e. the budget is not enough and poor time estimates.\nFurthermore, there is no calculation to back up the claim of 50.000 USD. Where does this number come from? How many hours of work do you estimate to this proposal? What is the hourly rate? What work has to be done? When does this work have to be done? \nThese questions could be answered with a roadmap and a detailed plan with milestones. I believe the intentions of the proposers are great but it is hard to give a high score when fundamental details as the above mentioned are lacking. The previous experience weighs heavy but it cannot justify the flaws in the proposal, as a result, a neutral score will be given. 3 points.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal is lacking a few critical components to make it fully auditable by the community. There is no forum or public channel stated where you will share the progress of the development, this should be added so that the community can follow and evaluate your progress easier. A suggestion is to provide a blog section on your existing website where you provide these updates. \nThere is no roadmap or detailed plan with a clear timetable, an ambitious community member could get a somewhat full picture by deriving information from different places in the proposal but it is recommended to compile this information and provide it as a regular roadmap with a detailed plan, time estimates and milestones. \nAlso, measurable KPIs are lacking in order to evaluate the success of the project in an easy manner. This could be solved by adding something like \u201cx amount of requests per month by time y\u201d etc. At the moment, the proposal states that you will measure *how much* is done weekly. But it is not stated what your goals are, could one API call per week be considered a success? It is a rhetorical question but the point is probably clear, the community must be provided with KPIs to evaluate the project. If this is addressed, the proposal will receive a higher score in the future but at the moment, the proposal is lacking in terms of auditability and a score of 2 stars is given.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2290", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3123, "q0": "Currently Cardano has lots of NFT in the space but lacking in analytic tools.

With an open source API to accurately track the data of each NFT platform would ease and benefit the community.

But more information regarding them would be appreciated (i.e x number of calls per months etc). The proposal did mention that v1 would be completed in a month time and the team would be open to feedback, but the proposal lacks the feedback channel (i.e thru social media platforms/ github etc).

This would be very helpful for new projects based around NFT and needs a lot of data collection. This does increase the efficiency of NFT ecosystem and thus helping cardano.

The availability of a public API to access such data could help apps that are attempting to design a proprietary solution for the same process save a lot of time, money, and resources. The author offers a thorough strategy to permanently resolve the problem after fully grasping it. The team is open to expanding its API library in response to customer feedback and needs and does not limit itself to a specific set of data points. The chain and the Dapps using it will undoubtedly benefit from the most recent data access, which will gradually increase Cardano acceptance and ecosystem maturity. The team could have given the readers some proof of the background research done in accordance with the plan and also some information on the dangers and problems they might encounter during implementation, but the other information offered outweighs this shortcoming.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The quantity of information I have at my disposal as a reader to judge the viability of the plan worries me. The assertions of the proposer are not backed up by any concrete deadlines. Although we are aware that the CNFTjungle.io team would have assisted voters who are not familiar with the project, the proposer makes no attempt to introduce himself or any other team members who would be working on it. It is exceedingly improbable that the community will develop a sense of trust and confidence in the idea without knowledge of the team's standing or prior expertise. Despite the plan's approximate 2-month duration, it does not include a detailed action plan or budget breakdown beyond monthly end targets. The voters and community cannot assess the money's effective use without a viable bifurcation because the requested amount is not tiny. I advise the team to go back to the drawing board and return in the next rounds with more research and a clear game plan to support their proposal, taking into account the seriousness of the challenge the team is trying to solve and the type of idea they have. Additionally, I would adore it if the team recruited a few new members and introduced us to them.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer misses his or her chance to influence the auditability section readers. Readers are not given any early statistics to report on. Due to the unclear split of the proposed amounts, there is also not much to track. However, rather than relying solely on their reputation, the team that submitted ideas in this round should have taken the necessary steps to give such KPIs. Really, there is no way for the community to predict if the proposal will evolve in accordance with the requirements and expectations of the challenge. Again, it's not apparent what exactly has to be assessed. In any event, it would have been advantageous to have defined KPIs and reports to assess how money was distributed and successfully used. The team's many suggestions all exhibit the same pattern. It may be true that the team has a reputation and has been providing enormous value for a while, but it wouldn't be wise to rely just on that.

Timeline specifies that V1 public API will be out in a month in all possibility.

By creating an API that accesses that data, this tool could save a lot of effort and time by a lot of projects who need to access historical NFT data. So overall, this proposal will have a positive impact, but I am unsure as to how great the impact. I am not certain that every proposal would want to access the jungleNFT database  even if they were looking for historical NFT data. Additionally I'm not sure that funding this proposal so that this team can implement an API on their own database would have as much impact as funding some of the other proposals in this challenge.  Ideally, at least to me, this seems like a tool that the team should develop and Implement on their own without Catalyst funding.

They are simply asking $50,000 and for us the trust that they will accomplish the goal without providing any details up front. This feels like a big ask.

There is no obvious method they plan to report on to the community, and there is no clear plan to be transparent to project catalyst. However again, this team has succeeded at completing other projects so I assume they would know to report. The lack of  detail however creates confusion in my mind as to whether or not this is a serious proposal, or a quick way to infuse a little extra money into their development budget.
