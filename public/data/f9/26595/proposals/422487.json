I say this because a form of decentralized payments would be created in relation to the transport system, \u201cusing DLT and DApps in Cardano employing smart contracts for payment transactions between the parties\u201d. With that, Cardano's technologies would be used with great vigor, since the transport sector moves thousands of people a day around the world, and it is certainly an area that needs to be modernized, once people start using the technologies from Cardano to execute such payments, adoption will certainly grow massively, which is something we are looking for in this challenge, as we are aiming to fund dApps, products or integrations that can foster our community, increasing the number of active members of the ecosystem. Speaking more specifically about the proposed solution, it aims to solve the problem of unifying a payment scenario in the transport sector. The solution is explained through some topics such as \u201cthe aim is to build a unified payment gateway platform on top of the Cardano Blockchain that enables safe and fair transactions between all stakeholders regardless of the fee medium, payment system or geographic location + payments and agreements between the parties will be executed automatically through immutable smart contracts based on equitable global standard agreements, etc.\u201d It is very clear what will be done and how Cardano would enter the question, how blockchain and smart contracts would be used here. However, I have some comments to make. How will the average user, who does not know about blockchain, be able to make use of these technologies? How will he learn to make this new payment method, in a simple and practical way? Something that I think is fundamental in the proposals is to build a solid bridge between the projects and the users, between Cardano and the common citizen who is not inside the crypto bubble. The objectives of what is intended to be achieved are very clear, as can be seen in the sections \u201cgreater mobility for all users by allowing the use of all transport services, readily available through means of payment + increased transit of users and revenue as a result of lowering barriers to use\u201d and so on. Some technical parts are also created, but in my view they could be a little better detailed, that is, explained more extensively so that all readers of the proposal can understand such parts well - \"Strategic Assessment - identifying the process or function that needs be improved, GAP Analysis - course to match specific needs and service level\u201d and so on. On the marketing side, I think the way the proponent places us in relation to the dissemination strategies is very rich, as the proponent mentions what the strategies would be one by one. Some of them could have some complementary information, for example: \u201cFocus on the Target Market through the scheduling of promotional actions and roadshows. Basically, our target market includes people from all walks of life\u201d: what would promotional actions be? \u201cImprove customer relationships by carrying out activities for drivers and passengers while collecting feedback\u201d: how would the relationship between customers and drivers be worked on? Finally, risks are identified in a very precise way and are properly resolved. I think the impact of the proposal is incredible, even if some small points could have been better explained.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Speaking of feasibility, once again we have a suitable topic, but I would like to make a few suggestions. About the script, for example, we are informed about 3 phases, and each one of them is detailed in smaller activities; for example in phase 1, which would be focused on building the Unifed Payment Gateway platform on the Cardano blockchain. Activities would include \"System Planning and Requirements - 1 week + System Design and Architecture - 1 week + Software Development and Coding - 2 months + Testing - 2 weeks\". I have two suggestions on this: the first would be to better detail some of the activities, in phase 1, which we have already mentioned as an example, how would the planning and system requirements be done? Which of the professionals mentioned in the part of the team would be responsible for this, and would this information be available to our community? All phases contain a trial period. How would it be? Who would test, would some users be invited to use the developed tools, and would their feedback be collected? How would this all be carried out? My second suggestion regarding the script is that we were given some dates - for example, what day would phase 1 start, what date would it be planned to end, and so on. But in general, I agree that the project was well situated in terms of development, we know what would happen, even if we don't know exactly when and how these things would happen, our visualization of the realization of the phases is very clear. Talking about the budget, in turn, the financial amount requested is quite consistent with what tends to be developed here, with the complexity and breadth of the project. The 40,000 is divided between phases (\u201cphase 1 - Building a unified payment gateway platform on top of Cardano Blockchain - USD 25,000 + phase 2 - Integration of APIs to Cardano Blockchain - USD 8,000 + phase 3 - Incorporation of data from public transport vehicular trip - USD 7,000\u201d). And after that, we have the salary of each professional involved. Two doubts occurred to me here: how much time would these professionals dedicate to carrying out the project? What hours would they work and the hourly rate? The other question would be in relation to the design part, the participation of any professional in this area is not mentioned here, we know that the project will be aimed at the general public, from all spheres of society, as the proponent himself points out, which generates need for simple and easy-to-use interfaces for everyone. From what I understood, that would be it, so I believe it would also be important for some UI/UX designer to join this team. And finally, speaking of him, the team: we are introduced to 3 professionals. Julius is the person who best presents himself, we know many details about his professional background, projects in which he has been involved (\"He has more than 20 years of extensive experience in the Information Technology Solutions and Services Industry + He has made significant contributions in providing exceptional IT solutions in various industries + Over the years, he has been a Consultant in the following organizations, etc). The same goes for the other team members, Philippine, Alejandro and Giselle P. Bantug. My only concern here is that none of the team members demonstrate previous experience with Cardano, I would like to know if they already have some kind of involvement with our ecosystem and what that would look like. So, speaking of feasibility, in general the proposal is very viable. I think some details could be added yes, but that doesn't compromise our understanding of the topic.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Finally, when thinking about auditability, we have a lot of information that can make the proposal easily auditable for ultimate success, but on the progress some improvements could be made. A direct way to monitor the progress of the phases is not suggested. I would like to know how this could be done, we have a script with a satisfactory level of detail about what would be done, so it would be ideal if we could follow the completion of each of the phases; we know that activities must be done in a certain period of time (1 week or 2, usually), so it is simple to verify if this would have actually been obeyed or not. It is enough for a member of the team, for example the proponent, to make a report at the end of each phase explaining if the plans were followed, if problems occurred (it is common that they do, but we need to know how they were solved) and so on. In my view, we lacked a bit of that notion. The information that is suggested by the bidder (\"Unified Transport Payment Gateway can make a significant contribution in the transport sector + Users/travelers - whether you are a resident or visitor using a means of transport, it will be easier for you to move around due to the readily available payment method, etc.\u201d); are valid and necessary, but say more about the partial results themselves than about the development process. As for success, we have more information. We know of several KPIs (\u201dnumber of users using the platform or service + number of transport groups, including private transport groups, that are using the platform or service + if it meets the main objective of providing connectivity between networks\u201d and etc.) . We also know what the desired results are for the end of some time interval (1 month, 2 months, 6 months, etc.). So we have a lot of information that allows us to understand what success would be and with that to understand if it was achieved. So two things could be added, in my understanding, so that this part of the proposal was 100% adequate. It is necessary that 1) the proponent also focuses on making it clear whether the objectives of the challenge have been achieved, how we can understand whether this project was beneficial for Cardano and how this can be accurately measured, how we can ascertain whether what would be being sought in the challenge was conquered; 2) all this information must reach our community in a simple and direct way, the proponent does not establish any communicative bridge with us, we need to know about all this after the project is concluded. My suggestion is that he use some social media to promote updates at the end of each phase and that he present himself in a townhall to expose the final results and the success scenario, through tangible quantitative and qualitative data. That said, the topic is fine, but it can still improve.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3410, "q0": "Use the cardano blockchain to Unify Public Transport Payment Gateway, the goal of this proposal.\nThe project would allow a collaboration between experts in the fields of technology, businesses, fintech, and public transport/ services.

The users can use all kind of transportation service and pay their fares on this platform. In order for this project to achieve its impact, there will need to be the possible adoption of public transport operators to this payment gateway. The team would have to answer a few questions: How could the team account for difference in public transportation modes yet make it fair for each  operator? What would entice these public transport operator to join this unified transport payment gateway? Also the team has not mentioned the regulatory risk whether their solution would be allowed to be implemented across different mode of transportations and if there exists some limitation. Although this unified transport payment gateway concept has been used in major cities, its use in small cities might not be possible or common due to the unorganized nature of small transport operators. The team could have provided information on their local market Philippines to strengthen the case that the regulatory is not a concern and if there are any limitations on implementation side. Provided with these information, the proposed solution would be an impactful dapp that bring interesting user cases to Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project has 3 phases of delivery.

For example, how much would project manager earn per hour and how many hours he will work on this project. The team members are very experienced with right skillset to complete this project.  However, the proposal has not mentioned each team member online profile. It will add to the feasibility of the project if online profile of team members and number of working hours of manpower and its pay rate are included.

The team lists the KPIs as number of users using the platform and transportation group (both public and private ones). The last 2 KPIs are qualitative measures and they would have to come up with the ways to quantify how they could measure that they serve the main objective of providing connectivity among networks and achieve interoperabililty among transportation service and key players of payment solution. There is a clarity in the description of problem, solution and how the proposal is aligned with them. The roadmap is designed to reduce risk and have the successful implementation.  The team would have to clarify on a few important issues that could affect the implementation and also identify the area that could be obstacle in the implementation.

On successful implementation, the gateway is used across various modes of transport could result in a hassle-free commute, thus enhancing the Cardano adaptability and usage.

Monthly reports, Git commits, updates over discord, and telegram channels could have helped the auditors monitor. Nevertheless, the success metrics are defined cautiously over the period of 12 months.
