The team is now seeking funding in order to transform one of their closed source applications, a voting tool, into an open source one, for the benefit of the entire community. The tool is already built and had been used for the first time in May this year to ask the token holders to decide on certain features from DripDropz\u2019s ecosystem (staking program, treasury allocation, etc). \n\nIn theory, there is a great demand for governance tools, and many users are very keen on being more and more involved in the life of the protocols / tokens they are invested in, so there could be a significant adoption of such an open sourced project. \n\nThe proposal is the fact that it is complemented by a video in which the tool is explained a bit, but not entirely. I feel that the proposal would have greatly benefited from a more in-depth technical explanation on what type of voting will be allowed within the tool. The only information available through their links provided is that the procedure will be a \u201cdust vote\u201d in which each user will have to send a very small but specific amount to a certain address, and the results of the vote will be derived from that dust amount. From a user experience perspective, this approach might not be the best in terms of nudging people towards using the tool extensively, since it is well known that increasing the number of steps from any user tool is inversely correlated with users\u2019 tendency to use that feature. \n\nGiven the limited technical information we have concerning the voting process and the fact that it has only been used once in practice and so adoption and user experience are still mostly unknown to the wider community (except DripDropz of course), I think four stars are appropriate here. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "DripDropz makes a very good case for the strength of their team, and they have detailed bios for all their members, both on their website and within the proposal, so it\u2019s fairly easy for them to demonstrate that they have a capable team, which is also proven by their existing track record of projects, with DripDropz of course being the most visible.  \n\nThe timeline seems very feasible. The project would take four months to complete, and implies the work of five of their team members, but we do not know if that means full time or only partially. The proposal lists many activities that have to be performed, so any reader can definitely understand the degree of complexity of such a project. \n\nThe budget is divided by each team member, but not many other details are offered. An excellent proposal would have included at least an estimation of the number of hours necessary for each task in particular as well as an applicable hourly rate. Lacking this information, let\u2019s take an example: the budget for the first full stack developer is 40k for the four months of the project, that would imply 10k/month considering full employment. Another example, 25k is reserved for the QA, but again we can presume that the QA job will not be a full time one for the entire four months - so it\u2019s very hard to appraise the reasonableness for each of the budget\u2019s captions. \n\nGiven the lack of budgetary details but considering the team\u2019s strength, I find four stars as appropriate.  ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team promises to measure completion of the project against every of their milestones, and to use Github commits for tracking this. They propose as success measure the availability on github of their tool as an open source package, including documentation. They could have definitely done a better job at defining what success should mean for the project, for instance:\n\n- start with a realistic target for number of apps to use their feature\n- promise to keep track of voting volumes within the first year after launch, for instance\n- use more qualitative data to measure the tool\u2019s success: percentage of wallets voting each time, time necessary to vote, level of integration with existing wallets, etc. \n\nHere I have the feeling that DripDropz went for the minimum effort in terms of tracking the project and defining what a successful tool would look like. While it definitely meets the minimum standards from my view, it certainly lacks in any efforts to do a great job, so again only four stars for auditability.

DripDropz understands this relevance, and decided to make available to the Cardano community a tool developed and tested by them. In March of this year the DripDropz team developed the first on-chain voting exercise using a native token in Cardano. It turned out to be very successful with the participation of almost 2000 voters. Understanding the significance of this feature for many projects within the ecosystem, the team decides to request budget from Catalyst Treasury to make this tool available as open source, they give the rationale why it is necessary to dedicate resources to make the transition. Of course, I personally would have expected the tool to be built with open source in its roadmap, and thus would have avoided this budget allocation. But I also cannot deny that the successful implementation of this proposal could have a huge return for the community, since many nascent projects will have a previously tested tool available to be incorporated into their code. And, if we consider that as a community we are pushing for Cardano to be an open source ecosystem above all, I find an important alignment. As an element of improvement, and considering that after the migration the DripDropz team proposes to allocate resources for monitoring and maintenance of the code for 6 months. I would have expected a better description of the metrics needed to make an estimation of the impact of the project, such as, for example, closure measure and report to the community metrics such as, number of forks, watch, star and pull requests.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal is strongly backed by the members of the team. DripDropz possesses a combination of exceptional skills and experience, in fact I would say that here are very few teams in the ecosystem today that are able to compete on this basis. However, beyond experience, they have demonstrated the ability to deliver products and services of great value to the community. To make the transition to an open source repository, the team provides a detailed description of all the steps that need to be taken. Furthermore, all the roles necessary for the successful completion of the project are outlined. As the budget is based on the roles required over the estimated period of time (120 days), I find the salary values to be appropriate based on worldwide averages. Although I would prefer that a time estimate be presented for each phase of the project, due to the nature of the project I do not find the approach to this topic problematic. Additionally, given that this is not the only proposal in this fund presented by the team, it would have been interesting to explain a little more in detail how the allocation of resources would work in case both proposals are selected. In a positive light, I do not see any dependency between the two proposals.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The description of the problem is totally transparent, and from my point of view totally relevant to the community not only of Catalyst but also of Cardano. It is an understandable and auditable solution. It is necessary to go one step further and provide the community with an estimated delivery date, i.e. assuming that the requested amounts are delivered in early September, is it expected to have the repository by the end of January or the beginning of February 2023? Not only do we have another proposal in the present fund, but also, as described above, the team members already have competing responsibilities.

A Github link for commits be monitored anytime by anyone is also plus in transparency. Still, all people in DripDropz team are active in the community especially in Twitter and I always enjoy reading their Medium and Twitter post. I have zero worries for under delivery, let alone non-delivery, considering everything especially the technical skills of the members. Furthermore, metrics such as number of projects/dApps/platform in Cardano using the open-sourced tools and number of pull requests will help the community quantify the project success and measure the return from this proposal.
