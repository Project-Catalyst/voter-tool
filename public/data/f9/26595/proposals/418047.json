Crowdsourcing data can help fix this, but data collection tools, visualisations and incentives remain significantly underdeveloped.", "f6_no_assessments": 7, "f6_rating": 4.0, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 6684, "q0": "Littercoin is a token with a real world use case - aiming to power OpenLitterMap, a crowd-sourced database of the world\u2019s litter and plastic pollution. The value proposition is mostly intriguing, since it is one of the few tokens that can create an immediate connection between the general population (non-crypto adopters) and the crypto space without the need for wallets or opening crypto exchange accounts, through a reward system for tracking and documenting litter across the world simply with the use of a phone app and geo-located photos. If you need a similar example to relate to the use case better - think about the Brave browser, which aims to democratize the advertising sector and rewards users directly for the ads placed on their devices. \n\nWhat is truly outstanding is that Littercoin\u2019s  niche identified is almost the perfect candidate for such a real world adoption: users simply need a phone app to interact with the system, the \u201craw material\u201d, aka the litter, is ubiquitous and easy to document its presence (unlike for instance a biodiversity app for which you need a PhD to identify one type of  bee from another) and therefore the barriers to entry are minimal.  \n\nThe origins of the project go as far back as 2008, when OpenLitterMap was initially launched, while the first steps for Littercoin were taken in 2015. Sean initially launched Littercoin on Ethereum, but obviously the long term plans had to be readjusted due to Ethereum\u2019s significant transaction fees. After another attempt of securing funding, the Cardano ecosystem was chosen to migrate Littercoin away from Ethereum, for multiple reasons: not only for its ethos, but also for Cardano\u2019s low transaction fees as well as the funding opportunities of Catalyst. \n\nAn initial proposal was funded in Fund 4, and now the project is back with new development plans. This proposal is asking for funding in order to continue development of the project\u2019s web version as well as enhancing the mobile apps\u2019 data collection functionalities (both Android and iOS). \n\nA rather worrying point from my point of view is the economics and the incentive mechanism behind the token: we understand that users will be rewarded with the Littercoin tokens, but they will not be able to buy or sell them on any CEX/DEX, or even make transactions, and the only possible interaction is with the smart contract that will be developed. We are also being told that there will be real-world interactions possible, and I quote: \u201cwe want to get our community discounted access to locally produced organic fruits, nuts, seeds, and vegetables for using our app\u201d, \u201conly trading you can do with Littercoin is for fruit and vegetables\u201d. \n\nFrom my point of view the tokenomics of this project and not well explained, contradictory at times, and despite the excellent general prospects in other areas and the very interesting niche in which it acts, I can only offer four stars since economics matter a lot, and the proposal needs to do a better job of explaining how things will work. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Sean Lynch, the founder, is a very well articulated Irishman and a truly passionate person about citizen science, crowd-sourced data gathering and tracking litter across the globe. He is a geographer by formation, a self-taught developer and a Bitcoin / blockchain enthusiast. Unfortunately, unlike other successful projects, there aren\u2019t any other second tier team members that can stand out and bring a solid proof of an already existing team, well-bonded and working hard towards the project\u2019s mission. We are only being told about Gini, a developer who has been working for the project since the first secured funding, while the rest of the necessary dev positions are actually advertised as available within the proposal. For me this is a slightly worrying situation, and it makes me wonder why hasn\u2019t Sean managed to already attract more seasoned devs close to him. Would it be the lack of ongoing funding, or perhaps is it a culture fit issue, an unconvincing business case for them? We don\u2019t really know but these questions definitely need to be asked. \n\nIf funded, the proposal would start in August 2022 and end in June next year, taking roughly an entire year - which is mostly consistent with the budget requested (if you divide each caption by the hourly rate and then to 40 hours/week, for each caption you end up with between 40 and 50 weeks, which is good enough from my point of view). There isn\u2019t really a very strict timeline for the project, and all the explanations we are offered are rather \u2026 narrative by nature and not very technical. Just as an example, in the Q1 we are told that \u201cnew languages get added and user signups increase\u201d - but which new languages, we are not being told, and user signup increase is not really an activity to undertake, so the phrase is looking rather out of place. And there are many more examples like this one. \n\nA bit curious, the budget is split by functions (for each additional person), and not by task, which makes our job a little bit more difficult in terms of making the right connections when assessing the budget\u2019s reasonableness given the proposed timeline. So far the project has around 6k users, growing with 3-5 users per day and an average of about 500 photos per day. The UI/UX for the web app and the Android version are very \u2026 improvable. \n\nThere are many worrisome points above, and when I connect all the pieces together, I get a rather grim picture of this project\u2019s feasibility: no real team behind the project, brush strokes when describing the budget and a not very convincing timeline. Now, the toughest question is: if OpenLitterMap has been brewing since 2008, why hasn\u2019t the project picked up speed until now? This can genuinely be a case of simply an app well ahead of its time, waiting for the right time to flourish, which of course can be now, but it can also be the case of the project simply not having the right mix of team, leadership, business case and the right environment to grow. \n\nI have a lot of mixed feelings about this project and I can only offer three stars for feasibility due to everything said above. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team are hosting a weekly community call, they are frequently updating their blog posts with progress updates and they pledge to continue tracking the expenditures in the google document (more on this below), while allowing community access to invoices and proof of funds at any time - which is an excellent initiative. \n\nWithin the proposal we have indeed a very simple google doc that shows us when the initial funding from Fund 4 was spent. We can only see the dates, and perhaps having a small description next to each outflow would have been excellent, but it is definitely a strong point that showcases his desire for transparency towards the Cardano community. \n\nA point of improvement would be perhaps enhancing their communication channels, since neither Telegram nor Discord are available, and I know for a fact that one of these ones is the preferred medium of interaction with the Cardano community for many members. \n\nIn conclusion we have here very good auditability perspectives, also considering that they are a returning proposer, hence five stars in this category. ", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2824", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 13881, "q0": "The Littercoin: Mass Adoption proposal is an ambitious plan to reward people with Littercoin for collecting data for OpenLitterMap. This open source project clearly fits into this challenge criteria, in particular being an integration building on Cardano that will drive adoption, growth and even more innovations that lead people to have more reasons to interact within the ecosystem.\nIn summary, Sean Lynch of OpenLitterMap wants funding to develop and bring to market this cryptocurrency Littercoin. He aims to make the earning process simple for many first time users, who will then hopefully onboard into Cardano as they wish to spend their earnings. To ensure the viability of the reward, only pre-approved green-listed stakeholders in the climate economy will be supported as outlets for transactions - meaning users are helping the environment twice, by collecting the litter data and then spending the rewards at environmentally friendly outlets. The objective of Littercoin also aims to not make users financially rich or as an investment, as it will be a non-tradable token. Instead, it will incentivize doing good for the world and possibly introduce new users to the Cardano ecosystem. This may have a downside for users hoping to monetize their experience and profit from collecting the litter data.\nThe possible impact for the Cardano ecosystem and the world overall is significant, by outsourcing litter monitoring and collection to citizen scientists with the tangible token reward there is a chance of societal and environmental change. The scale of the impact is perhaps a too large jump from its status now, currently at 6,200+ users, to hopefully implementing the OpenLitterMap further and full adoption of Littercoin worldwide. If the proposer and team can achieve this significant upscaling of the product, the proposal clearly articulates even further plans for the project\u2019s future and longevity.\nOverall, the proposal has the potential for a significant impact on the world (noting the majority of the SDGs are applicable) including the ever increasing Cardano community, I give it a 5 star rating for impact.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal includes key elements of a plan, timeline, milestones and staffing, however, there are key details missing that are of some concern in regards to the proposal\u2019s feasibility.\nThe OpenLitterMap project has been in research and operation for 15 years, including 5 years that are listed as software development. The proposers timeline for this round of funding indicates a single year to massively upscale the software and interface, add many users, create an OpenLitter AI and have Littercoin ready for a full roll out. Although the developer has a proven track record of completing the simple initial proposal (Fund 4), the massive increase in capability of the program expected to be completed in under a year is a big concern for this project's feasibility. A suggestion for the developer would be to stagger these undertakings to a 2-3 year roll out, and choose which sub-project to focus on each year, to ensure work completion to a high level, rather than many sub-par aspects of the implementation.\nConnected to the concerns about the timeline is the feasibility of the staffing and recruitment plan. Eight new employees are required in addition to the current CTO/CEO, with only two of these other positions having tentative first names listed, with no biography or LinkedIn information. For the amount of work needed for this project more detail is needed on the skill sets of the current staff, as well as the required skill sets, even the job advertisements ready for the staff to be hired. To achieve this project on time, the staff will have to be recruited and begin as soon as possible, and need to mesh together as a team instantly to ensure the project\u2019s success.\nAnother minor concern for the proposal\u2019s feasibility is the \u2018marketing, travel, resources\u2026\u2019 pool of money they have allocated without specifics. Although some costs will always be a surprise in project development, $18,500 worth of \u2018can be used for anything\u2019 money is too unspecific and worrying. Legal and accounting fees as well as marketing costs, included in this pool, could definitely be researched in advance and a fairly accurate estimate provided. Travel fees are listed, without the details of the travel required, even without specific financial commitment, could be provided to lend more confidence to the distribution of this portion of the funding. \nIn addition to the proposal\u2019s feasibility it should be noted that they already have over 27,418 Littercoin waiting to be distributed. This existing waitlist of sorts will undoubtedly add pressure to the timeline and the developers to get things right the first time. If the roll out is not 100% correct, ironclad and thoroughly tested, they risk their existing users and client database becoming disenchanted with the product, procedure and in turn may harbor some resentment towards Cardano itself.\nOverall, due to the highly ambitious timeline, lack of detail about staffing and unspecific details for a significant chunk of the funding I\u2019m rating this proposal 3 stars for feasibility.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In terms of auditability, this proposal contains enough information to assess its progress at attaining the stated goals throughout the year.\nThe proposal lists detailed KPIs as a measure of success. They are well-thought out, however there are a lot of objectives to cover. They range from expanding the existing OpenLitterMap platform, to encouraging new users to Cardano, from connecting with other Cardano climate projects to developing a whole new AI and crypto currency Littercoin. Perhaps these objectives could be reduced to clearly focus the projects on 2-3 criteria that can be achieved to a high level of success rather than accomplishing many criteria to a mediocre level.\nConnected to feasibility, the timeline listed by quarters does not go into enough detail to relieve some concerns about achieving milestones at specific times. Only that these sub-projects will be accomplished within a three month window.\nIn terms of financial auditability OpenLitterMap has a proven track record of maintaining development under budget. They also have in place weekly community contact and authentic progress reporting protocols so far. \nOverall, I give this proposal 4 stars for auditability based on their existing track record, with some minor hesitations about the large scale increase and potential workload they aim to complete within a year.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3840", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 62, "q0": "The problem statement defines a problem within the challenge which needs to be solved, specifically [Environment - Solutions that help to solve environmental issues]. The proposal is likely to have a positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem, by bringing an interesting app to fruition that aims to fight back pollution - and to Catalyst by supporting the development of an open-source environmental monitoring and action tool. Whilst I am aligned with the target goal, I have doubts about the execution of the roadmap, the marketing plan, and the future utility of Littercoins. A great app can be built, with an AI integrated to detect automatically the kind of trash on a picture - beyond the technical prowess, my main concern is that the app is ultimately targeting a niche audience and won't get the widespread traction necessary to justify its funding. And without a much bigger user base, the impact isn't going to be significant for the planet or Cardano - beyond being able to claim that Catalyst funded an app good for the environment. The current users are already the ones who collect trash or who have a strong interest in the environment. As much as I would want to believe in the project, I don't think the marketing plan is developed enough for the app to take outside its existing niche, and that people will rush to download and grab pictures of trash around the world, even if incentivized by the earnings of littercoins.

This is discouraging since the timeline this proposal provides is demanding as it is.\n\nConcerning the budget, the total amount required is a lot for this kind of project. A more detailed breakdown of how did you arrive at the general cost numbers(eg. marketing) would be subsidiary. The current open team roles need highly skilled people. For example, a senior web developer on a 25$/hour as mentioned in the budget would be considered underpaid and therefore it's hard to fill that position. \n\nRisks for this app are documented in-depth and extensive previous user experience is taken into account.
