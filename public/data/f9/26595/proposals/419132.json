As the link to the previously funded proposal by the same team shows, there is a $272Bn potential market that could drive Cardano adoption and growth if brought on-chain. This makes me think that the main challenge setting requirement, of producing real world use cases, is well served with this proposal. I would have liked to see some more detail about how credibility for carbon offsets could be generated, as this is from what a Google search reveals currently a huge problem and has resulted in prices crashing. It may have helped to show some use cases, for example how business interested in doing so could monetize their carbon credits by selling tokens, or more generally what the demand and supply for tokens might look like. So far, I think we have mainly seen tokens around crypto projects trade on Cardano, but I read that there are scams around carbon tokens. https://scanalyst.fourmilab.ch/t/factored-scams-nfts-on-carbon-credits/700", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This team of previously funded proposers is very impressive, with several PhDs and a PhD candidate on the team. They have launched 1 billion test tokens tCNC on the testnet six months ago, with a team member who is a Haskell dev and a Plutus Pioneer. What I would have liked to see a lot more of is the budget requested of $80k in comparison with the Fund-8 proposal and its deliverables. I would have liked to also see a discussion of the previous fund deliverables Q2 2022 which are dapp backend working on testnet, data structures implemented, frontend user account management working, frontend trading system mockup/demo 10 seller partnerships 3 buyer partnerships and CNC coin noncirculating reserves minted on mainnet, as this is currently not reflecting on their website https://carbonno.org/shop/", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There are a lot of deliverables listed for this proposal, all of which are qualitative in nature. I am happy with that if this is easy to verify or audit, but for a project that teases a $272bln market, I recommend that the proposers include some countable deliverables like number of transactions, amount of carbon offset or something along those lines. Social media campaigns, token lauches, dashboards and features are great ways to measure the implementation of roadmap targets, but they might leave the community not sufficiently informed about \"traction\" - especially if as stated the proposers will come back for more funding in future Catalyst funds. Currently it could be a little clearer what is seed funding, what is the alpha launch and what kind of external funding is required to achieve a working product.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2687", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5344, "q0": "Carbonno Verifiable Carbon platform proposal is creating a decentralized carbon exchange marketplace Dapp. Retail investors and businesses can exchange or invest in Carbon credit with no worries on trustworthiness of carbon credits.

The Carbonno team has provided the link to their fund 8 proposal.  The proposal addresses the Dapps  ,Products & Integration challenge quite well although it is unclear on the future of carbon credit market as it faces a few issues in real world and the team's solution does not provide the information to address these concerns along with unclear information on the implementation of this project.  There has been some criticism of purchasing outdated and poor-quality carbon credit not having environmental value as desired. How could the Carbonno team ensure that those carbon credits are not dated and in good-quality. The ICP (Investor Confidence Project) is mentioned by the team to verify submitted energy-efficiency projects to have their credits onboard to their platform. How about other projects which fall outside the scope of ICP? It would be informative if the team would give more information to clarify issues on these questionable carbon credit projects before I can agree that this project would have the real and full impact as intended for the Cardano ecosystem. The team explains the main risk as business model and blockchain and energy efficient technology and the way they could mitigate those risks but I could see other risks such as the reputation of carbon credit project and the variety of on-boarded projects still not addressed by the team.

However, when I look at their proposal in fund 8, they have mentioned their milestones in fund 8 as  working on backend dApp already with acquired partnerships in Q2. Since they mention that this proposal is about dApp building, it is unclear why the dApp (which was proposed since last fund and got funded already) would need to be funded again in fund 9. Maybe the team would want to report project progress for Q2 2022 to clarify what had been done on dApp and whether they achieved their milestones for Q2 in fund 8. They also do not explain how they derive their cost item like $12000 for NFT minting data entry and $20000 for DEX development etc. The team is comprised of a few Ph.D. holders with good background in energy and IT sectors and possess technical background to handle the tasks.  Since the team would return to Catalyst for later funding except dApp development, they would need to show their work on dApp (from Q2 fund 8 if it is completed). Their fund 8 and fund 9 proposals both have dApp components and yet so far there is no progress to show on dApp side.

The project has certain degree of auditability with key metrics as dApp launch, Carbon NFT minted, ISPO of their tokens and regular updates on social media.

This is a valid direction for the challenge setting, directly following several of its possible directions (dApps and DeFi, for example). The market for carbon credits, even though temporarily in decline due to the energy/gas squeeze, has huge market potential. The impact for Cardano in this fund seems relatively low, as the dApp from Fund-8 if finished would already put the NFTs into Cardanians\u2019 hands.

It is about expanding the use of buying and selling verifiable carbon credits, this would be done through a dApp. This platform would trade carbon in a decentralized manner through its own digital token, the NFT \u201cCNC\u201d. This would allow investors to make a number of trades on top of stocks such as \"carbon reduction projects, including, but not limited to, energy efficiency, carbon sequestration, reforestation, solar, nuclear, etc.\" It is very positive how the proponents explain in a very detailed way what would happen for this theory to become a real situation, that is, the process of building the dApp, its characteristics and uses.

Details of the activities that would make up the development of the project are also not mentioned.

We know a lot about the trajectory of each. For example Nikos Karagiorgos Nik: \u201cis passionate about innovation and reform that minimizes the carbon footprint.

Proponents are not concerned with a way for us to monitor the development process itself, which would be done on a day-to-day basis.

A delegation center where users can participate in existing carbon reduction, energy efficiency, reforestation and other projects\u201d, etc. The question is how the team would collect all this information and make it known to our community.
