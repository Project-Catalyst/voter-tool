The proposal is aligned with the challenge brief to bring more use cases and drive adoption. Many business models, merchant payment systems, and Defi applications could use this stablecoin infrastructure, and it would benefit many users as Cardano scales. I have given 4/5 stars because I believe if this was not funded, the team would still bring this project to Cardano, and it's not clear why they need Catalyst funds. They appear to have a very professional team, and their websites \"get started\" button asks if you are \"An investor interested in funding Fluent or providing liquidity\" Therefore I believe the team would be able raise funds for this project without catalyst. It's also not clear how this stablecoin will have a more significant impact on Cardano then other stablecoin projects that will be launching such as the soon to be released Djed or Ardana, or liquidfinance stable coin, or the existing wrapped stablecoins like MadUSDC and MadUSDT available on wingriders DEX. It will be important for Cardano to have several stablecoins available to users, however this fluent project is unlikely to be the only one that impacts the ecosystem.

In addition, the proposed idea increases the trust of all users, or not, of Cardano, improving the ecosystem as a whole. Therefore, increasing trust in the ecosystem, bringing in investors, increasing the cash flow, among other things, makes the value of the blockchain increase.\n\nThe idea's metrics and goals are directly correlated with Cardano's goals. In the project, there is talk of building a circulation of USD+ (stablecoin) of 1 billion in 18 months, and obviously it would increase with it the transaction volume and Cardano adoption.\n\nScalability and its support are intrinsic to the project. Once they are able to launch and have flow, the project will sustain itself.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In order to verify its feasibility, we need to verify the following aspects:\n1 \u2013 roadmap: Lack of detail in the plan involved. As a suggestion, it would be great if you included all the necessary steps, including tools and people for each task. For example, in the mentioned stage 2, it would be important to add all the necessary points to reach the end goal, which is described. That is, the roadmap is described more as a deadline to reach the goal than a plan with tasks to be accomplished with your specific needs.\n\n2 \u2013 budget: USD 250K was requested, which is a considerable amount and therefore should have more details on the allocation of this money. As a suggestion, it would be interesting to add information on the individual costs of the tasks \u2013 software development, legal costs, etc.\n\n3 \u2013 team: The team is composed of people with different skills and necessary to fulfill the objective. The linkedin of all members was provided. Therefore, the team seems to have the competence and knowledge to proceed with the project.\n\n4 \u2013 risk management: Due to having a multifaceted and experienced team, several risks were addressed and the respective actions were allocated to mitigate each one. In addition, it was said that there is a huge concern at each stage of the project for its development, making it possible to obtain a significant and lasting result.\n\n5 \u2013 self-funding/scalability: As mentioned before, once the project is realized and starts running it is entirely plausible that it will be self-sustaining and scalable.\n\n6 \u2013 tasks: It would be quite interesting if the proponent had said what tasks are needed to complete the project. Also, of course, add the time needed, tools needed and the team needed to complete it.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In order to audit, we need:\n1 \u2013 roadmap w/ milestones: As already mentioned, in order to be able to audit any project, you must verify how the tasks were exposed and the checkpoints. In this way, we can view partial deliveries and verify that everything is in order. However, unfortunately, the tasks are not exposed in this way and, therefore, it is not possible to audit. As an improvement suggestion, you can include more information about tasks and deliverables in the middle of the project.\n\n2 \u2013 Metrics and KPI: Another aspect is metrics and KPIs. The final objective and the expectation of success were informed, however the metrics that will be used to measure the evolution of the project were not informed. As a suggestion, metrics should be added to verify the evolution of the project such as transaction volume, amount of USD+ in circulation, number of portfolios, etc. This is on the client side. On the banks' side, I'm sure there must be other metrics to be controlled.\n\n3 \u2013 Channel: They have a channel to share all the information and, besides that, it was told that there will be a monthly report release. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2298", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 1, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4224, "q0": "Fluent: Briding TradFi & DeFi proposal addresses Dapps, Product and integration challenge by \"Fluent\", an interoperable stable coin and settlement system (2 layers: interbanks and cross-chain). Fluent's private and public layers connect legacy banking to digital finance. To mint Fluent's stablecoin USD+, they have 'Federation Member Bank' Network. In order to join this network, the Federation Member Banks must guarantee a 1:1 exchange with US Dollars and USD+. The team mention in the proposal that \"they will use real-time on chain analysis and audit to prove that the Federation Member Bank can meet their fiat obligations to USD+ Holders instead of a delayed third party audit.\" However, they haven't managed to clarify this unique selling point of their proposal. How does this real-time on-chain analysis and audits work? The entry into the federation should be a one-time occasion and it worths having the proper audit; however, this process is skipped. How could they ensure that their real time on-chain analysis would be better than third party audit? Until they can answer these important questions, the integrity of their solution is called into question. By claiming that Djed (algorithmic stablecoin) would find it hard to attract users in this market climate, they would have to prove that their unique selling point of real-time on chain analysis and audit of federation member bank would also work in this difficult market. The Federation members play a vital role in their project: mint, redeem and distribute tokens and their performance is measured by F-score which shows the quality of reserves. The low F-score could trigger the risk mitigation actions and freeze on a bank's node. The solution of this proposal is still relatively unclear to address the dApp, Products & Integration challenge. The team would need to provide more technological knowledge to back up their statement. The proposal is very ambitious to make a stablecoin and settlement system to increase Cardano adoption. However, from their official website and information in the proposal, we still need more precise info how the process would work for the Fluent protocol and also for the users.
