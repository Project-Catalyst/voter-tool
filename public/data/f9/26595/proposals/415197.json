Thus, the specific objectives present in the explanation of the challenge would be very well addressed: \u201cIncrease the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products. +Increased quality of existing products & integrations through suggested improvements that are supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community\u201d. I say this because the proposed solutions would already specifically address communities that already exist, but would have their activities improved based on the initiative presented here. This would be done through an open source lottery, where the community would have access to how smart contracts, built on plutus and minted on the Cardano blockchain, would happen. An interesting feature would be that the project is non-custodial, that is, all interactions would be done through smart contracts, without the need for third parties to manage the lottery funds. It is also positive that the administrator would not have access to the treasury, which would prevent fraud and unauthorized access. The objective would then be to provide resources for raising projects, as mentioned above, and the community could interfere in relation to how the project would develop, since it would be open source. Suggestions and comments could be made, making the lottery more secure, reliable and transparent. The proponent is concerned with detailing exactly how the lottery games would play out in practice, detailing each action. This project is interesting in several ways; firstly, for presenting an innovative approach in the field of betting; in a fully decentralized way, and as the author well defines it, \u201cusing only blockchain smart contract interactions. This trustless model does not require \u201ctrusting\u201d the lottery administrator to run and operate the lottery.\u201d I believe that the project deserves maximum impact in terms of impact, since it is a very organized idea that would benefit the community so much (since the funds raised would be invested in projects of the ecosystem itself, from what I understand); at the same time that developers would be attracted, with the new possibilities of work that would be presented. In general, this would also lead to a great commotion and community engagement with each other, as a new way of placing bets would be launched (and we know how the cryptographic community is fond of this type of game, that is, the possibility of getting maximize profits through tools like this). I thought that, despite being a complex and quite technical idea, the author made it accessible to all readers, since he accurately described how each action would develop, allowing us to have a great understanding of the whole. In this way, there is no doubt that a high-value dApp would be developed, which, at the same time that it would promote the arrival of new members to our community, would also encourage the activities of those who already make up the current members of the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, the proposal is viable, but I have some comments to make about improvements that would raise the bar on this topic. The roadmap provided is not adequate in my opinion because the detailed activities are not explained (Sep 9th : Funding Approved / Sep 12th - Oct 21st : Development (1 Developer) / Oct 23th - Oct 28th : Testing (1 Developer) / Oct 31st - Nov 2nd : Documentation (1 Developer). There is no detail behind this. For example, from September 12th to October 21st development would take place. How would this be done, what advances would the developer need to present in about 1 month How would the test be carried out, in 5 days, after the development of the product? How would the documentation be built? We also see that all activities would be performed by only 1 person, which in my view is a little worrying. that the requested funding is corresponding despite the creation of the 0.2.0.0 beta version, would it not be interesting for at least another developer to become the proponent's working partner, in case he had any setbacks, the responsibility could be shared, perhaps decreasing the risk of delays? That is, much more detail would be needed so that we could accurately understand the development process here. What would be done, how, when, who would do it, for what purposes, etc.: all this should be properly informed here. As for funding, approximately US$30,000 is requested. This would correspond to 350 hours of work, with a value of 85 dollars per hour. I believe that this value is very fair, and this part of the proposal is very satisfactory, since we know exactly which small parts together would make up the whole; as we can see, for example, in \u201cBrowser wallet integration [Developer] [80 hrs] [$6,800] + Plutus V2 updates and code refactoring [Developer] [60 hrs] [$5,100] + Random number generator using player based entropy [Developer] [100 hrs] [$8,500] + Staking rewards of Ada locked in Lotto contract [Developer] [20 hrs] [$1,700]\u201d. In this regard, there are no criticisms to be made, as I think it's all well laid out and our understanding of how the requested money would be used is pretty accurate. Finally, speaking about the team, it's just the proponent, Lawrence Ley. He is certainly super capable of carrying out this project successfully, a lot of confidence is conveyed through the information that is passed on: more than 20 years in application development, cryptographic enthusiast having done the Plutus Pioneer program, graduated in computer science from University of Toronto, etc. In other words, he is someone who is prepared and has a lot of study, in addition to providing his linkedin profile, so that we can have proof of what he is saying. My comment remains, I believe it would be interesting for him to hire another developer - preferably with the same level of experience - or maybe even an intern, so that they can share some tasks and support each other if necessary. In my view, it is never the best option for a proposal to be developed entirely by one person, no matter how prepared they are for it (as is the case), so my suggestion for this part is in relation to inviting a work partner. In general the feasibility is good, although not perfect - for example, the script in my view could be improved - but still it seems to me a project that would be successfully implemented.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of the proposal is the topic that could be more detailed, in my opinion. We know that progress would be monitored by even a monitoring software called JIRA; I did a little research on this technology to understand how it works, and in fact it seems to be something quite suitable to accompany the dApp development process. However, it would be better if the proponent had attached an explanation of this tool to the proposal, since it is something more differentiated and not so common in proposals. That way, we would have a better idea of \u200b\u200bhow the monitoring of the creation of the dApp would be carried out, all readers would be better leveled in this regard. It is super important that weekly reports are made available by Discord, in fact, in the channel that will be created. It would be important for these reports to include explanations regarding both tasks and partial achievements, as I do believe they will. In other words, the focus should not only be on the products generated when each phase was developed, but also on the activities that led to this accomplishment, as this was made possible through the work routines - we must be aware of the processes that would be performed by each professional. One part that I think could have been better explored is the measurement of success. This topic doesn't get very well covered, we know that the funding would match just for one version of Dapp - it would be interesting if we knew how much the project would cost in total, first. The results that are expected at the moment are entirely numerical (3 pilot lottery sponsors identified, 10,000+ Github page views, 1,500+ unique visitors and 1,500+ clones, 300+ unique clones). In my view, it would be necessary for the proponent to do a qualitative analysis as well, that is, has the release of this version already started to bring some kind of return, even if not in the expected proportion? Have the funds for the projects started to be raised? Has this caught the attention of new developers to work with Cardano's technologies? How can we attract this type of audience and calmly respond to what has been exposed in the summary of the challenge, about attracting new developers and a skilled workforce to Cardano? How could this begin to be understood? Did the application generate community engagement, are many people participating in the Discord channel, for example? Because, in addition to attracting new active members to our community, it is important that the project also makes those who are already part of it more engaged, more active. Therefore, questions like these could be raised, so that it could be understood how, in fact, the project would be bringing consequences to our ecosystem. And everything must be properly accessible to the Cardano community: both the monitoring of the phases and the understanding of the final success scenario. That said, I think the suggested auditability is pretty consistent and necessary, but some more detail should have been provided.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 8, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1774, "q0": "The Open Source Cardano Lottery is a fully decentralized lottery system, smartcontract based, whose purpose is to fund Green and Social Cardano projects. \nA beta release was delivered in may 2022, thus this proposal is made to continue the development.

Integrating the lottery platform with an unsupervised 3rd party mechanism and purely luck-based results on the Cardano blockchain will bring a novel form of lottery play that can build trust and attract many players when the current form of lottery is gradually losing the trust of players because of doubts surrounding the awarding of fake prizes to stimulate players. The author did a great job of describing the architecture of the platform, the lottery issuance mechanism, the prize structure, and how the winners receive their prizes. The descriptions of how the platform works as a decentralized platform also reinforce the author's commitment that the administration and operation of the lottery will not be interfered with by administrators.

Because Blockchain property can achieve brand new transparency without side effects. Unlike the traditional lottery where everything happens behind the scenes, Blockchain records all transactions and nothing can change any part of the transaction, making it a system. Ideal for preventing manipulation. Ultimately, Blockchain has the potential to solve the most pressing problem of traditional lotteries, which is the possibility of fraud. Blockchain removes any geographical, regulatory or financial restrictions currently associated with lottery tickets. By going global, jackpots can be collected by a worldwide audience, resulting in higher jackpots than traditional lotteries. In addition, by using cryptocurrency payments, users can bypass the often slow, unreliable and expensive hassle of banking transactions.

First of all, it would be more secure because it would be distributed and there would not be a single point of failure. Secondly, it would be more transparent because all transactions would be recorded on the blockchain. And finally, it would be more accessible because anyone with an internet connection would be able to participate.
