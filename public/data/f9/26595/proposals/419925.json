This is the financing of the installation of hydroelectric turbines in the Delaware Canal State Park, in Pennsylvania, United States. The energy produced in these turbines would be sold to local energy providers, as I understand it, and governance NFTs would be created to raise capital to pay for the installation of the turbines. A number of problems are encountered here, firstly, it is unclear what these NFTs would look like. It is said that a DAO would be created, formed by the holders of the active tokens, where they \u201ccan propose and vote on new ideas and projects to fund that would improve the community with the revenue generated\u201d. Another problem, even raised by the proponent, would be that we are not sure about the sale of these NFTs. We don't know if the local community would embrace the project, nor is it cited any marketing campaign strong enough to draw the attention of the cryptographic community, which collects NFTs. It is said that after the funding and creation of the NFTs, the project would be publicized through Twitter and Discord; but do local people in Pennsylvania use these channels of communication? How to make people who are not from that locality feel moved by the project, embrace the idea, seeking to improve the flow of water? I think the idea as a whole is still abstract, the proponent explains the problem, the idea and what it could generate. But it lacks a lot of detail in relation to how this would happen in practice and there is also a lack of argumentation and planning when it comes to the security of working. The proponent himself raises a number of issues, such as \u201cCompany legal framework / Unsuccessful creation of tokenized assets / Not enough traction/hype around the project / Not enough funding needed / Not selling itself / Not securing rights to water/building permits needed to install turbines\u201d. But he doesn't point out solutions, the ideal is always that we think of agile and accurate ways to solve the possible difficulties, which usually happen in the practical development of the project. Therefore, my suggestions for making the impact part of the project better would be: first, make it clearer what these generated NFTs would be; what would they be representing? How would they relate to the governance of the future DAO? How could we ensure that they were actually purchased, moreover, that the people who made the purchase stayed engaged with the project, so that the DAO could be formed? How would this project contribute to the strengthening and improvement of Cardano, in addition to minting NFTs on our blockchain? The target audience that would buy the tokens would be introduced to our community, in fact, how could we educate people who don't know about the cryptographic world to participate in this project? Many gaps are unfortunately left, greatly compromising the project's impact.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The roadmap provided is not adequately detailed. It would be necessary for the proponent to provide us with more details about the activities, because the way the information is arranged, he only informs what would happen in what order, as a kind of general planning; but it is not a script itself as it does not contain explanations about each activity. For example; how is he doing the information gathering (what information?) and site measurements? How are you planning for this to happen, in how many days? How will contact with local municipalities be established, how would the necessary licenses be acquired? Some legal professional would certainly have to act in this part. What would your service delivery look like? All activities should be better detailed, especially those related to the Cardano ecosystem, such as the creation of the NFTs; the process of marketing and selling the assets; the formation of the DAO; DAO activities, how future projects would be discussed and financed, etc. Another essential part of a proper script would be the notion of time: how long each thing would last. In the way it is laid out, we have no way of knowing how long each activity would last and also the total time for the development of this project. That is, unfortunately our understanding of the process itself is quite limited. Speaking of funding, $58,000 is requested. The amount is divided into some parts, but each of them is not explained, it is only indicated for what purpose the parts would be spent. Everything should be justified - approximately how many NFTs are planned to be created? How long would the artist who would be responsible for this work, what would be the value of his hour of work? We don't know if the 15 thousand dollars would correspond to 1 month, 2 months, 3 months\u2026 The same doubts arise in relation to the payment of the project manager. What would the marketing campaign look like, why would it cost $5,000? What would be the advertising strategies adopted? There is a large portion of the funding ($25,000) that would go towards various things: \u201cfeasibility studies/permission/lawyer/accountant/participation\u201d. It would be important that this part was better explained. How much would go into each of these smaller parts? Unfortunately, once again, the level of detail is very insufficient, not allowing us to understand with solidity how the funding would be used. Regarding the team involved in the project, we are only aware of 1 member, which is precisely the proponent. However, not much is said about his professional training, we don't really know his current area or even how he relates to the Cardano community (it is said that he has been in the community for more than a year, but not what he actually does). The other team members from what I understand have not yet been defined, it is only said what roles would be needed for the project and what these people would do. The ideal would be that we had a team already defined, and that all its members were properly presented, with CVs included and well detailed.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Again, unfortunately the information provided is insufficient. It is said that progress would be measured through the amount of energy generated, and this would be controlled by the Turbulent software. The problem is that the proponent is already starting to analyze it from a very advanced point in the proposal, before the hydroelectric facilities are operational, a lot of work would have to be done, and this would need to be audited. He says he will keep the formed DAO up to date on each turbine, but I think the project should be audited broadly and not directly focused on these products. It would be important that each advance was reported, that the work of all the professionals involved was monitored, that is, partial results and what would be behind it as well. I believe it is important for the proponent to produce some reports, for example at the end of each month, that can update the community from scratch. For example, the first steps would be to conduct research; this should also be monitored. The process of creating the NFTs, the sale, the formation of the DAO, the installation of the turbines, all parts in my view are equally important, and must be closely monitored. Therefore, these reports could be made available to the community through a website, or through the social networks that the proponent cites, such as Twitter and Discord, for example; the important thing is that the Cardano community is aware of all the advances, including the small ones. Speaking of success, the proponent points out some ways to perceive it, such as \u201cSuccessful installation of hydroelectric turbines in each lock capable of housing a / Revenue stream generated from the turbines that produce energy / Community dedicated to improving the channel while voting where the surplus funds should go.\u201d But we can see that all indicators are aimed at analyzing the results of the project itself, and not the consequences that this may have on Cardano. How can we be sure that the challenge objectives have been met? In general, I think that a study on how the local community and DAO members would be relating to our blockchain technologies would be good indicators. Lack of elaboration of details in the auditability, mainly in the monitoring of the progress. It is also unclear how the specific objectives of the challenges, such as the \u201ccreation or improvement of different Dapps, products, and integrations that provide value to the Cardano community and wider ecosystem + integrations with other existing services, products, and protocols that improve the end-user experience whether that's giving the user more options or making something easier to use that benefits the wider ecosystem\u201d would be achieved. So, while some important metrics have been provided on the part of the auditability of progress, a lot of information would still be needed for the topic to be in fact adequate.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3684, "q0": "While this proposal is noble in its goal to restore an old canal and help monetize it by producing electricity in order to generate revenue and revitalize the community near the canal, it is not at all apparent that this will be a sensible nor sustainable project. From the proposal\u2019s estimates, installing a turbine costs $50,000-75,000 but it only generates 15-70kW of electricity. Let\u2019s say we take the average at 42kW and if it could run 24/7, and that is a big if given that the proposer himself acknowledged the canal doesn\u2019t have much water most of the time and he has lived there for more than 22 years and it is prone to damage from natural disasters which disrupts water flow. To quote the proposer \u201cOver my years of living on the canal I can only remember a handful of times when there was water flowing through my backyard\u201d, how will one generate hydropower if there isn\u2019t enough water? Pennsylvania residents pay about 15 cents per kWh for electricity, even if assuming the DAO captures 100% without any going to utilities companies, it is hard to see how this project can generate meaningful revenue. If it could, why aren\u2019t other companies fighting to install their own turbines? Better unit economics need to be worked out, and hopefully that is why the proposal has only asked for money for one turbine as the eventual plan is to install about 24 turbines which costs $2M. This might be a pessimistic scenario but let\u2019s work through an estimate, installing a turbine costs $75,000 which will likely overrun given the lack of scale and other works needed to install the turbine and connect to the grid. The turbine only generates about 20kW and for 3 hours a day and the DAO can sell the electricity to a utilities company for 5 cents/kWh, it will take 25,000 days to recoup the initial cost or about 68.5 years. It represents about a 2% ROI annually which the Delaware community can probably beat by investing in low risk bonds or other assets. Of course the actual figures could be better, maybe there is more water after all or maybe it could be worse as we haven\u2019t factored in the costs to clean up and repair after natural disasters. If voters want to go ahead with this proposal, I would highly recommend trying a small pilot first and negotiating down the price of the turbines and other related works. A revenue sharing model could also be explored to align the interests of the turbine provider and the DAO and to reduce the upfront financing costs.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Should be doable given that the installation of the turbines is outsourced to Turbulent. They also seem to have an anonymous dev who can help with the technical side of things such as setting up the DAO, so it should be doable given that tools already exist for that. Main concern would be budget overruns as this is common with teams, no matter new or experienced, when building physical things and construction.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team seems committed to transparency, regularly updating the community through social media, being transparent on how funds are used and also sharing how much power is generated from the turbines(this data is shared by the turbine provider, and while it requires some level of trust and centralization, let\u2019s not burden the team with too much in such an early phase given that other teams are working on these issues too).\u2003", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2468", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4169, "q0": "The challenge seeks to drive adoption by growing an ecosystem of Dapps, products, [services] and integrations.  Ultimately, adoption \u2013 transition from innovator and early adopter to early majority and late majority phases \u2013 depends on the provision of utility to end users.  People will be drawn to the blockchain that enables them to DO things safely with the least friction. \nProposal Clarity & Fit (3): This proposal would create a DAO governance solution using NFTs to specifically be applied to a charitable purpose, supporting the Delaware Canal State Park in Pennsylvania.  While the challenge goals are sufficiently broad to accommodate this proposal, it seems it would better fit within another challenge: DAOs <3 Cardano.  The proposal well documents the use case, Delaware Canal State Park, including its present condition.  However, the nature of how the DAO would operate is more ambiguous.  \nCardano Impact (5): The Cardano community places significant value on projects that make the world better.  In Cardano events, the label IMPACT often refers to a category of initiatives such as this, which seek to provide public benefits. The project would impact a region of the United States (60 miles of canal in Pennsylvania), and provide exposure to Cardano. A successful project would likely draw news coverage, at least at the local level. In a mature state, the project would have potential impact on scale with other well known Cardano projects.  \nScalability (3): The problems that need to be solved in order to make this proposal successful would form a very scalable project.  In its current form, the proposal needs more work to be scalable. \nThe challenge presents the following KPIs: 1) increasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases, 2) Increase the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products, and 3) increased quality of existing products & integrations through suggested improvements that is supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community. A project would be successful under the challenge if it satisfies at least one of the conditions.  \nKPI Alignment (1): The single KPI represented is the power output of turbines.  This does not appear consistent with the challenge metrics. \nAverage Impact Score (4).  THIS PROJECT HAS GREAT POTENTIAL.\n\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Experience Required and Fit of Team (2): The proposer is the single team member and project manager.  The proposer has familiarity as an investor in NFTs and  Other roles are specified, but without identified individuals to fill them.  The work proposed by the project would occur primarily in the United States, and thus should seek to conform with US law, particularly tax law.  The work is also clearly would qualify as a public charity (501c3), which is defined in the code as a corporation. The project should also determine whether there is an existing charity or foundation serving the park.  While it may be plausible to form a corporation as a DAO, it would be a new application. It is likely the project will need legal advice, and potentially, legal services to create the appropriate entity.  A project of this scale is likely to need both legal and accounting work.  Having these needs accounted for, recruiting suitable partners beforehand, and listing them in the proposal would improve feasibility.   \nImplementation Plan & Budget (2): The budget requests $58,000. For the identified expenses, the costs are plausible and reasonable. However, aforementioned omissions (e.g. lawyers, accountants) and complexity call its adequacy into question. The plan establishes broad milestones and presents them in an order of execution.  However, there is no timeline or deadlines provided. This project seems to involve two separate, large projects.  First, it requires the development or adoption of a DAO with a functioning token.  Second, it requires raising at least $2M in funding for its immediate use case. Presumably, there are other places across the globe that could benefit from \nTechnically Sound (2): The proposer is an NFT enthusiast who indicates that NFTs would be created and sold to raise money for the project. The project seeks to install 24 turbines at a per turbine cost between $50,000 and $75,000, with a total price on the $2M scale.  This is a serious level of capital. It seems dependent on perceptions of value and attractiveness of the NFTs as collectables. The proposal also suggests operation of a DAO with an internal token. The proposal does not discuss the tokenomics of the DAO, and development has advanced in this space sufficiently to make any presumptions about how tokens operate.  The project shares similarities with the World Mobile Token, Empowa and the Cardano Forest projects. \nRisk Awareness & Mitigation (2): The proposal identifies the following numerous risks but provides no strategies for their mitigation. \nThe identified risks are: 1)Legal framework of company, 2)Non successful mint of tokenized assets, 3) Not enough traction/hype around project, 4) Not enough funding needed, 5) Doesn't sell out, and 6) Not securing needed water rights/building permits needed to install turbines.\nAverage Feasibility Score (2). THIS PROJECT NEEDS FURTHER DEVELOPMENT TO MAKE IT FEASIBLE. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Roadmap, Milestones and Time Horizon (2): The roadmap seems preliminary. Its milestones are appropriate but the time horizons are completely absent.  \nReasonable and Quantifiable KPIs (2): The single KPI is suitable but insufficient for a project of this scale. Other KPIs should be developed representing the project's important components. \nTransparency (4): The proposal commits to communicating with the public on Twitter, establishing and using a Discord server, and making the treasury wallet (presumably only the public address) known. \nAverage Auditability Score (2.67).
