The on-ramp feature will be an overlay on existing Cardano wallets that users a payment gateway to facilitate the transaction. The business vault will be hosted on the Ada Anvil website and allow users to specify a number of nominated signers for the vault and the threshold needed to successfully sign a transaction. The proposers could have specified the payment gateway they were intending to use here for clarity to show they have understand which third party infrastructure to use for this implementation and provide justifications as to why they are well suited. The proposers outline the issuers faced in the community of not being able to manage shared group treasuries which stifles the innovation that can happen in the ecosystem and also introduces large risk vectors. The proposers highlight how other blockchain wallets have some of the features outlined in this proposal. The main risks that the team details is the legal complexities, security of code and failure to get adoption. It would have been good for the proposers to identify what legal issues exist with doing direct payments that are swapped into ADA when making purchases and what controls may be in place for payment gateways to reject this type of usage. Or would they not be able to prevent this? Overall there is a clear sign of potential value and impact to a group of users in Cardano that are not well served by current implementations available, some more visuals or depth of explanation for the business vault could have added to better showcase how this may look or could be used and also more details on preference for existing payment gateways to integrate.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is broken down into four quarters that cover the planning, development of wallet overlay, development of business vault and finally integration of credit card payment gateway. Those phases are then broken down below with an itemised list of tasks that are involved for each. This list breaks down specific features that will be available from the deliverables of the application. For the budget breakdown a focus is made on the different functional areas that need to be completed such as UI/UX, legal content, development, planning, infrastructure and maintenance. The approach for budget breakdown appears to be very rough and is somewhat difficult to follow how they reached those numbers. Administration for instance states task management in Jira and budget planification and totals $15,000. Maintenance quotes $10,000 but does not detail anything specific. A better break down would have been useful here to work out whether the budgets are actually reasonable. The team has 6 people involved in Cardano with over 25 years development experience. They mention their flag ship project is Ultimate Anvil and detail who has used this. The team has not provided a link, not is it available on their Twitter, that showcases this project for the assessors and voters to verify. The team names are provided but no professional links are given to verify the background of the team. Overall there is a lack of evidence that the team can in fact feasibly execute this proposal due to a lack of evidence and links given on the previous work that has been executed and no professional links for the team. The Twitter profile also does not have a website link that I could then verify any of these details and the Discord link was broken. In future proposals I would ask the team to share all evidence related to their involvement with Cardano, development projects and their backgrounds to give assessors a way to verify and at least have more confidence that the team can feasibly execute the project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Tracking progress is broken down into deliverables at the end of quarterly timelines including the release of the wallet overlay features, business vault and credit card payment integration over different quarters in the future. They look to track the total $ value going through the credit card payment gateway and also the number of business vaults created. The proposers also mention they will do updates to the community on Twitter and Discord. The progress measuring is reasonable as well as the metrics they are looking to track. It would have been good to know exactly what would be open source from this proposal so that the community can follow a Github repository and follow the execution of the work in this manner as well. Success for this proposal is to make a seamless experience to purchase goods and services from Cardano projects and are looking to facilitate over $100,000 in payments per month through their wallet overlay integration. The second main area for success is the usage of their business vault to manage projects treasury funding and would like to see 50,000 users utilising the vault application. Overall the team have provided details on where updates will be released, made some high level objectives with some specific targets and have shared when they expect to release certain parts of the proposal for the community to audit. Some improvements would have been providing more evidence of where to audit existing and ongoing work such as with a Github profile, intentions to open source parts or all of this proposal and more specific objectives on the types of business that they want to target for adoption when trying to grow the usage of their application in the short and medium term.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2073", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 9, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3785, "q0": "The problem stated in this proposal is real. Thankfully the proposal will deliver a very real solution. Every time I want to buy some cryptocurrencies, I need to get it from CEX. From there I need to withdraw it to my (whitelisted) wallet then transfer it to my dApp wallet. There are a lot of hassles and inconveniences, both in time and cost, involved in this process. The fees for using credit card in CEX are also crazy, ranging from 4-7% on top of the sport price at that moment. Not to mention that every time I want to withdraw funds from the CEX, they always ask bunch of questions.\n\nThe other proposed product of business vault is also very interesting. I can imagine how very useful and impactful it will be for the mass of community to be able to create multisig wallets as easy as creating normal wallet. For comparison with the traditional finance (tradfi), creating a joint account is such a hassle that you usually need to come to the physical branch or office, deposit certain (high) amount of money as the minimum balance, and use it regularly or else you will be charged fee for less frequent transactions or being dormant. If all the features proposed are realized by the Ada Anvil team, I cannot agree more that this proposal will improve the utility and push the penetration of Cardano blockchain technology.\n\nLast thing, I would like to add is if the Ada Anvil team can help credit card crypto payment gateway such as MoonPay to push their exorbitant fees down into reasonable range of 3-5%, it will be the real game changer. MoonPay had been integrated before in Yoroi and now jpg.store and their fee is 8-12%. I have tried MoonPay service several times. I like their UI/UX, but the transaction processing fee is often the dealbreaker. It mentioned gas fees (maybe due to their EVM root) as one of the reasons but in Cardano the transaction is deterministic. It means the fee is fixed before the transaction happens (no surprise fee) and it will always succeed in settlement layer given all conditions (such as the UTXO involved) are satisfied. The most important thing is that fee is much, much cheaper in Cardano therefore we must be having some room for improvement in this area.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Project timeline is sufficiently outlined and key milestones are broken down into clear action plans. This project will be delivered in about 1 year. Assuming 48 working weeks with 40 working hours each week, this will make the hourly rate for each of Ada Anvil\u2019s 6-man member of developer team  to be USD 30. It is very reasonable and probably will be the best bang for Catalyst\u2019s buck when compared to other developer rates among similar proposals across Fund 9 challenges. For further details regarding their capacities and capabilities to deliver this proposal, please find my lengthy recent testimony below.\n\nI must testify my first-hand experience with Ada Anvil team, one of the Cardano NFT OGs. Yesterday, I participated in the first day of Virtua\u2019s Cardano Island land and condo purchase. It was quite a terrible experience even for someone who haven\u2019t participated in minting event before. The web experienced several loading issues, dApp connector was not working properly and indexing to wrong wallet (Yoroi instead of Nami) and we needed to remove the Yoroi first, no minting in mobile device, and the land NFTs took hours and hours to arrive. In short it was quite a dumpster fire with buyers demanding tons of explanation and compensation. Then for the second day and onwards, Virtua worked with Ada Anvil team and those problems I mentioned before just gone like they were never there in the first place. Minting website was super smooth as newborn skin, NFTs arrived at the wallets in seconds, mobile device minting was possible, multi CIP-30/dApp wallets support was enabled, and everyone was happy in the Discord and conversations moving forward towards the project and its betterment. I think this speaks volume about Ada Anvil team\u2019s capacity and capabilities to deliver this proposal. I speak from my own experience as a happy and satisfied user. I believe we will get pretty much the same testimonies from others who had worked with them before such as Nemonium, Yummi, etc.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Well, what can I say more? The proposal itself is already well-written. All the necessary information for a good proposal is there and detailed nicely. They are also very open and transparent to Cardano community. They plan to publish monthly blog for regular updates on the development and anyone interested and curious can drop by their Twitter account or Discord server. Maybe throw in some AMA sessions every now and then there as cherry on top.\n\nMetrics and KPIs such as total transaction value from credit card payments facilitated by wallets overlay is relevant to the success, as well as the the number of business vault/multisig wallet created on the website. They want the community to experience of purchasing Cardano projects as easy as the users of services such as Wise.com and Paypal. They also quantify that success of this project to facilitating USD 100,000 monthly payments to Cardano projects. Ultimately, they plan to have 50,000 users using their business vault and bridging the essential trust with non-blockchain native business. This allows grater adoption of Cardano technologies and onboarding more and more people into the ecosystem, meaningfully impacting the real world outside crypto space, and reducing the dependencies on trusted and custodial service such as CEX thus promoting more decentralization.\n\nThe fact that they keep building during this high intensity of capital flight in the current bear market is also commendable and inspiring. It is testament of their mettle and dedication as builders in our ecosystem. I am glad to have them as part of our family and I believe they deserve the support from Catalyst and no other time is better for this communal support other than now. They don\u2019t lie when they say that they \u201chave a demonstrable track record of delivering high-quality, state-of-art solutions for projects building on Cardano\u201d. I trust they are one of the best developer teams in Cardano ecosystem to deliver this proposed project with high degree of satisfaction and success. Good luck and all the very best for Ada Anvil team in the voting phase of this Catalyst Fund 9!", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2482", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 6694, "q0": "There is a very comprehensive value proposition within this proposal, and it connects very well with the challenge. Let\u2019s dive in. \nStarting with the problem statement, we have a spot on message. Cardano lacks the necessary tools to enable seamless functionality to manage shared treasuries. And this is indeed a challenge for decentralized working systems, DAOs and generally projects that have to share responsibilities and between users, sometimes located in different geographical areas. Now, the value proposition is to build a two-pronged solution: a multisig wallet (that allow complex signatures of n out of k keys needed as a quick example) and fiat-on ramp capabilities, valuable mostly for new users interacting with the ecosystem in many different ways: purchasing ADA for the first time, purchasing NFTs, etc. The proposers also point out, correctly, that Ethereum for instance, allows such capabilities from its own wallets via applications like Moonpay or Wyre. \n\nIndeed, there is an expectation within the community that such user-friendly tools develop over time on the Cardano ecosystem and allow for a similar user experience and level of functionality. In conclusion, there is a great connection between the proposal and the challenge, whore purpose is, I remind you, to foster the development of new products and integrations, and this is definitely one of them, that might boost user onboarding for general NFT purposes, DAO members as well as niche markets like web3 games with in-game purchases later on. Just as a note, this proposal would have also fitted very well within the Legal and Financial implementation, but given its significant budget it was probably wiser for the proposers to include it here. So five stars for potential impact. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The excitement from the previous round unfortunately settles down a bit when looking closer at this project\u2019s feasibility. And the first potential flag comes from the team\u2019s description. For a project of this scale, one\u2019s expectation is to have a well bonded team behind it, potentially even an existing business that can demonstrate, beyond reasonable doubt, the capacity to start this project and to deliver on its promises. Unfortunately this is not the case here. Ada Anvil claims to be a team of six Cardano developers, and we do know their names, that\u2019s for sure. But this is as far as things go, since no social media profiles, no extensive bios, no website and no resumes can be found - and therefore it is impossible to verify their claims. They do have one twitter account, but the number of followers is rather unimpressive and is just another red flag in my opinion. So we proceed with a heavy dose of caution. They also claim that Ultimate Anvil is their flagship product - used for multisig minting, but there is only one reference to this flagship product and again, nothing that we can verify further. \n\nTimewise, the project would start in Q3 this year and end in Q2 next year, and would be split into four milestones, each relatively well detailed with bullet points, so we can definitely follow the logic behind the development. \n\nThe budget however is a different story. Given the significant amount requested, one should expect, again, a very detailed budgetary description to offer voters enough confort that the budget is at the very least reasonable. Here, we do have a very rough split of the amount, and I will begin to analyze them from the most important caption, moving down. 200k USD would be spent on development, with next to no other details except for six bullet points. There are no detailed plans, no estimated hours to complete the tasks and no applicable hourly rates. The same logic applies to every other caption, significant in nature and amount requested, but without any details whatsoever: UI/UX - 40k USD, legal content - 50k USD, and the list goes on. \n\nAn excellent proposal would have included at least: \n\n- clear estimations of hours necessary to implement each feature\n- hourly rates used in the budget construction\n- description of external parties / consultants used, or at least criteria for their selection procedure and due diligence activities undertaken so far. \n\nAnother worry point is that the proposers claim the project to be self-sustaining over time, but we do not have any indication on what that time frame is, or how exactly revenue is to be generated, nor do we have any long term financial projections. \n\nConsidering the extensive red flags noted above in terms of team description, vagueness of budget captions and no detailing of long term sustainability plans, I can only offer two stars and consider the proposal rather unfeasible in its current form. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "In contrast to the previous section, the team makes a rather compelling argument for auditability. They claim that the community will be able to audit the progress by tracking the release of the wallet overlay, and that they will measure the value of payments facilitated and the number of business vaults created. They also share a target of 100k USD/month in transactions following launch, and an overall level of 50k users involved in vaults and managing seamlessly their shared treasuries. \n\nA rather negative point is that the team intends to make the code open source only if there is no mass adoption of the solution developed, which I don\u2019t think fully aligns with Cardano\u2019s ethos and open source philosophy. \n\nConsidering the overall good case for auditability, but also being mindful of the we-open-source-if-not-successful approach, I think four stars are sufficient.

If the project is successful, it will help hundreds of thousands of cardano users today save time trading through centralized exchanges that contain many risks.

They are prepared with the potential solutions in all these situations. But I think the legal complexities and regulatory compliance will be a hurdle for the fiat-crypto on-ramp payment gateway.

Those two problems are users' inability to deposit fiat money directly into their Cardano wallet via credit card and the lack of multisig wallet functionality for shared treasuries. Two major obstacles to Cardano mass adoption. With the development of the cryptocurrency market and Web3 today, the need to build ramps from fiat to crypto is great, shortening time and simplifying the deposit, withdrawal and trading process electronic. Multisig technology is being widely applied in cryptocurrency wallets to enhance security and reduce one's dependence.\nThe proposed solution solved these 2 problems. The author has detailed description and reasonable argument. The solution to improve the Cardano wallet is: to create an overlay for an existing wallet that allows users to buy ADA directly with a credit card and develop a business vault plugin for existing wallets to provide multi-wallet functionality. form for the treasury.

We learn from this proposal that the team is the team that runs ADA Anvil, a project that has been very successful and would appear to be very successful in what they do in the future based on the past accomplishments including a working multi-signature option, as well as Cardano's first mobile minting app. When it comes to this 6 person team, their past performance speaks volumes as to how successful they will be in doing what they set out to do.\n\nThe proposal lists everyone who is on the team, but does not list any links where the voter can go and research the background, education, history of successes, or any other needed information on each of the team members. This is why I had to lower my rating from strongly agree to agree. I was able to go out and find the information needed on each team member, but this information (links) are not included in the proposal. Moving forward with any proposals that you may bring forth in the future, please take the time to include this information for the voter to give you more success when it comes time for the community to vote.\n\nFinally, the proposer has listed out possible risks involved and how they will be mitigated. They have taken the time to think the full process through, pinpoint and consider the risks, then determine a way to overcome, or get around those risks which shows their time spent walking through the full implementation of the proposal. \n\nBased on the information provided in this proposal, the experience, and plan presented I agree that this it will be successfully implemented upon receiving the funding, but has some areas that could use some improvements, or areas to consider moving forward with any new proposals.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3237", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "We will develop an overlay for existing Cardano wallets that provides a credit card payment gateway and a business vault with multisig wallet functionality for shared treasuries.", "experience": "Ada Anvil is a six-person team that is deeply embedded within the Cardano community.
