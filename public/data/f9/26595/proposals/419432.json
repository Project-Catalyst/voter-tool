Currently, the English version of the Tent application has 2.5 million ADA transactions. This proposer team will develop another 9 languages that are most used all over the world.\n\nWith trading Tent multi language, the application will attract more users from other parts of the world.

Let's make it the best!\n\nThe budget used for this proposal is reasonable. Each item using the budget is listed clearly: UX/UI interface design, translation and product marketing activities to the community. \nThe plan to implement this proposal is clear. Results of completing work are reported weekly and parallel execution between translation and technical implementation will help to shorten the time of the project.

There is a lot of information that is completely unique from other proposals I have read. This is an idea of a proposal that promotes complete utility for the Cardano blockchain and will likely bring more users to the Cardano ecosystem. The challenge identified by this proposal is that most of the programs are built in the English language. There are a couple of projects that have implemented other languages. However, it makes it more difficult for these users to navigate through and even find their native language. The proposed solution to this is that the Trading Tent team will continue to add 9 more languages onto their project. Their project allows for these dapps and wallets to be translated into different languages immediately. They plan to include the 9 largest and most widely used languages to increase the amount of activity on Cardano. This could lead to having a global impact on the Cardano blockchain because it will allow for more people around the world to comfortably use Cardano-based dapps and wallets. For these reasons, I give this section of the proposal 5 stars. I would love to see this be implemented successfully. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It is important to note that the team has included a lot of information on their team. Each team member has included their Linkedin profile and also provides their specific experience and skills. This is important because it shows that the team is willing to be held accountable to this project and ensure that their multi-language tool will be implemented successfully and will bring utility to all community members. There is a detailed roadmap that shows exactly when they plan to implement specific details. They plan to finish their product within 13 weeks. Every week or two there is specific information on what they will have accomplished. This is important because it gives specific details that the team can be held accountable for. They have included a detailed budget breakdown that supports their roadmap and project. Most of the funds will be allocated to translation services and tutorial videos for their project in these given 9 languages. I believe that this project will likely be implemented successfully given the specific details and the transparency from the team. This is regarding the information provided on each of their team members. For these reasons, I give this section of the proposal 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is a great deal of information provided in this proposal. It is exciting to see the innovation that this proposal could bring to the Cardano ecosystem by allowing more people of different nationalities and different cultures to utilize Cardano. There is specific information included in the plan, roadmap, and budget breakdown which is extremely important. All of the information matches up to what the proposal describes. I would imagine that a proposal like this has a lot of followers behind it. This is because there would be a lot of people that would love to have an easier time navigating the Cardano ecosystem by using their native language. The only suggestion I would make is to include more information about the current community behind this project and how the team plans to deal with the concept of accountability. The community should be aware of this proposal and idea. This will likely give the proposal more traction and a higher likelihood of being successful. Given this information, I give this section of the proposal 5 stars. I really would love to see this implemented successfully.

As a result, non-English speakers have a language barrier that can prevent them from using the platform. Currently, over 10,000 assets and over \u20b32.5 million have been traded through this platform. The translations would be in the following languages: Mandarin, Hindi, Spanish, French, Arabic, Filipino, Portuguese and Indonesian. This project can have a positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem as the multilingual implementation can provide a universal tool through which people around the world can securely trade Native Cardano Assets. The main goals correspond to the outlined challenges settings. The biggest risk will be to perform the correct translations for the technical parts.

This budgeting is broken down into recognizable items. (translation services, marketing material,...) It would be useful to include working hours in the proposal. Now it seems quite common to charge $2,000 per language. The requested budget will be sufficient to implement the objectives. There will be a return for further financing or for a new project. A realistic timetable has been included to complete the work. It is good that the project is divided into 2 parallel phases and one implementation of both phases.

There\u2019s a level of understandable simplicity for this proposal but I do think there are areas where the proposers can put some extra work to demonstrate impact. I think there\u2019s a good argument to be made here that language expandability is a feature that encourages a widely safe experience for future adoption capabilities. Beyond potential missed opportunities to be a little creative with impacts, I would also like to see more numbers that help to understand the magnitude of this proposal. If there\u2019s any research on Cardano users that might speak some of these languages, what countries they\u2019re from, or IOG plans to expand into certain countries/languages, I think that information would help solidify that concrete vision about a post proposal world. Overall, this is a safe and relatively inexpensive proposal with great adoption and retention potential for the Cardano ecosystem because of Trading Tent\u2019s greater security options. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I gave this a little bit of leeway and bumped up this section to a 4 because this seems perfectly reasonable to accomplish and at a reasonable cost breakdown. However, there are some gaps that would normally make me a little skeptical that can be easily fixed. Since many voters generally view feasibility through the lens of the development team, this proposal is in sort of a unique position. The core development team here doesn\u2019t matter quite as much as the translators that are creating the end product of this proposal. I can understand translators not yet being onboarded but the service can get expensive and there needs to be at least some rationale or explanation regarding the plan on how to acquire these translators. I also think the scope of what needs to be translated needs to be further defined. The website at trading tent doesn\u2019t seem to have a lot of content that needs to be translated, so there\u2019s a question of whether or not those funds are efficiently spent. Lastly, the budget could use another layer of breakdown. I always love to see breakdown by hours of labor, cost per hour, and specific details on what every dollar is going to (most specifically the Multilanguage Implementation category). I\u2019m entirely confident that they will be able to get the job done but these are the improvements I would suggest if another round is attempted.

However, I always look for objective metrics and measurable KPIs and I do think there is an opportunity here to provide that. While I do think that completion of the proposal is an appropriate measurement of success here, a fully translated multi lingual Trading Tent platform makes no impact on the world unless it gets usage. Since the proposal budgeted for language specific marketing materials and tutorials, I assume they intend to spread awareness so I expect a preplanned perception of success in those endeavors. These metrics could include how many users from these languages adopt the platform, how much traffic the marketing and tutorial resources see, and maybe how many countries are reached (if this data is available). This section is one of the more important ones for me, so I hope to see much more thought put into what the proposer sees as success and in what timeframe they expect to see that end result.

According to the road map, they will conduct both translation creation and technical implementation in parallel. This process takes about 8 weeks. Then they spent two weeks implementing the translations and testing. Finally, they will spend a week allowing users to publicly submit, revise, and approve translations of their open language translation system.
