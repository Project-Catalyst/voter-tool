The problem raised is precisely the erosion (wear and tear) of the soil, which unfortunately causes intense and direct damage to the flora and fauna; this erosion process is natural, but it is more accelerated due to climate change, direct consequences of the unbridled exploitation of the environment by man. So, to solve this, it is suggested that fast growing trees be planted in areas where the erosion situation is more intense, and the place where the activity will focus is in the Democratic Republic of Congo, because the place is very affected with the erosion process (according to the proponents there are 250 thousand hectares of land affected by this phenomenon there). And how would Cardano relate to all this? The idea is that each tree is an NFT, so that specific characteristics can be tracked more easily (as they would be minted on the Cardano blockchain) and the tracking process is also facilitated. In my view, this initiative can bring a lot of benefits to the Cardano ecosystem, as it will work specifically on the KPI of \u201cincreasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases\u201d. As the trees are NFTs, the number of active tokens on our blockchain will increase, naturally the number of active members of our community will also grow, as people come interested in the project and the environmental cause and not necessarily in the blockchain and in their technologies. With this, there will be a community engagement and a new use case will be made available for our technologies, the project also serves Cardano's more holistic goals of providing environmental protection and an investment in causes that relate to the preservation of fauna and flora, and we know how Cardano is a blockchain aware and concerned with this type of issue. It is very positive that the proponents already have experience with reforestation situations - according to them, they have been doing the activities since June 2020; and also already have some familiarity with the \u201cproduction of educational content about Project Catalyst, Haskell and Plutus\u201d. It is very positive as the proposal is already well defined in relation to which phases would compose the whole and these are well informed here. The first phase would be based on establishing contact with the local population of the erosion areas where we intend to work: \u201cwe will go to the Masisi area east of the city of Goma to meet the people who live in areas at risk of erosion and start a conversation with them. We will focus on gathering information on the most used trees and areas of high erosion risk. Each of our actions and experiences will be captured through (videos, images, text and audio) that will serve as the starting point for each dynamic NFTree story.\u201d The second phase would be based on \u201creturning to previously visited areas at the appropriate time of year for seedlings and conditioning our current nurseries\u201d; and the third would be the most involved in Cardano's technologies, based on the NFTs minting process (NFTrees) and the determination of documents necessary for the execution of the project. That is, we know in a satisfactory way what will happen, it is explained to us with an adequate level of detail for the part of the script, so that we can better understand the processes. The risk part is a little confusing, it is not so explained what the possible difficulties to be faced and how they would be solved would be. However, the impact here is really strong.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the proposal is good, but it does not have the appropriate level of detail in the first two topics (the roadmap and the budget). In general, confidence is conveyed about the project being successfully implemented, but I would like to make some suggestions that would raise the bar on the topic. Talking about the roadmap, we have some established steps and steps. The first necessary comment is in relation to temporality. Unfortunately, no information is given on how long each step and step would take (eg step 1 would take 2 weeks, step 2 would take 1 month to complete, etc.); we also do not know at what time of year these activities would take place, that is, what would happen in August, September, October\u2026 in which month and on which date the project is expected to be completed\u2026 It would be very important to have this understanding of what would be done and when, because then we would have more information to understand the development process itself and would also be valuable information on the auditability part. Talking about the degree of detail of the actions, it is insufficient. In addition to knowing what, we would need to understand how such things would happen. For example, the \u201cResearch (Surveys, gathering information on tree swarms and high erosion risk areas)\u201d part: how would this study be done? Could it be that, in addition to talking to residents of risk areas (soil health), would a more technical study be carried out, with geography professionals, in more specific bibliographies on the subject? The activities \u201cacquire and condition seeds, extend our current tree and plant nursery, plant trees in previously identified areas\u201d could also be better specified, we should have a much more solid and detailed understanding of how these processes would happen in practice. Speaking of costs, the total of $25,000 is broken down into a few parts, which could also be better detailed. For example \u201cTravel Logistics and Coordination: $2,000\u201d: How many people would be traveling, what would the travel segments be? \u201cSeeds and seedlings (acquisition and conditioning): $8,000\u201d: how many seedlings and seeds would it be, why is the value so high? How much would be destined for acquisition and how much would go to conditioning, how would the seedlings be properly conserved? What exactly would the marketing process be and why would it cost $2,000? Maybe it's the issue of publicizing the project? If so, what would the marketing plan look like? As we can see, the way the money would be spent is not as specific, our understanding is not as solid as it should be. The team presentation part is the best on the topic, we know exactly who would be involved in the team and we have an adequate amount of information about them (eg \u201cAkilimali Cizungu Innocent: Proposal leader. Akilimali is a technical analyst for ISDR/GL , and holds a degree in computer science from ISIG Akilimali is also the support technician for the Cardano Stake Pool. Akilimali has experience in front-end and back-end developments\u201d). We know your linkedin profiles, we see that you are a diverse team and that at the same time it has members with experience at Cardano. For these reasons, I think the topic is fine, although there are some details to be explained more specifically.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Finally, talking about auditability, once again the topic is not so suitable because of the lack of specific detail on both parts - the monitoring of progress and success. Talking about progress, firstly, it is said that \u201cresearch documentation published on GitHub within 3 months of funding\u201d. What would that documentation look like, exactly? How would the Cardano community know when information is released, how can we ensure direct outreach in this regard? Regarding the excerpt \u201c120,000 seedlings growing in our nursery within 12 months after funding\u201d: a lot of important information is missing here. First, we would need to audit the entire planting process, which includes the acquisition of seedlings, the planting itself, care for the growing trees, their strengthening, when they would be bearing fruit\u2026 NFTress, just \u201cWhite Paper Publishing and Mining Platform Completed 18 Months After Funding\u201d is not enough for us to properly monitor this activity. In general, there should be more detail on the roadmap, so that we know more precisely what would be done and how, and that way we have the ability to better track what should be developed and delivered. The existence of more exact deadlines would also be essential, the information given about temporality here is quite abstract and inaccurate - for example, until month 3 the documentation would need to be available, and only in month 12 that the seedlings should be cultivated and etc; what would have to happen in each month between the range from month 3 to month 12? Therefore, in addition to understanding the partial results to be achieved, we need to understand the processes behind them, I suggest that any of the proponents prepare monthly reports with updates on all this and that they can make this information available directly and simply to our community, for example through our already established communication channels (discord, telegram, etc.). Speaking now about the success scenario, once again the information is passed on superficially, we know some data necessary for the proposal to be considered a success (\"Planting (coining) 30,000 in the first years of launch + Launch of a commercial seed operation / tree seedlings + Integrating farmers, schools and public institutions in our vision\u201d). But a much deeper study would be needed on what the project would produce both for environmental improvement and in order to achieve the objectives of the challenge. I suggest that the proponents do a research on two fronts: 1) they can do a study on how the planting of trees contributed to an improvement of the soil of the Democratic Republic of Congo, in which way the situation of soil degradation was being gradually converted ; 2) whether the specific objectives of the challenge would have been achieved. Did the project contribute to an increase in active members in our community, who would be those people who would buy NFRess? How would this audience be relating to our technologies, in what way would they be fostering ecosystem activities? In addition to the greater number of active tokens minted in our network, there would be a greater circulation of Ada, the people who were involved in this project would have been interested in studying more about our ecosystem, getting involved for example in Catalyst, whether PAs or as members of project teams? All this needed to be understood and reported to us. A final presentation containing these two surveys should be made for our community, as the proponents cite that they will use youtube as a means of communication, a video with these presentations could be created, posted there and widely disseminated within our community. For these reasons, despite the past information being relevant and necessary, so many other equally important ones are not taken into account, a good improvement is needed and more research is carried out so that the monitoring of the proposal is more adequate and efficient.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 4135, "q0": "The mission of this project provides for an outcome that is beneficial to earth, however a potentially overwhelming feat of \"managing trees\" exposes the reality that if we have reached a point in humanity where we have to do that - maybe we are already doomed.\n\nI have seen the same resources presented on other proposals from Goma, and while this proposal is relevant to Africa, it could be more appropriate in the Grow Africa, Grow Cardano challenge.

This proposal addresses the challenge by identifying this problem and receiving the means/funds to plant trees and help the world. I would ask how this project directly benefits the Cardano ecosystem.

I appreciate the relevance of this project to the key metric Challenge which is solutions to help solve environmental problems with an activity integrated on Cardano that can motivate users to participate because of its usefulness and interest. The process for an NFTree to be cultivated and cared for is also clearly described, besides planting trees, the proponent also plans to develop educational materials to raise environmental awareness for users. This idea is amazing. The risks and mitigations are also presented here, however, I am concerned about the risk that the covid epidemic may limit meetings and exchanges with indigenous peoples as well as tree planting activities, what is the solution for this case if it really happens, examples of building online exchange methods; set up a tree planting and data collection team consisting of local people, sending seedlings and authorizing tree planting activities for them when travel is restricted by epidemic for example.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Although the plan clearly describes the sequence of work to be done to develop the project, it lacks specific timelines to know exactly when the activities will be carried out or completed.
