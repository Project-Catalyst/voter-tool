Profila\u2019s integration of Atala Prism to provide a firewall between advertisers and willing recipients is an innovative approach that uses DiDs to protect personal identity and redirects half of the advertisement revenue stream to the recipient of these ads. The introduction of a token (ZKT or Zero Knowledge Token) represents an interactive reward system that mutually benefits advertisers and recipients, while simultaneously incentivizing a two way sharing of data. The ability of individuals to control every aspect of the data stream, from what information they choose to share about themselves, to what information they receive from advertisers, and what frequency they receive that information, is a revolutionary undertaking. There are very few projects with as much promise as Profila, and the potential impact on mass adoption is staggering.

Issues regarding Github submissions have been adequately addressed, and the willingness of core leadership of the team to provide requested information in a timely manner has been exemplary.\nThe proposer, Michiel Van Roey, and CPO Luke Bragg provide rare levels of accessibility to the community.

This proposal identifies an existing problem in traditional branding that plagues almost all companies where we no longer control our data and have no control over and benefit from it. need an ambitious bigger vision to solve this problem Via Cardano. The solution to this is to control who can access your data and be compensated for your attention with zero-knowledge tokens (ZEKE). The team has had several sponsored proposals in the past and this time they are continuing their great work using anonymous tokens ZEKE Data & Anonymity Control. I see that the business model The business of this proposal is very well explained. I think the proposed solution has great potential that it will have one of the biggest impacts on the Cardano ecosystem.

Risks of integrating our token payments associated with operations into an ad tech ecosystem/ad server requiring high speed may limit the scalability of the solution on Cardano, although the POC will demonstrate the viability of this approach. This is something that all people involved in Blockchain must know and we will see a lot of scalability improvements in the coming years as it is upgraded and improved gradually. Therefore, I strongly agree that this proposal is very feasible if funded I believe the project will be successful. The success of the project is clearly described by the author through the timely development of the third-party aspect this is in addition to the integration of the ZEKE token at the expense of the features of the application. This success is related to the challenge of the campaign through integrating it and the Profila platform and testing with their clients. The solution of this proposal completely solves this challenge as we are expecting more users to use our platform in the coming months, or guarantee that those who will benefit from the functionality that We develop according to this proposal. The solution that introduced over 100,000 new users to the app would be a great step towards bringing a large user base to the Cardano ecosystem.

In order to earn experience points, users have to attend different activities such as answering quizzes, unlock achievement or Badges. All of these activities serve the final purpose is to promote a better relationship between users and brand. To explain, as for users, they not only earn rewards from the system but also protect their personal data from internet abuse. As for the brand, they can approach the customer data in a legal way and step by step convert users' attention to profit.
