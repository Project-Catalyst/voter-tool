The problem to be addressed is a lack of pre-contracted health standards, but specifically in the area of \u200b\u200bclinical studies. Solutions will then provide proposals for this type of contract, which would likely be using Cardano's technologies and meeting the challenge's objectives. I believe it would be positive if the bidder had attached an example of what the framework for clinical standards would look like, not without architectural requirements of the development, but on the types of data and information these contracts would work with. As much as we have talks about a contractual structure without detailing the impact, these more pragmatic characteristics are not so clear. It's Brian Harper during a new component how to develop a global system of relevant experience with users and healthcare providers. What would this global health ecosystem look like? What would that be, exactly? It would be necessary for us to know what small parts it is made of, the information is a bit abstract. Turning attention to the project itself, specifically, in my view this idea meets the following KPIs, proposed in the challenge summary: \u201cincreasing the number of dapps and products available for use by the community that help to enrich the ecosystem with new uses cases . + increase the number of integrations that unite existing solutions for a more integrated and connected experience between different products\u201d. In my view, more than a new modality of smart contracts being built, we are still working with a programming language that already exists and with our programming language Plutus for some technological alternatives that already exist. Or the focus of my understanding is that it's created as something that's not exclusive use, that's not defined as a challenge project, like a new Cardano use case. This can increase an increase in active members on our links for sure, being for sure with more contracts in other technologies like CNFTs will be encouraged to use etc. ) for clinical trial health research groups. Would this be done with a specific health community as a specific building model, which would be done with the community to contribute to this project? Soon after, the author informs us of the elements of the standard of contracts: \u201cFunctional program framed in Plutus, Specific Model of Proof of Participation for selection, Rights of revocation of the contract, Term of accompaniment\u201d and so on; which is quite positive for us to have a more solid understanding of what will be generated here. Another question that came to me, in relation to impact, was referring to the excerpt \u201cHealth innovators may be able to generate smart contract functions appropriately using a Marlowe application tool, specifically applied to participants in clinical trials and similar research\u201d - how would healthcare providers use this tool? How would those who don't know about blockchain be able to make practical use of the technology in a simple and accessible way? I think it should also be explained how Marlowe's project is, as this is not common knowledge, I myself don't know this case/tool \u200b\u200bso I would have understood better what the proponent meant a little explanation. Finally, the first risk raised is not resolved, and the second is. In general, I think that a proposal fits the system that the challenge calls for, as it would create a verifiable in relation to clinical trial projects that would facilitate the work of health professionals while increasing the use cases of Cardano technologies . Thus, some points here can be better clarified.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This thread has its ups and downs, but in general I think things could have been explained better here. Starting with the script, in the order of the parts that are attached to the proposal: we know how long each activity would take in a matter of weeks, so from the temporality part our understanding is good, as we know what would happen and when. I think one data that could have been included was which month the project would start, so we would have an understanding of when in the year it would be each week, for example week 1 and 2 would be in the second half in September, then week 3 and 4 in October\u2026 Therefore, the ideal, regarding the temporal division, was that we were given some dates to be followed - this way we would better situate ourselves on which stages we would be in at a given time of the year. The level of detail of the activities could also be explored a little more, for example in week 8 and 9 there would be revisions of the results \u201cof the results of the main features and implementation of additional functional features\u201d. Who would do these reviews? How would the analyzes and tests be done? How would the \u201cPlatform Code and Audit, Speed \u200b\u200band Precision + Smart Contract\u201d audits be performed? How would the design be developed? It would need to be better explained how the usability of this tool would take place, it is not very clear how this relationship between healthcare personnel and blockchain technology would take place. Moving on to the other topic of analysis, the total time of activities would result in 1007 hours, and the money set aside for this would be $65,455. This large portion of the total amount, approximately, would need to be better divided and explained. Could it be that the division we should do is: the amount of money by the total amount of hours, to know the amount charged per hour? Doing this math I arrived at the approximate result of 94 dollars per hour of work, which makes sense. However, we do not know if the same price would be paid for, for example, the development of smart contracts, as would be paid for the design work, the review of results, audits, changes that were necessary in each of the project and so on. More explanations would be needed so that we could actually understand how the payment for each activity would be, how much each professional would earn, etc. The other two costs that are presented are: \u201cother\u201d (1545 dollars) and hardware (7000 dollars). In relation to \u201cothers\u201d: what could they be? Was it a reserve for unforeseen expenses? How would that money be used if nothing unplanned happened, nothing unplanned needed to be paid? Finally, when we analyze the team, I think this part is more or less, because the level of detail about each member of the team is not very extensive (for example, about Neville, we know that he works for \u201cthirty-five years of experience in executive management, business development, finance and sales, with technology and business start-ups and non-profit organizations\u201d). It would be positive if more details were passed, for example which startups he has worked with and etc. It would be appropriate for all members to have attached their linkedin profiles so that we have a way to verify all the information set out here. As much as in the relevant experience part they said that \u201cour team spent some time learning the Atala, PRISM and Plutus code modules\u201d, how can we prove these learnings? How can we better understand what they studied and how can we be sure that they are prepared to successfully develop this project, given that it is so complex? It would be positive if, by the time this team launched this proposal, they already had more experience with Cardano and its technologies. I think we still have a lot to improve in terms of feasibility, more that we have some good parts in this topic as well.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Auditability of progress is good, but not ideal. And the success story needs improvement. Speaking of progress, the proponent states that a \u201cMonthly Review of all parts of the development and changes associated with the development\u201d would be carried out. But it is not clear any way in which we could evaluate the execution of the activities mentioned in the script. We have a good temporal notion of how long each one would take to be carried out, but it is not possible to understand in detail how they would be carried out (because we have superficial information about each one, each action is not detailed in detail). It would be necessary for the proponent to establish a way for us to monitor the development process of the project itself, what was being developed, when, how, by whom... it would be positive too, if in addition to the activities themselves, we knew a little more about deliverables, that is, what would also have to be built (the project deliverables, which would be commented on in the weekly summaries). In other words, two things could be improved here: 1) both the level of detail of the activities, so that we could carry out a more solid and accurate monitoring; 2) it would be important for the proponent to make it clear where these reports would be made available. However, it is positive that he is already aware of the need for such follow-ups, as this is often not thought of by the proponents. The KPIs that are plotted, apart from reports on deliverables and development review, are quite important \u201cWeekly Test Reports + Core and Extended Feature Review at 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% completion intervals + Template Functional Smart Contract for Clinical Trials\u201d. It is very positive that we have a more focused study when such percentages of development are reached. So about this part of the proposal, we have a favorable general scenario, and just a few points to be improved. Already about success a lot has to be improved as all we have definition is \u201cSuccess will be the ability to launch a web application allowing users to build their own smart health contracts and add them to their wallets for execution\u201d . Two things need to be very clear and tangible for the Cardano community. The first would be how this technology would be a differential in the routine of health professionals, in practice. It would be necessary for some professionals in this area to provide feedback on whether they would be able to use the technology and what benefits would be observed in their daily work. And the second thing is for us to understand what were the benefits of all this for Cardano, if (and how) the project would have achieved the goals of the challenge and helped our blockchain and become more popular and respected, if direct gains like + community members, + NFTs minted in our network, + Ada in circulation would have been observed and etc. And again, the proponent should make it clear how all of this could be understood and presented to our community (perhaps through an exhibition in Townhall?). For these reasons, the topic is good, but not perfect.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 395, "q0": "BioDao presents the Inukshuk clinical smart contracts proposal that outlines the creation of a no-code framework for smart contracts used in clinical health research groups.

Most of the items in this list require further explanation to fully understand the intent from the proposers.

The plan is good in its structure, an improvement could be to structure it in a more readable way but no points will be deducted in this regard.\nThe main issue is primarily the budget, it lists 3 lines of expenses with no more information available. This leaves the reader with plenty of questions, what are the misc and hardware posts for example? This should be refined to increase the credibility of the proposal. Furthermore, do all team members have the same hourly wage? (Even if it's derivable by manual calculations, this should be stated explicitly in the proposal as well).\nIn conclusion, the proposal is feasible in some aspects but has another set of aspects that questions the feasibility.

That is indeed a new product for the community so i see how this proposal addresses the challenge under whose category falls under. Being also a no-code framework will make it easy to use templates to create an health identity, similar to the no-code model defined in the Marlowe Smart contract application for finance.

There is a well formed team, with experienced people in it, and a description of their skills is available. However, what is not available is some links (e.g Linkedin profiles or even Github accounts) to provide proof of that huge previous experience of theirs. That is something vital to be sure about the proposal being implemented successfully.

", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is a roadmap with milestones in it and that will seem useful when considering the success of the proposal. Now when talking about the tracking of the progress, there are some audibable parameters, very useful in my opinion, as they refer to weekly Summary repots of Project Deliverables, monthly review of all parts of the development so that the necessary changes are made, testing Reports weekly. I would like to ask two things in that direction. First of all, all those parameters are going to be public on your website for example or somewhere else? The other thing is that the developement of smart contracts needs auditing to be sure it is safe to be implemented, and in our use case, the medical records of the participants of the clinical trials remain safe. You might want to consider that as well. Now, when it comes to the key metrics of the proposal, there are none. Releasing a web app is not a metric actually. There must be some key metrics in order to measure the sucess of the proposal.
