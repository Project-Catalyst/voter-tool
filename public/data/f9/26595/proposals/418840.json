It divides people's beliefs about the economic and social interests of a person or organization. While we must protect freedom of expression, ordinary people find it difficult to identify information given by knowledgeable, trustworthy people, especially when everyone claims to be themselves. This proposal wants to provide a platform called JulianX, through which it will help weed out fake news content through identity/credential verification and \"trust\" score. JulianX will use a blockchain-based identity verification platform to accomplish this goal. A person's identity will be linked to a \"Trust Score Mechanism\", where users will be able to gain trust from the community based on past performance. Over time, users will be able to gauge the accuracy of the content they're viewing by the ability to look at both the user's and the content's trust scores. The content can then be monetized/licensed using smart contacts. There is clarity in the description of the problem and solution presented, and the proposal perfectly matches the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the proposal is relative. The author explains the roadmap and budget usage with the attached images. We know how long the whole project will take and what to expect each month. The related activities are listed and we know well what to expect in each subsequent month, and it is also very well marked with important milestones. Following the requested budget of $118,800, we were able to clearly understand what the requested funds would be used for. In my opinion, most of the budget is used for salary purposes. We also know what jobs will be performed, how many hours, and the corresponding hourly rate. It would be better if the proposal provided more information about which experts would do the work, or how many specialists would be behind each task. Finally, regarding the project team, the team provided the five members behind the project: Phil Grech, Julio Medeiros, Clearence Wissar, Joel Denning, and Nicholas Stanley. We also know their field of activity and experience, so it would be better to suggest specifying the role of each member or provide their link so that we can verify their qualifications An easier way. One point for us to appreciate the feasibility of this project is that the website https://julianx.io/#timeline is presented quite professionally. Here, we have some more information to be able to believe in the feasibility of the project. Therefore, I agree with the feasibility of this project with a score of 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal does not provide KPIs, but the success of the project is very clearly described, which are:\n-CX / Design\n-A proof of concept app built\n-Defined smart contract licensing model\n-Defined enterprise-grade solution architecture\n-Partner with distributed file sharing solution\nBesides, the community can easily track the progress of the project based on the author's reports in a sprint cycle every 2 weeks. That means every 2 weeks, the project's results will be featured on Youtube channels or social media like Reddit, Discord, and Twitter. Therefore, I think the suitability of the proposal is good but it would be great if it could provide some KPIs to the community.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2299", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 3, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5484, "q0": "The consequences of the plan are extensive. In the current era of digital media, this may have a huge influence on how people read stories on any NEWS. It's intriguing to even fathom the potential of a platform that provides constant information, news, and updates covering all social and economic events and is completely reliable. Because of the growing need for current and quick information, a platform with access to that information is now more essential than ever. The criteria of the challenge, such as growing Cardano usage, and outreach, are excellently captured by this solution. The author also has plans in place to lessen any risks that were identified during the first background study. It is important to recognize the enormous amount of prior research that has been completed. The writers appear to have taken care of the content-generating aspect by including the incentive system, and without government action, users would be allowed to exercise their right to free speech without restriction. As a result, the authors must carefully assess the legitimacy of the data.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "A clear strategy with attainable objectives is given to the readers at regular intervals. The proposer has provided a fairly concise proposal that, while taking into account every condition of the challenge, appears promising to any reader. The infographics used to demonstrate the chronology of their product also indicate that a significant amount of work has already been completed. The pre-funding work is already underway, which helps to increase the feasibility metrics by a few points. The required monies are also extremely fair and appear to be essential for launching the MVP. The introduction of the team was masterful, and it provides a range of skills to the ecosystem. Additionally, it appears that the team is aware of the outside assistance that is currently available in the form of content creators to support them in their endeavor, demonstrating their enthusiasm and resolve to make this an exciting experience. The effective portion of the proposal contains the majority of the proposal's plans, and the author spares the readers from tedious repetition.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Even if the project is fantastic, the quantifiable KPIs make it more interesting. The measurable indicators are precise, to the point, and closely align with the main demands of the campaign. Monthly live demos on YouTube allow the community to follow along with the project, and proposers may gradually acquire accustomed to the tool if they intend to utilize it in their own proposals. For the auditors' auditing requirements, Jira updates per two-week sprints would be adequate. The team promises to regularly update the community on development via their Twitter, Reddit, and discord channels, which will undoubtedly offer the openness needed to track the team's progress. The proposal's overall conclusion is summarised by the combination of the proof-of-concept app and the smart contract licensing mechanism. However, I believe the author might have done a better job of describing how the idea would succeed, likely the type of impact the project would have, the number of content projected to be released, and the likely volume of customers. Therefore, with the exception of the flimsy success definition, the offered KPIs are sufficient and suitable for simple monitoring of the installation and overall performance.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2704", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5895, "q0": "This suggestion is very helpful. Although it seems simple, the impact it brings is not small. It will create a platform that allows fake news content to be dropped through identity/credential verification and a \"trust\" score.

From there, it will create a level playing field where content producers will be financially rewarded for honest and accurate content.

Each of them has their own forte, they take on their own jobs, thereby combining to form a strong team. As you know, having a strong team will increase people's confidence in this project, making the project can be done easily. Also, I can only find the link to the team linkedin profile when I visit your website (https://julianx.io). I think you should provide those links in the FEASIBILITY section, that will make it easier for people to follow and make the above information more transparent. \nThe solution is described very specifically and in detail. It helps people have an overview of the project. Besides, you have identified the risks, challenges and ways to mitigate it. This will be the basis for the project to develop sustainably in the long run. Detailed roadmaps and budget allocations are also provided. You've identified the tasks that need to be done and allotted them to specific timelines. That will help the project to develop in accordance with the original goals and orientation. Thanks to a detailed roadmap, budget allocation is easier than ever. The budget is calculated by you clearly and transparently by defining the work, the number of hours worked, the amount per hour. However, the roadmap and budget are provided in the form of images, which can be an obstacle for PAs using phones and devices with poor resolution.

However, those things are completely acceptable and sympathetic. This is a very useful project, although it sounds simple, the positive impact it brings is not small.

Disrupting Fake News helps to increase the credibility of the platforms thus giving trust to users, so I consider this issue to be a perfect fit for the challenge of Dapps, Products & Integrations which is to bring about effective use for the Cardano ecosystem to help drive more users.\nThe product of this proposal is to create a platform named \"JulianX\", which helps eliminate fake news content through identity/credential verification and \"trust\" scores. Users are all users on the social network including content producers, given a \"trust score\", it is considered as their personal Brand.\nThis project contributes to reducing fake news on platforms affiliated with JulianX, but getting a large community of hundreds of millions of social network users to use it is a long process. If successful, the scope of this project in my opinion will be global, as all governments and people want to access the flow of real news and do not want to become a victim of fake news. .\nI think this proposal can have external revenue, from users and from advertising if the platform attracts many users and issues tokens.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "the solutions to address the issue is quite convincing. The user must be a verified individual to make sure it's not a Bot. \"Trust score\" is performed based on community feedback when information content is posted. Regarding technology, I think this is not a difficult process and completely doable, but they have not yet said specifically how to conduct user verification, because some common verification methods can still be used today. Fake bot to verify, the team needs to provide more specific how to do this verification.\nThe proposed team consists of 5 members of which Phil Grech is a leader with a strong focus on CX and solution architecture. This team is capable of performing the proposed task\nIn terms of implementation time, the team has given a very clear and specific timeline and work contents that can be implemented in practice.\nIn terms of a suggested budget of $118,800 for 2720 working hours ($40/hour) and some other marketing-related expenses, I find this budget to be reasonable.\nThe risk of this project is given as medium, and can be overcome.

A platform called JulianX would enable integration throughout the world of the Cardano blockchain, perhaps not even knowing you are using Cardano if done well enough.
