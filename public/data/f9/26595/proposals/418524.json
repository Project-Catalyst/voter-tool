The proposal includes a user story based on the agri-food sector. \nThe problem is well identified, and the value addition for the Cardano blockchain is described. However, as this project is at the idea stage (\"implementing a smart contract that records exchanges on a public blockchain\"), there is still a long way to go, starting with a more detailed description of the business model. For this reason, the ability to scale for future challenges is uncertain.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The 3 team members have strong experience in areas related to the project: commodity trading industry, finance, data science. Some skills are lacking in the team to give confidence in the continuation of the construction of the project. I am thinking, for example, of the legal aspects related to dealing with commercially sensitive data, but also of backend/frontend/UI/UX development skills.\nA team of blockchain engineers is mentioned, but the author does not provide evidence of the presence of these skills in the team or of past achievements.\nThe risk analysis is basic and shows overall that the project is still at the concept stage. For example \"We have to evolve our platform and smart contract step-by-step to see what information should be recorded and what should not, and this will depend on each product and market.\". This deserves to be detailed as this risk is significant: in many cases, most useful information is commercially sensitive information that cannot be recorded on a public blockchain.\nA business plan is provided as an image file, but we cannot open it from the proposale. Annual salaries are listed (120kUSD for CEO), but this is not a budget breadown. At this stage of the development of the project, it appears that the team does not manage to give a detailed vision of the budget splited into identified items. \nThe requested budget of 2MUSD is particularly high compared to the level of confidence that the project gives in its ability to achieve what it promises. My recommendation to the team for a future application is to separate the project into several stages and apply for Catalyst funding for these intermediate stages.\nI disagree the project is feasible and see many uncertainties in the plans or budget supplied.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The detailed plan includes very generic monthly milestones, over 6 months (nothing in octobrer). For exemple, one of the september milestone is \"smartcontract\". Considering the work that is to be done, and that details are lacking on how this will be achieved, I think it this plan will very unlikely be led on schedule.\nBeyond the very macroscopic planning, the team does not offer any means to the community to monitor the progress of the project, which is a real problem for such a level of funding.\nThe indicators listed are performance indicators that can only be assessed when the project is finalized, which is insufficient.\nFor a future application, I recommend that the team provide more detail on how the project progress reports will be produced: by whom, how often, and on what public communication channel?\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_2264", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3784, "q0": "The proposal is addressing and trying to resolve a real issue in commodity industry and market. It is a well-known situation now that farmers and producers in developing countries in Latin America, Southeast Asia, or Africa get the least benefit and value from this gigantic supply chain and market with astronomical value. Most of margins and profits enjoyed by the middlemen who often are large corporations. This is not sustainable in the long run since the farmers and producers\u2019 livelihood are not improving much and this discourage their posterities to continue the works and business. This will make supplies dwindling due to less producers, on top of uncertainties and risks such as pest and weather that can cancel their harvest partially or totally, and ultimately driving the price of commodities up thus hurting the end-consumers.\n\nIn order to solve above issue, the proposer is trying to decentralize the information and balancing the value distribution for stakeholders involved a commodity market. The solution is to reduce or eliminate the middlemen and replace them with Quideos smart contract which will facilitate transactions, record exchanges on Cardano and execute these commodities trade in a transparent, traceable, fair, efficient, effective, and sustainable way. The transactions will accrue fees that support the operation of the platform.\n\nAbove being outlined, I must respectfully say that the proposer needs to improve the writing of this proposal to convey more ideas on how their product/dApp will have positive impact on Cardano ecosystem. All the KPI mentioned also only mentioning the success of the platform/dApp but fail to translate them into the greater benefit for Cardano community. To summarize myself, I like the idea very much that it is impactful to the real world and utilizing blockchain technological advantages, however the execution is still vague and missing key points due to the crudeness of the proposal, maybe because it is still being written roughly. My advice to the proposer is to join incubator or launchpad programs in Cardano to familiarize themselves with the ecosystem (especially in Catalyst) and community while gaining more diverse and deeper understanding of Cardano technology stack. There are many facilitators such as Genius X, Astarter, Cardashift, Kick.io, OccamRazer, CardStarter, etc. where they can grow their team and develop the idea.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "To know further and verify, you must google team members\u2019 names first and go to their respective LinkedIn pages. They are great and legit by the way. There are mix of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence skills and experience to support the fundamentals of blockchain the proposer has. The three founders have lengthy track records in commodity markets which is crucial in the implementation of this proposal. There is a rough implementation plan that could serve as timeline with some outlined milestones.\u00ac There are also some addressing to the risks but not sure if all of them relevant to the implementation of this proposal.  \nAgain, with all due respect I must point out some critical flaw in this proposal. I am sorry to say but budget is the weakest point of this proposal. It asked too much for a first timer with no proven track record in Cardano ecosystem or community. USD 2,000,000 is about 25% of the total challenge fund of USD 7,850,000 which will put Catalyst treasury in a lot of risk if this proposal got funded, not to mention lost opportunity costs in case of under or non-delivery. The good practice is to ask for series of smaller funds and build accomplishments and reputations from there going forward into the next catalyst funds. Also, the blockchain developer rate of USD 36,000 (hourly rate of USD 17) is probably too cheap to find a decently skilled and experienced one. I am also not sure why the business plan is represented with just a single discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. The proposer needs to know that the purpose of Catalyst is not to just donate or grant money for any business. We in Catalyst has important missions and one of them is to improve the growth and adoption of Cardano blockchain.\n\nI strongly suggest proposer to familiarize himself further with Cardano through Catalyst. Activities like attending Town Hall and being active in discussions in Discord or Telegram will help with visibility of the proposer. They can consult or got mentored in Catalyst School or Swarm sessions to improve and refine this idea and proposal. By spending some time in diverse Cardano communities, they can learn about few things to improve the model of their smart contract idea such as tokenization of the commodities, incentivization for utilizing and supporting the platform, tokenomics to distribute and deliver value to stakeholders, and the most important for now: writing a great proposal in Catalyst.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Proposal provides roadmap with key milestones and time horizon for deliverables, but it is still not quite refined and lacking few things substantial that can be detailed and further described. Rational KPI and metrics are there to quantify the success of the proposed project but the proposer has not made a fine effort in explaining the success of his company translating to the success of Cardano community in general.\n\nI can see the GitHub of proposer but his repos on blockchain and smart contracts are all in JavaScript and Solidity. Although there are some SDKs , APIs, and layer 2 solutions for those, I cannot imagine someone who has no knowledge in Haskell building a meaningful and functioning applications or smart contracts in Cardano. Also, it is preferred that the proposers attach the link/URLs of their LinkedIn so community can verify them easier. The website can be better, and I believe it will be since the company just founded this year. The same can be said for the whitepaper, it can be honed as well.\n\nThe saddest thing from this proposal is it does not mention word \u201cCardano\u201d or \u201cCatalyst\u201d even only for once in its writing. I will conclude this assessment by repeating myself that while the idea is great, there are still a lot of rooms for substantial improvement necessary to refine this proposal into a somewhat acceptable standard. I will end this one on a positive note that the good news is Cardano is a very open and welcoming community especially to those who wanting to learn and build with the ecosystem. Please do not hesitate to reach us and I am sure the proposer will not be disappointed discovering himself to be here. I promise many members of Cardano is eager and happy to assist in realizing good ideas for the equality and betterment of humanity.
