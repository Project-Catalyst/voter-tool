The specific objective of the challenge that is best addressed here is \u201cIntegrations with other existing services, products, and protocols that improve the end-user experience whether that's giving the user more options or making something easier to use that benefits the wider ecosystem\u201d. I say this because the idea would use things that already exist, such as the process of proposing in Catalyst, understanding how Cardano's basic things work, the marketplace also already exists; overall it would be a continuation and continual improvement of parts of our ecosystem, which integrated will improve the user experience. The problem raised by the proponents is that \u201cCatalyzing is difficult, generating a good proposal, having it ranked and voted on can be a very scary challenge, generating frustration, good people leave the community and great ideas go unnoticed\u201d. And that's why they founded the Proposal Mentors Marketplace: it's very positive that the project has already been financed and the first steps are already completed, which demonstrates a lot of involvement of the authors with the idea, in addition to already having experience in relation to what should Be done. In summary what would be done here is \u201cadd a system and methods to facilitate the funded proposal, planning, team building, design and execution of the strategy, allowing funded proposers to find help among qualified members of the Cardano community who are willing to to guide projects and proposers\u201d. With this, it is intended that the proposals created are of high quality so that they have the maximum chance of being funded. This directly contributed to Cardano's expansion (as stated here, to the long-term goal of reaching 1 billion people with our blockchain technologies and opportunities). As more bidders are better oriented and create high-value proposals, this can provide the opportunity for relevant and super beneficial projects to happen, such as the construction of new dApps that will make Cardano's various technologies increasingly adopted, the number of of transactions on our network, of NFTs minted, of Ada being bought, sold, delegated and so on. The proponents make it very clear how they will continue and improve the marketplace, for example in the sections \u201cIncorporate new possibilities for the formalization of agreements between participants, allowing for more details to be registered and even to attach a portfolio for payments\u201d and \u201cProduce a report section , with key performance metrics and statistics aimed at all parties to understand their efforts, their results and overall KPIs to further improve their goal.\u201d They also define some risks that may be faced, and already provide solutions to these potential problems. It seems to me to be a very important proposal, because even though we have other groups (such as the Catalyst School) that teach people the basics of our catalytic process, it is important to have a project focused on proponents, since they are such fundamental pieces for the our ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is super viable, so the analyzes I'm going to do contain some suggestions, but in general it's very possible that this project will be put into practice successfully. The roadmap provided is adequate and satisfactory, as we know what will happen each week of the project development (and this is rare, generally the proposals work with longer time intervals - the shorter the time interval, the greater the degree of specificity , we know what will happen when and this is positive). My only suggestion, so that we could better understand the development process here, would be for each activity to be more detailed. The explanations about what would happen each week are very brief, if there was a little more detail about these actions, our visualization of this part of the proposal would be even more solid. For example, in the first week the team that would work here would be defined - from what I understand, who we are sure will participate in this project are the proponents, the other partners will still be defined (for example, in the team presentation part it is said that the project would have a partnership with the trio of professionals Cardano AIM - who developed some very important tools for our community. But within these 3 professionals we don't know who will join the team of this proposal, I believe that this kind of thing will be defined in the first week). So how would these selections be made? Based on availability of professionals? It would be interesting to understand the process of defining the team. I would also like to have more details about the new design that would be formed here, what would be the characteristics of the user experience, how the reports that are mentioned here would be built, by whom and in what way\u2026 Anyway, we have more information about each part. But this would improve what is already good, because our degree of understanding of the whole is indeed adequate. Speaking of cost sharing, the asking price is well matched to the proportion and complexity of the project. Most of it goes to the developers' salary, who would charge $4,000 a month. I believe that the requested values \u200b\u200bare compatible with the market, but two things could have been clarified better: how many weekly hours the professionals involved would dedicate to the project (the value of the work hour) + in the infrastructure costs part and other platforms , it would be positive if the proponents had already defined what other platforms these would be. Finally, in terms of the team, the project is in great hands, a lot of confidence is passed on to those involved as they have a very rich background with Cardano. For example, Alex is active in building the LATAM community, in addition to being a veteran evaluator; Phil is founder of Cardano AIM; Yoram is part of the Cardano4Climate group\u2026 They are very active people within our community, but in addition to knowing how they relate to our ecosystem, we know their training and a little about their professional paths. In this way, total confidence in the team is conveyed.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This topic is fine, but not perfect, like the previous ones; we know several metrics by which we could assess whether the proposal was being successful, such as the number of: mentors actively on the platform, proposals integrated through the platform, contracts registered on the platform, etc.; in addition to the \u201cquality of guided proposals, evaluated by the ACs, after mentoring through the platform\u201d. Proposers tell us what their goals are in numerical terms for each of these KPIs. I believe that in addition to knowing about the partial successes, it would be important to understand how the activities of the script would be being developed, as we know what would have to happen weekly, it is much easier to carry out this monitoring. My suggestion is that at the end of each month, one of the proponents prepare a report informing what progress has been made in terms of work routine, if everything that was planned was followed, what were the successes of the month and the challenges faced, if what was planned to be worked on each week it was done and etc. It would be necessary to maintain this bridge with our community, and it is not clear whether this would be done in the explanation of the proposal. Talking about the success scenario, they define what they want as \u201cbeing able to present the PMM as a key platform for the Catalyst community, raising awareness of Mentoring and Collaboration as key factors to produce better proposals, with greater chances of being voted on, and carry out their promises and become successful projects\u201d. In general, guide future bidders and that their bids are the best possible. I believe it would be important to keep in touch, after the 3-month period of the project, with those who were oriented. It would be positive if we had links to the proposals on ideascale, if we could know if they were financed, and how the practical execution of their proposals would be carried out, what benefits and advances their projects have brought to Cardano\u2026 Have the specific objectives of the challenge been addressed , after all? I would like the proponents to make an analysis in relation to aspects such as how many people were attracted to the community from these projects, which dApss were created and in what way they act, that is, what are they about; if these proposals were also important to make Cardano more popular in different locations, more accessible to a diverse audience\u2026 In my view, they were a little lacking in demonstrating their intention to carry out this long-term follow-up, let's say, it doesn't have to be done with everyone the proponents (as that would be a lot of work), but a list could be made of which projects were guided/which proposals were launched from this mentorship, and some could be selected to be demonstrated, brought as examples to our community. In my view this fits best in video format, whether it's a video recorded for youtube or participation in some room after Townhall (which could also be made available on youtube, to increase the reach of views even more). That said, the proposal is auditable, but some small improvements could be made.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3480, "q0": "The scope of this idea is to develop a MVP for new features to the Proposals Mentors Marketplace, started in F6, which will help to solve extra issues on the so called Catalyst proposal life cycle. A a catalyst active member since F7, these issues seem to be correctly identified and the solution presented does seem to solve it, by connecting in a strucutred manner the proposers and mentors/advisors, following a market place model. This market place alignes well with challenge, as it delivers a new product that may drive integration within Cardano, among its members, and is one of the types of proposal pointed out in challenge description (Marketplaces).\nProposal also does a great job on explaining what values these new features will add the the platform and its stakeholders. Its also nice that MVP are done first, before launching, so it can be validated by community. An agile framework can certainly help on this, if adopted.\nRisk management part is also well articulated and in includes one of the main challenges for projects like this, that involves a newp roduct being delivered to the community: the communication. To address issues on possible low adoption, a proper \"marketing\" strategy is ellaborated, which is key for its success.\nIn conclusion, it is a very much valid idea to solve a problem faced by many in Catalyst, addressing wel lthe challenge and coherently hereby explained.

The 3 members of the team have a lot of experience in Cardano and already developed part of this marketplace in past funds.

It helps that the proposal has included specific timeframes in the roadmap. This helps lead to the second concept. That is the idea of accountability. Once there is a relationship of trust within the team and community, accountability can be implemented to help ensure that the proposal is completed in a timely manner.
