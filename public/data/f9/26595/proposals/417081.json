That is a challenge in itself and requires experience with teaching. \nThe plan is more of an \u201cguesstimation\u201d than a real plan that can be followed if the proposal were to be funded. A suggestion is to refine the plan to list it into phases where the pre-phase consists of learning software. The recording phase is guesstimated to be 2 days, where 9 videos are to be filmed. There is no mention of editing said material, since the plan ends at day 3. The author seems to lack prior experience with recording software/editing, and no time is dedicated to editing the videos. This is a big question mark in the proposal, is it a result of lack of experience of producing videos? Nevertheless it should be addressed in the proposal to avoid confusion. \nThe budget is simple with a spare post of 750 USD \u201cif something goes wrong\u201d, a suggestion is to refine the detailed plan and look up how much time each action will take and then refine the budget to reflect this.

A suggestion would be to set goals for the videos, for example, 100 views for each video by month X, 1000 views by month Y etc. The current proposal is sparse and it's a bit tricky to assess in terms of auditability. Some kind of quality criteria or investigation should be performed to set expectations and estimates to allow for auditing beyond the release of each video. As mentioned, the output of 9 videos are simple, but the quality of the content (how educational the videos are, how many viewers are satisfied with the information provided etc.) is not considered in the proposal.

Just need an idea owner who is knowledgeable about how it works and protocols, can implement this idea, the special thing here is: the creator of this idea and the creator of cardano-tools.io. are the same person, so it's too easy to do a re-presentation of these protocols and compile it into a video for this topic.\n  The risk to this idea is almost minimal. but the proposal does mention that its videos may be confusing for the community. but this is not a problem because there will be feedback from users, but to ensure a great impact on the international community, I think it is recommended to present in my native language and have subtitles in English. of another country, can be inserted into the video, maybe the country the proposal feels has potential and a lot of new developers.

The reason for submitting this proposal is (according to the proposer) to educate people who are new to cardano-tools.io, and the underlying technology of the Cardano blockchain. In my opinion as a recurring PA (since Fund 6), it could be made clearer what the main purpose of creating the video tutorials is. The proposer mentions that there will be 9 videos (for each menu point on the website), but I would have liked to see a clarification or an example as to what areas will be described that can be related outside of the official website. For example, will the video tutorial address what a blockchain is? What does extended UTXO mean? What is a stake pool? The menupionts on the website are currently heavily focused on NFTs, so I\u2019m curious to see examples of what topics the proposer will cover in the videos. There is definitely a case to be made by looking at this perspective: By creating video tutorials ONLY focused on letting people learn about how the website operates, it will provide a good user experience and on-board more people on Cardano when the word spreads. \nFrom what I understand, this is what the proposer means by addressing the challenge but I would have liked to see some included details on what angle the tutorials will have. \u2028\u2028I don\u2019t know how many people are using cardano-tools on a weekly or monthly basis (and in a way this shouldn\u2019t matter), but it could be relevant when trying to estimate the eventual impact it will have on Cardano as a whole. \u2028Overall, I feel like the proposal could\u2019ve included a lot more information related to creating these video tutorials. A sentence or two describing each point in the proposal is very little information to go on. Despite being a relatively small project in comparison to others, it should still be presented thoroughly with as much relevant information as possible, in order to avoid confusion. And if this proposal needs basic understanding of cardano-tools.io to comprehend, I would suggest a paragraph or two about that as well. \u2028The proposer seems to have understanding of the risk of conveying the educational material in the 'wrong' ways, but states he is determined to include feedback from the community (in order to increase the quality of the videos) which is great. \nTo summarize, the information present in this proposal could be added with further details on purpose, focus, relevance to the Cardano ecosystem and process. I disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I\u2019m going to be honest with my personal opinion here. I have no doubts that the proposer is able to produce said tutorials, but I also feel this is not reflected in the proposal, due to the lack of information included. After all, my job as a PA is to assess proposals, so this is what I\u2019ll do. \n\nWe are told in the proposal that the whole process should take roughly 3+ days after being funded. Each day, a budget of 750 USD per day is allocated (for a total of 3000 USD). Coming from a pretty well-off country, I\u2019d say that 750 USD per day is a VERY good salary. My chosen profession is teacher and researcher, during the pandemic I was forced to create digital educational material in a very short notice so I have firsthand experience into that process. It does take a whole lot of work learning recording equipment, writing manuscripts on what to say, etc. So in the end it depends on what the standard salary for similar work would be in the proposers country (which I would have liked to see included in the proposal). Some other suggestions to include in the proposal are clarifications if the budget includes recording equipment etc. Had the timeline and budget breakdown been presented in a different format other than a put together sentence, I believe that the reader of the proposal would take it more seriously. What I\u2019m pointing at here (from my experience as an educator) is that it is imperative to proposals not only to state what you want to do, how you want to do it and why, but also think of what you communicate by presenting that information in certain ways. \n\nThis proposal would also benefit from including a small introduction to cardano-tools.io, since this proposal will be built \u2018upon\u2019 the foundation and understanding of what the website is. \nHaving said that, it is very impressive to have built that website and functionality, which speaks a lot of the expertise and competency of the proposer. I really wish that information could be further verified by some kind of \u2018proof of person\u2019, since I could not find information on the proposer either on the website or within the proposal. Due to the reasons mentioned above, I disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Being connected to stake pools and having an official website are great areas to communicate with the community in. In my experience in the Cardano ecosystem, there might possibly also be discord servers, social media platforms where this communication is happening? Including those would further strengthen the transparency and credibility of this proposal. \u2028I agree with the proposer when stating that the progress will be very easy to track since the plan Is to create 9 videos. What could be of interest into adding upon that is preferably tracking the number of views of these videos on a set timeframe (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, etc). Maybe also try and discern if the inclusion of the tutorials increase the traffic for the official website and all of its functions, and where the proposer means to include feedback from the community. \u2028As stated under \u2018feasibility\u2019, I personally believe in the proposer committing to this project and including the community, but this is still not reflected in the proposal.

I feel that this would be the problem. After looking into the website, it was hard for me to think that currently new users would go to that website to find educational content. There are some questions that should be considered in this section. Will this project have the community to come and see these videos? How will new users find this website?

The roadmap gives details and states that the project would be finished within about 3 days. 1 day doing research and 2 days recording videos. There could be a higher chance of success if these funds would lead to a continual progression of this project. The budget breakdown is very simple, but doesn't make too much sense. This would suggest that the proposer would make around $1000 a day from recording videos. There needs to be a better use-case before coming to Catalyst for funding. It would also be important to include details on the future users of this project. There is not enough information that suggests that people will use this platform.

There needs to be more preparation before this project can be considered for funding. There are some principles that can help explain this justification. The first concept is transparency. There should be a community that follows this project and that is waiting for this project to be successful. Without a community, there is no way that this proposer would be held accountable for this proposal. The second principle is what was mentioned before. Accountability. Without this, it will be very difficult for any progress to be tracked and will be near possible for people to find out that this project even exists. There needs to be a better plan that will help determine the potential success of this proposal. I like that the idea of the proposal is to promote education in the Cardano community.

The problem is that I don\u2019t know how much usage this tool sees and the proposal does not give the numbers to quantify the impacts. Based on some posts I found on Twitter (from the creators Twitter page), it looks like there isn\u2019t massive awareness of this tool to the greater Cardano community. So the creator might not be so great at marketing the tool BUT the low-cost of the proposal suggests a low-risk evaluation of approval.

I\u2019m rather optimistic about this proposal, in theory, but I vote neutrally because I\u2019m not given enough substance to have impacts demonstrated to me to show that it would be worth the cost of the requested funds (which is not a high bar to reach).

This section claims that he will be explaining everything, so I\u2019d like to assume solvency. There just isn\u2019t enough substance here for me to be reasonably certain that effective videos will be produced that are worth the cost. The roadmap isn\u2019t exactly conducive to a quality video production outline. As a content creator myself, I spend a few hours researching and scripting, before another hour of filming, and about two hours of editing. It\u2019s a process, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re shown this process with much reliability. As far as the budget goes, I\u2019m not so sure the ROI on the produced videos would be worth the cost in only 3-4 days of production. In this timeframe I expect MAYBE 5 videos to be produced (even though the proposal states 9), which breaks down to $600 per video. It\u2019ll be $333, if the auditibility goals are met.
