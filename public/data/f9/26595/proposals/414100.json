Today, through using centralized solutions, this population currently has an alternative in the \"mobile money market\". According to the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA), in its latest report, there are 1.35 billion registered mobile money accounts, which account for a total of $1 trillion in annual transactions. This translates into over $2 million worth of transactions per minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Having a success story that leverages the benefits of blockchain in this market could not only be a headliner in the industry, but also be an opportunity for Cardano to attract a new type of user. What is their goal? In its first version, it would be a solution that enables the common citizen to purchase and exchange stable currencies with their biometric data which is stored in a digital identity. Version 2 would include the ability to lend and borrow funds. This is explained in a straightforward and easy to comprehend manner. By comparing it with the objectives of this challenge, I can clearly see the alignment between the two. Despite the long-term nature of the proposal, the impact metrics are simple and appropriate to quantify success.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind this proposal possesses the necessary skills and experience to carry out this project. They are part of teams with prominent projects in the ecosystem such as Liquid, WMT and Ardana. There is an appropriate description of the number of people, and the technical level required to carry out the implementation of the proposal successfully. Budgeting is a bit confusing since it includes all aspects of the MVP construction, which, within it, are described in broad terms, durations, and costs. Although it was structured as it was, it is extremely difficult to analyze if the team's logic to reach the requested amounts is appropriate, since, for instance, the cost of hiring a front-end developer is not the same as hiring a Haskell/Plutus developer. The implementation plan provides very few details. The work packages are described as taking a total of 50 weeks to complete, however, there is no information regarding the delivery date for the MVP. How was the work distribution determined? Are there any dependencies? When submitting a proposal to Project Catalyst, these questions should be addressed to the community.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap was provided in 5 stages. However, it is difficult to evaluate the suitability of it because it does not show a start or end date, and it is not clear whether or not there is a dependency between the work packages. While the budget described exceeds the amount requested (reasons were addressed by the team), there are no indications of which work package will be advanced in the event the budget is allocated, which reduces transparency. I would recommend (in case you are selected or for future funding) that you describe minimally at a high level, time periods (e.g. in months) and accompany them with the deliverables expected. Although timeframes in software development are not expected to be highly precise, they are necessary so that a general assessment can be made of how the team is approaching this issue. Regarding the success metrics presented, I must say that they are simple and relatively easy to measure.

I just have some reservations regarding the scalability of the project beyond the MVP stage as it was not presented in the proposal. If the team could elaborate further on what they think (on a high level) to scale the product across multiple African countries (for example, technical requirements, legal requirements, partnership requirements), it would be very helpful for me to assess the long-term impact of the project.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "While the proposer did very well on the impact criteria, I have yet to see the same caliber for feasibility criteria. First, the budget requested is inconsistent in different parts of the proposal: at the beginning, they requested $250,000, then at the MVP roadmap, it was $500k, and further down the proposal, it was $50,000. Lacking a well-presented roadmap adds to the confusion. The MVP development plan roadmap is very high-level for the large budget ($500,000) requested. I would recommend the team to spend more effort breaking the MVP into details such as system design, acceptance criteria, user stories, wireframe, mock, etc, for the community members to assess the feasibility of the progress. I understand that this is a large scope project, at this initial stage, the team should probably ask for a smaller budget to build a whitepaper and prototype before asking for a big one without many supporting documents (there is a website but with no content). In addition, the risk section should be further considered. Currently, the risk section only has one sentence, which is overly simplified for a project of high budget and large scope. Some other risks you should consider are legal complexity (many African countries have unclear regulatory frameworks for crypto), dispute mechanism beyond community mediator (especially for a large amount of money), partnership challenges (mobile payment app partners, 3rd party KYC partners) and address those risks accordingly.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I disagree that the project is auditable, mostly because it is not clear which phase of the project this particular proposal is addressing.

In that case, it will provide value, provide banking facilities to the unbanked, and onboard the untouched chunk of the population to the Cardano Ecosystem.\n\nThe proposer did mention the three risks he may face in the execution of the proposal, lack of funding, marketing & Atala Prism release delay. But I feel the main risk the proposer will face from the regulatory bodies as the platform involves fiat/crypto swaps and fiat lending. Unfortunately, the proposer did not provide his ideas on how he will tackle the regulatory hurdles.

Since he does not need all the money now, he submitted the same proposal under three Challenges and asked for $350k in total. In this proposal, the proposer requested $250k; in 'DAOs<3 Cardano', he asked for $50k, and in Grow Africa Challenge, he asked for $50k. This makes sense from the point that he does not need all the money here and does not want to take a big chunk of the Challenge allocated amount.

This proposal asks for $250,000 but the budget analysis totals $500,000 and there is no allocation for $250,000.

Personally, this presentation is somewhat confusing. My suggestion is that the team should provide a separate budget analysis for each of the different proposals and only ask for the exact amount of that proposal.

However, there is a need to have a better risk management plan. Instead of just mentioning the challenges, the team can work on how to solve them or minimalize the loss. For example, when it comes to marketing strategy execution, they can figure out what phase in the customer journey they are stucking on, thenceforth trigger proper campaigns.
