It presents a world governance system that in essence replaces the worlds existing financial infrastructure. Later in this Pa review I will discuss the feasibility of this idea but at this moment ill focus on the impact it may have. The proposal appears to be written from the perspective of the proposer vision of the world with a lack of consideration for the wider Cardano community. The idea itself although good hearted fails to set realistic standards that look to help the community. The proposer should consider identifying an issue on a smaller scall and articulate a solution that adds value to the Cardano ecosystem. Identifying issues with the current governance systems in regards to cost to run and possible security issues first would then allow the proposer to then address these issues. At this moment the proposal appears to act to offset the beliefs of the proposer rather then deal with issues of the wider community. A rework of the world\u2019s infrastructure based on one\u2019s beliefs doesn\u2019t act to be impactful for the Cardano community. How this platform will attract new use cases is not detailed an no plans of integration are mentioned. The proposal appears to wish to completely replace current governance systems with no viable plan or explanation how this will be done. Described as a smart contract on the Cardano blockchain the proposer disregards the importance of being on the Cardano blockchain claiming \u2018it doesn\u2019t matter what blockchain the contract is built on\u2019. Considering the challenge looks to attract users to the Cardano blockchain as well as benefit existing users the integration with Cardano ecosystem should be fundamental in the proposal. Proposers could consider the implications of building a large world scale governance system on Cardano and what that exposure on that scale could do for the community. The proposers refer to \u2018linking all the worlds finances to bitcoin\u2019, several issues lie with this statement. Firstly, it\u2019s doesn\u2019t appear viable and secondly it fails to act to benefit the Cardano community. When asked how the solution addresses challenge proposers fail to answer the question. In future a breakdown of what challenge criteria the proposal aims to meet and how it aims to achieve it would be more impactful. The failure to identify risks once again does not provide confidence in the impact this proposal has in regard to meeting challenge objectives. Proposers should identify suitable risks (rejection of proposal by existing governments, Hackers, or malicious entities) and provide suitable mitigations. At this moment the information provided by the proposer does not provide an answer to the question. The proposer claims to not know what team they need, not seeking personal enrichment and being unable to estimate the time and funding required for the project. This alongside the lack of regard for the benefits the proposed project has on the Cardano community suggests that this will have low impact.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "As previously mentioned in the impact section the proposer claims for the amount of work, timing and funding impossible to estimate. Requesting a funding of 1 million dollars without a clear plan and outlook already brings the feasibility into disrepute. A task-by-task plan is provided but based on the previous statement the deadlines and times provided are clearly estimates with the proposer unqualified to judge whether work can be done to these deadlines. Apparently, the deadlines are dependent on the team hired but in the previous section proposers note not quite understanding the team they require, looking to turn towards the community. In future I suggest proposers do prior research into exactly who is required to deliver the project, how much they need to be paid and the hours required for each task. The budget requests 1000,000 dollars for contingencies. This means nothing and raises concerns, detailing what this entails will ensure the funding money is allocated correctly .If proposers require a fund for possible issues detailing what these issues could be could justify why such a large amount of capital is required. At this moment no suitable team is referenced with proposers claiming to look to hire members using recruitment agencies\u2019 proposers fail to mention their own personal qualifications making it impossible to discern whether they are suitable to lead a project of this magnitude. In future noting previous projects they have worked on, and their qualifications would provide proposal assessors confidence in the proposer\u2019s ability to deliver. Based on the fact the proposer claimed not to know exactly what team members they require this does raise concerns once again. The lack of a suitable team doesn\u2019t provide confidence that funding money will be used correctly to provide a product/service/governance platform for the community. This alongside the uncertainty of a return for funding doesn\u2019t suggest a long-term plan has been considered. Returning to the budget, the proposal demands 300,000 dollars for advertisement. If requesting funds of this magnitude proposers should detail how this advertising will be done, who is responsible and what frequency the advertisement plans to be done. Without these details its unreasonable to assume that funds are being correctly assigned and the proposal is feasible. Considering of the amount of fund money requested and the scale of the idea (a complete rework of the world\u2019s financial infrastructure) the information provided does not suggest the team have that capability to bring the project to fruition.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proposers do well to  mention publications of goals and objectives to own site and social media. Detailing what goals and objects would serve beneficial to determining the auditability of the information provided. Proposers should also detail what public channels they plan to post on(twitter/medium) as social media is too broad. As a governance platform the amount of the population onboarded, costs possibly saved, and the volume of transactions would all act as kpis with widespread use being the main target of this proposal. Some viable metrics are given (increase in active address interacting with smart contract) but when describing what success looks like no quantifiable metrics are provided. In future the teams should consider frequency of community updates, and who will be responsible (public relations/marketing expert). Adding quantitative targets (volume reached) would also serve to aid audibility, unfortunately based on the information provided I disagree that the proposal is auditable.

There are no KPI's provided. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposal has several \"rules\" that are practically impossible to implement or impose such as \"\nAll of the world's finances, assets, values, what can be evaluated in monetary terms, we link to Bitcoin (the sum of all the world's money = the number of bitcoins in circulation).\nAny financial transaction is equated in relation to bitcoin and local currency.\"\nThe proposer has not provided evidence that they or the proposing team has the technical ability to execute on this proposal. The proposer has stated \"The risk is that I personally cannot implement this network and do not quite understand what kind of team I need. That is why I turn to a strong community, where there is a lot of experience and qualification. That together we will find the right approach and solution.\" Therefore I do not see what additional value this proposer brings to the challenge. Many in crypto share a similar vision, but funding this proposal will not help to accomplish this vision, and may actually reduce the likelihood of Cardano being able to deliver on this vision, if this is not a productive use of treasury funds. The proposers plan does not include sufficient detail, or explain how this new crypto currency will add any additional functionality to the existing ecosystem of thousands of crypto projects. The timeline provided is not realistic considering there is no team in place to execute this plan. I appreciate this proposers vision and desire to contribute to the space, but this proposal budget is unrealistic for the plan provided. It is essentially asking for funds to hire unknown developers to build a crypto currency that will somehow make the world better, however it is not clear how this crypto currency if created will have any impact, other than to provide funding to the proposer and potential developers. I would encourage the proposer to explain what blago will be able to achieve that Cardano and Ada cannot. Why is this project necessary when Cardano already exists? What value does it add? ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proposer has earned 2 stars for Auditability because they have included some measurable metrics that can be quantified and tracked. However, the following description for auditability is unrealistic with no way to audit in the near term. \"The result of our actions will be the erasure of state borders, the unification of mankind into a single community, the cessation of wars and conflicts, conspiracies and lies on a global scale will come out, poverty and social inequality will disappear.
