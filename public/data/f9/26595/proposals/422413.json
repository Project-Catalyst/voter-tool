It is Lac Viet Online Auction company - the owner of the first SaaS auction platform that is patented and authorized by the government in Vietnam. As we all know, auction is an activity that requires transparency and instant price updates. This is the feature that the cardano blockchain can provide through smartcontract integration. Moreover, their old platform already has a good reputation in the auction market, is recognized by the government, and they also represent to trade a lot of rare government treasures. Therefore, if this project is implemented, it will change people's perception of blockchain applications in practice.

It's a decentralized auction. This application is developed on the Cardano blockchain platform. For me, this proposal is really attractive. It has a pretty big impact on the Cardano ecosystem, where decentralization stands out for everyone. If the proposal is put into practice and has good results, I think it is completely possible to scale up to solve the challenge in the future. But first of all, we all see that the proposal can solve the goal set out in the Challenge. The team also mentioned the fact that so far the auction has existed in a centralized form, without an automatic, transparent, and honest auction service. If developed in a decentralized form, it will become more public, more transparent, and much better for the community of auction participants and auction organizers. So compared to offline auctions, online auctions have advantages and disadvantages. You have stated quite clearly about this advantage and superiority. In my personal opinion, this is a good idea that will come to life. Specifically, bidding actions are performed using smart contracts using the ADA algorithm on the Cardano blockchain platform. Cryptocurrencies are used in the bid deposit. This is considered great progress in the current auction in the world (the current auction market in the world has many problems that need to be solved - especially transparency and honesty). With this proposal, it can solve that problem. I vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Through the proposal, I found that the team consists of members with extensive experience in the field of real estate, business administration, and software development, some members are doctors and leaders of the business. This makes me more confident in the feasibility of the proposal. In particular, all the members reveal their identities via social networks (Linkedin). That also speaks to the transparency of the proposal. In terms of budget, the budget has been broken down by the team into categories and I find it very reasonable for the team to focus on using the budget for the development of the auction platform. The cost is calculated on an hourly basis (I strongly agree), and a variety of related costs: Software development, infrastructure, training, etc... in which marketing costs play an important role. It's important to let the community know about this great auction floor. I am very impressed with the current auction system of the team, the members are most interested in developing an auction system to provide tools for users on the Cardano blockchain platform, implemented on Metaverse. The items applying for funding have been analyzed in detail, mostly, it is the application of advanced technology to create an unprecedented decentralized auction tool in Vietnam. I see now that the auction tool system in society is at a general level, with no specific development. But I believe that if the fund is granted, the situation will be much more concretized. Therefore, in terms of practical application, I think this proposal will be brought to life when given enough time. The plan and implementation method have been outlined quite specifically by the team. However, I have a question, is the team planning to issue tokens for this project? My advice is that you should issue tokens with the condition that the management is open and transparent. Because the token helps the community know more about the project and then they participate more in the project. Also, I have a question to clarify a bit more, do you know if there is a decentralized auction in addition to this project? I believe it is true to what you say, this is the world's first bidding model and has a lot of impact on the government. I think your project is of great significance in pioneering the construction of a decentralized auction platform at least on a national scale. Its pioneering nature will help it attract more and more community interest in online auctions. But I would like to note the legal issue, which is that the auctioneer must be licensed and have their license to practice, surely you know this well? You've built a government-authorized auction platform initially, which is great. On the technical side, I acknowledge you have used very new technology related to blockchain 3.0 Cardano, do - very good, very creative. But whether it still exists a technological barrier because it forces auction participants to perform technology-related operations. For example, creating a wallet, manipulating real money to buy ADA... are these suitable for the actual environment of a developing country in Vietnam with the people's intellectual level? This is also related to the risk when applying the proposal in practice, that is, for older people, technology and manipulation of online auctions is a difficult thing for them. It is only convenient for young people to participate in online auctions. To overcome this, I think that you must build a communication system, especially the communication on the user manual, which is very detailed and clear so that everyone can easily use it. . I would like to mention another reason that is the legality when implementing the project, have the authorities and agencies allowed the project to be implemented or not? What do you guys have to prove its legitimacy? Although the team has already covered the proposal, I would still like to get further clarification from you. However, I always believe that this project will soon be licensed for implementation because it brings great benefits to society, especially to the product auction industry. Recently, some of my comments have been added. In summary, at the moment I appreciate the feasibility of the proposal and completely agree. I vote 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "A clear roadmap and milestones are what I see in the proposal. I'm interested in the product development stages - very clear. The numbers on promoting Cardano adoption say that the team is very focused on developing the Cardano blockchain ecosystem, thereby scaling the use of cryptocurrency through the decentralized auction application. This greatly helps in proving auditability and transparency. It benefits the Cardano blockchain society and community. KPI criteria have been listed for each period and milestone. Along with that are the criteria for evaluating the success of the proposal. I am especially impressed with this, the team company did it very well. It helps the community and PA to evaluate auditability easily and publicly. From start to finish and recommendations. The problems were described in a very clear and easy-to-understand manner and there were solutions to solve them. This is something that not all proposals can do well. I hope all proposals from Vietnam will do as well as the team's suggestions. However, I have more questions to contribute to transparency. The question is related to the auction tool (an important factor in online auctions): Is the auction tool censored and appraised to determine the input quality of the products be auctioned? In my opinion, the team should pay attention and clarify the steps related to this question so that the community has more confidence that the proposal is full of transparency and auditability.

Expenses are also given and allocated appropriately. The project team has also foreseen the risks and preventive measures. The fact that the founding team has people with a background in traditional business and auction, I believe that the project will attract both sellers and buyers to participate in the auction on the blockchain platform. However, it takes a lot of time for users to switch from a traditional auction to a blockchain platform, especially for those who have no knowledge of blockchain & crypto. Moreover, in order to conduct auctions on the blockchain platform, auction participants need to convert from fiat to crypto and vice versa. This will be a huge barrier for many participants.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditing is an essential part of determining the success of a project. The proposal has provided a relatively detailed and complete set of KPIs for each phase, both in terms of product development and Cardano adoption.

However, this is a completely new project, there have not been any successful initial trials. I suggest that the project should trial an auction on the Cardano platform first by their product first.

The first is that there is no automated, transparent and honest Auction service to proactively find the correct bid winner for an auction. The 2nd is \"Nobody accepts crypto-currencies deposit\". The scale of the impact is relatively large. Auctions are an important industry in the global economy. The online auction market is growing rapidly. However, there are still many limitations on transparency, there is still a lot of fraud, and it is purely centralized. Technology is increasingly developing, decentralization is what we want to aim for. Blockchain technology in particular has an impact on many industries. The auction industry cannot be ignored. The two main obstacles to the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies are the absence of an environment that allows the use of cryptocurrencies in real life and the complexity of using cryptocurrencies.\nThe proposed solution has solved the above 2 problems. The reasoning method is clear and reasonable. The solution here is to integrate the Cardano blockchain into a centralized online auction (dMAH) platform. The platform will be completely decentralized and accept payments in cryptocurrencies (ADA and stablecoins) through a licensed auction house (Lac Viet Auction House). The author describes the solution in great detail, uses drawings to describe the system structure and modules, and provides auction video tutorials for easy visualization. The author has presented a logical layout and a strong argument. Give examples and include links. This solution will impact the auction industry, users, the Cardano ecosystem and the Vietnamese government.\nThis proposal responded to the \"Dapps, Products & Integrations\" challenge as it created a platform (dMAH) on Cardano, attracting more users and keeping users longer in the Cardano ecosystem.\nThe author has mentioned many risks that may be encountered in the implementation process in 3 issues: legal, development stage and Marketing & Delivery phase.

Bringing the traditional form of the auction to the Decentralized platform with transparency by using smart contracts and not publicizing the auctioneer. The coherence of the project comes from clearly solving each problem of the traditional auction: First, there is no transparency, then there is the barrier of technology as well as the difference between the project with other auction projects. Another price point is paying attention to customer experience. Agreeing on UI UX in this project is very important because if the website, as well as the platform, is not good enough users will hesitate in receiving it. If this project is successful, it will solve that problem well, especially for those who are new to the blockchain as well as Cardano, which proves the ability to understand user insights as well as the thoroughness and professionalism of those who do project.\nIf this project is successful, it will certainly attract many new people, businesses as well as individuals to participate.

The idea is not really in line with the challenge setting, auction is a form of transaction through a third party (auction house) that detracts from the \"decentralization\" affecting Cardano's goal. The solution is to place the decentralized Metaverse Auction House (dMAH) operational connection platform between licensed auction houses. The author argues that the solution offers to attract users to Cardano and has an impact on them. However, the fact that participants who want to auction assets will have to buy cryptocurrencies to pay for the assets is difficult to do, on the contrary, they may not participate in the auction because of concerns about the legal issues of cryptocurrencies in Vietnam. Clauses 6 and 7 of the Government's Decree No. 101/2012/ND-CP of November 22, 2012 on non-cash (https://luatvietnam.vn/tai-chinh/nghi-dinh-80-2016-nd-cp-chinh-phu-106671-d1.html) payments when purchasing assets in cryptocurrencies are not legal. The author made the establishment of Novatic Singapore Pte (NSP) in Singapore to issue utility tokens in the form of B2E and receive a tender deposit. The NSP is the third organization to hold the auction participants' money. The activities of depositing auction money and registering to buy auction dossiers all have state-regulated taxes to pay, these taxes will be declared based on cryptocurrencies are not valid, I would like the author to have a solution to this tax.

It is not legal to use cryptocurrencies to trade in Vietnam, when holding an online auction, is this registered with the local authorities?

I suggest that it should be optional and users will choose between ADA and B2E tokens to receive as rewards; (3) The proposal has not mentioned about the KYC procedures before auctions which is very important to avoid any financial risks.

The proposer has the idea of integrating Cardano blockchain into current centralized online auction platform, Lac Viet Online Auction - the no.1 Vietnam Auction House also, the first patented and government-authorized SaaS auction platform in Vietnam. This platform is called Decentralized Metaverse Auction House (dMAH), if executed successfully, it will bring many positive changes and benefits to the auction industry, users, Catalyst project, Cardano community and Vietnam government that was analyzed very clearly by the proposer. This is a really promising project. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I strongly believe in the feasibility of this proposal. For the roadmap, the proposer has made a very clear plan with targeted goals, which is devided into 3 phrases for 8 months in total. In each phrases, we know exactly what they would do, main tasks and how long it takes to complete which is consistent with their plan. For budget part, it shows very clearly how it is calculated. I know the exact hourly rate for each type of jobs (technical or non-technical), the total hours for each task, total required expenses,..I'm more convinced about the ability of this project as they are all from a very well-know company in Vietnam with high positions that the company has different departments: CEO, CMO&advisor, CTO, Head of design&Customer experiences, Head of Business development&partnership in carrying out this project well.

Moreover, by checking the given Github link of the product code, anyone could access and check the objectivity and transparency of the system. Also, based on the quantitative analysis such as the percentage of users moving to decentralized platform, the number of newly registered users, the number of active users in 30 days, the number of bid deposit user in cryptocurrency. By comparing these indicators each month, we could know their interest in new platform. Besides, the proposer has a very detailed success outlook for this project as presented clearly in the script.

Some of them concern fraudulent activities and the ease of bidding by relieving many concerns from the bidders by implementing AI-based infrastructure within the ecosystem. However, this is where the proposal may not seem to define their problems. They use words such as fraud, AI, blockchain, and cryptocurrency complexity, but fail to explain in what way they hinder the current system in place. While the Cardano ecosystem's lack of dApps may be concerning, the auction market is not set to having a big enough user base in terms of physical products. The problem might not be fixated with identity, but rather the number of listings and users that utilize auction-based selling.\n\nLastly, the proposal cites the complexity of using cryptocurrency and its constantly growing market to further appeal to this proposal which is addressed through marketing campaigns and user-friendly design. This is an appreciative core feature for most crypto-related technology as it encourages more and more non-crypto native users to get involved with Cardano. However, the lack of explanation for use cases and implementation seems to sway me away from agreeing with the addressed challenge, but they do seem to capture the benefits and the general good in a well-researched manner.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "It seems to me that the team involved has extensive experience with auction houses. Mainly with Hanh as a government-authorized auctioneer and has been CEO of Lac Viet Auction House. Similarly, Tuan is also well experienced in software development and has a Ph.D. in CS (LinkedIn). The team itself shows a great amount of interest in implementing the auction house. However, issues can arise with the gathering of supporters of the product as there is no reliable source for bringing the \"10,000 non-crypto users\" onto the Cardano ecosystem. The plan presented is laid out in an efficient manner with variable details and timeline presented", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal seems to address the issues and lay out the plan for their implementation seemingly effectively. However, this proposal lacks heavy structure and clarity when it comes to feasibility and predicting the success of the project. \n\nThe first main reason is that this project seems to address non-existent issues in the real world with a very heavy budget ($155,070). The proposed pay for the developers seems way too out of the mark considering the cost of living in Vietnam (where they propose to build their infrastructure at). The payscale seems to be their biggest drain for the budget and it needs to be adjusted based on the cost of living and the post hiring process needs. Other costs such as the Salesforce are not really needed until the product has been fully developed, but it is understandable since it does come under the budget breakdown.\n\nOverall, it is a innovative and structural idea to build a safe place for auctions. However, with the more mainstream auctioning sites (one known as OpenSea), this project may seem extensive and unnecessary for Cardano's ecosystem at this stage.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_3454", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 13411, "q0": "This proposal meets the challenge presented by Fund 9. The proponent clearly presented the lack of transparency of the traditional auction model and the great benefits of building a blockchain-powered auction system. If the project is successful, it will give the Cardano ecosystem a large number of new users who were previously traditional auction participants, while eliminating fraud that adversely affects auction participants. However, I am not giving a maximum score because the business product of this proposal is rare tangible items and assets, especially belonging to national governments. While now very few countries accept digital currency in general, as well as Ada in particular as a legal payment currency, this is a huge barrier to expanding project development.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project team has extensive experience in the technology industry and the traditional auction industry.

Besides that, I have a few suggestions for the team:\n1) You should make 1 copy of CMO Hong Hanh's proof of work and achievements on Linked for better evaluation by the foreign community.\n2) To put off-chain data on on-chain, do you need to use an oracle? Please elaborate on this if your answer is yes\n3) The number of participants in each process should be included in this proposal\n4) My biggest question is how would you guys auction valuable government items in countries where their governments don't accept cryptocurrencies?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Documents and reports released as proposed are important proof-of-work so that the community can track whether the project is meeting its KPIs or not.

The risks and their solutions are listed and broken down into logical categories. But in my opinion, the risky part of the license to operate the auction in Vietnam listed here is not very good. Because this is not necessarily considered a risk but a mandatory procedure if you want to do business in auction services. I think it would be better if it was written in the introduction to enhance the reputation of the proponent through a licensed Lac Viet partner. But overall, this is still not a big deal so I still do not subtract points here.\nThe writing style of the proposal is clear and logical. All information and arguments are cited so that the reader can easily check the evidence of the arguments. And the proponent also uses a diagram to help readers better visualize the current centralized auction system and the decentralized auction system. The arguments for impact are comprehensive.

For example, in the first criterion in phase 1, the proponent might say that they need a week to start a photo and report discovery workshop. But I also understand the main purpose of the proponent here is to provide timelines for monitoring and pre-visualization of the project. So it is understandable that there is no specific time.\nAnd in the second part, which is the Cardano adoption, the proponent gave clear criteria and included specific quantifiable goals such as bringing 80% of users to switch from the legacy platform to Cardano's decentralized platform.\nThe successful picture of the project is described very clearly by specific numbers such as 10,000 downloads and 4+ star rating on Andoird, or 5000 downloads and 4+ stars on iOS. \nIn summary, this audit part is very well presented.\"", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_4045", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Build and integrate a Cardano-based smart contract into our current centralized auction platform.
