The proposal will therefore have a positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem as a whole by allowing a wider range and more imaginative uses for their existing solution. The proposal clearly articulates how it will add value to the handles, has a scaling plan, and propose innovative solutions to the problem (NFT-based and Virtual sub handles). This update will bring great value to the project, and allow it to compete on the crypto scene with the more known competitors by delivering a unique set of features.

They provided the details of the tasks, the order of execution, the timetable for completing the project is realistic and the resources necessary are listed.\n\nThe Ada Handle team has indicated some the risks they identified with the solution they want to build and has given some indication of how they will mitigate them (a portal to revoke sub handles for instance).\n\nGiven the experience and plan presented by Ada Handle team, it is very likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal provides a clear and detailled roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement.

A number of examples are provided for how sub handles could be used such as from families, SPOs and organisations. The solution described outlines the usage of both virtual handles that are owned and maintained by the root handle as well as NFT based sub handles that can be issued by owners of the root handle. The main risks for sub handles that are covered is the issuing of an NFT sub handle and how this could result in issues where the root or sub handle holders change, the solution for this is to maintain a list of which sub handles are verified so that the NFT sub handles issued don't hold power in perpetuity. The demand for this proposal is well articulated and backed from existing users of the ADA handle standard which highlights that the execution of this proposal could create high impact within the community soon after its implementation.

There are a number of highly technical individuals in the team and the same team helped to deliver the original ADA handle standard which provides further evidence that the team has the competencies to execute this proposal.

This proposal allows for the expansion on an already extremely successful part of the ecosystem, and your team has a proven track record of delivering brand new technology that works flawlessly. Funding in catalyst should be reserved specifically for projects building like ADA handle.

You guys even took it a step further to create \"virtual handles\" where an NFT doesn't even have to be created. The security feature strength of this proposal is mind blowing! Your team sat down and really thought all of this through, hard, before coming to catalyst to pitch your proposal. Any company looking to get funded through catalyst should use this proposal as a prime example of what PA's are looking for. The experience of the team having over 50 years of combined experience, along with the breakdown of every step of your process makes me feel fully confident that your team will deliver, as promised!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Your team has literally covered every base that I could think to rate in a proposal.

Success for this project would look like the majority of projects adopting the handle standard, and the onboarding of traditional world businesses as a whole.

The issue raised by the author here is that organizations need to purchase multiple native ADA processors unrelated to different billing addresses, and there is no guarantee that all the related Handles will be available. That is, they want to release multiple subHandles associated with their root Handles to specify a variety of tasks, but without the need to use dashes, underscores, or full stops. As a workaround for this problem, the proponent came up with a solution that is \"SubHandles\". This solution identifies most of the problems of the challenge. Because it improves and integrates new features for the ADAHandles platform on Cardano. This will attract more organizations and users; provide value to the ADA community and the broader ecosystem.\nThe proponent described his solution in great detail and reasoned well. By providing specific examples and detailed analysis of 2 subHandles formats, which are NFT-based subHandles and Virtual subHandles. Besides, the proponent also mentioned the main risks that may be encountered when implementing this project. These risks are all related to NFT-based subHandles and Virtual subHandles.

This amount has been allocated into fractions corresponding to the expenses. At the same time, the author has also given the basis for this calculation (hours and average amount per hour). I find this budget analysis to be reasonable. But to be better, in my opinion, the author should present those expenses in more detail.\nThe project team all works at ADAHandles. They are people with many years of experience and competence in many different fields. The proposer provided detailed and complete information about the members. Their identity is also easily verified through the project's website. In addition to this proposal, some members of the group have many other proposals also submitted in Fund 9.

The latest information, work progress, weekly & monthly reports of the project will be continuously updated on the project's communication channels such as Twitter, Github, Disco, and Youtube... for the community to easily monitor and evaluate.
