In fact, it seems quite possible to develop new forms of monetization using NFT's and other ways to integrate players and fans. So we have that the proposal actually fits the objectives of the challenge in which it finds itself. However, we see that a very general plan is being implemented to try to create a new scenario. But given that this is a very innovative model and this idea will still be initially explored, we have that maybe the budget being requested is too big, as well as the ideas being planned seem too broad, which puts in doubt if this idea will be able to cause a positive impact.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Given the vast technical characteristics of this project, it is interesting that the team of professionals involved also have good knowledge in this area. In this regard, we found a team with excellent technical skills, including CVs so that their professional experiences could be proven, which certainly counts as a positive point. However, the biggest source of concern about this project, as mentioned above, concerns the steps chosen to bring the proposal to life. It seems that building a marketplace, community utilities and the amount of licenses being acquired are all too grandiose for a project that still aims to establish a concept. We believe that it would be more viable to choose some of these actions so that the concept was initially validated. This would also lessen the costly $500,000 capital amount being required. We believe that the possible financing of this amount would remove the possibility of several other proposals being made viable.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Regarding the metrics chosen to monitor the evolution of the project, we see that relevant parameters have been defined and that actually indicate the level of engagement that is being obtained by the platform.

We believe that this is a good way to monitor the progress of the project, but we see that in general the goals set seem very grandiose for a first year, which once again enters the scenario of very large actions being taken.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3592, "q0": "Developing a Game platform for the game fan community of 2.7 billion gamers worldwide.\nGenerate revenue from the platform's operations, not dependent on the supporting budget.\nDeveloping the platform on the Cardano ecosystem helps to reduce future scams and hacks.

I don't think that will really take care of the problem of bringing people into the ecosystem of Cardano other than giving them \"loot boxes\" to buy in order to have any sort of perks. This type of project would not be healthy for our ecosystem, as it isn't sustainable without endless consumerism. Personally, I believe that we need to get as far away from that as we possibly can. You are also biting off way more than you can chew right off the bat. I think creating an ecosystem and starting to grow it with self funding first to have a platform to show for your hard work you would be better off. Brands take time to grow, and as an e-sport brand, you will have A LOT of competition. Twitch.tv is an absolute titan, and taking over that kind of space is going to prove damn near impossible without some time and effort into putting in your initial roots. Maybe focusing on building your DAO first will help your chances in getting funded. 500,000$ is a lot of money to ask for in this type of industry.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Your team is not fully doxxed, which to me is an IMMEDIATE red flag when you are asking for the kind of money you are. I think your goals are way too lofty for how much funding you are asking for. Something like this would likely take hundreds of millions of dollars to even gain a small portion of the market share of a company like twitch. I value your aspirations, and I think you are able to achieve them. I just think you need to focus on building from the ground up for something this big if you plan on truly creating the titan you hope to create one day. Funding through NFT sales is simply not sustainable, especially as flooded as our markets are right now for the demand. The world is in a recession, and things like this will take a lot less priority for quite some time.

I think a project like this would be easy to be transparent in showing where funding is going. The one thing I am worried about is the amount of payments delegating to paying workers. It is hard to show the work hours put into projects like this because of the nature of the work. This is why I think you would be better off starting with volunteers to work free on your dream and become a vested part of the interest of the company. That way, they are rewarded for the success, and driven to help you achieve your goal. Doxxing your team is SUPER important when you are asking for this amount of money. You have to understand that crypto is so full of shady characters trying to scam something for nothing. You could be completely legit, but because I cannot tie you to a real-life identity in some cases I do not feel comfortable granting this kind of money to you. I am a project ambassador for the blockchain website Chain Lobby that will be releasing soon, and having become a vested part of volunteering my time for the platform, the company has saved tens of thousands of dollars.

It is good that different revenue channels are included.

It might be helpful to break down the $500,000 budget a little more clearly. This financing will be part of the 1 million needed to start up the company (salary, operating costs, software,...) This budget seems to me certainly sufficient to start up this proposal. Second funding will be required once project milestones are reached.

The risks are included in the proposal with a possible solution. This has already been described in the particle impact.

The project proposer has clearly defined the problem. (new revenue stream, bringing fans closer to their idol) This platform can provide a solution to this problem. It will be very important to involve as many famous gamers as possible. Proper marketing of this product will be very important. Their website already clearly describes how popular esports is.

Or the opposite, more competitors will come up and those companies will want to work with them instead.\n\nOne of their revenue streams relies on NFT sales. They don\u2019t talk about what kinds of NFT\u2019s they are going to sell so how can we be sure that the sales even happen? There must be an incentive for gamers to buy and sell those NFTs. I understand that they have licenses and can create unique products but if their main goal is to help gamers communicate with their idols, getting them to trade NFT\u2019s seems like a far-fetched plan. However, if this goes through and creates a new revenue stream for professional gamers, it would drastically change the outlook of the public view on esports. \n\nThe majority of gaming meet-ups occur with yearly conventions. Since the pandemic is close to over, people are more likely to fly out and go to physical conventions instead of join online events. A valid point stands for the use of these NFTs in which the holders will get VIP access to the events. But in reality, this is no different to classic events where attendees have to pay extra to get VIP access.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The roadmap they explained seems confusing.

They talk about a \u201cBeta App\u201d. Is this a mobile app or just the name of the online platform? They don\u2019t specify this in their proposal.\n\nHow will they implement this idea while simultaneously working on their other Fund9 projects? There doesn\u2019t seem to be a roadmap on how these projects will or won\u2019t collide with each other. The funding they request probably will be split amongst these projects because the amount they ask seems too much for just one project. Their team size is 14 and they are asking for 500K$ which in my opinion is more than enough to pay for their salaries considering they have many other proposals. If they succeed in achieving their funding goals, it is likely that their project will be implemented.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The most probable way that this project will generate revenue is if all the users that follow GameFan buy and sell the NFT\u2019s that they create.
