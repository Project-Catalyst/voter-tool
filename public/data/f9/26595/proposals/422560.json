Through this platform, the user can record and share authentic information from each stage of the supply chain, improve food safety, strengthen brand integrity, increase consumer confidence and monitor environmental impact as well as the good agricultural practices and social conditions in the producing communities; and the cooperatives and organizations can monitor production yields, facilitate third-party certification processes, access formal markets, and build a digital economic allowing them to access various financial services. The users of the platform can be processors, cooperatives, exporters, national and multinational corporations or startups in agricultural e-commerce. The proposal also mentions to the technical aspects, such as: Cardano native tokens consists of non-fungible and fungible tokens that store verified food related information with a non hierarchical trust system; and Tokens bound is Native tokens linked to create a more complex relation system, that this decentralized system can integrate fungible tokens representing food units linked to the verified non-fungible tokens. These show the alignment of the project with the challenge\u2019s objectives (Dapps, products, and integrations), and Food Traceability Daap is important and affects to the Cardano ecosystem because there are many factors aiming to the adoption of platform for the agri-food sector.\nWith the need for a modern information system that provides traceability and transparency to the world's agri-food systems, the creation of this daap is impacts not only the Cardano ecosystem but also the lives of millions of people. The user will scan a tag (QR Code or NFC) applied on a product to access its traceability information stored on the blockchain, and native tokens help for products to be synchronized to one different database by querying the same blockchain, and supporting product traceability. At once, by using metadata of the safety and quality control regulators and the blockchain analysis tools will be able to observe whole history of a token from farm to fork. In the section, the proposal clearly shows Key metrics and references, the solution is detailedly given, but rather lengthy, and sometimes repeated; so I suggest the author should present condensely, and easier to understand.\nThe main risks preventing the adoption of blockchain traceability systems are digital adoption and a lack of incentives for farmers to collect data or the need for a business model to collect data including the technology and support activities. The proposer also gives how to mitigate the risk: for digital adoption, the platform is designed in a way that is friendly to new users; and for the incentives for small producers to collect data, agribusinesses need to carry out an education campaign to communicate to producers the benefits they will have: certifications of the third party, accessing to formal markets, increasing income, and identifying the construction of economic to access financial services in the future.\n\"", "q0r": 4, "q1": "\"The proposal aims to add the function of traceability to the available  platform by using tokens and metadata, and to deliver it, the proposer gave a extremely detailed, reasonable plan with a specific timeline including three stages: research; development of the prototype; and Pilot Test. Each stage have the sufficent information of resources needed and key milestones, even in the stage 2, the prototype\u2019s functions are also presented clearly, such as: the creation of tokens representing food products; the creation of tokens representing farms, wineries, certifications etc; searching for a product saved on the blockchain and the traceability information; and the ability to transfer assets between stakeholders. Besides, technical information of project was said above (Cardano native token, and Tokens bound), and for language of the proposal, it will be auto-translated into English from another language, so it can attract more and more users on this platform.\nA budget breakdown is propposed with detailed costs for resouces needed in all stages, the costs are clearly devided with bulleted points (specialized advice, marketing, promotion and community engagement, expenses for field visits, technical support,\u2026.). The author estimates very meticulous, exploits every free resource (Blockfrost Cardano API,  NFT creator from Game Changer Wallet, Run on.demand Cloud service by Joget, Field staff, Office staff). The team also worked very serious, and estimated the potential risks (although, acording to them it is very difficult to happen), that would be solved by a contingency budget, and if it is not enough, certain actions must be taken, such as reducing the project management and development cost. \nFor team members who worked and will work on the project, the author shows the details of key members, available people on the project with their positions, their skills and theirs experiences, we can also consider carefully in the given links. They are also looking for other profiles: a content writer, working by deliverables; and customer support, working part-time; each profile with required skill and suggested salary is clearly shown in the proposal. Besides, the proposal mentions their partners: StartupMexico, LATAM Cardano Community, Chile Stake Po; whose information can be seen in the proposal or the referent links. \nWith this excellent and sufficient plan, the project will achieve the proposed goals and with benefits that it will bring to agri-food systems and small producers, the potential of the project is very large.\n\"", "q1r": 5, "q2": "\"The project\u2019s progress is shown by specific metrics: new wallets in the cardano ecosystem, number of native cardano tokens minted, and number of scans to the final product. Through the proposal, we can see how these progress are measured and how they are communicated with the community with how frequency. Especially, any general progress being made in the implementation of this proposal will be communicated through a breakout room during the Latam Town Hall held every Thursday; and with the Cardano community in Latin America the progress will be communicated every 2 weeks, and the link to the Town Hall will be shared through their social networks.\nThe success of the proposal is shown by its benefits for small farmers and consumers, by Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Subgoals, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are average income of small-scale food producers and Proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture. With the correct implementation of this solution, small farmers over the world will be able to participate in a system in which they currently have no voice or vote, and with a decentralized and transparent system, the consumer can sure the origin of their food and establish a more direct relationship with the producer without the need to rely on third parties.\nThis proposal, with the traceability platform designed to be freely accessible without having to pay anything from the user, is a continuation of a proposal from a previous fund (fund 7), \"\"Support small farmers in Latin America\"\", that can deliver the MVP of a platform allowing digitization and transfer of the food product between the different stakeholders and an integration of payments using cryptocurrencies (ADA).

The proposers demonstrate that they have used their experience from the funded proposal in Fund-7 and with the Cardano community well and studied in great depth about the eUTxO model, possibilities with non-fungible and fungible native tokens' metadata, and possible links between these real world use cases by for example the Blockfront Cardano API. Creating a food tracing and provenance dApp for initially wine and later other foods in Latin America is a laudable direction of this challenge setting, as the potential to increase adoption, growth and reputation for Cardano is large. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers give a very detailed description of the skills required for the success of this project. They are still trying to fill the roles of customer support and content writer, but these should be much easier to fill than smart contract development or domain specific marketing and sales, which the proposers bring to the table. Although theoretically highly versed in the intricacies of the Cardano blockchain, my impression from studying this proposal is that the background is more theoretical than practical about smart contracts. The previously funded proposal has been slightly modified to work without smart contract deployment as it appears, and this project would actually build and deploys on Cardano for the first time. Some additional budget allowance for outside research, auditing and contracting for Plutus and minting policy design may help the project reach its goals faster. Some issues with food provenance for example require fairly sophisticated smart contracts to constantly issue, burn and manage tokens in circulation and automation of API calls might be underestimated in the current outline of the technical solution.\nThe core team has strong profiles in engineering and entrepreneurship though, with successful previous projects and an existing wine business to be the first trial customer. Therefore, meaningful progress that extends the Fund-7 project into a larger roadmap seems likely and positive.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "By merging this proposed specific food traceability project with the more general Fund-7 project, we gain economies of scale but give up some auditability. To restore the clarity of the overall roadmap and milestones, it would be good to see some more specific goals and quantitative performance metrics such as number of businesses that issue tokens, both on testnet and mainnet, value of tokenized goods and number of industries and products this service has been expanded to. It would also be a great opportunity to make this open source and track contributions and forks on Github.
