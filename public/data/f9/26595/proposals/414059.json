I say this because the proposal intends to work on a current problem that is very present in the community: the misuse of CNFTs. Proponents define the problematic situation very well as \u201cthe NFT projects in Cardano are not built on Dapps, but just a few paintings or a collection. So there are NFT projects, but not many long-term investments. Items are primarily of value and are traded on an emotional basis.\u201d In this sense, the idea here is to build a Dapp platform that helps CNFT creators and those members of the Cardano community who somehow trade these active tokens. The components refer to various problems, such as the lack of use of CNFTs, the lack of use of the asset configuration practice, the lack of direct use of the interaction between users and users - which generates a lack of use of the unity in the community. these problems are directly solved by the proposed initiatives, being for \u201cexample NFTSSS NFT\u201d are used to generate \u201cpassive for os:Staking in the income-only wallet\u201d all Custom NFT: helps users own NFT items according to their changes and creations\" and \"Evolution and creations\" In addition to technical solutions, the proponent proposes examples of contests with some interactive events in the works, voting for and receiving works - as a kind of contest or works to generate engagement, by. proposal makes a lot of sense with the scope of the challenge, as it will work on a very relevant problem for our community. We know the role of CNFTs for popularization and good establishment of Cardano in the cryptographic market, which creates the need for investments that improve this practice. In addition, the proponents disclosed how some would be mitigated. We know that there is a certain limitation between Card's cross-chains year with other blockchains, so much so that we have a challenge focused on improving scalability and connectivity between Cardano and other blockchains (cross cross chain). The problem would be the lack of other people to other Cardano NFTs, but I believe that with all the work that will be developed here, this will be solved.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Now analyzing the feasibility of the project, we see that the roadmap is well defined in the sense of punctuating what would happen and when. We know that in the first quarter of 2023, for example, some activities would be developed, such as \u201cair launches, $CHEEMS token listing, charity events, marketing\u2026\u201d. The view we have about the processes is a bit superficial, however. What would happen in the first month of the year? It's on February? And March? There was also a little more detail about each activity mentioned above, in the order they happen. They have a detailed plan that explores some things better, such as how the product design would be done (\"we will finalize the NFT collection, so far we have designed 580/4000 NFTs and once the collection is complete, we will open the registration of the list of permissions. for the first NFT sale. We plan to launch the launch pad on Marketplace platforms, etc etc\u201d). But not all activities have a well-defined duration and so many details unraveled. For example, what would these charity events look like, how would they contribute to the project, what would they do, exactly? In general, I think the script is good, it is satisfactory as it allows us to understand what would be done, but it could be richer in explanations about each activity, individually. A similar thing happens with the explanation of costs, the total amount is divided into less installments (eg expenses with technology personnel, with designers, project manager and etc). But for example, we know how much would be the salary of each, but we don't know how much time each professional would dedicate to the project (example: 20 hours per week). It would be very interesting if we had that understanding. $6,000 is set aside for community building with real-life activities - this part deserved a little more attention. What would these activities be, perhaps the CNFT contests cited in impact? The marketing part is very detailed (marketing Personnel: 1 Project Manager 3500$/ 3 months + 1 Advisor 1000$/ 3 months + 1 Lead Marketing: 2500$/ 3 months + 2 Digital Marketing: $2400/ 3 months); but even so, it is not ideal, because, once again, we do not know the hourly value of the professionals involved. The team presented, in turn, conveys good confidence, but I do not believe that it is an impeccable part of the proposal, again due to the lack of detail. We know, for example, the name of the members, their roles in the project and their linkedin profiles (for example: with the members Mr.TianRen - Artis, Mr. Peter - CTO, Mr.Teddy - CEO... in fact the only person who has all information that is accurate is from Mrs. Du Oanh \u2013 Advisor). We lacked a detailed curriculum on each, which would allow us to analyze their trajectories so far. Of course, through linkedin we can have a more practical knowledge about this, but it would be interesting if more details were included in the proposal as well. Also a little worrying is the fact that apparently no one has experience with Cardano's specific technologies, and in my view at least one team member would need to be active in our community and convey peace of mind. So I think the topic is fine, but overall more explanation of each part would be very positive.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Finally, we will analyze how we can audit both the development of the phases and the final results. In my opinion, this was the part that left the most to be desired in the proposal, because we don't have as much detail as in the first two topics of analysis. We know that progress would be measured following the phases and activities reported in the roadmap; but as I mentioned in terms of feasibility, some activities are very detailed, others not so much, we don't know exactly how long each activity should take, in practice. The suggested KPIs are quite interesting, the proponents claim that the process would be monitored by Github tools, weekly reports (where would they be made available?) and dissemination of results in media channels (which ones? Twitter, discord, telegram?). Through the information that is passed, it is possible to have a good understanding of how the phases will be monitored, but some more details could increase the security in this monitoring process - such as a greater detail of the activities and the exact definition of the channels communication tools used to maintain contact with the community. Talking about the final success, this is defined as \u201cthe popularity of NFT Adacheems and the acceptance and love of the community, even greater is the image of a dog. The Adacheems have become a phenomenon in global NFT circles. Users and artists involved in the project also have a better life with earnings from Staking NFT or participation in the Metaverse Art Gallery. And so help attract new users to the Cardano ecosystem.\u201d In fact, this is our main goal. But how can we find this out in practice? I think the proponents could have suggested KPIs, as they did for part of the auditability of progress, that would be useful for us to see what could be done about the end results, how they could be substantiated. With this in mind, an idea would be to do a direct survey with Dapp users, to understand how their relationship with CNFTs has been improved; Are they making more money from their digital assets? Has the number of mints on our blockchain really increased exponentially? Has Cardano's relationship with other blockchains been made easier? How did this project achieve the specific objectives of the challenge? It would be important that such issues were better defined and reached the community in a very direct way. That said, the auditability is good, but it could still be better, especially in terms of understanding the final consequences of the project.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 8, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 4332, "q0": "The idea that was evident in the team's proposal was the Adacheems dog NFT. I guess this is a creation based on the symbol of Dogecoin? This proposal aligns with Challenge's goal of Dapps & Integrations. Through NFT Adachems, you define a problem to be solved that generates economic benefits and interacts with the community. Of course, applying to the Cardano platform will add value to the Cardano ecosystem. However, the future scaling and challenges need to be looked at more closely, as I don't see a clear prominence. And I hope the team can do more than what it has, not just as it is now. I think the capacity of the team far exceeds what you are doing. Why don't you think it is possible to create a Metaverse platform for many products in many other fields. For example, agriculture - agricultural shows, cars, etc... will take the team and its products further. Then Adacheems will be shown on your Metaverse platform as a specific example. The team can build a platform for everyone who wants to work on Metaverse, NFT\u2026 They will create NFT on your Metaverse platform. Then calculate the impact of the project will be millions of people, not just the current number\u2026 That's my suggestion for the team. Also, I have a further question of impact: What is the actual use value of the NFT Adacheems here besides buying and selling value. You can explain what personalization of user preferences is like in addition to selecting the Adacheems images according to each person's preferences. I would like to comment that for this project to exist for a long time, I should aim for the real value of NFT Adacheems, not trading or other good factors. To increase the attractiveness, the team can change the logo image to be richer. I understand you want to take advantage of the existing community of dog images that have been on the market for a long time. So, the proposal is impactful because it represents the goal set, adds value to the Cardano ecosystem, and can scale and challenge in the future if the team approaches the proposal deeply. more colorful. I am happy to hear that the proposal is the brainchild of the young generation Z. I encourage you to continue promoting the spirit of youth to do useful things for the community through the Cardano blockchain. I vote 4 stars.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Through the proposal, we see that the team is all experienced in the field of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. There are also members working in the field of communication, which is very beneficial in promoting products to the community. The number of group members is 5 who have been publicly identified via social networks (Linked). I find this very good because it builds trust in the community. List to be broken down by items and logical to the goal. Through the presentation of the budget, we can see that the team has shown a very serious attitude when implementing the proposal, along with the thoroughness of the plan and the implementation method. If the proposal is not funded by Catalyst as a result, will the team continue to work on it?\nI would like to take a closer look at the technical aspect: Adachems is a token created on the Cardano platform. But not every native token on the Cardano platform can participate in the staking process. The essence of staking is that the token must participate in the consensus mechanism power process to validate data - that's called staking. Does your token have the right to participate in Cardano's consensus mechanism validation? Is this team staking confused with lending? In addition, when the team has to decide a lot of things, is the nature of the NFT proposal to be decentralized? Or is it still centralized?\nI realize the applicability is not much, can the team explain more about the staking payout ratio? If the staking payout ratio is high (30-40%), it will make the community doubt the feasibility and transparency of the proposal (some previous projects with high payout ratios are scam projects). . I recommend you review the rules and payout ratio (maybe 15% or less).\nIn terms of resources needed to implement, if the request to create NFT from the community is very high, how will the team do with the existing staff? Hereby, I suggest that the team can cooperate with everyone in the community to implement the proposal as this helps both transparency and the implementation of the proposal without the limitation of resources.\nRegarding the challenges and risks of the project, the team mentioned the fact that NFT holders are not yet popular on the Cardano platform. I have an opinion about increasing the number of NFT Adachems owners, it is the team looking for ways to increase the visual appeal of NFT users. How to NFT to make Adacheems more beautiful and richer. I realized the fact that it has appealed to the young generation Z, the rest of the generations (older people) it is less attractive. So let's think of a way for generations to love NFT Adachems. To do this, it is not only an improvement in the image but also an improvement in the quality and usefulness of Adachems in life. One more opinion about the risk that the image of Adachems when applied for commercial purposes is considered copyright infringement? In my opinion, you should do thorough research on the legality and get permission from the person who created the image of the dog and find a legal guardian (legal advice). In summary, in terms of feasibility, I think that some issues need to be calculated more carefully, the rest, the release of NFT Adachems is likely to be supported by young people. I both agree and disagree with this proposal. I vote 3 stars.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I am pleased with the roadmap of the milestones the team has set to implement the proposal. It is quite detailed and professional, showing that you have invested a lot in the proposal. The professionalism and sequence are shown quarterly so that the community can easily monitor and evaluate the implementation progress. You have also stated the KPI for performance evaluation. To me, that's when it's important because any proposal needs this indicator, which highlights the transparency and auditability of the proposal. It would be much better if the team provided key metrics, to be able to fully clarify the transparency of the proposal. Did the team clearly state what the success of the project looks like? I think the criteria of success as you say are difficult to implement? My suggestion is that you can view success with a smaller, more achievable goal: becoming familiar with the Southeast Asian NFT world, making it more feasible and beneficial for the team when audited. Throughout the proposal writing process, the problem is described in an easy-to-understand and clear manner, and there are implementation solutions and solutions to overcome challenges. I am very pleased with this. A significant investment by the team brings spiritual value to the community (especially for Generation Z) and certain economic value for those who care.

Wed3 building and creating its own token is suitable in creating the incentive of a Dapp. Open source has not been mentioned in the proposal this is an important factor in the community's access to surveillance and research. Creating NFTs may be a hobby for many people when earning extra income but also a concern about the long-term existence of the application. Investing an initial amount of NFT ownership for Stacking to receive a bonus seems to be the form that is attracting the initial source of money, just like the current NFT game projects after only a period of time the value of NFT and Token decreased resulting in a decrease in the number of users. $ACHEEMS can impact the current user because of its value, but in the future the expansion development will be very difficult. Stacking NFT to have the $ACHEEMS as intended on your Wed will be able to cause inflation to affect the value of the Token. The use of cheems dog images to create NFT is creative, which attracts Cheems lovers who have a significant impact on the expansion of the user community.

I expect voters will not want to approve a $50k price tag for such a minimal impact on the given problem statement. The attempt in this framing is to help Adacheems stick out from the competition but this proposal also needs additional justification and definition to accomplish that as well. The proposals solution to this problem is by providing the native token $ACHEEMS to holders that stake their Adacheems NFTs but provides common utilities for this token that many other NFT projects provide. Catalyst voters will be aware of other NFT projects that provide users with tokens like $DING, $YUMMI, $MUTANT, $CLAY, $NINJAZ, and so many more that create utilities that exceed the list of utilities provided in this proposal.

This is a very encouraging sign, and it appears that the team has the necessary abilities and expertise to carry out the project. Furthermore, they have a defined roadmap with specific and attainable near-term targets and clearly envisioned long-term targets. Given the actions to be carried out and a time frame of a quarter in the roadmap (particularly, Q4/2022), the proposed amount of $50,000 is reasonable. It is also clearly divided. The budget is acceptable for each role's today's salary and includes sufficient information about how much the item would cost. One point of concern is that the requested financing only covers three months of a 12-month project. This project will require continued financing to continue beyond the next six months (the first 3 months has been completed). I would advise the team to evaluate it as a possible risk.

There is also an action plan outlining potential risks and drawbacks, as well as a sense of how success would look and how much value it may contribute to the Cardano ecosystem and, in particular, NFTs. It's a pity they haven't given out the potential metrics for measuring the quality or contentment of users with the ADACHEEMS NFT. However, progress can be audited based on quarterly milestones, and I believe such milestones would provide valuable information to the community related to a major, scalable challenge while the budget is very reasonable.

In order to bring about more value to enrich the Cardano ecosystem, bringing in NFTs with use-cases that have benefits to a wider community must be the primary goal for most NFT projects. On a side note, as the proposal addresses NFT value optimization, the proposal will be better off by acknowledging the distinctions between utility-based NFTs and fine art NFTs. As a community moderator of a CNFT fine art project, fine art projects are not well-positioned to be assumed under the same umbrella as utility-based NFTs as artists would want the art as the primary focus. \n\nBut, I find the impact of the solution given as minimal. The value of its entire ecosystem seems to be founded on the use-cases of Metaverse Art Exhibition (MAE), which determines the value of its governance tokens, hence staking rewards and NFTs. Yet, I fail to see how MAE stands out from several other projects with similar use-cases such as Pavia and Cornucopias in their use-cases due to the brief descriptions of its functions. What sort of art events MAE would organise, what kind of artists it seeks to attract, what is Adacheems target audience to make MAE a success? These questions are not addressed inside the proposal. Without addressing these problems, it is impossible to ascertain the future scalability and potential contributions of Adacheems in the Cardano ecosystem. \n\nBesides, I find this proposal to be confusing. There is a brief mention of Dapp, which is a primary focus of this Challenge. Yet, the proposal does not address what the Dapp would be for. My guess is the proposed MAE would be the Dapp. Should that be the case, the proposal fails to address how the MAE is a Dapp. \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal does not provide a detailed explanation of the team.

Besides, professional experiences written in this proposal and LinkedIn have huge discrepancy which leads to further confusion on their actual capabilities. For instance. Mr. Robinson is said to have 5 years of experience in communication and content creation in the proposal. Yet, his LinkedIn shows he has only 1 year of experience in relevant fields. More clarity must be given to convey confidence. \n\nCoupled by the team\u2019s unverifiable experiences and roles in this project, their non-existent track record further dampens the feasibility of this proposal. \n\nRegarding budget, the proposal gives very few details on how the fund allocated would be spent.

Without specifying the team\u2019s roles, there is no way the Catalyst community can ascertain if the fund allocated would do justice for the personnel\u2019s responsibilities. \n\nThe timeline is very ill-prepared as there is insufficient information (milestone, target) that determines the progress of this project over time. This brings about an impression of a team that does not have foresight for the future. Besides, it is said work/targets for Q3 have been completed. After further investigation, I found out the project has extremely lacklustre Discord development and Twitter activities, which are said to be at  completion stage. The dissonance found is deeply concerning as the team does not practise proper communication. \n\nFinally, the challenges identified in this proposal apply to the NFT scene of all chains.

What leaves me unconvinced by its KPI is its notion of \u201cbeing loved by the community\u201d. I do not see a direct correlation/causation between community loyalty and its contribution to this challenge.

This is the purpose of art (at least one of the many other purposes). Therefore, this can be understood as some internal contradiction in the proposal. If they are building a solution to artists, why to say that displaying NFT is wasteful? They might be referring to the issue that there\u2019s too much hype or too much art that they don\u2019t like (which is fair, I\u2019d agree).  But to say that it\u2019s wasteful goes against the principle of creating spaces and technologies that allow art to be created and distributed, either good or bad art (a definition that is always subjective). It can be that the proposal just applied a bad way of formulating the issue of too much hype in the NFT market, but then the proposal should demonstrate more awareness and choose proper arguments to defend this point and still show that they are bringing a solution to all artists, either the good or the bad ones.

A possible concern would be the initial attraction of a number of users that ended up not being maintained, something that occurs today with many initiatives involving NFT's. Regarding the budget distribution, we see a consistent division of expenses, it is also interesting to have internal team members focused on the development area, helping to mitigate expenses.
