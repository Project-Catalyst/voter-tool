(https://www.affde.com/it/uber-users.html). The problem with current ridesharing solutions is that they are centralized, which poses a greater risk to data security and privacy. When you use centralized applications such as Uber your sensitive data is recorded in centralized servers and could be misused by the service provider. Information such as your workplace, commercial destinations, number of trips, residence transform companies like Uber into real \"data-mines\". It is therefore not surprising that users were concerned when uber was hacked in October 2016 and the data of over 57 million passenger and driver accounts were stolen. (Https://nypost.com/2017/11/21/uber-paid -100k-ransom-after-57m-accounts-were-hacked /?

Centralized management also involves higher costs than decentralized governance systems, which translates into higher commissions for the user, who has no decision-making power on the application of any changes to the rules (eg change rates).\nThe proposal aims to solve these problems by creating a completely decentralized ridesharing application, which uses the Cardano blockchain to save data in a private and secure way, thus involving users in corporate governance systems thanks to a native Cardano token, they will then be able to propose improvements that will be implemented only after a vote by the community.\nGiven the size of the ride sharing market and the growth prospects for the coming years, the advantage for the Cardano network is evident.\nThe proposal therefore wants to create a decentralized application that acts as a valid alternative to the current centralized ride sharing services such as Uber, for this reason it responds to the objectives of the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal aims to create a decentralized ridesharing platform to solve the problems of privacy, security, high commissions and lack of decision-making power on the part of the user typical of centralized services. However, the platform that will be created is not a complete solution from the point of view of decentralization, it is an MVP (minimum functional product), therefore the data collected by the CAN-bus (which can be imagined as the nervous system of the vehicle that collects all the information of the various vehicle components) will be sent to the Peakchain server in raw format. The server will decode the data by retrieving useful information such as speed and will send a transition which, once confirmed by the user, will allow the data to be saved securely and permanently on the Cardano blockchain. Since the vehicle data passes through the Peakchain server, the proposed solution still presents a problem related to the possible interference or abuse of the data, for this reason the next step in the development will be the integration with a hardware device that will allow the decoding of the data to locally before running a full cardan node without the need for centralized servers in between. The proposal for the construction of this device was presented by Peakchain within this fund (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414249) together with other proposals in this fund.\nThe proposer stresses the independence between the proposals however, for the reasons indicated above, to have a truly decentralized solution a future integration with the hardware device will be necessary, without this device the proposal only partially solves the problems of the current centralized clients (lack governance, high commissions).\nThe proposer provides the linkedin references of the team members, who live and work in germany at a duly registered software development company and GmbH (https://www.unternehmensregister.de/ureg/result.html;jsessionid=E1F379FD0E14C05649CD0444BC13B884.web01 -1) and ISTQB certified (international standard certification of software testing skills).\nTeam members possess the necessary Cardano development elements and have deep-rooted experience in the automotive industry.\nThe budget is divided into identifiable items, however external profiles are indicated for the following roles 2 Ext BE Developer and UI / UX Designer (65 $ hourly / rate) but precise references are not provided. The salaries required for team members are .. above average but still in line with the salaries received in Germany.\nExt BE Developer is quoted an average salary of $ 70 now for a total of $ 22,400 per month. 22400/70 = 320 hours, considering working days of 8 hours are 320/8 = 40 days. With a monthly wage of $ 22,400 and an 8-hour workday, the hourly wage is about $ 100 now, not $ 70.\nUI / UX Designer ($ 65 hourly / rate) (check hourly cost online) for a total of $ 10400 per month.\n10400/65 = 160 hours, considering working days of 8 hours are 160/8 = 20 days which is reasonable.\nA critical aspect is the fact that team members are found to be engaged in the same weeks on different projects in this fund, which risks creating a work overload if all proposals are funded. In this regard, the proponent reports that as a consulting / software development company they would have no problems in finding the necessary staff.\nThe proposal provides a detailed implementation plan and defines precise acceptance criteria as well as a defined time frame (6 months for the first product increase).

Both the problem and the solution are relevant to me. For further improvement, the proposers can consider adding extra information to clarify the part where they state: there is expected to be significantly increased demand in the number of Cardano Wallets and transactions, as well as the demand for ADA.

I think it\u2019s worth prefacing this review by acknowledging that I think this is a rather good proposal (better than most) but it must get judged with a more extreme level of scrutiny with the $294k price tag (not including the other two proposals for PeakChain priced at $85k each). The high price tag poses a tremendously higher risk at the point where these funds could otherwise provide for 10-14 other Catalyst proposals with more average requested funds. With that, I think this proposal needs to stress the problem statement much more because the current layout does not compel me to believe that the issues centralized alternatives pose a major need for this type of platform. I think that the brief market statistics about the trajectory of the industry is great because it quantifies how much money could be shared with the Cardano ecosystem through this platform. The proposal just has to convince me that they could create a product that is significantly different/competitive enough to reasonably capture some of the market share. There needs to be strong appeals to reasons why both drivers and users will switch to this platform based on factors that THEY care about. In the gig-economy world, you don\u2019t have a product without only one or the other participating.

I highly recommend developing a simple and concise roadmap and budget that can be put directly into the proposal as voters will not want to click links to navigate through business documents and trackers. The good news is that this proposal is not outright wasting the requested funds on overly exorbitant salaries and overpriced equipment (though the pay rates are very clearly on the higher end of industry standards). The budget breaks down month by month payments that are within fair compensation for the type of work being done. It may be concerning to voters that the proposers are asking for $460k (cumulative) and states that they plan on returning for more funding, so I would advice providing some greater justification about keeping up with competitors or wanting to avoid reaching out to large investors. I think voters would appreciate feeling like funding is not being taken for granted.

However, in a world where a completed product is accomplished but does not see any interaction beyond the directly involved parties, the proposal makes no actual impact on the world. It is for this reason that a proposal must provide additional metrics in areas like social media following, social media engagement, website traffic, devices accessing the app, satisfaction ratings, volume traded on the platform and a wide variety of metrics that shows the voters that this team has an objective definition of success. It\u2019s one thing to identify different categories that are intended to monitor and measure, but it\u2019s another thing entirely to set targets for what levels of adoption/usage the team wants to see at different timeframes/milestones in the life of the project.

I agree with the proposers that current ridesharing services have some major disadvantages: privacy issues, security, high fees, governance/centralization. Therefore, the demand for decentralized ridesharing is urgent. \nThe Cardano (ADA) will be used to pay for ridesharing. Thus, a large number of users will join the Cardano ecosystem, boosting the users of Cardano. From this perspective, the solution is well aligned with the challenge setting. \nIn terms of the risks, the proposers addressed well and gave logical solutions. \nHowever, until the end of this part, I still do not understand how the proposers incorporate blockchain technology into Uber platform; and with this technology, how do the users and riders perform on this application?
