The big challenge is more about implementing features they\u2019ve identified, scaling up rapidly as a social marketplace.

The team could further test the audience engagement, interaction with mockups to how best adoption could work given the challenges highlighted in the proposal with regards to a missing reading culture.\n-\tSome further details on the go to market strategy could help better understand if there may be some gaps in this respect, i.e marketing and communications campaign and gearing up with an operations team, business developers & partnership managers  to develop the partnerships needed. \n-\tSetting up a business model canvas to explore an operating business model could highlight some other gaps or hypotheses that the team is making and allow the team to test them ( https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas) \n-\tThe tokenomics for a blockchain based application would also need to be designed to clarify the incentivization model, licensing and royalty payments through utility or payment tokens or fiat money. Each payment interface implementation can have a cost, and maybe integrating payment channels ( fiat, MPesa etc) with high adoption rates can help drive adoption for starting off.\n-\tBooks can eventually evolve as a multi-NFT universe on their own, and innovative business models like co-authoring, co-reviewing, using art NFT, media NFTs can unleash new business opportunities and value chains. The team may find it useful to research the market dynamics possible with these other NFT communities ( art, media) to design the final product. \nIn order to accelerate time to value, the team could consider looking at some of the references below: \nSome developments in the Ethereum space with regards to royalty standards : \n-\thttps://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981 - standard for royalties in Ethereum\n-\thttps://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip27/#simplesummary standard for royalties in Cardano\n-\thttps://www.openlaw.io/ - platform for legal smart contrats for implementing contractual relationships\n-\thttps://accordproject.org/ , open source software for smart legal contracts\n-\t\nDigital rights management : \n-\thttps://www.zdnet.com/finance/blockchain/new-platform-uses-nfts-as-a-gateway-for-digital-rights-management/ \no\thttps://rair.tech/ - Blockchain based digital rights management platform\nCardano ecosystem integrations that may be of interest : \n-\tProfila for CRM from Cardano ecosystem for communications and marketing purposes\n-\thttps://www.clanity.com/#Platform  for social marketplace from Cardano ecosystem including business to business and business to customer features.\n-\tIntegration with lending protocols to faciliate liquidity for those authors and author communities needing funding for creating content\no\thttps://www.meld.com/ from Cardano ecosystem\nThere are also some similar proposals in Fund9, so probably setting up a Cardano community focussing on the book  industry, eg a Guild or even a consortium going forward could benefit everyone : \n-\tMy digital library, https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/421718\t\n-\tNFT Books - Book Token Platform, https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/422608\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "-\tThe team is clear on customer acquisition (reader, author, publisher), retention and product adoption being the key outcomes they are after through the launch of their app. As there is a go to market phase, the team may find it useful to include some indicators for feedback collection eg : number of users using it, number of interviews, ( groups, individuals) , feature requests using a user-voice & voting mechanism.

That helps the project to put its full potential team's strength in each stage. The construction of a specific roadmap for each stage will be more detailed, helping the project to be closer to the issues. The community is easy to monitor and evaluate.

The solution is expected to encourage the reading culture in African countries and expand the Cardano network by applying NFT blockchain technology. \nSince the project doesn\u2019t contain too much technical complexity, the biggest risk mentioned is how to promote the reading culture. The team has presented the addressing approaches which focus on two sides: authors and readers. However, I think more details on this plan will help the team increase the viability of the project. For example, to encourage authors to create content, some of the recommended approaches can be hosting some content creation workshops (e.g. every two months), giving rewards to get people on board, and creating content challenges,...

The team behind this proposal aims at creating an NFT book library focused on promoting a reading culture in Africa starting in CMR which will not only greatly expand and facilitate access to books but also provide incentives to readers. Despite being a huge project, the team cleverly divided it into four major phases, allowing the community to assess the impact the team aims to make in each phase. There is a description with a high level of detail of core elements/components the team plans to implement. The main deliverables are described clearly as an NFBook marketplace fit for the African context. For this, the potential for adoption is real, which is in line with the objectives of the challenge.

Based on the evidence, the proposal timeline and milestones are clearly specified, and the suggested time frame is appropriate for the amount of events outlined to be completed. I believe the amount of funding requested is appropriate for the benefit this project will bring to the community. However, I would have preferred to see more specifics in the budget. For example, how many hours per week will be devoted to platform design and architecture, and how many individuals will be on the design team? How many developers will be involved in the implementation, and will they all be paid the same hourly rate? I would advise that the team include an expected hourly rate as well as the number of working hours for each role, followed by the number of experts participating in the role, so that we can justify the budget's fairness.

The solution will be an NFT book library that promotes reading culture in Africa. The proposer is able to give an analysis about the reading culture in Africa - the target market where good-quality historical and cultural books haven\u2019t earned a widespread readership. The proposer also analyses the obstacles for book reading in Africa (high cost of printing, lack of digital library, undeveloped reading culture, no incentives). Seeing these problems, the proposer intends to create a NFT book (trackable on blockchain) with audio version. The proposal may elaborate the impact of the NFT book library on the blockchain community. Advertisement and sponsorship is also offered on this platform as a way to lower cost. Suggestion for incentives is illustrated by Mermoz\u2019s trial - where he offers monetary prizes for students who read and take notes as guided. There are several recreational activities to promote reading culture on this platform. The platform also integrates a search engagement that caters for African cultural context (understanding symbolic African paradigm). This helps searching for African books easier and gives exposure to books whose names are written in paradigm. The proposer also considers the DID module for decentralized identity. This proposal is very well-presented in that it is made to solve a problem while integrating the blockchain technology. It also resolves authorship as the authors will earn not only publicity but also sales from the secondary market while maintaining their copyrights and ownership. Translators and publishers also get to see some benefits offered to them, validating this project as a win-win situation that aims to promote reading culture in Africa rather than profiting off others\u2019 works. The main risk is lack of reception due to an unestablished reading culture. This is also the reason why this project is created and the mitigation is able to tackle both ends (the provider - authors, publishers and receiver - readers). The proposer can have a brief analysis about this project\u2019s impact on the Cardano/Catalyst community (publicity, expansion of ecosystem, more recognition in a potential market - Africa). The proposer could also put more emphasis on the impact of this project on African reading culture and literature future - more profound books are created by African authors, people in Africa read more historical books and become more invested in their culture.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan is extremely detailed, with consideration for the local context of Cameroon.

Nearing the last steps, the proposer specifies the main deliverables (for specification documents) and finally implements the platform. Similarly, the budget breakdown is also presented in a detailed way. However, it will be even more detailed if the proposer could specify the salary paid to each of the positions listed (how much for expert fees, designers per hour, what\u2019s in marketing - advertisement posts, billboards).
