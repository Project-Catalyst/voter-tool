They strive to lead the change towards a more open employment model and to help their members map their skills while discovering opportunities and making new connections. Goodwall has over 2 million users and is active in over 150 countries. I have actually joined the platform to understand it better - and there is definitely an interesting blend of job board / social media / course directory, focused on students and young professionals (16 to 24 years old). Goodwall have had one proposal funded in Fund 8 and have now come back in Fund 9 with six proposals totalling over 650k USD. \n\nGoodwall interacts with its users in many ways, including sending out monetary prizes, with all the costs associated with bank and international transfers. Their value proposition here is for Goodwall to integrate the Yoroi wallet in their platform, thus allowing for instant ADA / native token payouts. Being a Yoroi user, I fail to understand the extent at which Yoroi wallet needs to be integrated with Goodwall\u2019s platform. If Goodwall will be making the payments, users simply need a Cardano address to be inserted in a field, irrespective of whether that address is controlled through a Yoroi, Daedalus, Eternl, Ledger or any other wallet interface for that matter. Moreover, the Yoroi page doesn\u2019t really detail a use case for integration on third party applications. Would such an integration maintain the same level of security? Would seed words have to be transmitted to Goodwall? From my point of view the necessity for integration is extremely limited to a field that must be completed with the Cardano address (and of course the extra step of setting up a wallet, be it through Yoroi or another wallet). Of course, extra work is needed to educate their users on the general Cardano ecosystem features and tools, but this is outside the scope of this proposal. \n\nGoodwall has 2 million users, they are targeting an excellent cohort (young, educated, worldwide audience), and the fact that they wish to develop their in-app economy and incentivisation infrastructure on Cardano is laudable, but I have serious doubts of whether this integration is necessary in the first place.

I think their HQ is in Madrid, but they seem to be geographically distributed throughout Spain, Philippines, Switzerland and many other locations.  In the proposal itself they have included a list of management team and also three team members who will be leading this project as well as taking the Atala Prism pioneer course. So you can\u2019t really ask for anything more in terms of team transparency.  \n\nWhat is their plan? A 6 weeks timeline, divided in three main parts: preparation (scope, design), execution (wallet integration, QA) and results (instant ADA payout, tracking usage). Budgetwise, the project will necessitate 400 hours, with 100 USD hourly rate for development. \n\nI shall offer five stars despite the fact that I have my doubts whether the Yoroi integration is really a necessary project to have, since the project is definitely feasible and Goodwall has an excellent team.

Yes, given the experience of the team provided, this idea is quite likely to be implemented effectively. I especially like the risk identification and mitigation part since it shows that the proposers have thought about the proposal and are ready to address any issues that arise. Unfortunately, no specific budget breakdown is available. With a desired amount of $46,000, voters deserve more than just a lump sum with only two elements showing how that amount was reached or how it would be spent. Most of the fund is allocated to the salary for 2 devs so the team could try to make clear which experts will attain in this role. Moreover, the $100 hourly rate is quite high in comparison to today's value expertise so it\u2019s crucial to describe the tasks of this role as well as the number of their working hours. The remaining money is for QA teams for 1 week, this element needs more information on what activities will be conducted (a breakdown with estimated expense for each item is highly recommended) as a sum of $6000 contributes nothing to the voter\u2019s trust but vagueness. My other concern is that the team does not offer a realistic timeline. As far as I can tell, the plan is divided into three phases, each with its own set of objectives. While I understand the roadmap, I believe there is still much opportunity for development. One thing that was absent was a clear explanation of milestones and technical tasks that needed to be done. I would have liked to have read more about technical implementation, specifics, and plans since it could have aroused my interest in assisting with the implementation, but as it is now, I'm not sure what the actual plan is.

It is a plus point of the proposal when mentioning the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Rating.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_4073", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14635, "q0": "Currently, sending international payments via banks is a high-cost burden. Goodwall will integrate with the Yoroi wallet, enabling ADA payouts to be made instantly. To release payments, users will only need to enter their wallet ID. Completing the above project will allow over 2 million users to easily access their monetary prizes in ADA. And that will simultaneously increase the number of users entering the Cardano network and the volume of ADA used.\nProposer proposes the project will be divided into 3 phases: Preparation/ Execution and Program Results. The stages take place in a logical sequence, but the proposer does not technically explain how to accomplish the tasks in each stage. It would be better if the proposer could provide a way/technique to integrate Goodwall with the Yoroi wallet, either in writing or with a diagram. It will help describe the plan more visually and vividly.\nIn the solution section, the proposer repeated the problem to be solved in the solution but did not suggest anything further.\nIn the description and recommendations to reduce the risk, the proposer raised the technical issues and users. The proposer had the right perception of the difficulties of the project in the future, and also offered appropriate solutions to the problem.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has planned 3 phases of the project for 6 weeks, which I find reasonable, but still incomplete. Proposers can add specific timelines to determine the expected start and end dates of the project.\nThe budget allocation plan is divided into 2 parts, $40,000 for 2 developers for 5 weeks and $6,000 for QA Team for 1 week. I realize that such a budget allocation plan is not enough, I propose the proposer add other information such as who will be in charge and responsible for the use of those budgets, More specifically, spending $40,000 for 2 devs (iOS and Android) should be listed more specifically such as what parts will be developed, how many hours it will take, and how much money will be spent on developers same or not\u2026 The same goes for the quality assurance team.\nIn the list of project personnel provided by the proposer, I found that the expertise of the members spans many fields, especially in the fields of technology and economics. In addition, all members of Goodwall's management team are highly educated and have many years of working experience in the field they manage.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal includes a live dashboard that will provide necessary data to assess the project's performance and also create a presentation that will outline the project's findings. However, the proposer does not clearly describe how they can monitor and evaluate project progress. In this section, I propose the proposer add a clearer roadmap with specific timelines and the number of users that Goodwall hopes to achieve in the future to increase the persuasiveness of the project. Goodwall's success will be realized if the quality of existing products is enhanced through improvements suggested by customer feedback or increased community use.\nBesides, with a project implementation plan taking place in a short time, the proposer can refer to using agile software development in combination with software from third parties such as Jira to monitor and manage the project judgment reasonably.\nIn my opinion, Auditability has not been given enough attention. The proposer should add details about expected traffic numbers, and how to achieve those goals more specifically.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_4076", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Goodwall will integrate with the Yoroi wallet for web and mobile, allowing for instant payouts of ADA.
