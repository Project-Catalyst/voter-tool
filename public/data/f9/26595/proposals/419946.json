When realized this proposal will clearly add value to the ecosystem as many ventures are waiting for a browser wallet to go ahead with decentralized identity solutions. Even Catalyst itself has been waiting for a DID web wallet for \u2013 if nothing else \u2013 to help keep tabs in a decentralized way on its proposal assessors and veteran proposal assessors. Anyway, as the proposers behind this project themselves state, the development of a web browser wallet will allow for the use cases such as users logging in with a DID, or signing credentials from a web page \u2013 all with verified decentralized identity confirmation that does not share identity information. I rarely advise voters to read through a proposal, but some proposals are more than just proposals \u2013 they also have an educational aspect to them. This is one that helped to clarify the current state of DID development on Cardano and helped me understand the current state of play to boot. The speeding up of PRISM-enabled websites could open up brand new use cases for Cardano. Just great. Perfect fit for this challenge and well in line with the Fund 9 goals, in my view. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There are no technical risks as far as the actual product is concerned. There should not be any significant delays here\u2026 Wait a moment, that\u2019s not just me talking [as a proposal assessor], it\u2019s the proposer team  themselves who stated that. This proposal is not a pie in the sky, but it is visible on the delivery horizon. The  $45,000 budget seems completely suitable for the task at hand. The lead developer is a man of substance as he is also offering to reduce the real budget of the proposal ($52,000 + $5,000 = 57,000 USD) by investing his own time/money into the project \u2013 thus cutting his personal costs to from $52,000 to $40,000 USD. The remaining $5,000 is allocated for the Front end developer. To cut a long story short, this means even more value for money for the Project Catalyst treasury. This proposal has not only a sensible and clear plan for implementation \u2013 but it also is super encouraging as the team states it does not need a contingency plan for budget overruns due to its clarity in scope and lack of major risk. The plan is broken down in three major phases (10 weeks, followed by 6 weeks, followed by 4 weeks) and for each phase we have been provided with a mental map of what will be going on. I\u2019ve been a Proposal Assessor since the early Catalyst funds and it is a joy to read a well-thought out and prepared proposal such as this one. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team gives a very good way of imagining what we are about to get as a product here: Think Metamask for Identity! The team \u2013 composed of previously funded proposer (F7) Bj\u00f6rn Sandmann [who has been working full-time on PRISM] and a front-end developer (John Grabenmeier) \u2013 are keen to together deliver to the Cardano ecosystem a working identity wallet. Yet, as big as a contribution that is, the way that they are going about it \u2013 may be even more amazing. The presentation of this proposal is so clear and its solution is visually appealing and simple. I commend the team for setting a precise dynamic for providing updates to the community via public releases of new information. The team intends to post a blog entry on a fortnightly basis at https://blocktrust.dev/blog, which is key to a true auditability of the proposal\u2019s implementation \u2013 especially as they intend to be open about the progress and provide screenshots of development. I would ask the team to try to utilize the same in-depth language and approach as they did during the writing of this proposal \u2013 possibly even to share the updates through other forums. Explanations and concise break downs like these are treading new ground and have a special value for the community. Furthermore, the proof of this proposal will be in the decentralized pudding. Namely, the community will be able to track the download numbers for the wallet from the web stores of the main browser platforms (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari).", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2047", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 13, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Excellent"}, {"id": 14334, "q0": "There is currently no browser extension wallet for Atala Prism. There are a few mobile wallets in various stages of development, but no browser wallet. Unlike mobile wallets, with browser wallets it is possible to interact with a web page (with a mobile wallet it is also possible, but then you have to photograph the screen, which is not practical). The proposers have recognized this gap in the ecosystem and have already developed a browser wallet as a proof of concept and presented it in a video. In my opinion, this already looks like a good product. Not only technically, but also visually. Especially with wallets, I think it is essential that they are easy to use and do not look like a hobby project. This clearly speaks for the project. The concrete goal of the proposal now is to take this POC and within a short time (only 2-3 months) turn it into something that developers can use to \"Prism-enable\" their websites. Instead of waiting several months for a completely finished product, the primary goal here is to solve a real problem as quickly as possible. In further steps, the wallet should then also be available for installation by the public. In my opinion, the proposal fits the Challenge very well and addresses an existing problem with a realistic and timely solution.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "With the video of the demo, the developers prove that they are able to implement the project. I think as far as the resume and technical credentials are concerned, there are no concerns here. The budget is relatively tight, but realistic. The overall schedule is also very compact and ambitious, but again, it's easy to see how the current product can be completed quickly.\nOn the project's website, you can find additional technical material as well as the demo website where you can supposedly try out the wallet. Unfortunately, it appears that you can currently only try out the wallet if you are a member of the \"Atala ASTROS\". This seems to be a group with graduates of the Atala Prism cohort. It's not that clear. Unfortunately, I could not see the code, nor test the wallet itself. It is also not obvious whether the project is open-source or not. In my opinion, the project doesn't have to be open-source for it to be good, but I would appreciate it if there was more clarity here.\nThe team also has other proposals that could theoretically conflict with this project in terms of time. However, they are very transparent about this and offer a proposed solution in which they would give preference to the project with the most votes in development. It would certainly be nicer if there was only one proposal, where one could then also be confident that one's votes would ultimately also ensure that the project would be implemented. So one can only hope. I'm not so convinced of this, but I also don't have a solution for how to do it better if you have several ideas that you want to put to a vote.\nHowever, these are not serious points of criticism. Based on the descriptions and the video, I am very optimistic that the project can be successfully implemented.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Is the project auditable? The team intends to blog about the development and then contact the community after the launch to gather feedback. That sounds reasonable so far. When is the project successful? On the one hand, the proposers refer to the usage and download statistics, on the other hand they formulate rather unselfishly \"But the real success lies in the fact that a working browser extension wallet means that many PRISM projects that have already been started can now be completed\". To what extent there are really many projects that can continue because of this browser wallet and were previously stuck, I cannot judge, but am inclined to believe the proposers here. I also find it strange that there is currently no wallet for Prism projects, especially since IOG always talks a lot about Prism. All in all, this sounds like a project worth supporting.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3988", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Excellent"}, {"id": 14353, "q0": "First, the purpose of this wallet is explained quite nicely. I find this very understandable and can see why such a wallet is urgently needed. I can also follow why there is none so far. The developers built a prototype and made a video of it being used. It all looked nice and gave the impression that everything was already working. The features of the wallet are probably quite comprehensive and appear to be identical, if not more, what the Roots Wallet project can do already, although they have been around for a while and got money from Catalyst. The whole proposal looks very elaborate and I am very optimistic here that the project, if implemented, can be very good for Cardano, allowing projects to connect their digital identity to the website.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "With the prototype, the developers have shown that they have an understanding of what they are doing. The links (linkedIn, etc. are unfortunately in German) but as far as I can understand they also have appropriate references and the technical know-how. The budget is clear and for the implementation in my opinion realistic to achieve the goal. The developers rule out further financing, but they could imagine making the wallet available for mobile devices at a later stage (and thus probably competing with the existing wallets). This would be a second step and a separate proposal at a later date. The idea to start with a wallet for browsers only is good.\nThe timeline is also realistic and the risk is relatively low, since they already have something that works. By the way, what I like is the design and the look of the wallet. I think that's really important and it's nice to see that the team has managed to pull that off quite nicely for the prototype.\nI've also previously evaluated another proposal from this team and went into the issue of the SDK. What was written there should also be repeated here:  \u201cthe team is not using the official Prism SDK but its own version of it. On the one hand, I find this very interesting and it makes it clear once again that the team really has a great knowledge - on the other hand, in my opinion, this also carries risks. If IOG has its own SDK, then probably more than 1-2 people are working on it. How can a small team have such an SDK and keep it permanently up to date? It is a topic that probably hardly anyone can really judge well without comparing both SKDs. Consequently, I don't want to judge it negatively - maybe it is actually a very big advantage - as a voter you can form your own opinion about it.\u201d\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In contrast to the previously evaluated proposal of the team (\"web credentials\"), my original point of criticism is also present here, that it is unclear which proposal will actually be implemented first, if several proposals receive money, but the whole proposal conveys a certain urgency. There is an acute problem here that needs to be solved - namely that projects based on Atala Prism can finally connect to websites. Also, the time planning in the project is designed in such a way that approximately 2 months full time are estimated here to solve the problem as fast as possible. Everything after that will be done part-time, which implies that other projects could be implemented during this time. I'm not that enthusiastic about this either, but the criticism is less prominent here, accordingly I don't want to take away a point here.\nThe development process should be traceable via a blog and then of course via the wallet downloads. Sounds good. All in all, this sounds like a realistic, feasible, and traceable solution to an actual problem.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3996", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Excellent"}, {"id": 7561, "q0": "The problem with this challenge is that many PRISM funds projects are in progress, the proposal is still missing a critical piece of infrastructure in the form of an identity wallet for the browser.

The solution to this problem is to create a browser-first wallet for digital identities that solves the current problem.

The main goal of the wallet is to be to connect to websites (a bit like Metamask, but for SSI). This differentiates this wallet from other SSI-wallet projects like \u201cRoots Wallet\u201d which is a mobile-only wallet. The interesting part in the proposal is that they already have a working demo, which on the first look is seemingly pretty feature-complete. Their goal is to polish the demo, add a few features, and then release it to developers quite early. The proposers state, that this kind of browser-wallet for SSI his holding projects back and that this is a key piece of software for Prism and Cardano overall.

In the second stage, after getting feedback and the final polishing, they are going to bring the wallet to the market-places of the different browser-vendors. I think this is an interesting approach which offers a lot of audibility.\nThe timeline and the budget is reasonable for what they are trying to achieve. \nBased on the demo they clearly know what they're doing, what is needed and how to achieve this goal. But with this kind of detail and transparency also comes a hindrance: They also seem to know exactly where the pitfalls are: In the delivery to of the extension to the marketplace and the time of the release of the official sdk. \nAnother point which also causes a bit a headache are the other projects the team is involved in. They are proposing two other projects, which also seem to be not too small and to be delivered in the same timeframe. This I find generally problematic, but they are very transparent about it and state that they will \u201cgive priority to the proposal with the most votes\u201d.

Using decentralized identifiers (DID's) is the only way to go in the future and I believe will be the way of the future. There are several projects working on this technology and even wallets such as \"Lace\" will eventually be using this type of technology but it is not yet available.\n\nHaving multiple projects working on solutions to this area of technology is very important, and the more we have working on it the better.  The proposer has targeted this problem specifically and fits very well to this challenge category. They already have a working model for a browser-wallet for digital identities.\n\nAlso it is important to understand that this SSI is browser based, and well on its way already. Browser based SSI is not yet implemented as far as I am aware, but is something that is, in my opinion, desperately needed. \n\nHaving some form of SSI would bring value to Cardano ecosystem and could potentially bring forth whole new concepts in future projects once identity wallets exist, or current wallets add this functionality.

The proposer has attached a youtube video showing, that, at least on testnet, is already functional. They have already put in the work to have a proof of concept and need the funding to get the browser based wallet implemented and in the hands of users.\n\nFurthermore the prosper has already created their own SDK. This means that the proposer will not need to wait around for PRISM, but can simply taking the existing demo, and tweak it and go live for their phase 1.\n\nThe proposer has laid out phases and a timeline that is doable and has milestones in each of those phases which leads to an easy auditability of the project.\n\nThe budget is simple as this is mainly developer costs to accomplish the goals.

Perhaps next time they put in a proposal they could give us this timeline to help improve the proposal. \n\nNext, they plan to have it available on the browser stores, so we will be able to see the progress of the browser based SSI wallet by seeing it become available to people on the various browsers. \n\nFinally we would be able to see the number of downloads that the wallet has received which would enable us to track the success of the proposal/wallet. \n\nThe hidden auditability of this project resides within the PRISM ecosystem. Many of the projects being developed within PRISM can not be implemented without SSI and DID's.
