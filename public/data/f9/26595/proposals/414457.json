Gradually I came to see that the proposal to solve the problem of DApps with NFT integration involved crops. This is very beneficial for the ecosystem that is the common environment of Vietnam, Asia, and the world. The team raised the specific issue of people's limited understanding of blockchain and NFT. Based on that, the team came up with a solution that is to use NFT on the Cardano blockchain to manage afforestation work in Vietnam. Using NFT adds value to the Cardano ecosystem. I think this has the following benefits: Good impact on the green environment (especially in the future when the trees are grown, bringing significant value), improving the knowledge of the community because they have good conditions. approach blockchain technology - NFT, providing maximum support in working for partners (those who directly plant trees - Gaia nature conservation organization). This proposal is fully scalable and solves the challenge in the future. I have an impact question for you: Do you have any plans other than just supporting and managing tree planting? If you have other plans, it will have a different impact. I think in the future, the team can do more research on the goal of commercializing crops and taking money for social support. I vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "You and the members are both involved in the Cardano blockchain ecosystem and have experience in the fields of event organization, finance, and media, especially one man who ber works full-time in the blockchain field. . In addition, the team has publicized the identities of all members through social networks (Linkined). As a PA, I am satisfied with the experience and materials that the team presented in the proposal. The above criteria are quite important so that the community can trust the team's reputation and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal. The proposed budget has been broken down into categories. Regarding the plan and implementation, I realize that the money from organizations and communities for afforestation is very large, but there is no application to help control the afforestation effectively. In addition, many organizations and individuals in the large community want to contribute to afforestation but have not found a suitable application/partner to entrust/cooperate with. There are still many frauds in the use of funds for afforestation. This is a good opportunity for the team to develop the application and release the NFT - creating a transparent public platform for everyone to participate. I understand the team is going deep into technology to thoroughly support the management element for partner Gaia. The release of NFTs based on trees is also very beneficial in communicating and promoting the afforestation program so that everyone knows about it. However, the team should be more clear about how the NFT issuance will benefit its holders? Does this NFT only have the function of simply recording and monitoring the existence and development of trees? Is there any economic benefit to the holders? I would like to suggest that the team can consider bringing economic benefits to NFT holders in the long run when the trees mature and reach their use value. Then, in addition to meeting the quota of trees needed to protect the environment, several other trees can be commercialized to (1) Make direct economic contributions to society; (2) A small portion after commercialization will be distributed to the owner as a gratitude gift for supporting the project for a long time. Doing so will be good for both the ecological environment and the individual NFT holders. However, there is still a risk (this is my personal opinion) that during the growth process, some trees will die or be destroyed, then you will have a plan on how to handle them. who is holding the NFT of that dead/destroyed tree? (NFT once recorded on the blockchain is immutable) Another challenge that I want to mention in the technical aspect is the technological barrier of a web application, mobile application, dNFT, etc. .for the elderly. Is there a way for the team to make it easier for older people (with slow/limited ability to absorb technology) to use apps, NFT, etc...? My suggestion is that we should strengthen the instructions on how to use it in detail so that everyone can understand it as easily as possible. Detailed instructions can be implemented in many different ways (via the website, youtube, and volunteers...).

The team set out the criteria for success. The proposal is in line with the 15th of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. It would be even better if the community knew the key metrics to increase the auditability of the proposal. I find this to be a highly practical proposition, worthy of being put to life. Especially when the proposal is impactful and feasible for the natural environment and the common interests of society. However, the team needs to understand clearly that its position is not the one that directly goes to plant trees, but the one that provides solutions and applies techniques to have appropriate plans and actions.

Blockchain technology is increasingly being applied to serve many areas of life such as finance, health, education, agriculture, etc. However, applying blockchain technology in forest planting is currently not very popular yet.

As we know, reforestation is a very critical task in all nations to lessen the severe effects of climate change on our planet. Therefore, the proposer has the idea about creating a blockchain-based technology platform called BlockTree to connect Sponsors and Planters in Asia, (focus in Vietnam first) to manage the reforestration work in Vietnam by using NFT. Their products will consist of a Web app for tracking and progress reporting of the trees, a Mobile app for the Planters, a Mini ERP for tree planting organization. I think, this is a very good idea which could be scaled to other countries. A NFT representing a number of trees planted in a certain location will be created, and it will include the planting date, a photo of the trees, and their coordinates (latitude and longitude). We refer to each NFT as a \"Green Certificate\" and will mint them using the Cardano blockchain so that Sponsors can easily check the outcome. In addition, this proposal is suitable for the challenge because this will increase Vietnam's forestry efforts' transparency and auditability. Additionally, it will not only assist the Cardano Community in learning more about the practical applications of blockchain technology, but it will also enhance people's lives, have a significant positive social and environmental impact, and support sustainable development beyond Catalyst. However, there are some main risks such as persuading and taking time to educate Planters which are low-skill labors, and tree planting organizations to change their current manual process. My suggestion is to find the right professionals in that field to deal with the right risks. In short, I would like to give this proposal full mark because of all the reasons above.

Moreover, the proposer has clear target in which they will focus on product development, and aims to have 2,500 trees planted and tokenized after 3 months since the funded date. It would be better if the proposer could add the name of the person who will carry out each task in the sheet. Regarding the budget, this part is also quite clear, leaving nothing to be desired: I know how many hours are needed for each task, the hourly rate per hour, and the total amount in USD including the risk management (5% of the total project's cost explained).

Besides, the eventual results have not been obvious, because this project is useful for all parties participating, so beyond the report on the number of trees planted and tokenized, I think it should have a target for deriving satisfaction from sponsor or how applying technology increased the effective working of the tree-planting organization is.\n\nAnyway, I totally support the sustainable project as blocktree, so I rate it 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Clear understanding this is a continuation project from Fund 8, the main goal is to plant and tokenize 2,500 trees.

It will certainly help Cardano spread a huge impact in the real world by using NFT and technologies to help solve such an important environmental problem.
