The proposed solution is extremely detailed, especially has further explanations of Training Kits & Tools: Cardano Cart & Payment Gateway Plugins (Cardano \u20b3DA Payment Plugins, COTI \u20b3DA Pay &DJED integration, Cardano Wallet Integration, Development of Cardano Cart, \u20b3DA Affiliate Referral Programs), education & marketing (Multimeda Multilingual Business Training, Events & meetings, Business Development Kit, Hubs Development Kit, Token Launch Kit, CCH Stake Pool Operator Kit, User Generated Content (UGC), Virtual Hubs). The team focus on building daily trading for products and services, active trading priced in \u20b3DA or other Cardano native currencies, and create real revenues and profits that are sustainable though all market conditions and are real beneficial use-cases or utility for the blockchain. There are good reasons why Cardano is Proof-of-Stake: Cardano allows low priced transactions; Cardano will overtake market capital of Etherium if a vibrant \u201cReal\u201d trading economy is created; and Cardano is highly transactional offering real products and services in return for Cardano native currencies. The proposal encourages Cardano enthusiasts to trade with each other and have the tools and incentives to bring new users onto the Cardano Blockchain by using the Cardano Hubs model.\nThe proposal will make the Cardano Blockchain much more active and increasing the ways the ecosystem can contribute to improving the world, and allow all types of people to participate in satisfying the objectives of the challenge. They will show existing business how they can be benefited, creating channels of communication from Cardano Community Hubs out into the wider world with quality structured proposals; and empower people to become ambassadors, make more money along the way, also offer practical tools & information.\nThrough the proposal, the main risks are explained with clear treatment solutions: First, \u201cresistance to new things\u201d: focusing on introducing their industry into daily life so that people can see the benefits for themselves, and also working on simple user interfaces and protecting the users from the more technical aspects. Second, \u201clack of understanding (Knowledge Gap)\u201d: educating in a simple and straight forward way while demonstrating real world and real financial benefits of their industry. Thirds, \u201ccommunicating the opportunities\u201d: adopting a policy of using straight forward, non-technical, language; and also demonstrating their industry\u2019s various functions and features. Forth, \u201cBlockchain congestion\u201d: communicating the timely improvements in a non-technical way, and also looking to provide the tidy and easy-to-see user interfaces that demonstrate the achieved efficiency by the Cardano blockchain. Fifth, \u201ccompeting Blockchains\u201d: avoiding direct contradiction of these people and continuing to drive the Cardano community to approach and collaborate with all members of their young industry. And finally, \u201ccreating smart contracts\u201d: approaching to create collaborations whereby creating user interfaces to input the terms of agreements in English that producing the necessary background code to manage and approve the smart contract terms.\n\"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\"The proposal offers a detailed plan with a specific roadmap and activity timelines for many different stages (Pre-Funding, Preparation, Funded launch, Implementation, Testing &Refine, Finalisation). The given plan is very reasonable  with the tasks which they have to complete, those are the Training Kits and Tools mentioned above, and how they need implement through each stage. In the section, the author haven\u2019t said the technical aspects, languages necessary to complete the project.\nThe proposer offers a extremely detailed budget breakdown and Cashflow, not only for key payments (Platform Development; Research, Data, Writing; Web 3, 3D Modeling; Translations; and Admin, Marketing), but also for smaller items (such as salary for human resource with  hourly, weekly details). This budget is reasonable when compared to the above plan, however, the team should add a standby budget to pay for the different inccured expenses. Besides, for funding, they will have to offer monthly reports on their website and social media channels for the community.\nThe team demonstrated their commitment & competences by completing previous funded proposals (Fund 7 & 8) and they have a substantial team of in house and external developers, translators, researchers and data entry assistants. They also have numerous advisors and executives able to be brought into the project as it grows, in current there are three key manager guiding the project who have all worked together for a period approximately 10 years on multiple projects. The proposer provides information of key members with skills, experiences and referent link, but not mentions their positions.\nWith all of the above (a detailed plan, a specific budget breakdown, a team with required skills, full experiences), the community have confidence the project will be completed successfully.\n\"", "q1r": 3, "q2": "\"The project will be monitored by monthly reports on their website and social media channels for the community, and under the policy of \u201cShow not Tell\u201d, they will be developing everything in public and open-source, therefore all progress can be monitored in real-time. The progress will measured by specific Key metrics of Training Kits & Tools and their targets: Business Training Measurements; Cardano Cart & Payment Gateway Plugins Measurements; Education & marketing Measurements; MetaVERSE Measurements; Community Building Measurements. Through the proposal, the team are very serious and clarity with their goals, presented by clear explanations for Key metrics and their target, and their results which they will offer in a detailed data report.\nIf the proposal is successful, the project will not depend on Project Catalyst funding any more, the operators of Hubs will aim to become financially seft-sustainable in the long term. The community will use their business tools to build online businesses offering products and services priced in \u20b3DA, prioritising to pay by Cardano native currencies. They make referrals through affiliate programs in return for incentives and promote Cardano to existing businesses, bringing them into the Cardano Community. And Cardano will use the metaverse to conduct digital business and be seen as the leader for Blockchain Businesses. Besides, they will also see Cardano Community Hubs as businesses, and the leading edge of building will be the Cardano ecosystem, the number of community members and the volume of new transactions on the Cardano Blockchain.\nThough not mentioned in this section, the proposal can be considered as a continuation of a previously funded project in Catalyst because of its given solution, \u201cbuilding Training Kits & more software tools with COTI \u20b3DA Pay, helping Cardano Hubs show the world we are the Blockchain for real-world business & increase \u20b3DA denominated ecosystem transactions\u201d.\n\"", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_4097", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Thank you for your assessment!"}, {"id": 13762, "q0": "i)Benefit to cardano\nThis project focuses on how to grow the cardano blockchain environment through an increases in traffic, flow of information(teaching and learning),increase in trade of cardano as a whole and also growth to the community, as the Coti adapay system is adopted it will lead to rapid growth in the usage of ada as more people will see it as a viable method of payment and as it will use security from the cryptographic layer.

The most specific and accurate is to build a solid economy ADA does NOT rely on \u201cFinancial Engineering\u201d. It emphasizes the creation of multiple transactions around the Cardano ecosystem. The author explains very clearly and in detail when it comes to the advantages of our Cardano ecosystem, down to what important activities will be implemented and developed in the next 6 months. The challenge of building Profitble Cardano Hubs can be a challenge for both the proposer team and the Cardano community because the proponent has to execute and determine which of the six operational goals are the most important. should be implemented first. When one goal is successful, it will lead the way for 5 goals to expand the activities of the remaining Cardano ecosystem. However, there is still a limitation, which I think the author has not mentioned, that is business training, how will the writer build the number of people interested in creating the Cardano Community Center? If this proposal lasts for 6 months, what will the team do in the first month, the second month, and the third month... to measure and improve if the results are not as expected. I highly recommend the ADA affiliate referral program, this is a bright anchor for marketing activities to attract new users, but if possible, it should be more specific, this program will provide commissions like how? I repeat, this is a good practice, so clarification is needed to take advantage of the original direction of the proposal.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project budget and cash flow 2022 are very detailed, I appreciate that the proponent created a separate pdf file to show the use and allocation of the budget.

However, I only saw Mr. Carl Henry who announced the activities of this project on the media, and the other 2 members could not verify their information on Linkedin, these two members have not to post anything related to the Cardano Community Hubs idea.

For example, with the goal How many hubs have registered for the course?, the goal is 200+ Hubs/Trainees - exactly how long it will take to reach this number, and when to start running the course program.\n\nIn summary, I rate 4 stars for this proposal, because the author has given quite detailed information, from cause to reason, how to do, and activities to propose to achieve successful implementation in detail. However, there is only one small point that I think the author should review, that we should prioritize choosing important goals for this challenge rather than having too many but the time is short, only 6 months.\n\nThe proposal is a clear description of a solution that will be positive for the activities that create the Cardano merchant economy and fits the challenge description perfectly.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3191", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 3, "ng": 7, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "I'm pleased you have highlighted the proposed affiliate program, you are the first person to fully appreciate the power of this, more comprehensive detail will be publish soon.

The proposer also presents the argument against cryptomarkets and provides counterargument that places the importance on real trading revenues utilizing blockchain technology to an extent where the value of tokens become secondary importance. In a sense, the proposer is integrating cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in day-to-day trading to transform them into quantifiable units of trading, similar to traditional currency and the connection between share price and profits made by big corporations. The proposer wants to detach blockchain from the alleged ambiguity by channeling it into real transactional products. Various sub-projects have been prepared for this transformation (most notably Cardano cart where ADA is used to buy real products, NFTs,..).

So the newcomers can focus on building the utility without being gridlocked to hire expensive developers or long learning curve. \nThe other main point brought forward was to steer clear away from the financial manipulations of rugpulls/ISPO/sidetracking of new projects. \nThe team is working diligently to provide main open source developer tools for everyday utility and pool operators. \nThe ecosystem of cardano will only grow when such tools are available and become a plug and play component workspace. This will allow creative minds to flow into cardano and focus on what they do best, marketing skills, NFT art, commercial hubs etc\u2026 \nI foresee multiple projects that will benefit from this platform.
