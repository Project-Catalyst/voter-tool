The key requirement for this challenge (Dapps, Products & Integrations) is to promote the development of products and integrations that could help drive greater adoption of the Cardano blockchain. The team behind this proposal desires to create a secure and open-source (extra points for this \ud83d\ude0a !) software platform that would allow for the embedding and integration of devices with the Cardano blockchain. This proposal is both well thought through and well presented with a meticulous attention to explaining in layman\u2019s terms the key advance that the team intends to achieve. Love the Trezor Model T example \u2013 and if the voters have time to delve into the proposal \u2013 it is a valuable read. Effectively the team intends to develop an SDK for resource-constrained Cardano development that will provide required tools (and extensive documentation!) in Rust code for developers on the embedded systems side to work on high-assurance and enterprise-ready software. The team is planning on following up this proposal later with additional projects to expand the security of the platform and audit it. I think that the proposed impact of the project could probably have been a small notch higher if the team had contacted several hardware developers of production embedded applications to check for some preliminary feedback about their needs \u2013 beforehand, so that these needs could be incorporated into the scope of this proposal. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind this proposal is an experienced team that has provided links about the competencies of their key members taking part in implementation of the proposals. The company MLabs is well known inside the Cardano world for contributions to developing out components of the Cardano infrastructure and they have submitted proof of their competencies in terms of working with Haskell, Plutus and other programming languages. MLabs works with dozens of developers and has partnered with many key Cardano community projects, including Dexes, NFT minting services and DeFi hubs. The team has broken down the required work for the project into 1200 hours total, with 600 hours going for engineering work and documentation, plus 600 hours of the time dedicated to \u201cchange\u201d. The team has addressed the use of the change budget as there is always uncertainty regarding the extent to which Cardano can be transposed to resource-constrained hardware systems. I think it is great that the team has set aside and been transparent about the need to plan for this contingency/risk \u2013 especially as MLabs is heavily involved in software-level R&D in the blockchain world. The required $96,000 budget works out to $80/hour for the budgeted 1,200 hours of work. As regards the planning, the team has been clear about explaining their intentions \u2013 as this team is clearly competent in terms of the required technical requirements for implementation \u2013 including the required technologies and programming languages. I have no doubts that there is a clear feasible path to realization as the team has taken the precautions of budgeting for R&D, and I applaud the team for thinking about how to further decentralize the entire Cardano ecosystem. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I would commend the proposing team for making a very good presentation of the problem that they want to address and for explaining even to a layman how they intend to approach the solution. This does not mean the explanation was simplistic, in fact the team has provided such a nuanced and gradual presentation of the problem - that it enabled me to learn more about this aspect of blockchain (Cardano-specific) integration level that I was not really even aware of previously. The proposers have included a list of deliverables that they intend to produce and three-month, six-month and twelve-month milestones. The delivery of the wallet SDK, compatible with the ARM Cortex-M series of processors, is a clear and auditable deliverable. The stretch goal (HW prototype, relying on, e.g., a Nordic nRF52840 development board, that uses the SDK) \u2013 seems to remain up in the air as it is defined as a stretch goal \u2013 as I am not completely clear on whether it will be delivered \u2013 but it probably depends on the outcome of the R&D phase. Overall, the metrics correspond to the projects aims. The way that this proposal is written inspires confidence that the team is very well aware of the new ground that it is treading with the proposed venture into the realm of embedded devices. Special commendation for planning ahead and for laying out a roadmap (not covered by this specific proposal) for further advancing the security of the platform through audit and formal verification, as well as plans for exploring the possibility of running a HW and a cardano-node/mithril-node) on the same device.

The inspiration came from the current problem that projects using embedded systems are subject to resource-constrained settings such as network band-width...\nFirst, the proposer states the problem very deeply with a case study of how individuals and organization can custody funds so that only authorized users can assess them. By suggesting some current solutions such as Trezor or Ledger and analysizing their limitations of Trezor at the softwware level, the proposer gives an idea of building a HW designed from the ground up for Cardano community, but the proposed scope of the project could be expanded in the future. They seek to help developers overcome the hurdle of  poorly-defined pratices and enable them to use Cardano everywhere even with the smallest and most resource-constrained system. This shows that the proposer has a very good understanding of the technical issues and the current problems. \nTherefore, for the first phrase, the proposer plans to develop a wallet SDK - a tool that can be used by developers to design their own HWs. I think this tool can have high chance of applicability for developers and individuals and this is a very promising project which could increase the utilization of embedded systems on Cardano as the existing tools stated by the proposer are not accessible for individuals and smaller organizations.\nMy concern is that this proposal is the first phrase of a bigger and long-term goal of the proposer and we could see that there are many risks or unanswered questions stated by the proposer for this project. I understand that these risks are unexpected and I would like the proposer to explain more how to mitigate each risk. This show that they have a good preparation for carring out their project in the future and make a good move before turning to the another phrase.  After all,  I fully support this proposal and hope it successfully. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Well, the proposer gives all the basic information regarding the plan, budget and the team which shows the feasiability of carrying out this project. However, I believe they could have done better by adding more details in some parts, in order to generate a better understanding of the whole development process of the project, the use of the budget and the team ability. I suggest the proposer should make plan more visually by infographics for community better understanding and following your project easier. Starting with the plan, the proposer devides plan into 3-month period within one year, but I'm not sure when the project will start and finish (from which month/year to which month/year for each period), I mean, the proposer could do it more clearly about the timeline. Moreover, the proposer should give each task more detailed for each period. For example, the proposer said they will begin to develop features for wallet SDK and it is possible to build the code, but I wonder what kind of features they will develop for the wallet? And who will be in charge of building the code? How will they do that?. Also, I think the proposer should have detailed marketing strategy for project when the platform is ready for use. I am not clear about who will be in charge of documentation and blog posts?. Regarding the project's expenses, the proposer claims a total cost and total engineering hours, and gives total hours for each main task which I am appreciated. But I would like the proposer to show clearly how much dollars for each hour. Of course, I could calculate it myself ($80/hour) which is quite fair for professionals. Also, I would like the proposer to explain a little more about total hours for \"Change budget\". I'm not sure what the proposer mean by change budget?. And finally, speaking of them, the team all belong to the MLabs- a development firm in the Cardano ecosystem in helping many community projects. In the early stage of the projects, it is good to make use of developers resources in the community. As far as I know, the core team includes 3 members, and the proposer introduces briefly about each person. I know their name, their roles in MLabs, their brief history of what they have done so far and give Github link for reference. My suggesstions are: provide some means for us to contact them, for example Linkedin profiles if they have one; if necessary, provide some evidence of their CVs. After all, with all the basic feasiablility information, it would be better if they could explain a litte more detail. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Well, the auditability of the process of this project is based on some several metrics: the number of completed deliverables, the number of resolved issues in the codebase, feedback from community, the number of projects incorporating their embedded systems tool and possibly a working prototype... These metrics are essential to know, but the proposer could also go further and explain a litte more about how and where the Cardano community could check these indicators. Also, as I mentioned before, if community know exact person who is in charge of which task in the project, it is easier for them to follow up. For example, to measure the community interest, how would feedback be measure and which channel will be used to measure? Will a survey be carried out or which marketing channels for community to update about this project? For other metrics too, I think, the information is quite general from the author but not give detailed on how these metrics will be measured and where the community could check it. Regarding the success outlook of the project, it is quite simple. It would be better if the author could give their expected qualitative number about each indicator. For instance, how many people from community getting interested in the project will be a success? how many developers want to use their wallet tool?  After all, the auditability of this project is possible, but it can be presented deeper with some more qualitative analysis from the author.

In this proposal for the first stage of platform development, products such as:\n- A wallet SDK, compatible with ARM Cortex-M series of processors, minimally CIP-21 compliant, and ideally equivalent to a Cardano wallet\n- A well-defined design pattern for resource-constrained applications based on the Cardano blockchain: Plutus scaffolding\n- Stretch target: An HW prototype, e.g. based on the Nordic nRF52840 development board, using the SDK.

Speaking of the roadmap, the proposal offers us 3 milestones: what works to be done in 3,6, and 12 months. However, in my opinion, the proponent should update the roadmap in more detail such as breaking down the activities that will take place by the month so that it is easier for us to understand time and space. More details about the activities will be needed, would also be great if you understand how long these activities will take to complete? Who will be responsible for each activity? I think the information the author gives is good, but it is not enough to explain to me exactly what is going to happen.\nSpeaking of budget, the project asked for $96,000 and announced that the total time for this project was 1200 engineering hours or $80 for 1 work hour. However, I think the budget justification could be better explained. That is, the proposal lists some key work to be done along with hours to complete such as \"Design, architecture, specification, initialization/scaffolding: 120 hours; Implement and superficially test core features: 240 hours\". Since this is a very technical project, I think the author needs to explain in more detail about these activities, besides how many members will be involved in each category. Also, the budget asking for an extra 600 hours (I understand it's difficult to repeat the exact time given but asking for an extra 600 hours (= $48,000 for a $96,000 project) is not a small deal. a small number, your explanation that the budget change is due to \"uncertainty about how we can get Cardano into resource-constrained hardware systems\" I think it's a bit vague. it would be more convincing if you explain what extra items it will be used for, why don't you add time for those items in the first place but ask for such an estimate?\nAnd finally, about the team, we know that the members working on this project are mainly members of MLabs, the main network, and development contributor to the Cardano ecosystem. The three main members of the project are Hari Amoor (Systems Engineer and Programmer), Michael Hollister (Embedded Systems), and George Flerovsky (Delivery Manager). Arguably the team is the part that best describes the viability of the project. We know their names, and their role in the project, and a small text is also attached to reveal the history of those involved. It's good that they include links to each member's GitHub, that way we can have actual proof of the work they say they do.

As the challenge listed the type of proposals that could be included one of them is \u201cHardware\u201d which fit the scenario of this project. The problem spotted out the initial need to run Cardano in multi-location and resource-subjective contexts with the need of specifying access to users. By comparing the cons of resource-usage and accessibility of current technologies (Amazon S3, FIDO2) following the missing layout of Cardano Hardware wallets, the project has listed out the potential of embedding their applications through compatible features (in programming languages, extensibility, etc \u2026)  as well as bringing the Embedded Cardano SDK  design through references towards cryptographic primitives, hashing, transaction scalability and prototype of Mithril (envision development to security verification). From this point, the complexity of technological impact is pretty impressive. The community impact to reduce the centrality of huge competitors (Microsoft, Google) is well depicted in the use-case of login authentication. The foreseen vision of connecting Cardano wallets through a decentralized process (resource-constrained setting, remote server protocols) could have a very massive impact that would enhance the power of Cardano scalability. The description on the proposed solution is well explained towards the widespread use of the SDK development process through persuasion on processors compatibility, prototype and publicity of their research. Future challenges are also noted below which relate to security and device enhancement with specific solutions of expanding knowledge into the community.

Throughout the detailed plan it seems that the project should include a target community (like developers or students) to be included with the criteria of giving what value to that target. Promotion strategy should be creating instruction of usage to users (for example : Youtube tutorial) since the technological amount behind the product is considered huge.

The value proposition is to develop an open source platform that can streamline the embedding process of the Cardano blockchain into hardware devices, in principal hardware wallets. So while the project will not deliver a hardware wallet itself, it will enable other developers / manufacturers to produce in an easier fashion Cardano compliant wallets by using the modules developed by MLabs. \n\nThis is certainly a very niched project, without a very obvious end product in mind that the general Cardano user can relate to, but it can definitely turn into a backbone piece of enabling software that can boost competition on the market for hardware wallets. For instance we can think of mobile-specific implementations where the software can be deployed to turn the phone into a light hardware wallet, with certain functionalities similar to authenticator apps. Or, as the proposers mention as a strong use case, capture the demand from developers to run applications that already collect data from IOT devices that have to be published on chain, like for instance Adosia or Veritree. \n\nThere is definitely a strong case to be made for funding such a software development project, while at the same time being mindful that it will not be easy for general ADA holders to cut through the proposal\u2019s complexity and observe the potential behind it.

MLabs promises to deliver the results within a year\u2019s time from the start of the project. The first three months would be used for an initial exploration phase and for developing the wallet\u2019s SDK. Six months from start the platform should be already emerging with most of the features live, and at this point signing transactions on prototype hardware should be possible. For real techies this would imply for instance starting with an STM32 board and loading the software onto it. The end of the year would see a fully functional product ready to be used by any developer that wishes to embed the software into various hardware pieces. As the technology possibilities are still not 100% known, the scope might be slightly variable, for example it is not clear if such implementations will only be able to run a wallet exclusively or perhaps they will be capable of running an entire Cardano node. \n\nThe MLabs team is very extensively presented into the proposal, and let me offer just a flavor of their competencies and background: with a team of over 80 devs and as a company that are an IOG Plutus partner, they have already been involved in plenty of Cardano projects, with the most known ones perhaps being  Sundae swap and Liqwid. An excellent point of the proposal is that the core team for this specific proposal is extensively presented within the proposal itself, including links to their github pages, thus making it easy to verify certain things and generally obtain a better view of the team\u2019s skills and background. \n\nThe budget is very reasonable in my opinion, since they are asking for a modest amount considering the highly skilled competencies required for the development phase and the rather unknown complications that might emerge during the process. The entire project is estimated to take around 1200 engineering hours, split between research, architecture building, implementation, testing and documentation. There is also a significant \u201cchange budget\u201d of 600 hours (so 50% of the total) included which accounts for the extent to which the team will be capable of bringing Cardano to hardware which is more resource-constrained than the systems currently being connected to the ecosystem. .   \n\nOverall a very solid proposal with excellent feasibility prospects.

On the bright side, I really appreciate the team for giving us a brief introduction of your team with their background and skills and through that, I\u2019m very confident to say that the proposers have sufficient potential to make this project work.

To audit this project in the future, I\u2019m almost certain that the community will need to see your specific KPIs. KPIs should stick with your milestone and different period of time while launching this project. For instance, the number of deliverables, listed above, completed, the number of resolved issues in the codebase, the number of contributors and their extent of contribution, the number of projects incorporating your promised embedded systems tool\u2026 What is your goal for those numbers after a certain amount of time (3 months, 6 months, a year?) We can only measure the success of your key metrics through numbers. Hence, the team should work on building short-term and long-term KPIs.

To fully decentralize, the hardware required to communicate with Cardano should be as simple as feasible, according to the proposer. Although embedded systems are used in certain Cardano projects, best practices are still being developed. To address this issue, the solution proposes a secure and open-source software platform for embedded devices on the Cardano blockchain, applicable to hardware wallets and other devices buildable using our primitives, which aligns with the aims of the challenge. The team gave us important information about the project and how it would be developed? How will it meet the demands of Cardano users? And what benefits would the proposal bring to the ecosystem? A dedicated session showcasing impact is also extremely appreciated because it clarifies the value proposition. The proposed team includes plans for scaling up the project, as well as some potential difficulties and solutions that I believe are appropriate. I highly believe that this idea not only handles the difficulty successfully, but also identifies a significant need within the community and for future growth throughout the Cardano Ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "MLabs definitely has a lot of expertise in the ecosystem, having worked on some of the most important Cardano projects. This proposal demonstrated an experienced and outstanding team, as seen by their Github respiratory profile. Not only is the team role well defined and described, but each member has years of prior expertise in their respective field. All of these elements give assurance that the proposer will be able to carry out the idea. Budget-wise, the proposal's key components are broken down in budget with the number of working hours necessary for each that produces the final budget total where the cost per hour is $80. While the total working hours of each position are specified, it would be important to know who and how many individuals do what role, as well as extra information on their tasks (whether the workloads of each are equivalent?). It is also vital to know 800 hrs in total referring to what time-frame (in 3 months, 6 months or 12 months) as it is not stated in the proposal. As a result, an accurate assessment of the explanation for the required amount is difficult. Despite an imprecise budget breakdown, the team provides a well-defined timetable with milestones of 3, 6, and 12 months, allowing us to observe what happens at each step and what tasks will be completed over time. Furthermore, milestones are practical and reasonable. If the team considers my recommendation, it will be more advantageous to the project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In terms of traceability and auditability, the team performed an excellent job; we have clear timelines and milestones for auditing the proposal. With the team's capabilities and commitment, I believe the roadmap and targets within 12 months are feasible. Key metrics are mentioned, however I'd like to understand how you plan to achieve some of these metrics and why they are important. Another aspect that could be addressed is that there is no mention or real links to whatever channel or platform the community will be able to audit the project.

Presenting a concise but effective budget for the audit, we can clearly define the direction of the cash flow to be allocated to which items, and it is built on the main project tasks and the number of items working hours of each task.

I am appreciated by the author's deep analysis of the problem and understanding of the current market and how he got inspired to solve this case. My concern is that this is a new idea and there are quite many risks that the team have to solve in the process of carrying out this project, my suggesstion is that they should have some idea on how to deal with the foreseen issues.

The proposer has one year plan and it is devided into 3-month period each. The plan for carrying out this proposal is quite simple but it seems that the proposer know what need to be done for each period. However, I would like the proposer to give more detail regarding the timeline for executing each period and the whole project. Regarding the project's cost, I think it is enough for me as it includes information about the total cost and hours for the whole project and the number of needed hours for each main task. Finally, I think, from the team background from MLabs, I think they are qualified enough to carry out this project.

For example, I suggest, by publishing weekly report or holding some livestream or small talk to share about their project,..by which they could get community interest and the community could follow up their project too.
