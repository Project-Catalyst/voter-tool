There is no transparency or ownership over our own data, leaving us at the mercy of nefarious actors and productized for someone else's gain.", "f6_no_assessments": 5, "f6_rating": 4.133333333333333, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 401, "q0": "The Mainline application is an application for decentalized social intelligence that helps people understand how social media is being used with data about the profiles, interactions and posts made by users on different platforms. Some of the features that Mainline is introducing is network graph visualisation of social media data, profile page information such as engagement, authenticity, activity, influence an audits and then also leaderboard pages that compare profiles against each other based on these different variables and metrics. Algorithms are mentioned as the way they deal with the scoring of profiles against different variables. Finally the $MAIN token and DAO are detailed which outlines how the token focusses on driving how data is prioritised from these platforms as there is such a vast amount of data to collect. The token also helps with governing priorities of the ecosystem. The tokenomics could have had a bit more detail as it is difficult to fully understand whether it will be easy to create right incentives for the token holders to influence the platform to collect the data which is most valuable to the holders. As a comparison it could have been good to understand what kind of value users of this system put on this application - in a web 2 setting what would they pay for this monthly in a subscription to have access to this information? How does that translate into the tokenomics of this application? Is this a service that people want to pay someone else to do to get the information or is it something that people want to actively participate in themselves? Stating the risk of the complexities introduced with these tokenomics would have been beneficial to understand these risks in more depth. Overall the solution is well articulated and there is potential for this proposal to create impact in the ecosystem if the integration into Cardano and the tokenomics are well executed.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers have already created an alpha version of this product and have videos showcasing how it can be used with comprehensive explanations. In terms of the progress moving forward they have a number of quarter based roadmaps provided that have itemised lists of tasks they intend to execute. In terms of cost breakdown the proposal has broken down how the budget will be spent based on the functional areas such as backend, frontend, smart contracts and marketing efforts. The itemised list provides sufficient depth and clarity on exact intentions. The team is listed with their skill sets and all have professional profiles attached. The team has a diversity of skill sets and has already showcased they are able to execute the previous work. They do not have a Plutus/Haskell developer internal to the team which increases the risk on the delivery or quality of execution for this key area. Due to the depth of information provided, detailed breakdown and evidence of previous delivery and teams background a higher confidence is given that the team will be able to effectively secure the haskell developer needed and feasibly execute the intentions of the proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For tracking the proposals progress the team mention outcome based metrics for the usage of the applicaiton. It would have been good for the team to share how they intend to share progress with the community such as through Github repository commits, progress reports or video updates so that community can more easily engage in the execution of this proposal and provide feedback. It would have also been nice to share any intentions to open source certain efforts from the proposal that would benefit the community or intentions to do so. Success for the proposal gave a high level goal of having community members participate and be rewarded by earning in the ecosystem being developed. It would have been been good to have more specific objectives for the application to showcase that the team fully understands what they are trying to achieve with this specific funding so that the community can more effectively determine whether impact have in fact been delivered. Clarity of the proposal was to a good standard due to the explanations given, illustrations and links to existing implementation efforts.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2073", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 3, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1575, "q0": "While the proposal aims to create something that would be an overall improval as it would give users the ability to make some money off their own data, it doesn't completely solve the problem described in the problem statement, as other actors will still have custody over one's data, but now there's just more ways that one's data can be utilized. Some of those added features are however invaluable, like the network graphs that might help more people see through the algorithmic echo chambers dominating social media at the moment (while they off course won't be uncreated at the same time. Overall this proposal will probably have some positive impact. Considering the big amount of data, we will see whether a good scalability solution will be devised to run this on the blockchain. Currently no Open Source solution is provided, so how is transparency really guaranteed?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It can be noted that some work has been put into the feasibility section of this proposal. The team is transparent about their members (at least those they have so far) and about the budget. The budget is overall well-made, and would be even better if time estimations/hourly rates were attached to the various items. A slightly negative thing is that a Plutus/haskell developer has not yet been acquired. The roadmap is satisfying and a contigency plan was made to adress possible risks. Technicalities are explained sufficiently to identify what is going to be done. Overall good feasibility.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In my opinion the proposal is pretty clear in what is going to be achieved, so the WHAT is being audited part is pretty easy to figure out. The metrics/KPIs make sense, are a bit brief however and could encompass more of the parameters discussed before. What bothers me is that at the moment the only way to track the progress of the project is to sign up to the project and in the process also give consent to the usage of the social media data. I definetely recommend finding another way to track the progress.

The use case is described clear and with much detail so the voter can see what goals want tob e reached and how the application works and can help to provide support with real life problems or inefficencies. Fort he cardano blockchain and the challenge setting this proposals shows clear support for social media topics and fits good in the portfolio. One point that could be added would be why cardano is a better choice than other blockchains so that the reader connects better with the project and see\u00b4s the advantage.\n\nCompetitor:\nAs Data tools for social media are already pretty common, there is a clear risk that there are already other tools on the market that solve the same problem. E.g. Google has an analizing tool for years in existence. This is an important point that needs tob e addressed by the project team and is unfortunatly missing.\n\nLink to challenge setting and other challenge settings:\nThe link to the challenge setting is given, as this project is build to create data support for social media purposes and therefor fits good in this category. Also a DAO is beeing developed so things can be integrated on an open source and decentralized way that supports the guidance of Cardano and Catalyst. \n\nRisks:\nTwo risks are written down that can be seen as important by the prject team. The bear market and platform APIs. As the second risk is clearly given the first risk mentioned should not be too important for a project that wants to get funded. The reason for the funding process is to give support tot he teams so they don\u00b4t need to look at such pirce-market-conditions. Other more important risks are unfortunately missing and should be added to give the voter a \nbetter overview of bulletpoints that need to be considered.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Showing of realistic timetable:\nThere is a quarterly timetable with clear written milestones that show a good overview. As there are also finished points written down, it can be seen that the timetable is rather realistic and can be achieved. For such a big project a more detailed timetable with deadlines fort he subproject would be beneficial so the reader/voter can gain more confidence and the picure is even more professional.\n\nBudgetfit:\nThe budget break down is stated clearly and realistic and seems to fit to the goals and ToDo\u00b4s that are written down. To give transperancy fort he auditability part a more detailed budget is always welcome so KPIs and milestones can be controlled in an easier way.\n\nMotivation/drivers:\nUnfortunately there is no clear statement about the project teams motivation rather than trying to give a value add tot he cardano community. The structure of the DAO and their coin $MAIN incentivises the project team to be successful and get things done in time to drive value of the project. Also external drivers and early supporters are mentioned on their website so ther are parties pushing for success which can be seen rather positive. \n\nTeammembers and experience:\nAll teammembers LinkedIn profiles are tagged so the voter can get easy information on the background of the people working on the project. There are clear structures and task sharings so it is likely that the team operates efficient. A nice to have would be some additional words on the teams experience together so the voter can gain even more confidence on the success.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "KPIs and goals:\nThere are clear written KPIs that the voter and the community can track the success against. The KPIs are written towards the application growth and there operational success rather than the project milestones and development success. This should be added to not only have an external view on the projects success but also an internal look so problems or issues can be seen early stage and tackled before they become critical. \n\nCommunication channels and audits:\nUnfortunately there is no clear mentioned communication channel fort he community to get access to their development and success. The growth of the KPIs could be shown interactive on the webside. This would be a big plus to gain more confidence a show a glass clear vision of transperency of the project. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2848", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8990, "q0": "The problem in this proposal is aligned with the challenge in that way that it can attract a lot of users. I have been using social media since 2005, when social media was used only for interacting with friends. Back in 2005 there was no question whether a profile was managed by a human or not. It usually was, but nowadays things have changed. \nSocial media have become a platform of politics and advocacy campaigns. Often with the help of bots, like how a foreign country had an impact on the 2016 presidential election in the US. \nThis dapp could be the solution to this problem. The website looks solid and trustworthy. It was very easy to register an account. In the dapp, users can select what information they want to get a live feed on. Users can also select if they want to show posts that are from verified accounts only. There are lots of more filters to apply all in order to get rid of trolls and bots from the users feed. \n\nThe DAO uses the MAIN token to get capital in order to cover the costs of storing huge amounts of data. The idea is that instead of ads the token will be used for sustainability without a third party involvement. Users can stake tokens and setup a stream of information that they think will go viral. The proposal also takes the ongoing bear market in account as one of the main risks with the project. The proposers do think that the use case of the DAO will override the bear market and get investors anyway. \n\nThis proposal provides a strong use case in the form of a social media x-ray vision as the proposers call it, that filters out trolls and bots. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Given the experience of the seven team-members presented in this proposal and that the website is already up and running, it is highly likely that the proposal will be implemented successfully.

If there would be any kinds of challenges presented in the timeline, this would provide a more thoughtful presentation.\n\nThe budget is outlined clearly with database upgrades as the biggest piece.
