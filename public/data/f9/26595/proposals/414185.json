How do you handle it when your order has a lot and you don't have it? As for teammates, I believe it will be challenging to accomplish if we do not have the support of the community. This is probably a good idea.

The first one would work as a ladder, to get money to invest on the second. While I liked both of these real life applications, it's kind of difficult to see they working in a logical sequence, from a business perspectives. They are completely different type of business and the capabilities/knowledge and customers gained with the first one will hardly be used in the second. it would make more sense to start with a more alike business (if fitness clubs are the final goal) to leverage more than just the money and have more sinergeis. Or maybe proposer could clarify better here why they have chosen these two business (maybe there's a very fair reason but the connection/motivation between them is not clear).\nHaving said that, the proposal, for this fund at least, seems to be mostly focused on the car rental/property business. The idea is valid and is aligned with challenge as it focus on \"Physical products (Tokenised housing as a Cardano native asset, International crypto headquarters and liason office on every continent, etc)\", very clearly stated in challenge description as one of the key examples of proposals. It will help people to see more utility on NFT and possibly attract new ADA holders. An attached presentation helps to illustrate how the project is strucutred and the business would work.

First, the idea of using NFT to represent real-world services and assets has been around for a while. The implementation has been limited so far, as we only NFT represents some event tickets only (similar to how a QR code would do). The main reason for that limited implementation is a legal complication (e.g. dispute mechanism) and I don't think the proposer has identified an impactful way to address this key challenge. The proposed business model for the first phase (i.e. car rental) is very unclear to me to assess the impact. For example, which specific location does the proposer plan to implement the car rental business, and what could convince the community that this car rental business is better/cheaper/faster than other existing solutions in the market that could support car rental users to buy the NFT? If the NFT holders are treated as \"shareholders\" who will benefit from the rental businesses down the road, what does the governance look like? Overall, the proposal is not clear to me how it would deliver an impact on the Cardano community and help meet the strategic goals.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I disagree that this project is feasible. This proposal of creating a rental car business for NFT buyers (the current phase) is not feasible on multiple fronts: the ability to address the problem to solve, the assessment of critical capabilities to build/acquire, lack of relevant skill sets, and budget not planned carefully. I would suggest the proposer really focus on creating a good solution that solves a real-world pain point before thinking about NFT as a gamified feature on top of it. At this moment, the proposer focused a great deal on designing and creating an NFT theme, which I don't think would be value-added to real-world business solutions. If I want to rent a car, I won't just make a decision based on a fun NFT; the car rental business itself must have better value versus other service providers in the market. Car rental is also capital intensive, geography constrained which the proposer did not demonstrate how it would address. The proposer also mentioned house purchases using NFT and my experience suggests that the legal complication to user NFT to represent real estate ownership is heavy-loaded. The proposer touched on legal and tax complications but I don't think they have a clear sense of its complexity, evident in their underestimation of the legal fee ($5000 is a very low budget for the expected legal scope of this project). It is also still a one-person team who has some experience in crypto but not in the car rental business or real estate business. In another scenario, if NFT holders are more similar to shareholders in the traditional finance world, we would need a stronger governance system (e.g. smart contract, voting rights, governance design) than just fun-themed NFTs. I would strongly suggest the proposer to further develop a reasonable business model, gather more team members with relevant experience, and break the project down into achievable smaller goals.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I strongly disagree that this project is auditable. The proposal is not verifiable and the main reason is it unclear description of the problem and solution. The proposer is asking for funds to execute this particular phase which is a car rental business using NFT, but the success is about a health and fitness chain. The roadmap is very high level with no specific milestones beyond designing and distributing the NFTs and is not coherent.

In this way, a certain cost could already be reduced. A lot of time has already gone into making a sensible plan and budgeting for the project. Instead of taking a milestone every 2 weeks, it might be better to choose to take a longer period of time. The project is certainly feasible if there is sufficient support from chains that want to use their product. No additional financing will be required in the future.

The proposer wants to take the influence of Cardano further so that it can involve in real business (in this case, they want to launch a health and fitness club chain that is fully functional with cNFTs as memberships and tracking as well as accepting $ADA for services), and that definitely matches some criteria of this challenge. I can see that the intention of this proposal is increasing Cardano's influence in real life and make it a reason to attract more people to come to Cardano. Moreover, it can be a huge boost for the value of Cardano and ADA. In terms of an idea, I agree that this idea aligns with the challenge. \nHowever, through the proposal presentation, the proposer has only shown us the idea and a very vague vision of how this idea works but not the building process. I have no idea whatsoever how the team going to make this idea come true. How are they going to create a cNFT, using which resources, and how to blend it into our ecosystem? How are they going to bring a marketing campaign in to achieve their purpose of using NFT technology to empower individuals to start using the blockchain in the real world? Which Cardano resources are they going to use and what another tool will they use or need to build in? The team wants to connect the users, but how? I don\u2019t find this information in this proposal. \nThe team doesn\u2019t have a piece of strong evidence to show us how this challenge will affect the Cardano ecosystem such ask clear key metrics, or KPIs, \u2026 So, in terms of the outcome, I don\u2019t see much impact being shown here. The team still has a lot of work to do with this part, I think it would be better if we can see a brief introduction of the current problem that you want to solve (like how much Cardano is involved in businesses in real life or if ADA is accepted anywhere as a payment method for services), it can be through numbers, demographic or any kind of more detailed picture, then you can put your solution in the picture to show us how it\u2019s going to solve each problem and specific what you\u2019re building on Cardano.

What I can suggest the team does here is to build some milestones that you want to achieve, then build a timeline around those milestones (What work is needed to be done to achieve those milestones, how many hours are needed, and so on,) better do break it down into multiple periods of time. The budget breakdown should strongly stick to it. \nFor the human resources aspect, I\u2019m certain that the proposer has sufficient skills and experience to run this idea.

First, voters are looking to this section to be told how this proposal is going to change the status quo. That impact should appeal to increased adoption of the Cardano ecosystem (which also needs to be quantifiable) or it can point to an increase in user experience within the Cardano ecosystem to make it more advanced/innovative. This section of the proposal describes general possibilities of use cases (and intention of fulfilling some of those utilities) but it does explain how this utility is logistically implemented. I think it would be much easier for voters to focus on car rentals (as the proposal says will be the starting place) and more thoroughly explain the logistics of that utility. The voters will want to see something unique and innovative that provides an appeal that traditional utilities (car rentals for example) have a disadvantage over. In this section, I\u2019m not certain if this collection of NFTs is meant to compete with other NFTs (and perhaps solve the problem of NFTs lacking utility) or if it\u2019s aiming to compete with traditional investments (like a car rental company).

Since voters often view feasibility through the lens of core team experience, it is of the utmost importance that resumes and pictures - preferably in the form of a LinkedIn page - are provided in the proposal resources (especially for one of this price tag). One of the areas where the proposal is  missing some key information is in the rhetoric about smart contracts. Beyond what the smart contracts will do and why they are needed, the proposal needs to list the individual who will be building it because the capability to produce such a thing is not a common skill. Voters will vote negatively if they cannot clearly see that they are approving funds to someone that is capable building. For the budget and roadmap, I would suggest explicitly showing this information in the proposal, rather than having the voters reference attached documentation. They\u2019re more likely to vote favorably if they have all the information easily available to them. Specifically for the roadmap, I would suggest finding a developer first so that someone that is qualified to do that portion of the work can write a roadmap with all the step-by-step tasks and how many hours of labor it would take to build it out.

I think this section could include NFTs listed on secondary markets, number of NFTs that are actively using the built utilities, and perhaps the average amount of rewards a single NFT has earned (post proposal). Some of the better Catalyst proposals take the extra step to further define target metrics for all of these areas and establish progressive milestone based metrics for different timeframes of the life of the project.

From this 500.000$ ten percent (50.000$) are spend on (Management, artists and developers). This is pretty high \u201cfee\u201d compared with other alternatives. You could mitigate this by trying to get a bigger funding and having the same expenses. For example you try to sell NFTs for 5.000.000$ and spend 50.000$ on Management..
