They strive to lead the change towards a more open employment model and to help their members map their skills while discovering opportunities and making new connections. Goodwall has over 2 million users and is active in over 150 countries. I have actually joined the platform to understand it better - and there is definitely an interesting blend of job board / social media / course directory, focused on students and young professionals (16 to 24 years old). Goodwall have had one proposal funded in Fund 8 and have now come back in Fund 9 with six proposals totalling over 650k USD. \n\nTheir value proposition in this one is for Goodwall to develop a token and an in-app economy to provide reinforcement for users that encourages positive actions. Goodwall identifies a number of use cases for their token: (1) rewarding positive actions (creating own content or verifying other user\u2019s content), (2) spending it to gain access to opportunities. I would have really enjoyed seeing a more in-depth overview of the token use cases and revenue streams: what kind of outside flows will be used to incentivise the token use? Will it be possible to sell it on a DEX? Can it be otherwise exchanged back into ADA? Does Goodwall plan to develop partnerships with education institutions and offer free courses / incentives against their token?\n\nThere are many positive aspects of this proposal. Goodwall has 2 million users, they are targeting an excellent cohort (young, educated, worldwide audience), and the community should support them to build a tokenized in-app economy since this can drive more adoption in a very important age band! I would have gladly offered five stars for potential impact, but I think that not drilling down on tokenomics was a missed opportunity to really take the proposal to the next level and demonstrate an excellent understanding of what Cardano\u2019s ecosystem can sustain. Four stars.   ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Goodwall seems to have a fully fledged team, and they are super transparent about it. Their CEO is Taha Bawa, a Forbes 30 under 30 and Global Shaper (and that means a lot). Their website shows 65+ employees (all with Goodwall accounts of course, so easy to interact directly), and Linkedin shows 80+. I think their HQ is in Madrid, but they seem to be geographically distributed throughout Spain, Philippines, Switzerland and many other locations.  In the proposal itself they have included a list of management team and also three team members who will be leading this project as well as taking the Atala Prism pioneer course. So you can\u2019t really ask for anything more in terms of team transparency.  \n\nWhat is their plan? A 28 weeks timeline, divided in three main parts: preparation (requirements, user stories, architecture), execution (smart contracts, front end, back end, QA) and results (track token use, marketing plan execution). Budgetwise, the project will necessitate 1.500+ hours, with hourly rates between 50 for QA and 100 development (most of them). A definite plus of this proposal (compared to some of their other ones) is that having a DID in place (another proposal) and a tokenized economy (this proposal) are the first two logical steps, and a clear enabler for all the other ones (community endorsement system for instance, another proposal) - so it definitely has a timely characteristic attached to it. However, a 120k USD proposal should have definitely come before the voters with a much better problem definition scope of necessary work and demonstrate without a doubt that creating a Cardano based token economy and integrating it with their systems within the requested budget is sufficient, and necessary, for project completion. \n\nWith an excellent team and a good but not excellently detailed plan (but with a proposal that can enable many more projects on Goodwall\u2019s platform), I shall err on the optimistic side and offer the full five stars for this proposal\u2019s feasibility.

I think the impacts here are pretty well quantified in the cited 2 million users aged 16-24 from countries all over the world.

The team definitely has a set of well developed skill sets to continue carrying out this project to increased succession and I\u2019m excited to see that this team will be taking the Atala Prism pioneer course to facilitate their integration with Cardano. The roadmap is a little skeletal but plenty functional and deliverable in a 7 month timeframe. Minimal hesitation in that area. Normally, I would\u2019ve brought up some qualms with the cost of the proposal of this amount of requested funds (well over 3-4x the normal proposal cost). In this case, the magnitude of the impacts has made me forget about the cost up until this point. While expensive in total, the spending appears to be moderately reasonable compered to industry standards for companies of this preestablished caliber. Not cheap but reasonable. The biggest expense is the 960 hours of development for $100/hr, which is defnitlely on the expensive side.

Goodwalls tokenomics - design and its monetary policy. I propose that there should be a much detail information on this, such as, how are the tokens distributed? what are the predertemined number of tokens generated, and what are the securities to prevent speculation over the token that could affect ordinary users - for example taking account of traders or manipulation of the tokens? I assume that if users do create authentic content, and are get rewarded, multiply that and say most users are rational, this would create an inflationary token system, which would lead to not having a real value.  \n\n[Rationale]\nMy take would be, that the dApp do not require a token system, but being built on a decentralised manner, which will ensure the security and verifiability of its authentic content, also give the users its data rights. But how do Goodwall gain its revenue then? My suggestion is, to have ADA as its native token for subscribing for unique features on the dApp, this provides users to use ADA as a cryptocurrency. Next, we might incentivise users to stake their ADA to provide more security on the blockchain, in turn of gaining the standard yield from Staking Pool. So, what is the key selling point here?

What worries me, is the tight schedule of the plan as I do believe that this need more time especially on the program preparation. I suggest that the dApp is carefully planned, to get as perfect as possible from its marketing plan, front end design and architecture.

As funny as it sounds, trust comes first even in the blockchain industry.
