This has significantly tapered the income and creative freedoms of screenplay writers.", "f6_no_assessments": 10, "f6_rating": 4.1, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1650, "q0": "The problem is really something that happens a lot in the cinematographic universe, which is the difficulty in producing films due to an outdated industry full of intermediaries, which makes it difficult for artists to earn a fair income from their ideas and projects. To solve this, the proponent suggests the creation of a platform whose main objective is to help audiovisual professionals to produce their content more safely and also to have more rights over the sale and distribution of their scripts, as web3 would be used, the Blockchain technologies would be the tool for such content to be coined and monetized more adequately. In other words, theoretically, the proposal aligns well with the challenge of Dapps, as it seeks to create a Dapp that will attract a portion of people who are not necessarily involved with the cryptographic world. Audiovisual professionals would be interested in the initiative because of the advantages that creating cinema here would have, and not necessarily because of the blockchain and its technologies, although one thing would lead to another. The problem I identified with the proposal's impact is that, even though we carefully read the entire scope of the proposal, it is not so clear in what ways the Web3 technologies would be integrated into the platform. Some things are very well defined here, for example, the difficulties that professionals in the field face, such as \u201cwriters do not receive royalties for the idea they created + small stores to display their scripts for sample readings + little or no possibility of interact directly with actors or producers + spec scripts are going through handlers\u201d and so on. In general, transparency and quality control are lacking during the film creation process, according to the proponent. It is also very clear what the advantages of using the platform would be (creating a safety net and guidance for film industry participants + allows artists to have economic freedom across the film industry + allows new ideas and content to be presented to final consumers, etc.). But in relation to how the blockchain would be linked to all this, in my perception the explanations were a little summarized, so that we have no way of adequately understanding how Cardano would be used, in practice. What would be the contents minted on the blockchain? Would the NFTs be the scripts, would they be the other parts of creating the film? How could screenwriters track and share their ideas, both with other audiovisual professionals and with artificial intelligence? In this regard, it is said that artificial intelligence would be used to improve the quality of the content created and to make creative suggestions, how would this technology be built? Regarding the fee for companies, what would be the % compared to the costs of each film being produced? Would it be a fee charged per project, per professional\u2026? In general, my perception of this proposal is that, yes, it is a good idea and that in theory it fits with the objectives of the challenge (because it will create a valuable Dapp that will attract a new audience to Cardano, fostering our community) , but lacked some practical explanations about blockchain integration.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The roadmap presented in the proposal is not very adequate, the activities are presented on a quarterly basis and are not as detailed. It is said during the explanation of the impact that an effort would be made for many writers and companies in the field to get in touch with the platform, but during the explanation of the task schedule it is not mentioned how this would be done. The proposed activities are not well detailed, for example, how would the preparation of the software architecture be done, and what would be \u201csafeguarding the blockchain roadmap\u201d? As in the third quarter of this year, the other quarters should be their activities better explained. Each activity should contain an individual detail so that we could understand not only what would be done, but also how and who would do it; the temporal division could also be more specific. For example in Q1 2023, the focus would be on two activities: early access for some writers and cloud/API test security. What would happen in January, within these options, and in February? I believe that the way the roadmap is laid out, unfortunately we don't have a solid understanding of the processes that will be developed in the future. A positive point, however, that I think it is important to emphasize in terms of the script, is the milestones reached. The proponent defines some of the goals in the technology field (KI-Analyse Roadmap, licensing/selling roadmaps, internal process, blockchain implementation, cloud security and API, among others). For this part to be complete, in my opinion, it would also be important for us to know when each of these milestones is expected (in which months of both 2022 and 2023 they are expected to be reached). Talking now about costs, in my view, something similar to the presentation of the script happens: we know the basic information, but we don't have many explanations about how the money would be used. For example, $10,000 would be earmarked for UI/UX design, how would the interface be built, what would the designer's work routine be, what would be the price of his hour of work? The same doubts arise in relation to the other parts, such as the backend developments, AP implementation and etc\u2026 How would the community development be done? Perhaps here, in this part, the issue of disclosure within the cinematographic environment would fit, but it still remains a little open. Talking about the team, we actually have a duo defined here, an average trust is transmitted in those involved, since they are given some information about them (but not so much), their linkedin profiles or other ways of verifying the information are not provided that are passed. I also believe that the team still has to be complete, for example with a designer. It would be important for all members to be properly introduced.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The information provided about the auditability of progress seems pretty safe in the sense that the team stays organized and constantly and solidly monitors its progress, but it doesn't give us as much confidence as to how such information would be conveyed to members of the Cardano community. It is said that progress would be tracked by the Scrum framework, it is positive how the proponent explains the workings of the tool (\"the Scrum framework is based on transparency, inspection and adaptation and will allow us to move forward at sustainable speed and deliver the parts of the product in small iterations \u201d). In this way, those readers of the proposal who had not previously come into contact with this technology would have a better understanding of how it would be developed. Other positive points of this part of the proposal are that the proponent states that weekly sprints and daily 15-minute meetings will be held, so that the team always remains cohesive and alert about what is being done. So my suggestion here is in relation to how all this information would reach our community, in my opinion it would be necessary for the team to prepare monthly reports that allow the community to have knowledge about what would have been developed in that period of time ( therefore it would be important that the script be detailed with greater specificity). Talking now about the auditability of success, several informed metrics are reported that can illustrate the ideal scenario (end users -screenwriters- can use the platform to safely load and save segments of their scripts + the platform helps users to come up with new ideas for + NFTs can be generated as scripts + users actively use the platform). In my opinion, it would be positive for an analysis to go beyond the success of the platform itself. By that, I mean a more in-depth study of how screenwriters and audiovisual professionals who would be using blockchain technologies would be relating to the cryptographic universe. It would be necessary to understand what were the most palpable consequences of all this for our blockchain, will these professionals have started to use other Web3 tools, since they now know their uses and advantages? How could Cardano, in particular, stand out from other blockchains in this process? How can we confirm that the specific objectives of the challenge have been met - have the writers become active members of our community? So, I believe auditability is fine, but some small changes are needed to make it ideal.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 8, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3984, "q0": "In my understanding, this proposal is targeting a fractional part of creating a large (web3) platform on Cardano for Screenwriters, Actors and Producers (This proposal addresses screenwriters). The discussion on the art industry and the fact that large companies of the film industry is limiting creators has been going on for several years. The tools and spaces created to mitigate this is not well developed, so in my opinion (as a musician) this proposal addresses an important and underdeveloped need in the film and arts industry. The proposer seems to have understanding of the problem, and describe in great detail not only what they want to do, but also how they want to do it. This is shown by focusing on creating functions that is well needed for screenwriters, from the creative process (collaborating on ideas with others on the platform) to selling their screenplays as NFTs (and still holding the royalties). \n\nThe proposers are well aware that this project will take a lot of time and effort, with a couple of other risks. To mitigate the potential risks mentioned in the proposal, they know that the people involved in this project need to be 100% focused, it is nice to see them addressing the need for dedication. The market conditions-risk is complicated, but I believe that focusing on the community-first principles is the right way to go. That way, the first steps of implementation doesn\u2019t need to be fighting a trillion dollar film-industry, and focus on the creators and actual community instead. The development will probably be a bit slower this way, but it will increase the probability of the project being successful. Having a strong and dedicated community will also build a strong foundation for the future development and sustainability of the project. \nThe team states that choosing Cardano as a working platform fits well into their own thorough (and slower) first-principles-based ideology, and this is clearly reflected in the proposal. \nThe intended product has potential to address several different aspects of the Cardano, with a heavy focus on community and NFT market. \n\nI would like to have seen some inclusions on the KPIs related to adoption rate, as of now the current measurements of success is connected to functionality of the product. Since outreach will be an important part of this proposal. It would also be beneficial if the proposer further expanded on the risks of listing two team members for a proposal of this scope. (Correction: after looking through their official website the number of team members is 12) \nJust including a paragraph including some thoughts on if they plan to hire Cardano developers would be helpful, etc. \n\u2028Overall, I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer provide us with a very detailed roadmap with included milestones set on a timeframe of roughly one year. It could be formatted to be presented more clearly (lots of jumping back and forth between milestones and roadmap) but this is just minor, in my opinion. All of the relevant information is there. \u2028In the budget breakdown we are provided with a rough sketch of the budget allocation. The requested amount in total (60 000 USD) seems fair for what the proposer intends, and most of it (50k) will be spent on product development. In order to make the proposal even stronger, I would suggest to include an estimation of work hours for each team member and responsibility area, and connect it to the budget numbers to provide us with an estimate of workload and hourly wage. \u2028\u2028As mentioned before, there are two team members listed in the proposal and 12 team members listed on their official website, It would be beneficial to include some clarifications on if the whole team will be included in this, or if there will be need for hiring staff outside of the company. On the website we can find LinkedIn-profiles, contact information to many of the members. From my perspective as a recurring PA since Fund 6 and a voter, having that information included in the proposal would be nice (since we wouldn\u2019t have to jump back and forth between website in order to verify the expertise of the proposers). \nThe team seems to have a lot of expertise covered in order to implement this proposal successfully, but there is clearly a gap in regards to blockchain technology and specifically developing on Cardano. Maybe it is not meant to be included in this initial stage, but I would have liked to see a paragraph explaining the plan for the implementation on Cardano, and where the proposer will find that competency. \n\u2028The proposer states that it is likely that they will return to Catalyst to apply for further funding (due to the immense scope of the project), I hope (personal opinion) that they keep their intention of focusing on this project for the future, so that their attentions and time won\u2019t be divided between different projects. \u2028\u2028Overall, I agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In my experience as a recurring PA since Fund 6, I\u2019ve come to really appreciate and understand the value of transparency, especially in two areas: Transparency within the team during the process of development, and transparency when communicating that with the community, outside of the team. In regards to the retrospective and measurements of KPIs within the team, the proposer has a strong plan of continuous check-ins during development. I don\u2019t have experience with using Scrum, but involving external tools in order to increase transparency and process is always a good thing, in my experience. \nA key question to ask is: where will the team communicate this with the community? Will the community be able to provide feedback during development? There is an official Facebook-page, an instagram page along with a twitter handle where all of these probably will be communicated, but this is information that could\u2019ve been included in the proposal. As a PA, I\u2019m assessing proposals and preferably not information that is assumed to be understood. The more relevant information included in the proposal, the more transparent and credible the proposal will be. \u2028\u2028As mentioned before, I would also suggest to include tracking KPIs that are relevant to outreach, and the community. How many people are using the beta when the app is released after 1 month, 3 months? How many on-boarded screenwriters will be measured as a success, according to the team (including target numbers, etc). \u2028\u2028Conclusively, I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.
