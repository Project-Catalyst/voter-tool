How do users find out what's taking place?", "f6_no_assessments": 5, "f6_rating": 4.266666666666667, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1656, "q0": "The proposal meets exactly the objective present in the scope of the challenge of creating \u201cintegrations with other existing services, products and protocols that improve the end-user experience, either giving the user more options or facilitating the use of something that benefits the wider ecosystem\u201d . This can be seen because a web platform called Calendar would be created, which would aim to guide the user in relation to all events, twitter spaces, face-to-face meetings and projects currently being developed in our ecosystem. In other words, to help community members get a better feel for what's happening on a single platform. This has become necessary since our community has become so diverse and complex that it is very difficult for members to keep track of exactly what is being done, how, when, by whom and why. And all these details would be included here, from what I understand, since the platform would be focused on improving the users' experience, situating them. Another justification given by the proponent is that nowadays most of the performances are accompanied by social networks, with for example NFT launches on twitter, but the truth is that not all members of our community are fans of such media, so access for those who do not have social network X or Y is really difficult. We know, for example, that many people have created profiles on telegram and discord to participate in important groups for our community, such as the Project Catalyst group or the Proposal Advisors (PAs), but it is still quite complex and confusing to stay abreast of all important updates, and the weekly meeting (Town Hall) is not enough to keep us informed in the most appropriate way possible. So in theory the project is brilliantly something the community needs. But in practice, some doubts have arisen for me. For example, how can we ensure that all updates for all projects are constantly being posted to the Calendar? How could we resolve language differences (for example, projects created by the LATAM community or a hub of Arabic-speaking community members\u2026 would the projects all be posted in their native languages \u200b\u200bor would there be an automatic translation service, would it be a rule that they be translated and only then published...? How would the process to register a project on the site be? How would users be taught to navigate, according to pre-established parameters? How can we guarantee an ergonomic site, the In my view, it would be important that such details were clarified. Finally, analyzing the risks, I find it very positive as the proponent intends to keep a \u201ctest\u201d group always attentive to the partial launch of the product, with the purpose of mitigating development failures that may delay the launch of the product. In general, the proposal deserves maximum impact rating, despite the fact that and some issues could be better clarified.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In general, the proposal is viable, however it would be interesting if a little more detail had been made available for part of the budget explanation and also in the team's presentation. Starting with the script analysis, I believe this is the best part of feasibility, as we have a lot of information about what would be done and how, and we are also well placed in time as to when each activity would take place. First, the proponent informs us of what has already been completed and makes an overview of the phases to be developed, such as \u201cstart development, test the logic functionality, complete development\u201d and so on. My only suggestion is that the timeline had always been divided into months, for example in the months of October and November, from what I understand, the following activities would be done: start the development of the first version + run QC checks for code and UX+ collect feedback from the focus user group. It would be interesting if we had a sense of what would happen in October and what would happen in November, respectively. Talking about the activities themselves, it would also be positive if they were better explained each, but even so, from the way the script is presented, we have a very solid understanding of the whole, of the process of developing this project in practice. When it comes to financing, the asking amount is not low, but it makes sense given the complexity of the project. Most of the budget would be earmarked for the development team, who would work full-time on the proposal (we still don't know the value of the working hours, which would be a relevant detail). Fixed expenses are very clear, but marketing expenses could be better explained, for example educational videos and marketing - how exactly would these parts of the proposal be constituted? How would the publicity campaign for the project be? Because it is essential that it is well publicized, this can be a watershed for success here, since it is a tool designed especially for the Cardano community. So it is necessary that as many people as possible know about the project and use the calendar. Finally speaking of the team involved, I think this part is ok but it's ideal. We know a lot of details about Pritesh Gosai, but we don't know much about the members of the development team. For example all that is said about them are their names, roles and years of experience. But more information would be needed, so that we could know better about their professional backgrounds and more confidence was passed.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "To audit the progress, two metrics are suggested: 1) the amount of visitors to the site, which can be perceived through the increase in registrations to participate (it would be interesting if the site had measures to monitor engagement such as analysis in relation to the number of interactions between users, comments on projects - if this function is available - and etc); 2) the user experience would be measured, \u201cgathering feedback from event creators and platform users. We will measure this by providing a survey for every user who interacts with the platform and giving them the opportunity to tell us what they like and don't like.\u201d Both metric 1 and 2 relate to a project follow-up when the platform was launched. But how can we audit the work of the professionals involved, developers, designers, project managers, in short, the entire team that made the interface a reality? My recommendation is that at the end of each month, the proponent holds an internal meeting with his team in order to understand how the work month was, and to be able to update the Cardano community on all the steps that were taken, in a summary, the progress of the tasks that would be behind such final results. A communication channel needs to be established with the community. In relation to success, this would be defined as a large number of users using the platform (the goal is 10 thousand), with the amount of one thousand being new users registered per month, and the increase in the participation of community members would also be measured. in face-to-face events (the goal is a 25% growth in relation to the total). I agree that it's important to work with numbers, but I don't think that's the only variable that we should take into account. A more qualitative analysis of the final scenario is needed, so that we can understand not only how many people were affected by the project, but also how. That said, it would be very positive if the proponent collected the feedback from those registered in the Calendar, so that we could understand if the main objective really was (that all information about Cardano could be gathered there, and that the navigability of the different projects of our ecosystem has improved considerably). Once again, it is necessary that this study reaches our community. Therefore, the auditability is not bad, but it is not perfect either, requiring some improvements to make it fully adequate.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3453, "q0": "The idea of having a centralized calendar to consolidate all the multiple events being held in Cardano is really useful, specially considering they are growing in numbers more and more. Having the pepople proley orgnized may help a lot to increase their attendance.\nIt also alignes well with challenge as it creates a product built for the Cardano ecossytem and can potentially increase some challenge kpis.\nProposal does a nice job explaining well the problem how the solution can address it andp rovided already some picutes of what the UI will look like which helps a lot to illustrate it and seems really nice and easy to navigate. Risk management part is well done with all containing a good mitigation plan.\nHowever, a few more information could be provided on how proposer intends to engage with the community. For this to work, probably people will need to have a log in, so this need to be properly advertised so more people use it. Moreover, it could be better explained how the events will appear in the platform. For instance, for registering an event, will the event holders have to register them individually in the platform? or he would be able to integrate with other caldendar such as MS outlook or google caldendar? \nThis integration would be much welcomed to avoid re-work from the ones holding the events. Otherwise, people would probably keeping using multiple calendars and the solution wouldnt be so effective. Other possibility would be the platform owners to register the events themselves but this would be a lot of workload and doesnt seem very feasible.\n\nAll in all, its a  good idea with a potential high impact but to assess if this all this impact will be met, more information could be provided. My rate is 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There's a good time-framed plan in place with nice deliiverables. Its excellent to see here that feedbacks will be collected throughout the whole  project, this is key for projects like this. In order to make this timeline richer, I'd addd more details on the what acitvities would be necessary to reach the mentioned deliverables. One other acitvity that I missed in the plan is the comunication/engagement with the community in the end of the project to market it. Important to mention that some features are already developed.\n\nBudget breakdown is very well done and covers all project scope. Here, the marketing part is considered, with a specific budget line for it.\n\nAs for the team, there's the proposer and a dedicated team of developers from DevTeam.Space. It is provided a nice description on their experience and background, with links as reference. Their competences combined seem to be enough to run this project. One note here is that the dev team is used to work with Agile frameworks. It would be very nice if this approach is used here.\nIn conclusion, although some improvements could be made in the plan, they dont seem to compromise project feasibility, specially considering the other parts are really well done. My rate is 5.\n\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Some nice metrics are proposed here, they are time-framed and have a pre-defined target, which will help to evaluate the success of this project. I particularly liked that the growth in attendence of the evenets and feedback are considered already. They both will help to assess quality and effectivess of the solution. One extra metric to consider the number of events registered in the platform. \nAlso, if an agile framework is adopted, sprint reports and product backlog could be made available to community, to track implementation throughout development.\nIt's also important that all these information in an online public place.\nMy rate is 5 as the metrics provided are good enough and there nice deliverables/milestones in the plan. \n\n\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2461", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6415, "q0": "There are currently so many different events on the Cardano blockchain that happen every day. Twitter spaces, in person meetups, and project updates to name a few. It can be easy for many investors to miss out on certain opportunities because they never saw a certain event that they wanted to participate in. This is because there are so many different things going on at once. I think about a newer community member trying to find his way through the Cardano ecosystem. It can be hard to know where to start. This proposal suggests creating a platform that will give all of these details. It will be a place where a user can go to find any of these events. It will appear as a calendar with all of the different upcoming events. If you don't want to miss out on something cool in the ecosystem. This will be the place to go. This could have a positive impact on the Cardano community because it will allow more people to participate in these events. Especially including people that would love to join certain events, but don't know about them. Now they would know. This proposal has a great solution to the current challenge in the community. There isn't a platform where a user can go to find this information. For these reasons, I give this section of the proposal 5 stars as I find that it brings useful utility to Cardano community members.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Kaizen Crypto is a big Cardano influencer. He has a large community and experience on the Cardano blockchain. It is important to note that the team is included in this proposal. It highlights their skills and accomplishments. This helps determine the potential likelihood of implementing this proposal successfully. There is a detailed roadmap that is written very well. It has a long-term approach that shows exactly what the team is going to be working on each month. These specific dates are important because it will help the community keep the team accountable to what they say they will accomplish. There is also a detailed budget breakdown that describes where the requested funds would be allocated if funded. The proposal does a great job at including the important information and helping the reader of this proposal to see exactly what the team plans on accomplishing through this funding process. They are aware of potential challenges that may come through this process and have plans to work around those. I see that the team is set on carrying-out this plan because of the specific details listed in this proposal. For these reasons, I give this section of the proposal 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "When auditing the potential success of a proposal, there are two tools that I like to use to gauge this. The first concept is transparency. This tool can be very important to the success of this proposal because it involves the community. If Pritesh can be open with his Youtube community about this proposal, he is likely going to have followers of this idea. They will be people who see utility behind this project of highlighting Cardano events in the community. Given that Pritesh and his team will be transparent with the community, there will be loyal community members who want to see this project come to fruition. It will transition from a proposed idea to a functioning platform. The second principle that is important is accountability. Once the team has built trust and excitement with their community. There will then be room for positive accountability. These community members who are waiting for this Cardano event platform to be built, will ask the team for updates. Given that in the proposal, the team included tentative dates of completion, this will help them to stay accountable to building this product in a timely manner. This will be a positive form of accountability because there will be good intentions behind the community members. For these reasons, I give this section 5 stars.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2817", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10099, "q0": "The main issue mentioned is that the Cardano and Catalyst Ecosystems currently have a lot of projects being built and completed, from previous funds to the present. However, with such a huge number of projects, it is difficult for the community to track the progress of the project or if the community wants to participate in meetings or want to learn more about the projects, but information is limited.\nThe proposal meets Cardano's goal to Make Cardano an open source project and attract more developers. The proposal also responds to this Fund 9 Challenge on Dapps, Products & Integrations while focusing on the area of \u200b\u200bCreating or improving various Dapps, products and integrations that provide value to the Cardano community and broader Ecosystem. The scope of this proposal can be very large with more than 10,000 expected users, mainly developers and the Cardano community interested in the progress of projects. The proposal would create this Platform called Cardano Calendar that would allow users to keep track of events, twitter spaces, face-to-face meetings and project developments. I believe the proposal is solving a much needed problem in the Cardano Ecosystem which not yet have.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The solution is to set up a Cardano Calendar platform as a web-based interface that features events from different projects so that users can stay informed about the latest Cardano developments and share their favorite events with their network.\nThe implementation plan is divided into 6 specific and reasonable processes from August 2022 to February 2023, in accordance with the construction and development of an interface on the web.\nAbout the proposal implementation team, the most prominent member is Mr. Pritesh Gosai - an experienced member of Cardano with many contributions and creating a reputable brand with a Youtube channel with more than 1 million views and 30,000 subscribers, and He is also a philanthropist. He spent his personal money to fund the initial research of the proposal, demonstrating his great enthusiasm for the project. I very much appreciate this spirit and belive that he can implement the project successfully. Supporting him is an excellent development team with at least 5 members with extensive experience in technology, development and management.\nThe proposal also introduces four risks with reasonable solutions. However, I still think we should consider one more risk that has not been mentioned, that is, the number of visitors / registrations is much lower than the proposal's expectations, which will greatly reduce the value of the proposal. We can fix it by designing an attractive interface, easy to search, and especially should spend some money on Marketing to bring recommendations to more users.\nThe proposal has not yet mentioned whether to issue a token, and the source of revenue from the proposal is unclear.\nI saw a passage in the answer for the question \"What Are We Bringing To The Table?\" being repeated 3 times, it may be a rush of time, but the proponent has not yet checked it all, but it also causes an annoyance to the reader, the proponent should be more careful.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The budget of the proposal is divided into 3 main items with a total amount of USD 50,000, with the largest focus being the payment for 2 full-time engineers within 1 year of 48,000. However, I found that the proposal will be completed between August 2022 and February 2023 (7 months), so the salary of these 2 engineers is not considered as 1 year. We need to calculate again.\nThe proposal's implementation roadmap is presented clearly and specifically with milestones and items conducted in each milestone.\nI am especially impressed with the project's successful description which is very specific and clear with quite challenging KPIs, expected to have 10,000 visitors and more than 1000 new subscribers per month.\nAnother limitation here is that the proponent has not mentioned options so that the community can check the completion progress and measure the indicators. The proponent should provide specific meetings for reporting, thereby increasing the transparency of the proposal\nThe proposed completion of development of the final version by February 2023 is also a fairly fast and reasonable time, I am very excited to look forward to the product of this proposal", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3153", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10269, "q0": "Building Cardano's Calendar app was a good idea by the team.

This platform is completely suitable for challenge setting, it provides a resource platform to support information about events taking place in community, especially meaningful to new members.

Unfortunately, I have not seen concrete evidence of what you guys have done on the Cardano ecosystem. I tried accessing the relevant link, there is too little information and the demo interface of the application is not attractive to users. The risks are predicted and listed together with solutions, I have a suggestion that you need to consider the problem of developing applications on different platforms, for example Android, IOS\u2026The detailed plan listed all 11 items needed to build the application, do you intend to publish it on Github so that the community can monitor and evaluate it more easily? Unfortunately, your application has not built a plan to have a source of income and ensure financial independence in the future. I think you can develop an event support functionality on Cardano Calendar to find revernue, that's a way to support the community and at the same time give you self-sustainable.\nI agree with the timetable to implement the development of Cardano Calendar, however, since you are not asking for future funding, are next versions still viable?
