Due to language differences, there are many projects related to knowledge sharing that are not suitable for the majority of native language users.\nMost knowledge-sharing websites are only available in English. This leads to not many people being able to read it and these sites have no interaction between the sharer and the reader.\nThis proposal identifies a few problems of the challenge and provides solutions and logical arguments. Specifically: This project is geared toward a decentralized governance model that includes a training course on knowledge or assessment. The price of cryptocurrency projects is measured by scoring and the quality of the project is shown by the score.\nThere is a set of quick test questions about the Cardano blockchain, crypto - a quick knowledge test that allows the community/readers to increase their knowledge.

I see it as having certain importance about people's wisdom. The proposal to identify the problem here is that there are many projects related to knowledge sharing but do not create two-way interaction, education, and lack of vision to build a platform or a variety of educational products. The team that comes up with a solution to the problem is to create a platform or product that involves sharing, training, and educating knowledge about Cardano and blockchain. This is a great solution, because the dissemination of knowledge about the Cardano blockchain is always essential, especially for a developing society that has access to new technology. Because it is related to Cardano, it contributes to a great increase in value for the Cardano ecosystem (if implemented successfully). In the future, it promises to be scaled up and solve challenges (with the foundation of good knowledge, from which to deploy ideas, proposals, and projects to solve problems of the whole society). That's the huge potential that the Cardano blockchain can do, stemming from the right insights from proposals like this. I have high hopes for this proposal and hope it becomes a reality as soon as possible. With such impact when I completely agree - vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Vcoincheck team consists of members with extensive experience in community website administration, full-stack, graphic design, blockchain, etc... The team has also provided quite a lot of documents related to the proposal (website link). , videos, ...). Especially the social networking link Linkedin, Facebook, and telegram, ... to publicize the identity of most of the team members (including 8 key people). I strongly agree with this because it gives the community a lot of advantages in looking up the members' identities and verifying the feasibility of the proposal (this is something that not all proposals can do). It is very commendable that the team has made this clear and very specific. However, there are still a few members who have not shown social networking links, I advise the team to complete 100% of the presentation of social network links of all members. The number of team members is 8 people, I understand these are the key members, the team can also have collaborators from the development team or the expert team.\nThe budget is broken down by items and is logical to the goal. The costs are listed with a very detailed item, which clearly shows the professionalism of the team. Through such details of work and costs, the community can look at it and have more confidence in the feasibility of the proposal. The team's meticulous budget presentation makes it easy for everyone in the community (who are very new - they don't know anything about the team and this proposal) to understand the budget allocation easily. That is my opinion when analyzing the budget table. My additional question is if Fund 9 has not been funded by Catalyst, will the team continue to work on this proposal? And what other funding does the team have to be able to implement this proposal (from contacting support from other organizations)? I ask this question because I want to demonstrate the clear feasibility of the budget.\nThe plan and how to do it has been stated step by step, very fully. I was most impressed with this in the team's proposal - the team is doing a great job on this. This is also one of the important factors in clearly defining the feasibility of the proposal.\nRegarding the necessary resources for implementation, I consider two resources that are financial resources (mentioned in the above budget) and human resources to implement the proposal. There are plenty of other resources out there, but I've mainly classified these two. Currently, with a professional team and good expertise, I believe that the proposal will be successfully implemented. As the team shared, some members are also working on another proposal in parallel with this proposal at Fund 9 but still ensuring the quality of work in this proposal. That's a great thing, I believe the team can do it with the current people. Performance results are the best way to create more trust in the community, thereby increasing the feasibility of the proposal.\nIn terms of technique, technology and language used when implementing the proposal: A collection of high-tech learners in the new era: Cardano blockchain, web design programming language, cryptocurrency, finance banking itself, etc... It is carried out by people with extensive experience in fields related to technical aspects, different fields - members of the current team. That is the basis for me to believe that the team will do a great job when implementing the technical aspect of the proposal implementation.\nThe team is also quite clear about the possible risks when implementing this proposal: The difficulty of keeping the community deeply involved in blockchain activities as well as Cardano when the crypto winter has arrived; An education and knowledge sharing platform that only works independently, it will be difficult to diversify sources of information and knowledge or it will cost a lot of project costs in knowledge sharing activities awareness - accompanied by 2 risks are 2 solutions to prevent possible risks. I am very pleased with the team that raised the risk with a satisfactory solution.\nHere are the questions, and the positive advice. Teams can refer. I strongly agree with the feasibility of the proposal. I vote 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I see the team's progress and milestones clearly through the coherent presentation of the proposal. The coherence shows that the team is very interested in the roadmap for the milestone of the proposal. I only regret one thing, if these milestones are tied to specific months of the year (January, February - this is just an example) it will be even better. Because it makes it extremely easy for the community to assess work progress, and demonstrate the transparency and auditability of the proposal. Having such a detailed roadmap is very helpful for newcomers to the community - they can easily read what the team needs to do at the milestones.\nThe team presented performance indicators (KPIs) for each month of work performed. It's the first time I've seen a proposal with such a well-tailored KPI. Very good. If only there were the presence of key metrics, it would be perfect. We all know the role of KPIs and key metrics in auditing. The clear presentation of KPIs and key metrics helps the community to be more convenient in evaluating and auditing the proposal. KPIs and key metrics play an important role in proving the transparency and auditability of the proposal. Therefore, I am very satisfied with the KPI that the team has come up with. If both of these indicators are included in the proposal, the transparency and auditability of the proposal will be greatly enhanced.\nOn the other hand, the team has stated how success is defined, it is simply that the products made by Vcoincheck will become a user manual, greatly helping the community in knowledge and experience in the field. blockchain in general and the Cardano blockchain in particular. Throughout the proposal is a clear, easy-to-understand description of the problems - solutions to the problems are clearly stated. I found that the team made a strong effort to identify the problem and come up with a solution to solve the problem.\nHere are some of my positive comments to build more transparency and auditability of the proposal. Regarding the auditability of the proposal, I strongly agree - vote 5 stars.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2552", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5945, "q0": "The proposal brings a new concept to the Cardano Community to the Share to Earn knowledge instead of only Learn to Earn hype trending recently. The problem identified is the monetization and the reputation of the stakeholders who join the knowledge spectrum, and this was mostly aligned to the challenge setting. Significantly, the solution part is a proposal of the decentralized knowledge platform where people need to contribute and earn a reputation (Vcoincheck point) and get incentivized with money (based on the survey of the community voice.) Therefore, such an Integration solution must be implemented to resolve the financial factors and the reputation records. The risks are also considered with the winter of cryptocurrency when the community will mostly stay silent and disengaged. ThusThus, the team proposed a counter plan for incentivized solutions for the community in the winter period.\nMoreover, the proposal also considered the considerable cost of knowledge acquiring and sharing with their limits. The approach to partnering with the Catalyst community for knowledge sharing is highly potential for effective delivery for the Cardano Community. It would be even better if the team could consider the risks for who will be on the authorizing panel or any voting mechanism for a decentralized knowledge-sharing platform. For example, the knowledge source/information correctness to make it more subjective for the community and the slippage of ADA should also be considered given the team already mentioned the crypto winter period arrived.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team consistently showed their expertise and experience from Fund 7 to Fund 8; they also received five funded projects in the relevant links: https://vcoincheck.io and https://cardanolibrary.net. The team dynamics are diverse in Financial professionals to experience development team, crypto and blockchain analyst, and most importantly, the community manager (as this closely links to the proposal of the knowledge-sharing community.) The proposals will be implemented in 4 months with clear milestones attached. The KPI for each month is also presented. There is also praise for the transparency in terms of the core team members who are also working on other proposals in Catalyst and the mitigation plan for that. The budget is around 8% of the challenge settings for complex knowledge and InIntegrations which is justifiable. The budget was presented for different roles for the core team and also for the users who join the community. What could have been a better suggestion is the split of the budget on a monthly basis to sync with the milestones mentioned above. This would be a better illustration of the delivery compared to the workload each month, as the team also mentioned the missing 15k from the previous funding rounds. There is also the need to show the split for the community and core team with different roles to show full transparency for the proposal Share to Earn, who will earn how much incentives compared to their effort, and the Vcoincheck Point \"tokenomics\" for Reputation.  I am not so sure on the Tokenomics or how the Vcoincheck Point mechanism will work, it would be nicer if the team can explain further in the next round for the voters.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Although the project is only four months, the specific deliverables/KPIs were very detailedly mapped out. The success will be defined and positively impact the Cardano Communities as a whole. The impact will not only be in non-financial factors: knowledge & reputation but also in incentivized factors: prizes and funds from the community. There is also a bold suggestion from the PA point of view for the proposer that the community who wants a special analysis should also vote and create a small incentive scheme to encourage the analysis team for good quality content in return. This is a continuous funding project from the past two Catalyst funding rounds with a record of five delivered proposals (two completed and three work in progress). Thus, the team is reliable and the deliverables can be monitored at the relevant links. As a PA I already visited the links and I am quite impressed with the status and good quality content from the team. Although this proposal is not linked with any Sustainable Development Goals (a new promotion of Catalyst), I am still convinced this project is highly valuable and deserved a score of five for audibility.

And in this Fund9, the basic idea here will be to develop the existing product that is Vcoincheck.io website into a platform to share, train and educate all knowledge about blockchain and  Cardano ecosystem. To achieve this, the proposer proposes to build a library on Vcoincheck.io with articles on basic knowledge that are not heavily academic in depth but still help readers easily understand the basic concepts and content. Next, the proposer will build blockchain courses and Cardano, who directly teach will be senior team members with many years of experience in the blockchain field.

In addition, other costs in my opinion were at the common level such as website administration costs, research questions. Overall, the proposer have listed their capital expenditure plans in full and in detail.\n- With the implementation time lasting for 4 months, I think it's a bit rushed because researching and understanding knowledge requires a lot of time, and at the same time synthesizing knowledge in a way that the majority can understand is another story. Therefore I think it would be better to add 1 more month of implementation. But overall the time allotted as proposed is quite good (or the proposed team has been preparing for a long time)\n- The experience of the proposed group: all show that the members are people who have a certain level of understanding of the market, about the blockchain space.

To solve this problem, the proposer would like to offer a full-packpage platform, namely Vcoincheck Share for blockchain community where learners could gain knowledge, contribute their own knowledge, and gain Vcoincheck points. I think, this is a good idea, and fits with the Challenge. Their platform solution will involve how to evaluate crypto projects, knowledge sharing libraries, knowledge training, Quiz questionaire, training courses, crypto dictionary list which could be translated into English, Vietnamese, and Japanese.

In this season, the basic idea here is to develop the Website Vcoincheck.io to become a platform for people in the community can share their opinion or raise questions via this platform, and also this website will aim to educate and raise awareness about the blockchain as well as Cardano inhabitants in-depth. Since knowledge is plentiful and contains various terms for the reader to explain and catch the whole meaning of it. However, there would be a lot of complicated and academic terms that are not able to understand.  Thus, this proposal is providing a very practical solution for assisting users to access the knowledge which has been simplified and summarized to understand easily.

Anyway, in general, this is a good plan and the distributed time is quite effective.
