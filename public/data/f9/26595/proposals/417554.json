As part of the implementation the proposer intends to let the user set styles, colours and pictures and then also provide features such as tipping, image roll of NFT collection and displaying which NFTs are for sale. This is a common application people use in real life already such as the linktree application to bundle together relevant links and share that on social platforms. This provides a Cardano specific use case that could become a preferred way for Cardano ecosystem members to share their details. The proposer could have added some more risks and considerations towards how they intend to achieve adoption so this application will gain some initial users and if there was already any users requesting this and what specific features were requested. Another point of concern that wasn't mentioned is around privacy which could be a reason people choose not to use the service as many would need to create a separate public wallet.

The main idea behind it is to be able to have all links to your social platforms or any other links you deem worthy there and you'll use your wallet only to create. As the proposers mention - your wallet is your id. There will be some other UI features as well as the ability to have premium section in bio links for videos and blogs to give an example.\nAs a member of the cardano community I'm quite happy with it being decentralized and my identity and information to be private. In that train of thought this proposal combines personal information - bio links (social platforms, videos, blogs) which is personably identifiable information with your wallet, which isn't ideal because it'r KYC (know your customer - which centralized exchanges need to implement as a regulation) more or less. I doubt the proposers of this idea have done this on purpose, but the aftermath could by unwanated so I urge them to reconsider the connection between the wallet and the personal information anyone using their platform chooses to share.\nI personally wouldn't chose to use such a wallet if it connects my finances (wallet) with personal information about me (social links), but I understand that many people don't have such regards and will be happy to use this wallet. Even so I'm uncertain of the impact it will have so I'll restrain myself from any speculations.\nOverall this is a decent proposal, although as I mentioned I'm uncertain of the impact it will have over the environment.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I was unable to verify the credentials of the proposer (paddy - a stakepool operator) and there weren't any links or a family name to go on so I hit a dead end there. I couldn't verify his skills because they weren't listed and the only verification would be the built sites linked in the proposal, but there's no github repository or anything else I could verify on the matter of technical abilities and know-how.\nThe roadmap is pretty simple and I hoped for more detailed tasks and segregation of items and tasks that would be easier to follow. A website development is a complex process and in the context of crypto doubly so so such a description is not enough and more details are needed. Same cane be said for the other milestones like NFT minting, security and refinement, each deserving elaboration of it's own.\nThe budget for the hosting is decent if a bit on the cheap side, the developer salary per month doesn't specify if it's an 8 hour or 4 hour work day or 1 hour a day, which would have a significant impact on the hourly wage which can't be calculated currently and compared to other proposals or checked against guidelines. As a developer it's impossible for me to estimate if the timetable is reliable or reasonable considering a lot of the information I already mentioned is missing.\nThere's no team and a single person may be able to finish the job, but again there isn't enough information for me to say if feasible or not.\nOverall an interesting proposal, but I couldn't recommend voting for it for the reasons I've listed.

There's no mention of any channel for communication with the community or feedback. There is an opportunity rather then a problem stated and a solution that would solve it. The proposal lacks viable metrics and KPIs to follow or to enable optimizing of any future work.\nOverall, for me, this is not an auditable proposal for the reasons I've mentioned.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2463", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 2, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3677, "q0": "The project aims to build a web3 decentralized version of a link in bio page that one sees often in web2 social media such as Linktree. For the unfamiliar, Linktree is one type of \u201clink in bio\u201d startups where creators on Instagram for example put a link in their bio. Clicking on that link brings you to a page containing more links to the creator\u2019s other works which could be their tiktok page, linkedin, onlyfans, websites and anything that has a link really.\n\nBut there are multiple implementations of this \u201call-in-one\u201d link and some web2 implementations have pictures acting as links and it seems like this project is going to build a version of that by integrating an NFT gallery and payments.\n\nThe potential impact could be big. Linktree became a unicorn earlier in the year and it is easy to see how a web3 version could benefit web3 creators too. It would be easy to see and follow a creator\u2019s projects across different blockchains and platforms, across both web2 and web3 which might span their NFTs, tiktok, Instagram, websites, DAOs, Discord channels etc. Reducing friction for creators and their fans would onboard more people onto web3 and Cardano. It could also evolve to include use cases we have not seen yet.\n\nBut one important question remains unaddressed, how is a web3 version better than their web2 counterparts? For the foreseeable future, web2 versions would probably out compete a web3 version as most people are still on web2 platforms like tiktok and IG. Whereas web3 social media is quite undeveloped in comparison and may not get a lot of users and thus less usage for web3 link in bio solutions. It also isn\u2019t clear how much added benefit a web3 version of LInktree could bring over a web2 version since it only contains links which web2 can handle as well. For example, Linktree could also link anyone to OpenSea. Sprout social lets one upload pictures as links too which could double as an NFT gallery. Tipping can also be done with links, for example a creator\u2019s .eth link which web2 link in bios can handle as well. Payments for NFTs would presumably be handled on NFT marketplaces too. Also, would creators really value the decentralization enough to switch over given that these link in bio solutions have pretty good uptime and are free to use while this project wants to charge a fee to make it self-sustaining. It seems unlikely that they can charge a fee as there are many competitors in the link in bio space with free offerings. Nonetheless, web3 is growing quickly and novel use cases might evolve, one possible direction is for this project to be a foundational piece of web3 software that is free for all to use, like how Uniswap doesn\u2019t charge its own fees.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It is a one man team but the proposer seems to have sufficient experience to carry this out having built a Cardano stake pool explorer and a news feed for all things Cardano. Budget seems to be reasonable though it would be better to give an estimate for the number of hours needed so voters can have a better idea if the budget is reasonable for the number of hours worked. Timeline is about 4 month, and like most proposals, should be treated as a best case estimate if nothing goes wrong, so it\u2019s highly recommended to include a buffer.\n\nIt is also mentioned that the proposer would not need to return in future rounds for further funding as it would become self-sufficient and profitable. But this should be taken with a pinch of salt as there are many web2 competitors with free offerings. One way further funding might not be needed is to create a token for this project and use it to incentivize and reward creators and their fans, which the proposer should seriously consider looking into.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Proposer seems confident in delivering the project but clear metrics are not spelt out, so tracking the progress and success would be difficult unless voters are going to comb through the blockchain themselves to for example track the number of new sign ups.
