Given ideas are rarity, metadata, and the number of nfts in wallet. I would agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge by providing a dApp that will show all of this information. This dApp could bring a lot of utility to the Cardano ecosystem by having an influence on the power of CNFT's. It could have a global impact by giving more users the ability to see what nfts utility would best support them in their circumstances.

He is also the project owner of CardanoPress. He has experience in this community and has a large following that will help support him in this project. The proposal has a specific roadmap that highlights the ideas and timeframe that will be implemented into this project. It splits it up into 5 different phases that will be completed one at a time. Something that could be beneficial is to include a potential timeframe to this section. Even something as simple as Q3 or Q4. This will help the community hold the team accountable to completing this project in a timely manner. There is a detailed budget breakdown that shows exactly where the potential funds will be allocated. This helps allow the readers of this proposal to address where the funds will be going so that they are held accountable for utilizing these funds properly and improving CardanoPress.

There are two main principles that I like to have the proposer think about. They are both very important to the auditing process of a proposal. The first concept is transparency. The team behind a proposal needs to ensure that they are completely open and honest with their community. When transparent, it allows for more ideas to be shared on how the proposal can be improved and how the likelihood of the success of the proposal can be improved. The second principle is very similar to the 1st. That is accountability. When there is a community behind a project/proposal, there is more room for the community to hold the project team accountable for reaching their roadmap goals. For that reason, I suggested including a more set timeframe of exactly when these phases will be completed. Then the community will hold the team accountable and that promotes more work to ensure that the project is reached on time. Especially with an idea such as CardanoPress. I'm sure the community will be excited to support this project. That will make the idea of accountability a positive thing, because the community will be following up in excitement. Rather than making sure that the team is being honest. For these reasons, I give this section 4 out of 5 stars.

Ultimately, adoption \u2013 transition from innovator and early adopter to early majority and late majority phases \u2013 depends on the provision of utility to end users.  People will be drawn to the blockchain that enables them to DO things safely with the least friction. IMPACT: This proposal fits within the challenge problem.\nProposal Clarity & Fit (4): The proposal is clear and fits within the challenge specification. The proposal is supported by links to several explainer videos as well as code repositories.  The proposal proposes to add features to the CardanoPress plugin for Wordpress that enables NFTs to authenticate user permissions.  Through the app, users can create mini Dapps that interact with Cardano without such users being technically advanced. The success section of the proposal implies the expected users are NFT platforms, which would limit impact. Can other types of websites (e.g. a community platform), using an endogenous or exogenous minting and distribution platform, use NFTs as indicators of certifications (e.g. developers versus legal, accounting or leadership direction)?   \nCardano Impact (4): Recently, NFTs have attracted a massive amount of attention in blockchain. Most of this attention has been speculative around art projects and scarcity.  However, there is great potential for NFTs as utility instruments. Such use in emerging game platforms has been well publicized.  This project seeks to add integrations with Wordpress.  This proposal adds a form of identity to the NFT, where the NFT becomes an access token granting appropriate layers of access to a web application.  Presumably, this could be revolutionary feature for managing communities.    \nScalability (3): However, it is limited in present form to Wordpress integrations in centralized websites.  Perhaps, future iterations would scale the project to other platforms.\nThe challenge presents the following KPIs: 1) increasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases, 2) Increase the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products, and 3) increased quality of existing products & integrations through suggested improvements that is supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community. A project would be successful under the challenge if it satisfies at least one of the conditions.  \nKPI Alignment (4): KPIs are reasonable for the scale of the project and consistent with the challenge.\nAverage Impact Score (3.75).\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Experience Required and Fit of Team (4): The team seems to have substantial experience in web development.  Since the integration works through linkage to browser-based wallets, the project is more web oriented than blockchain focused.  Team members are identified by name and role. \nImplementation Plan & Budget (4): The budget is modest ($12,000) and appropriate for adding a feature to an existing product. The timeline is organized by objective and phase, presented as an order of execution.   \nTechnically Sound (4): The project seems to be technically feasible.  \nRisk Awareness & Mitigation (4): The team recognizes the existence of 3rd party risk arising from dependence on the Blockfrost API.  The mitigation is vague, but seems to imply the team will establish a dialogue with the Blockfrost team to proactively address changes in protocols.    \nAverage Feasibility Score (4).\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Roadmap, Milestones and Time Horizon (2): The roadmap, milestones and time horizon appear reasonable. However, the reliance on \"phases\" without reference to a calendar, even at the month level, is less accountable.  \nReasonable and Quantifiable KPIs (3): The KPIs are plausible and quantifiable, but very limited. It is likely that more meaningful KPIs could be developed and tracked.  \nTransparency (3): The proposal does not make reference to reporting.  However, the team provides its Github repository, allowing community members to follow development.  \nAverage Auditability Score (2.67).\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2523", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9538, "q0": "For a brilliantly innovative idea with a shortage of quantified impacts or articulated outcomes, I rank this section a 4. Perhaps I end up doing a little bit too much work for this proposal in inflating this sections ranking because of my enthusiasm for the idea. However, I\u2019ve been a part of many Cardano NFT utility think tanks for a variety of different collections (some of which were able to brainstorm up to 50 possible NFT utilities to add value for holders -but in many cases were not yet totally enabled by the given technology). This proposal enables a whole world of NFT functionality that was never possible before. Just on a simple level, this enables exclusive membership to content for filmmakers, bloggers, trading information, subscription access, anti-counterfeit ticketing capabilities, and exclusive access to additional NFT minting that is more secure than what we have access to now. With more real world application, NFT gating technology could enable house/hotel/office keys, safebox/banking access, computer access protection for personal/work computers, legal documentation protection (perhaps in the case of leaving crypto assets to someone in a will), and an unlimited list of possibilities. As transformational as this technology could be, there is a bit of missing information here that could provide voters with a greaters sense of confidence in impacts. Normally, I like to suggest adding measurability to the problem statement to give voters a sense of urgency for the need of this technology, which I think could be  pulled from modeling evidence of similar concepts on other chains. However, the more pressing weight that needs to be added hear is the quantifiability of the impacts. This could appeal to usage data of NFT gateways, market research on subscription exclusive content (both on corporate levels and content creators that aim to monetize their content), or security of exclusive content protection. This kind of status quo data will leave voters with a narrative about adoption potential by demonstrating how much money would become accessible to the Cardano ecosystem, what industries could utilize these tools, and how many people Cardano could impact with these additional utilities. Also, while data can tell tangible stories, it couldn\u2019t hurt to tell actual stories that frame the potential use cases for voters to imagine. I think all the right logistical content is here to tell voters how these impacts will be achieved but I think some additional weight could be added to show voters what these impacts could be. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "For a perfectly experienced core team and clearly outlined roadmap, I rank this section a 4. I love that the project owner is a content creator (one of the more well known YouTubers in the Cardano ecosystem). As a content creator myself, I could see myself using this technology to monetize my content with exclusive access to backend features like blogs, additional videos, and information releases. Overall team appears to be very familiar with WordPress, which is a fantastic starting place to implement this technology with 455 million websites that utilize their services. On the presentation of the core team, I would suggest providing brief descriptions of the professional experience of each team member so that voters don\u2019t have to go digging for it. The roadmap seems rather clear but perhaps a little too simplified to cut out a lot of substance. The budget has me a little surprised that the proposer expects only 80 accumulated hours of labor to see completion of this product. I defer to the expertise of the team but I\u2019m both skeptical and excited to see such a short timeframe. While the overall budget is very much on the cheaper side of most Catalyst proposals, the given hourly rate seems rather exorbitant and well above industry standards for the given lines of work. However, I think the impacts substantially outweigh the given cost and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it took a good amount more time than the allocated hours. Ultimately, I think there\u2019s plenty reason to see feasibility with only a few minor qualms from me. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In fairness to the simplicity of the proposal, I still rank this section a 4 for providing only a few KPI categories to measure success by. If this project is an open-source plug in provided through Github, there\u2019s not a whole lot of comprehensive data to be able to pull from other than the number of downloads and Github comments. So I lend some credit to limited access to the expansion of measurables. However, I do think there\u2019s always room for more tangibility through quantification. I would like to know how many projects this proposal expects to see from this proposals approval. This additional dimension helps to provide voters with a sense that the proposer has a specific vision for success (which directly feeds into the magnitude of the impacts) and that the team has an ambition/comitment to achieve those milestones. I put a lot of stress on usage data because the most innovative product ever invented would still make no impact on the world without someone using it.
