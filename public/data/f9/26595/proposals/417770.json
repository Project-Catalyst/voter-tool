Now there is no doubt that there is a genuine need for providing such kind of information specially about Cardano where people outside of our ecosystem have many misconceptions about Cardano. To that extent it is a good idea.\nBut for me, the idea of delivering education content through NFTs doesn't make sense at all. We already have a vast variety of educational material on varied topics concerning everyday life along with ample content regarding Blockchain Technology in general and Cardano is particular. This data is available in the form of text like pdf files or in the form of videos on different video hosting and streaming platforms. In such a scenario, delivering such a content in the form of NFTs doesn't add much value to the user experience and I don't see it bringing additional users to the Cardano.\nFor me if you want to provide education using Blockchain, it has to be in an interactive and fun way. The best way would be to build an Educational Metaverse where users can enter the virtual world and learn new things by interacting with different Avatars. One of the prominent DeFI application building on Cardano, Indigo Protocol, already had a proposal on setting an Inidgo MetAcademy inside existing Metaverses on Cardano to provide Educational content on DeFI and Synthetic assets. That proposal is already funded in the Fund 8 and here is the link -\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/400611.    For me this type of proposal makes more sense to solve the problem at hand.  \n\nI would just like to add here that just creating good content is not enough when there is already a good deal of content freely available. The focus should be to build innovative content delivery platforms which can attract new users to the ecosystem.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Given the academic credentials of the proposer and his previous experience in the field, creating educational content won't be very difficult task to achieve. Also delivering  this content by way of minting NFTs is an easy task and there already exists many platforms which help in doing that. Hence the proposal is quite feasible and it won't be difficult to implement it.\nAs for the funds requested for the project, $7000 is a low amount which will be used to pay small expenses like buying new computer and paying electricity bill and rent. This seems pretty reasonable for the scope of this proposal.\n\nBut in my point of view, the proposal will not be able to achieve the objectives of this challenge and hence even having a  feasible and implementable proposal doesn't make much difference if it is not able to achieve the underlying objectives of the challenge.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Proposal is seeking funds to create content for educating people. As the content will be delivered in the way of NFTs directly minted on Cardano blockchain, these NFTs can be verified using any blockchain explorer, hence the Auditability and tracking the progress of the project will be very easy. But, for me, that ease of Auditability doesn't make much difference if the underlying Proposal doesn't add much value to the ecosystem.\nIn the end, I wish them all the best.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2312", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3633, "q0": "The proposal is asking for funds to continue developing a series of educational material in English and Spanish on blockchain, finance and DeFi which is uploaded in the Cardano blockchain as NFTs. As good as a cause it may be it has no relation to the challenge it has been presented on, dapps, products & integrations. This challenge is about building products on Cardano to grow the ecosystem, not to fund miscellaneous projects. Also, uploading educational material as NFTs on the Cardano blockchain might not be the best idea. If the content is aimed towards people with low or null knowledge of blockchain technology then this represents a barrier of entry.

By analysis this it can be said that the requested fund is very reasonable for the work needed to be implemented.

Much is said about Cardano's scientific and whitepaper-based approach to development and governance, but much less is said about why these things are important. \n\nSimilarly, Cardano--despite its strong and active community--does face headwinds created hyped-up VC-intensive competitors who promise faster development and flashier DeFi opportunities. A podcast that can explain, to a mass audience, why Cardano's slower, more methodical approach is ultimately in the best interest of developers and investors would be beneficial to the Cardano community. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Andres is already appearing on panels and creating media pro bono and is essentially asking for funds to help with the sustainability of his project. In appearances he seems to be eloquent and well-versed in the topics under discussion. The fact that he can address audiences in Spanish as well as English is also a plus. \n\nAs the produced materials are free to the end user, the budget is essentially functioning as a stipend for Andres and his team, and to upgrade and replace hardware. It's a more than reasonable ask. Andres background appears to be what he claims, but could we see a little bit more on the other members of the team? Also how many hours of content should we expect in a series?", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project is pretty straightforward with clear deliverables: we either get the promised content or we don't. Likewise, we have enough knowledgeable community who can speak to the quality of the information being delivered. \n\nAs far as KPIs go, it could be challenging to measure the project's exact impact, though it could be possible to get a general sense of resilience to scammers and bad-actors through feedback and surveys.

The goals of developing new apps, bringing in devs, or growing/refining existing apps is almost absent entirely here.
