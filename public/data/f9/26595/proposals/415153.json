It's about creating a platform that unites the music-loving audience (which we know is a giant market) with Cardano's technologies. The problem raised is that Cardano only affects those who are part of the crypto bubble, which is information I agree with - it is very difficult for those who have no previous contact with blockchain to get to know Cardano and even understand why the project is different from other blockchains. So the proposed solution is to unite a market valued at 10 billion dollars (according to the proponent) with the peer-to-peer market, so that new users are brought into our ecosystem in a more organic way. I agree that this would be a great solution to foster our community, as people would be attracted to the music issue and not necessarily blockchain. Some of the possibilities that Dapp would work on would be: instrument rental; find music teachers nearby; find specific musicians for the formation of groups, such as guitarists, singers, pianists, etc.; rental of rehearsal spaces; funding of music scholarships for children and so on. From what I understand, how Cardano would relate to all this would be through payments: they could be made in local currencies (eg, dollars for Americans, euros for Europeans, etc.); as in Ada. An incentive would be made for people to transact on Ada - the fees charged by Dapp would be lower in this case; it is also understood that the first purchase made in cryptocurrency would be rewarded. The proponent states that \u201cas our goal is to bring in people who are not aware of or comfortable with cryptocurrencies, we will allow people to pay using their own money or Cardano for people to discover this cryptocurrency and become familiar with it. We don't want to bother you with cryptocurrencies and that's why our strategy is to slowly familiarize you with this part of the platform. Simple tutorials will be created to explain how to buy Cardano for those who don't have it yet\u201d. I thought this idea was quite clever, as it would not be \u201cforcing\u201d the public to adopt a new technology right away, but encouraging them to look for this alternative because of the advantages; and in this way, the adoption of the technologies of our ecosystem would occur in a more organic way. It is also very positive as the proponent raises a series of risks that can be faced with the development of this project, and is already seeking to solve them. In addition to some resistance from users to adopt cryptocurrencies, people could have difficulty creating digital wallets (and to mitigate this problem, a tutorial is suggested that teaches the lay public how to do this); there could also be some distrust in renting materials or spaces, and to solve this problem all data would be minted on the blockchain, through smart contracts; etc. So, in terms of impact, in my view, this project is very well built and achieves the objectives of the challenge very accurately.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is highly viable. I say this because the bidder gives us a lot of information about the 3 main topics - script, budget and team. Talking about the script, first of all, it is said that I would happen according to the passing of the weeks. My suggestion for this part to get even better would be to detail each of the activities reported - for example in the first 2 weeks, it is said that the initial structures of the e-commerce platform would be configured. It would be positive if we could better understand how this process would take place, exactly. In the following others, the projection of \u201cthe entire platform and developing the processes that allow the rent and trade of physical items\u201d would be made. How would this work be developed? I can see that until the 17th week the work carried out would be mostly of a technical nature, we know that professionals in the technology area would be actively working in these stages. But it would also be interesting if we knew, for example, if any marketing work was being carried out in parallel here, that is, if the project was being publicized as it was being built (it is said that perhaps more money will be asked for marketing in future funds, so it is not very clear if this part would start to be worked on or only when Dapp was already more complete). Talking now about the division of expenses, 73 thousand dollars are requested, which is a very high amount, but it is very well explained. We know that the full amount would be used to pay the salaries of the professionals involved (backend and frontend developers, as well as expert developers on Cardano's blockchain; a project manager, a content retarder, and a designer). We know how many weeks these professionals would work and also the value of their working hours - so it's pretty clear how the requested money would be used. Finally, when we analyze the team, a lot of information is provided about the members involved (especially the proponent, who provides us with a long detail about himself, making it clear what his past was and what projects he has been involved in so far). As mentioned by the proponent in the troubleshooting session, the proposal had been launched before, but it was said that the team had no experience with Cardano, so it was very important that they hired professionals specialized in our blockchain to join the team. That said, in my view, a lot of confidence is passed in the process (in addition to knowing the activities of each week, the development process is also explained in the impact part); the funding requested is very well justified and the team is properly presented, so this topic also deserves top marks.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Progress auditability is perfect. The proponent states that at the end of each completed stage, the progress will be reported to the Cardano community through various social platforms, such as twitter, github, telegram, etc. From what is said, it will be informed what the partial results will be, as well as the activities that would be behind it. In the part of \u201cwe will share our struggles and we believe that being part of the Cardano community is a strong point and we would be happy to receive suggestions about Rythmeet\u201d, it is implied that both the efforts and the successes being achieved will be shared, so I consider this part of the proposal is ideal. Finally, by looking at the auditability of the final success, we know what is expected for 6 after funding (\u201call technical issues are resolved and the site runs smoothly. We reach 5,000 users and 15% of them use Cardano currency. People start to donate to raise funds for scholarships. We can also start developing the NFT part of the platform in parallel if we receive funds in Fund#10. We develop marketing using the network of youtubers and musicians that we already have\u201d); and also for 12 months (\u201cwe reached 20,000 users and 50% of them are using Cardano currency. We could then start hosting ads on our platform and become financially self-sufficient. With the money increasing, we will focus more and more on marketing\u201d , contacting other influencers, music festivals and advertising on platforms like Facebook, Instagram or Twitter for example. We already know people from Shinetech working in marketing and ready to work on this project\u201d). However, regarding this last part of the proposal, it is not so clear through which communication channels the final results would be shared. I think they would be the same ones used for partial results, such as social media and Town Hall participation, but it would be beneficial if this issue was clarified. It would be interesting if the proponents carried out a study of how the users involved in the project would be relating to blockchain, if those 50% of the public using Ada for payments would be somehow getting involved in the community, in other projects, whether in Catalyst itself or using other Dapps, for example. If we had this perception, we would know more firmly if the specific objectives of the challenge had in fact been achieved. Therefore, I believe that this part of the proposal is also quite adequate, just needing a little more clarity in relation to this last mentioned aspect.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 7, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2002, "q0": "The proposals consist in creating a music platform which accommodates musicians, music enthusiasts, music stakeholders (places to play, stores, schools, teachers, students etc). Moreover, the aim is to implement smart contracts to help with some functionalities within the platform and using ADA as a payment method, giving taxes discounts.\nTherefore, since music is a worldwide passion, being part of cultural expression in every country, there is a huge potential to the ADA community and to music community. That being said, the proposal aligns with the Dapp challenge, which is an impactful use case and brings adoption.\n \nThe goal of this proposal is quite interesting because it has the potential to bring lots of new ADA users which would not use it at first, or not know about it. The success metrics are quite nice, aiming, in one year, 20K users and 50% of it using ADA in the platform.\n\nThis proposal is ready to be selfsustained, with a objective plan to have a healthy growth before it starts to monetize to the team, which is an important aspect of any project. \n\nI\u2019ve just taken a point here because there is no allocation of money to marketing, which I find a major step in any new application to have wide adoption.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "To be able to deliver this proposal they need:\n1 \u2013 Team: The team is diverse and has lots of experiences in their field.

More than that, since this proposal already has the team with experience, was provided a timetable giving the process that should be finished and the expected budget to each phase;\n3 \u2013 Budget: The budget was given in two different forms, that helped to understand. The first one used together with the timetable and the second one divided into hours of work of each function, meaning that they have clarity in what they\u2019re doing, when they gonna deliver it and who they need to deliver it.\n\nBesides that, to make the platform sustain itself it was provided a concise revenue model in which explains how the platform will generate money and how they\u2019re going to use it.\n\nThere were presented risks and answers to those risks. However, it was not mentioned a risk that I find to be really important to consider, which is the functionality and usability of the platform. Since there are several newcomers to this platform, it\u2019s mandatory that the platform and interface be friendly and deliver a nice experience. If this is not true, it doesn\u2019t matter if it solves several problems, people will tent to not use it.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "To audit this proposal, it was provided several Social Media platforms in which is stated that will be provided all the updated content.\n\nThere was provided some metrics and success expectation which aligns with the challenge.

The problem statement and the follow up solution is described clearly in its simplicity. The problem statement has two points: music is not accessible to everyone, and cryptocurrency in general, particularly Cardano, lacks appeal to individuals who are unfamiliar with new technology. The team's goal is to create the most complete music platform, which will serve as a meeting point for these two problems, not only to encourage musicians to connect and develop their music skills and network, but also to invite new from outside the cryptocurrency bubble into this new technology. For that, I completely agree this idea is in perfect harmony with the challenge settings. A dedicated session revealing impact is also very much appreciated since it clarifies the value offer. It also provides a detailed vision of what the community will accomplish, how it will attract new members, what activities will be established there, and, most importantly, how the projects will be implemented. Furthermore, the proposers have already explained the technical aspects and technologies required for implementation, as well as a list of potential risks and how to resolve them if they arise.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has submitted all of the information required to get clarity regarding feasibility. The proposal contains thorough information on the team; the experiences presented and the work already performed suggest that the team is fully capable of developing this project. It is great to have links that give us an insight into the necessary talents and expertise to accomplish this idea; this provides some assurance to Cardano ecosystem members who are reading the proposal. I love the fact that the author took suggestions from the previous fund and then recruited 2 new members with a high level of knowledge in blockchain. The team now is complete and ready to carry out the project as stated. The timeline and strategy are clear, with week-by-week milestones specified. In terms of what will be done, how long it will take, and in what order, we are provided a description of the main tasks that will be completed in each period. Even more intriguing, we have a breakdown of expenses for each milestone! Which means we can clarify how much it costs for a particular task to be done. Providing the time horizon, milestones are likely to be achieved. For that, I have nothing but praise for the team. Furthermore, the proposal includes a detailed financial breakdown, which is reasonable and appropriate for the amount of effort required to make the project a success. We have an insight of which and how many experts are in charge of which role, how many hours they work per week (I figured out the number by a simple calculation) and most importantly, their hourly rate. With some google compared to today's value expertise, I agree the salary is modest. Also the team has a distribution of personnel which I consider reasonable. In addition, the team's personnel allocation is appropriate in my opinion. Furthermore, the team highlighted further funds that may be necessary for the marketing aspect in the future, demonstrating the team's commitment. From an overall perspective, the roadmap, budget, and overall executed plan are all very clearly laid out and make a lot of sense based on the information presented by the team. This proposal has a high chance of succeeding, in my opinion.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Tracking the successful delivery would not be a problem because the timeline is well defined and linked to certain KPIs.

These success metrics are consistent with the key metrics, allowing voters to easily keep track of the project and assess if the stated goals have been reached. The executed plan is comprehensive and thorough; we know exactly what will happen and in what order. Another advantage is that the team has already offered a multitude of connections to their social media in order to stay in touch with the community.

And integrating this platform on Cardano has the potential to bring new users and increase engagement on the blockchain. Personally, I love the idea of \u200b\u200busing a variety of payment methods on this platform and users will be rewarded with using the Cardano wallet for transactions. This not only encourages ADA interaction and adoption but also reduces the risks of legal issues in countries/regions where cryptocurrencies are not yet legalized. While there is no demo describing how the platform works and the main function buttons of the platform yet, the proponent's descriptions are enough to help us easily visualize what's going on on the app. use.

The budget is allocated according to the staff in the group and based on the number of weeks they work, to prove the members' work effort is reasonable given the given budget, Proponents can provide additional estimates of each member's weekly hours worked. While it can be seen a discrepancy between members' working weeks (4-8 weeks) and platform building weeks (17 weeks), proponent has earlier justified the platform frameworks are already available and not all members will be working most of the time building the platform (17 weeks) but working on each stage of product development. Therefore, the calculation of cost is reasonable and consistent with the proposed application development plan. Regarding personnel, the proponent addressed the risk of the lack of blockchain professionals by recruiting 2 new members first. Information about the main members of the project including work experience, educational background, expertise, and projects implemented are clearly described, and attached to CV and Linkedin profiles for verification.

This section is good and thoroughly descriptive but could benefit from being made more concise. If these proposals are meant to be put in front of an average voter, it\u2019s not unlikely that they\u2019d get turned off from the seemingly excessive length. My biggest concern is cost to impact ratio of the proposal, as $73k is on the higher end but the use of the platform is restricted to France and other neighboring countries (as inferred by the risks portion of the impacts). I do still think the proposal has potential to encourage adoption and awareness of the Cardano ecosystem if it gets substantial usage in these beginning areas, which would make this section an ideal space to provide some information about marketing, existing connections to reputable organizations, and regional awareness of the project at this stage in development. It could be argued that the given payment options in ADA are a weaker mechanism to inspire adoption, I do think these kinds of real-world integrations are how we can push for mass adoption of the ecosystem.

I think a more pressing concern is the lack of descriptive information about marketing, as product awareness and usage is key to achieving the desired impacts. There is some marketing related content in the roadmap but I would like more expansion, since it is such a centrally important factor of this project. I\u2019d like to point out that the budget breakdown is exactly what the best proposals do, in providing through details on hourly rate and timeframe requirements for each category of labor.
