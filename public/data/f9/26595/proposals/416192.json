And this project aims to do just that, while serving multiple purposes that benefit all the participating parties. \nDiving deeper into the details, the proposers aim to create a Learn-to-Earn educational platform that features betting on quizzes. Yes, that may sound really odd, but the further the proposal describes the project, the more sense it makes. As the proposal states, Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) is still an effective method to evaluate one\u2019s knowledge and grasp of a particular topic, subject or field. However, it can sometimes be inaccurate to measure exactly the degree of one\u2019s comprehension. Therefore, comes the new form of MCQ, called Evidential Multiple Choice Question (Ev-MCQ), that the team will be featuring heavily in this project. The proposal has enclosed a white paper that explains deeply what Ev-MCQ, at the same time informing us the capability of conducting a more precise and rigorous assessment of one\u2019s learning process. \nIn addition to Ev-MCQ, the BOUNDER platform sports a betting mechanism that would encourage students and participants to study everything carefully if they want to earn money or not to lose any. To exhibit the features and functions of the project more closely, the team has given quite an illustrative visualization of what goes on during normal use, followed by comprehensible descriptive words. At the beginning of the \u201ctest\u201d, each participant will be granted a designated amount of ADAs from the platform, which will be used to \u201cbet\u201d on the answer believed to be correct. If users are wondering between 2 answers, they can bet on both. If they bet on the right answer, they shall keep the money. Otherwise, they lose it. If they find themselves unable to answer a question, they can choose to skip to the next one with a little penalty of a small amount of ADA taken away, and the same thing also happens if they ask for hints. All the lost ADAs will be sent to the evaluators/teachers/tutors who have helped create the knowledge-scrutinizing Ev-MCQs as a way of saying \u201cthank you for your contribution\u201d. When users have completed the test, the remaining amount of ADAs will be able to transfer to their wallet for cashing out.\nI believe that BOUNDER will succeed in achieving what they set out to do, which is incentivizing learners, both off and on-chain, to take part in serious learning in exchange for some profit. And I do agree with the proposers\u2019 statement that this project will be highly appreciated in developing countries, as it not only motivates students to bring in their A-game, but can also be a steady source of income for them. All to make learning more fun, engaging and rewarding. Furthermore, BOUNDER may also have the potential to be a global hit, due to the fact that even though we have already had a handful of platforms that serve the same educational purposes, none of them offers a monetizing feature like BOUNDER. And It\u2019s also safe to say that BOUNDER is the first of its kind, since according to the proposer, if I may quote directly from the proposal, \u201cA web3 competitor of Kahoot doesn't exist yet. Let's make it on Cardano.\u201d\nNevertheless, I have spotted a small flaw in an otherwise near perfect presentation. This section of the proposal still lacks the key metrics needed to measure the different states of success and achievements of the project in the foreseeable future, and how those success and achievements translate to the benefits designated for Cardano. Therefore, I would suggest the proposer supplement those important details.\nAs for the possible risks and obstacles that may stand in the way of the project finalization, the one that the team fears is also the one commonly found in the crypto world, human resources. Specifically, Haskell/Plutus coding is somewhat of an advanced level of programming, hence there are only few developers who are actually capable or familiar with the coding, and for that reason, they charge quite an amount of fees as well. Therefore, the team plans to entitle them with ownership of their contributions to the project, in addition to payments, which I believe should be enticing enough for them to remain onboard. And to ensure a positive outcome of customer adoption, the team will build a website that acts as not only a beta testing platform but also the place to keep pace with the project, two birds with one stone indeed.\nAnd by the way, I love the addition of the memes. I always appreciate hilarious ones that depict exactly the context or situation in which they are being used. Still, for the sake of being professional, It\u2019s advisable to leave them out.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In this section, the proposer has managed to present a sufficiently detailed timeline and accompanied milestones in a logical order of segments. The only things I would love to see also are the start and finish date of the execution process. And I must add that It\u2019s quite impressive of the team to have an MVP ready for deployment in just 3 months of implementation.\nFor the analysis of the requested budget, I strongly feel that the proposer has done it justice, given that the budget is allocated to the payment of the involved individuals during the course of execution. I love the extra mile the team goes to reassure us Community Advisors that they have requested a reasonable amount of funding for the project to have a solid foundation to properly function.\nThe highlight of this section has to be the listing of the current team members and to-be-involved individuals. All 4 members are highly detailed, enclosed with respective LinkedIn profiles, positions and duties, current occupations, expertise and past experiences all relevant to the project. As for the hands-on contributors of e-Learning DAO, they are given a brief introduction of their proficiency along with the online profiles. A growing list of code contributors is also provided.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As mentioned in the Impact section, the team will be creating a dedicated website that both acts as an experimenting platform and also the place for updates and news of the project, which should offer a good level of auditability to the followers. And also, there will be GitHub ticket requests made available as bounties to encourage more people to join in. \nThe desirable success for this project would of course mean it being the source of passive income for all participants, teachers and students alike, and also a good way to pick up knowledge. The SDGs also aim at the exact same thing, only this time obviously the outcome would scale up dramatically over time and hopefully reach a dominant preference on the market. All of them evidently fit within the scope that this Dapps, Products and Integrations challenge has set out. However, I must point out one critical detail that the proposal has failed to mention, which is the benefits and/or profits that Cardano can expect to reap from the success of the project.

It would be better to list a few stats that are directly measurable so that everything can be tracked more clearly.

This will greatly help everyone in monitoring and evaluation.\nThis is a very good idea.

I write about this because I appreciate this proposal wants to create a project that can have an engaging effect on community members and promote education while doing so. The solution proposed to combat the current challenge of lack of education in the ecosystem. The proposed idea is to create a product similar to Kahoot that will quiz users on certain topics and to reward the users when they answer correctly. This has the potential to have a positive impact on all Cardano users because it will give more people opportunities to learn about Cardano and how the blockchain works.

However, there are some significant drawbacks when adopting e-learning that should be taken into account, like low motivation, easy distraction, low-quality courses, etc. The Internet occasionally distracts me as well. I do support the concept of designing an engaging and dynamic learning platform.\nThe proposers described quite clearly how the system (BOUNDER) works. Three main elements that form this system include quiz betting, ease-to-use tools, payment for content creators. From the student perspective, basically for each question they receive a certain amount of money (ADA) when they answer right; and lose money when answering wrong. This form of betting motivates students to really understand the knowledge thus gain confidence of betting to obtain the rewards.\nFrom the content creator perspective (those who create questions e.g., teacher), they receive passive income from the content created when students bet/answers through BOUNDER.\nIn terms of the risks, apart from the human resource problem, I just want to ask if there were other blockchain-based quizzes like this? This is the risk from competitors, so what are the unique points that this platform offers?\nIf the system is successful, Cardano will draw great attractions to students and teachers, thus boosting the number of users. This solution is well aligned with the challenge. \"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap was provided and clear enough. The proposers divided the milestone into several sub-tasks, helping readers easily evaluate the feasibility. Just small feedback that I advise the proposers to propose the exact date of each milestone. A detailed budget was provided. If the proposers divided the financing into smaller amounts in accordance with the plan, it would be apparent to the assessors. I don't have any other advice since the core team was made up of several experienced professionals with solid e-learning, coding, and engineering backgrounds. These skills and experiences assure the feasibility of the project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This is an open-source solution; thus, the project will be audited by GitHub commits, pull requests, and bug tracking. The Sustainable Development Goals Rating was used here, since the project was related to quality education. However, to improve the project auditability, I still think this project needs some other KPIs/metrics such as numbers of users, teachers, MCQs, ADAs earned from learning, etc. The proposers just said they would create the website containing their progress in the near future.

Therefore, building an e-Learning platform on Cardano by staking ADA is obvious, the benefits it brings to the ecosystem will absolutely happen. It can be seen that the students will take a quiz to assess what they have learned by betting on the ADA that was given at the start. If users pass the test, they will receive an ADA number; otherwise, it will be returned to the content creators. This not only allows students to review their knowledge while earning money, but it also allows the creators of the Ev-MCQ to profit from the exercises they provide. Furthermore, the proposer attaches the BOUNDER user manual, which has a rather unique feature in that it costs a 10% bet if the student wants to find a hint. This not only gets students closer to the correct answer, but it also motivates students to study harder if they don't want to waste 10% of their valuable time. However, I disagree with the proposal's intended solutions to the challenges. Aside from finding human resources to write the code and attracting users, the proposer must also address one issue: fraud. This is a common occurrence, especially with online testing. What will the proposer do if, while taking the test, the user uses the material to find the correct answer or asks for help from others rather than reviewing it himself?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In this section, we see the necessary features for a plan, such as the implementation plan, budget, and characters who will participate in the proposal, all of which are prepared in great detail and with a lot of information. According to the proposer, the proposal will be divided into three milestones, each with a completion time of one month. The work required for each phase is clearly indicated, and the amount of work is not small in general, so completing within one month may be difficult for the entire team. However, if that is the case, the entire team must be very confident in their abilities as well as their hard work, and I admire this attitude. Furthermore, rather than simply listing the events that will occur in each milestone, the author can try to provide a title or main goal for each stage so that voters have a general idea of what will occur in each month.\nTo complete the proposal in three months, the working team must be carefully selected. It can be seen that the team members all have more than ten years of experience in the profession and have accomplished a great deal. That is an admirable figure. Each member is assigned a specific task, and I especially like that the proposal includes a team of collaborators. This not only provides job opportunities for many people, but it also supports the proposal to complete the construction on time. Perhaps this is why the budget for the proposal is not small. The funds raised by investors to support the proposal will be used to pay employees' hourly wages, which are calculated based on their work time. For such an estimated budget, I have nothing to add to such an estimated budget because it already contains all of the necessary information.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The goal-setting success like Kahoot! of the proposer is not always a bad thing, because it will encourage the proposal to develop as desired and even surpass the opponent. It is clear that the author's goal is to provide a learning environment for students that will allow them and teachers to earn more money from the content created, and I completely agree. However, the development progress of the author's proposal is still not very good and does not meet all of the required requirements.
