You have identified the problem here there are very few NFT projects on Cardano that provide real value to holders. I have the same opinion as you because I see that NFT on the Cardano blockchain in particular and on all other blockchains, in general, is at a very early stage. Your proposal directly adds value to the Cardano ecosystem. It solves the goal set in the Challenge of integrating products and Dapps on the Cardano platform. I was very excited about this proposal and realized that it is possible to scale and solve the challenge in the future when NFT comes to life. I see the proposal's sizable potential through the release of this NFT, which can be the premise for further building an NFT community to drive the adoption of the Cardano blockchain in the region. It will be very useful when NFT is seen as a membership card with real value when applied in life instead of just a tool to pump and speculate on prices to make profits like today. Thus, the impact of this proposal is clear, if successfully applied in practice, it will bring great benefits to the community and contribute to the development of the Cardano blockchain.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In the process presented in the proposal, you have experience in website design, programming, etc... This is very suitable for NFT creation. So, the feasibility of the partial proposal has been proven. In addition, the team has publicized the number of members and identities through social networking links (Linkedin, Facebook, etc...). I think this is very necessary because, through the disclosure of the identity, the team has somewhat strengthened the community's trust. According to the budget analysis, the design costs of NFTs, smart contracts, etc... have been fully listed, which proves that the team's intention to work is really serious and show. be professional. I am very satisfied with this, the more I read the proposal, the more I believe in its feasibility step by step. If the fund has not been funded in Fund 9, will the team continue to implement the proposal? Or continue to apply for funding at the next Fund? In terms of resources required for implementation, I want to pay attention to human resources. Knowing that some members of the team are also working on other proposals at Fund 9, I have a question: Will the team ensure enough human resources to be able to implement the proposals in parallel? How do prove that the team can do it? I think the team should consider these questions to further demonstrate to the community the complete feasibility of implementing the proposal. I am very satisfied with the technical aspects, the team has outlined the interests of current and long-term NFT holders, the number of NFTs generated, and the design details of the NFT in 6 levels. This helps to clarify the feasibility of the proposal is a great way. The team also raised the foreseeable risks when implementing the proposal, I found these risks and challenges reasonable and the solution presented quite convincing. My advice for the technical aspect is that the team can refer to other proposals in Fund 9 and previous Funds related to NFT creation & NFT application in the life of project owners/ other proposals come from other parts of the world, thereby having the opportunity to improve and improve the quality of their proposals. Just a few small comments I want to contribute positively. I strongly agree with the feasibility of the proposal. I vote 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In terms of the transparency of the proposal, the roadmap and milestones have been detailed. However, I still want the team to be able to attach roadmaps and milestones to specific months of the year. Doing so will increase the favorability of the proposal so that the community can evaluate transparency and auditability easily. Key performance indicators (KPIs) have been specifically outlined by the team and are highly reasonable (domestic physical consumption and GDP). If key metrics are present, great for auditing. But in return, the team has defined the success of the project through specific numbers: The number of NFTs created by users, NFT users, etc... The community can look at the numbers. This particular number gives a very good assessment of the transparency and auditability of the proposal. In summary, the transparency of the proposal has been demonstrated quite clearly by specific figures for easy verification. In general, the problems were described in a way that was easy to understand and the solutions attached (the team put a lot of effort into identifying the problem and coming up with a solution to solve it). I hope this proposal will be funded by Catalyst and quickly put into practice. Through this, I have some suggestions from my point of view for the team to refer to.

I believe that in the future, NFT will be applied a lot in real life. That is exactly what Cardano is aiming for. If you look at the requirements and conditions offered by the Challenge, this proposal is fully qualified. If NFT is to be applied in real life, it will attract many users who do not know anything about blockchain or NFT and they will get acquainted and use it. Not to mention, users will find a novelty when experiencing a membership card for a club or organization in a completely new way. I believe that if this proposal is successfully implemented and expanded, many other models will be imitated. This will help increase the number of new users and the number of transactions on Cardano. I imagine owning an NFT and going out for a discounted coffee or buying a discounted shirt. That is quite interesting. It is the fruit of my efforts to contribute to developing a community content contribution project.

But it is just enough to make a project that is not too difficult as the author has suggested. This recommendation I find the most difficult will still be the security part. If the NFTs are valuable and beneficial to the owners, it will lead to many spies that will exploit security holes and create many NFTs that can be put on the market. So the team needs to pay more attention to this issue. I read the comments of the authors and thought that if the technology is better in the future, I should switch to dNFT development. That helps users only need to own 1 dNFT instead of having to own many NFTs for each level. Next, you can add even more value to your NFT by building relationships with another proposal's leadership. Finally, I see you as a young, capable and skilled team. At the same time, we have foreseen the difficulties in the implementation process and extremely detailed planning. I just want to add a small suggestion if your plan can be written in detail by month, it will be even better. This not only helps me see clearly what you do, but also helps you when you are funded to perform tasks faster. I will follow you to see the results you will do.

I don't know if it will continue to be the trend in the long winter. But I see big companies like Facebook are still investing in NFT and interested in NFT; I believe NFT still has a chance. I only learned about NFT through buying and selling on the exchange. I have not seen the value of NFT without reading this proposal. It helps me better understand the growth potential of NFT in everyday life. In the future, maybe I don't need to own paper membership cards anymore but own NFTs on Cardano's blockchain. That's an excellent idea for this Challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has a lot of experience and can do it for more than 6 months. The only issue I see is how the team will continue to update and upgrade the solution once the Catalyst funding runs out.
