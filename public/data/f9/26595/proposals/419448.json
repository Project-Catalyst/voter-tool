What makes this project stand apart, and which I have not seen before with other comparable projects, is that is trying to do this in a decentralized manner. \nThat being said it think this project is in line with the challenge and could benefit the community worldwide.

The only thing missing is the concept of time, we don't know when these activities will start and end, on average how long each of these activities will last, and in what month are expected to be collected. such partial results, etc. We need to have a 100% understanding of the process because we understand very well what will happen and how, if this is combined with a month or even a monthly idea. week, it would be perfect.\nRegarding the budget, $138,000 was requested, we know how this is divided, however it could be explained better. Example cost of designing and developing a Koios microbiology service: (6 months) - $19'000, how many specialists will take on this work, and what is the specific salary of the experts? monthly, or hourly). Since it is very general, we cannot have a clear view of how the requested amount will be used.\nAnd finally, about the team behind the project, the team is described as a collection of longtime Cardano enthusiasts including many OGs/current/former ambassadors who have continuously contributed enormously to the ecosystem without any additional marketing or financial costs. They are the creators of some of the popular tools and resources in Cardano - including Koios, CNTools, gLiveView, and GuildNet, plus provide a Github link so we can learn more about the team. According to my objective assessment, this is a group whose members are qualified to carry out the project, so I think the feasibility of the project is fine, just need to add some details about the roadmap and budget so the community can better understand the process of this project", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Finally about the ability to audit the project, in my opinion, this proposal can completely track its progress. The proponent states that due to the open-source nature of Koios and the related extensions proposed here, any progress and/or development achievements will be publicly available for all to see. Although no KPIs are provided, in the roadmap section the tasks are listed very clearly and the community can completely follow this proposal based on its roadmap, what is needed here is just skipping the steps. Add timelines so the community can understand if these activities are on schedule.\nThe success of the project is also clearly defined as a faster and more decentralized Koios API along with a complete set of off-chain datasets (APIs) and related Dapps for community use.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2299", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 3, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5275, "q0": "The Koios -side chain & Chain analysis proposal is to implement 3 additional components not yet developed which can improve Koios -1. K.light-node (for lighter, faster, easy to set up node), 2. Side-chain (reward nodes) & 3. Cardano Decentralized chain analysis dApp (for dApps builders). Koios is a decentralized query protocol for indexing and caching data from Cardano blockchains and storage networks. It is a flexible launchpad for builders that offers API end points besides integrating off-chain data ). This proposal is a 3-in-1 type of proposal addressing 3 problems with 3 different microservices that not only support Koios but also Cardano. 1st solution lightweight instance will lower system resource requirement and make potential operators to install and run them on infrastructure. 2nd solution help to achieve faster decentralization by incentivizing the microservices instance throughout L1 reward. 3rd solution expand API (on-chain data) with off-chain data collector help dapps developers or researcher to access data without downtime risk. From the reasons mentioned above, this proposal clearly identify the problems within a challenge and how the solution can add value to Cardano ecosystem. The team has communicated very closely with IOG developers as they will need to adjust their code when changes in cardano-node and dbsync occurs.  The solution is scalable to address future challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind this proposal is Guild Operators which are long-term Cardano enthusiast with very well known community members and creators of popular tools within Cardano ie. Koios, CNTools, gLiveView, GuildNet. They have listed detail tasks for each solution ie. Koios Microservices, Koios side-chain and Decentralize analysis tool. They also propose Koios Extension- utilities and bot in another proposal in F9. The project will take around 12 months in total to complete these 3 main tasks with the last task the most expensive and time consuming which are reasonable considering the size of on-chain data and off-chain data. They aim their side-chain to be financially sustainable and fully supported by the community. The guild operator has the right skillset to take on this challenging project although they could have been more specific which team members are responsible for each of the 3 main tasks. The technical explanation give me confidence that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The success of this project is more decentralized and faster Koios API with complete set of off-chain data (API) and related dApp for the community.

There is a clear technical roadmap with time duration for achieving each task. The metrics for this project are clear with the deliveries of 3 main features.

This protocol is implemented and funded by Fund 6. Up to now, Koios has been completed and successful. While the scale of Blockchain is increasingly changing and growing rapidly, finding additional solutions to improve and scale dApps, protocols, wallets, etc. is necessary and important. This proposal is intended to add utilities to extend the Koios protocol.\nThe team outlined 3 features that need to be added: Koios light node service, Koios subchain for Cardano, and dApp chain analysis. This solution has been detailed and the method of reasoning is reasonable. The author has analyzed each feature by stating the problem and the solution to solve it. This expansion will increase the decentralization, adoption and participation of Koios which in turn will benefit Cardano, attracting more users. Besides the solution, the author has raised a unique risk that can be encountered in the implementation process. It is related to breaking changes happening on both Cardano-node and dbsync development by IOG. The team also anticipated and came up with solutions to minimize this risk.\nFrom the above, I see that this proposal fulfills the \"Dapps, Products & Integrations\" challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project roadmap is divided into 3 parts according to the 3 extension features that this proposal outlines.

This budget has been divided into 3 parts which are Koios microservices design & development, Koios incentivized side chain and off-chain analytics API + dApp on/off-chain.

The team seems qualified, competent and capable as they've already developed an api to accomplish the queries  set out in their original proposal.

It would have been ideal for the team to provide additional details as to how they planned to address the core components of their work. There are general  Milestones but they have no reference to time or estimated hours of work to complete. The budget does not give any indication as to dollars per hour being paid to the team completing the work. There is also no mention of how many team members will be required to complete the work. Also I could not find any details about the dApp  the team is attempting to develop. There are no screenshots, there are no capabilities listed, there is no functionality mentioned, or really any detail other than it will cost $90,000 US dollars to accomplish. This is too little detail to determine this is feasible. However there is reason to trust  that the team is capable, qualified and competent.

There are also no mentions  of community participation or measuring adoption of the DAP when completed.
