With public API offering to apps the server costs are increasing.", "f6_no_assessments": 7, "f6_rating": 2.7142857142857144, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 3995, "q0": "In my understanding, this proposal is seeking funding in order to cover the operating cost of cnftjungle.io for six months (Which provide analytics tools for NFTs built on Cardano). \nThe main goal with the platform is according to the proposers \u2018to create a cross-chain recognizable brand for our analytics utilities for people to trust and rely on\u2019.\nAs a PA, I\u2019m finding it complicated to assess the impact of this proposal, but I will assess it based on the information contained in within. \n\nIn Catalyst ,there is a reason for why us PAs are assessing the sustainability of the project/proposal that we are assessing. These proposal has to be carefully thought through, with as many potential risks (and how to mitigate them) in mind. The problem statement for this proposal is clear, \u2018running a platform is expensive\u2019, the solution being (in accordance with this proposal) to apply for 6 months worth of operating costs. There is potential value for Cardano to uphold this platform because they are using Cardano and appears to have grown substantially, and keeping participants on our ecosystem is in our interests. However, I cannot say that the proposal addresses the challenge in this way because it (1) doesn\u2019t focus on outreach directly and (2) the focus on the project seems to be to mitigate early miscalculations in management from the proposing team. To give some perspective, imagine if numerous projects/companies would launch a very ambitious project, run it for one year and then come to Catalyst saying \u2018we cannot afford our growth because we miscalculated, can you pay for it?\u2019. I don\u2019t mean to be overly critical, but I want the proposer to understand how this might be perceived from an outside perspective. This is especially apparent when the proposer is mentioning potential risks: \n\u2018If we continue to operate out of our own pockets without reliable source of income to maintain increasing server costs it will be quite hard for us to develop it further.\u2019\nIn my view, this might almost be interpreted as a hostage-situation. It is indeed a risk, but it is a risk that should be unrelated to the challenge setting. \u2028\u2028KPIs or success data cannot be integrated because the proposals goal is basically \u2018keep the platform running for 6 months, and develop what we can\u2019. In order for this to work, I would have liked to see a lot more information included in the proposal on exactly \u2018how\u2019 and what the proposer aims to do, especially with the economic situation that they\u2019re in at the moment. Here it would benefit the proposal even more if the plan on future sustainability were extensive.  \nPlus, the proposal doesn\u2019t focus on development, but upkeep of the platform. Development is mentioned, but it would fit the challenge much better if the focus would lie there instead. \n\nOverall, I disagree that this project effectively addresses the challenge. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal includes mentions on a couple of milestones (adding utilities such as bubble maps, portfolio management, etc) but it would strengthen the roadmap if each milestone could be presented on the 6 month timeframe. From my understanding, the funding is unrelated to the development, so this might not be relevant. The budget breakdown is super simple, for that reason. Upkeep of 20 servers for 6 months: 30 000 USD. In my opinion as a recurring PA (since Fund 6) becomes slightly confusing when development aspects are mentioned in the roadmap, when the proposal is about covering for server costs. It is conflicting information that make me confused. \u2028I would also love to see some information on the 5 team members mentioned, in order to be able to learn about their experience and expertise related to the project. There is a case to be made that the teams expertise can be verified by having created a successful platform (cnftjungle.io), but all information that we can access will only benefit both the team and proposer. For your next proposals, include some LinkedIn-links to each member, previous projects they have worked on, social media, etc. \u2028\u2028The proposer also has 4 additional proposals submitted for this Fund, so it would be super nice to see a paragraph explaining how they aim to deal with workload-management, if they are related to each other and if the budgets for different proposals will be connected to each others successes (if they are funded). \u2028\u2028Having said that, the platform is online and working, so there is some proof of the teams competency and credibility. \u2028Due to the reasons listed above, I strongly disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Concerning the reason for this proposal being unexpected costs for the platform, I would (in my opinion as PA) deem transparency and auditability especially important. As mentioned under \u2018feasibility\u2019 there are milestones included, but the roadmap would need more detailed information, and address the proposals intention. Tracking the milestones (which I assume will be posted on the social media channels of the platform) will result in the community tracking the wrong thing. Having said that, I don\u2019t know what milestones could be included apart from \u2018we kept the system running for a day more\u2019. The only KPIs that could be measured in accordance with the initial purpose of the proposal would seemingly be similar ones. \n\nIt would also be nice to see a mention on where the proposers will post updates and communicate with their community. I know that this is assumed, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to have it included in the proposal. Keeping on the good side of the voters by being clear in our descriptions and intentions is imperative for all Catalyst proposals, in my personal (slightly idealistic) opinion. \u2028\u2028There is a lot of information missing, or details that would benefit the proposal immensely. I\u2019m very sad to see that they\u2019re not included, because I have no doubts about the proposing team being responsible to the community and managing their platform forward. I am however somewhat bound to assess this proposal in accordance what is written, therefore I strongly disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_2504", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2425, "q0": "We were able to see an alignment of the proposal with the challenge in which it finds itself, since a tool is being created, using Cardano technologies, which will assist in the commercialization of CNFT based on analysis.

CNFT Jungle is well known public API platform used by many such as jpg.store, fluid tokens, Tokhun and is being integrated to many more such as Eternl wallet, Trading tent. The cost of operating server is $5000 per month. They are asking to fund the Jungle asset and sales database in order to keep continuing data for platforms to build on. The proposal fits the challenge in the sense that its API will feed many dApps in Cardano and needs retention.

I would encourage the team to either name such NEW features and placing the proposals on that OR find revenue models (SaaS model as the team mentioned or else) & start  charging for their service. It is not sustainable to bear the cost of $5000 without any profits. Taken into account that during these 6 months, the team will develop new features but again it might have time lag to implement those features. Alternatively, the CNFT jungle team can also explain the situation for those they provide the service to and ask them if they appreciate service and start charging them. The team member profile should be mentioned in the proposal as the CNFTjungle.io doesn't have this information and the Catalyst community would like to get to know who is behind the CNFT jungle. The team should also laid out the timeline for this proposal although the whole plan is in place.

One such application that a broad range of users uses to track Cardano or any other NFT prices and requests is CNFT Jungle. It is also favored because applications can use its open APIs to integrate a variety of cutting-edge services. However, as the author points out, the upkeep of the same costs roughly $5000 in running expenses, and at the moment, just two developers are ensuring that it remains afloat and are paying for this out of their own pockets. After realizing the kind of value it is bringing to the ecosystem, it would make sense to support these people for the first six months of their strategy to become self-sustaining by utilizing their API and completing their SaaS model. However, if the proposal contained more detailed material outlining the type of impact they are delivering for readers and voters who aren't fully aware of the CNFTJungle's technical capabilities and services, it would have helped them gain credibility and confidence. The challenge's requirements are satisfied in a different method, but they are not entirely off-course because they are still promoting Cardano use and enhancing the chain's capabilities.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "However, given that a large portion of the application has already been deployed and that many users are utilizing it, the viability appears good. Additionally, the money requested in the proposal will only be used to support the application's operations, making it simpler for the development team to continue adding value by enhancing their API library and standardizing their SaaS model, which will enable the application to become self-sufficient and continue offering services without any further financial assistance. Meanwhile, at this time, the author also suggests adding more sophisticated utilities to NFT, such as Bubble Maps, Portfolio management, Tax exporting, and many other essential functions, making the program much more potent and sophisticated.

The problem that voters may encounter when considering this proposal is that the impact section is framed in such a way that suggests the project was not built with long term sustainability in mind if they don\u2019t currently have reliable income from advertising revenue. I think such a proposal would greatly benefit from more substance as to what new innovations that could be produced as a result of funding approval, market research on how analytics platforms improve ecosystem experiences, and an indication of greater enrichment of the Cardano ecosystem.
