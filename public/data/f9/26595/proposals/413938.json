How they (your server) work is so convincing and interesting that investors are said to understand it well. You also specify the benefits that users can receive, not limited to essential communication channels between different users (or implementing agencies). Also, I think you should explicitly define the \"user\" constraint here as you would mainly focus on who they are. Second, many of your listed tasks, in my opinion, are suitable for the first part of your application's testing (like tracking and categorizing all the information stored in a given network). However, I would like to make a small announcement. A high quality DAPP is the one that can allow users to adopt Cardano, which is also the main part of the test, so you can mention this in this section to let the advisors know that the products Your application can help them increase their use of Cardano. The team has a lot of ambitions, and the goal is to develop servers for a network of operating units (robots) that will be in charge of delivering the sending operations. / receiving messages will be certified using Cardano Blockchain. This output is, I believe, appropriate for the context and, if completed, will have a significant impact on the community and future of Cardano. by links, summarized, and illustrated ideas by Author. However, the second link to the product's functionality may seem a bit confusing for the reader. I suggest that the proponent add more details in this picture to make it easier and clearer for the reader. The proponent indicates the audience functionality they are targeting. It's the user server. Next, I think the data matches the export formula. The range of information amounts can be tailored to the application allowing it to be easily changed according to the operator's requirements. However, the author does not state the results that will be achieved after the project is completed and communicated with the community.

For example, who will face formulas, users or team members or something else? Similarly, who will stand out in solving these difficulties? No Access Title.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Another factor that makes us believe in the viability of the project is the general (but well-organized) scope of the operational field of the technology being developed. With regard to organizing the actions of the plan, we can find very clear and structured steps in well-defined intervals that show us a path to follow. As mentioned earlier, if we look at the team behind the project, we can see that it is an award-winning company that has done business with tech giants like IBM, ASUS, and Intel. In addition, the actions taken become more complex over time, indicating a good sequence of logic. We observe that in WP1, the development of the database system is carried out, and only in WP3 a communication test is performed. Regarding the budget details, we found a good explanation determining the $85,000 value achieved, with information on what the hourly rate would be. This total seems pretty consistent, as we recognize that the team will be formed by 5 members of the company (https://thecorpora.com/blog/) and will be considered an 8-month period. Work. The project involves a team of five members with experience and professional working attitude, which will help when starting the application to gain the trust of the users.\nHaving over 10 years of experience with AI and interactive robots, they understand the evolution of AI/ML.\n+The team seems to be the pioneers in \"robot\" cloud computing, ... in addition, their company has received many major honors, including being selected by Intel as one of the promising startups. most promising for the next ten years in 2011 and named 1% of crowdfunding products on Indiegogo in 2017, increasing by more than 380 percent of its original sales target. It has earned the trust of its customers' thanks to its professional and dedicated attitude, which has enabled them to sell thousands of robots to partners and customers in 49 countries from 6 continents. Furthermore, there are links provided to verify their forum and channel on YouTube. These demonstrate thorough research and understanding of the limitations of their knowledge, as well as the ability to determine what is required to solve a problem.\n\nWhen we analyze the proposal, we can find even one more indication of the project's viability. We see that some robotic units will be sent to universities, so even if a final product takes longer than expected to be perfected, its development will contribute to spreading blockchain and cryptographic concepts in an academic environment.\n\nAnother good thing about this proposal is that the team is estimating how long they expect the development to happen and a budget for each time period. There is a timeline that gives the specifics of the steps to take, which I find practical. Likewise, the descriptions of budget items are also extremely detailed, covering all aspects of the budget. Overall, this section, I believe, deserves a five-star rating from me.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For everything described in the proposal, we see that this will be a product in development that will need to be tested by future users, as the goal is the manipulation of their data. And we note that this has been considered here, as one of the audit modes will be tested with the user and recorded the feedback. Public ways of tracking results are also proven through periodic updates on easily accessible platforms. And we have verified that the perception of success is well described, with a numerical parameter that will indicate if the project is successful (implementation of two communicated networks).\n\nRegarding this part of audibility, you are doing a great job of providing an impressive number of active users in your forum community. Also, your team successfully raised a huge budget (over $200,000) for a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo in just over a month in 2017. It was a remarkable success. Idea. And the way you determine how the success of this continuing project looks very realistic and close to your proposals.\n\nThe author clearly defines his goal and the implementation process, which shows that they are determined to carry out the project with a serious attitude. The success criteria of this proposal are simple and easy to measure. We will update our repositories every week in Gitlab https://gitlab.com/thecorpora/qbo and our forum community. Therefore, I think the exact roadmap of the steps taken here includes the date when each step will be taken; weekly progress tracking may be easier for developers and the community.\nAdditionally, some key performance indicators (KPIs) are absent, both to measure progress and success. The proposal should therefore contain more specifics on how success will be tracked in a shorter time frame, in addition to KPIs, for future submission.

Utilizing the library on chain, the team wants to implement a new \"proof-of-concept\" by allowing the AI to base its decisions on the most logical outcome. With the synchronization of multiple Cardano nodes to share information within the network for easily certifiable information, messages sent and received, which will be catalogued on-chain and the central servers, the future challenges still exists, as mentioned by the proposer, larger than usual text or image files that could become expensive, the proposed solution would be to use a hybrid model by having larger amounts of information stored on a public database with certified uploads to the blockchain within the library and a Queue system as well as use of multiple robots. This solution could eliminate the high volume of information received from creating an overload on-chain, something that has been a major downside of Cardano as of late; slower than usual transactions or even failed transactions from certain Cardano wallets and unprepared systems. This proposal may add significant value to the Cardano ecosystem, with the use of technology being implemented into an already successful product, Qbo, it's clear this proposal could have potential to reach a wide audience.
