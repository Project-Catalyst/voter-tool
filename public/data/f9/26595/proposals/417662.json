There is a saying \"Rome was not built in a day\" and this applies to ambitious projects involving slow moving legacy institutions, especially those under direct administration and control by governments. It would have been really nice to see the proposers come up with a strategy how to built a proof of concept use case, get in touch with a university and set out a meticulous plan how to implement blockchain solutions there.

The problem statement is straightforward, and the solution addresses it well. It appears to me that the relationship between this proposal goal and the challenge setting is very transparent. Due to the fact that most of the administrative process in the educational institutions is being carried out manually which results in a deficiency in terms of student admission, continuation and graduation, the team behind this proposal wanted to design a study control system to automate the process and speed up response times. They will include blockchain technology for the generation of administrative documents. The basic idea behind the proposal is pretty nice. I believe that the implementation of this proposal could have a significant impact on the Cardano ecosystem in general, and that encouraging the use of decentralized technologies by providing them with a different functionality for the exchange of products, goods, and services could be a great way to improve Cardano adoption. My only recommendation is that the author include a section highlighting the potential risk in a straightforward manner. According to the project, the main problem with carrying out this idea is the implementation time of the same. Although sensible, I would have preferred that they present relevant data to back up their claims, as well as some potential solutions to the problem.

This project's development will be divided into three phases, each lasting two months. The implementation time horizon is reasonable, however the timeline and milestones should have been more defined. They appear to have been completed in a hurry. One thing that was absent was clearly defined step-by-step activities that needed to be done in order for the project to be successful. Furthermore, the proposer fails to go into sufficient depth to describe the technical components of his idea. On the bright side, a clear and high level of detailed budget breakdown is supplied describing how capital will be spent; the team includes the cost of all the equipment necessary for the data center's operation as well as the developers' monthly salaries. I anticipate that certain prices will be higher than quoted. For example, there is a monthly rate of $1,000 for two Haskell developers, but as far as I know, the typical wage for a Haskell Developer per month is around $5000 at the very least. It would greatly assist in determining its fairness if the team provided additional working hours. The only thing we know about the core team leading this project is that there will be three people working on it and their full names. There is nothing else. This information is insufficient for the community. There is no evidence of their experience and knowledge, previous achievements, etc... I couldn't verify any of them because no links or credentials were included in the proposal. This will jeopardize the project's practicality since it is critical for every proposal to have individuals standing behind it with their names and expertise, because in the eyes of the voters, this adds enormous credibility to the author and the proposal.

The risk management section is not really well-done, with the key risks identified but no indication of a clear mitigation strategy in place; how would they \"adjust the application according to the needs of each institution\"?
