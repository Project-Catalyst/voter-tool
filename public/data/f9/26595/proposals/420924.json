However, I have some caveats to make. The problem raised is very important to be solved, because while some projects are designed to bring more technology and solutions to populations that already have several resources, this one aims to benefit marginalized people, who live in remote regions and who do not have a good internet access. According to the proponents, this share corresponds to about 33% of the world's population - a very high percentage of people who are unable to engage with the cryptographic world precisely because of lack of internet access. So to mitigate this, a \u201csolar-powered portable offline/online server device called the Lokole Numerique box was built, which will give the Cardano Ecosystem a golden opportunity to reach the world\u2019s disconnected populations.\u201d Ee would function as an \u201coffline portable email and web network server running on a single board computer to provide an internet experience when offline in remote regions of developing countries around the world where data costs are prohibitive for the low-income population. And Cardano would relate here because there was a web application where individuals could create a digital wallet, from what I understood, that would connect at a fixed time with our blockchain network to execute transactions. I believe the idea is good but some comments must be made. The first thing I thought about the project was how these people, who live where the internet itself is inaccessible, will be educated about the basics of the cryptographic world, so that they can understand not only how to create but how to use a digital wallet. It would be good if they understood well what blockchain is, what Cardano is and what makes our ecosystem different, what Catalyst, Ada, etc. If they understood about Catalyst, it would already be a way for them to get involved with our community, being able to learn more about the world of blockchain to become PAs, and with that acquire an income that could even help them out of the precarious situation in which they meet. I think that for this to happen, it would be necessary for these people to be helped and instructed, not just to acquire a device that would give access to Cardano; it is also necessary that they understand about Cardano, how to take advantage of the opportunities that are available today. Other than that, it would be interesting if they could access the ideascale website as well, with the help of this device (so that they become APs); ideally, they would be able to establish contact with the rest of our community, but I don't know to what extent the solutions proposed here will make this variety of resources available. Yes, I agree that the starting point is that they get access to the internet/Cardano and that it is cheap, but this issue of helping them to integrate into our community is also very important, and in my view it should have been commented on in the proposal . Other than that, it is very positive as the proponent already points out some risks and how to mitigate them.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unfortunately, the proposed roadmap is not adequate, for two reasons. First, the temporal division is very extensive, the phases are of 3 months, and it is commenting very superficially what would happen in each quarter. It would be better if the time split was monthly, so our understanding of what would be done when would be most accurate. It would also be essential that the activities were more explained, more detailed. In the first 3 months, the activities would be about the \u201cconsultation between the software developers of the Lokole system and the developers of the Cardano Ecosystem to share and learn how the two topologies work\u201d. How would this bridge be established? Would online meetings be held, what goals do they intend to achieve at the end of each month, to ensure the integration of these two technologies? The second quarter is summarized in \u201cpreparing the necessary tools to face the integration project\u201d. What tools are these, how would they be prepared? In \u201cLokole software developers build, test and debug the system and deliver the MVP product to the public for use\u201d: I was quite confused about this part as I had understood that the product was already ready to be released. But in that case, how would the work routine be to perform the construction and testing of the product? A very important thing for this proposal is how the product would reach the target audience, unfortunately no marketing campaign is suggested. How can we ensure that the product is widely adopted, that people understand what it is, what it's for, and engage to buy a copy and start using it on an ongoing basis? We would need to think very carefully about this approach, because in my view this is the heart of the proposal, that is, without people adopting the product, our objectives of both benefiting the local public and promoting the Cardano ecosystem would not be well achieved. . Now talking about financing, the asking amount is divided into 2 parts, the salary of the engineer and the project coordinator. I think it's pretty clear how the funding would be used, something that could have been better explained is about the routine of these workers; I am also in doubt about the payment of all the professionals involved in the first quarter, where the bridge between this project and Cardano would be made, surely they would contact our blockchain developers: would they not be paid? And, once again, it would be necessary to set aside a value for the marketing campaign, to make a good publicity that would reach the target audience in the most effective way. And finally, talking about the team's presentation, this part is good, but it also deserved some improvements. First of all, it would be important for us to have the same level of detail about all team members - for example we know a lot more about Nzolantima Swasisa than we do about Shaun Bathgate. It would also be positive if everyone had attached their linkedin profiles. Talking about the way they describe their professional performances and previous experiences, we managed to get a good visualization of who they are and trust is conveyed here, but it would still be better if someone on the team were more specialized in Cardano - or at least they had provided names of members of our community who want to develop partnerships.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The suggested auditability for monitoring progress is very good compared to tracking partial results; but it is not clear how the development process itself of the project would be monitored, that is, the activities, work routines, what has been done during the quarters mentioned in the part of the roadmap. We would need to know in more detail what to expect for each month, and the ideal would be for a member of this team to post updates at the end of each month, this could be done, for example, through the github page (it is very positive as they already that bridge the gap between the community and the project team, it just needs to be used properly). I also found it very positive that they will carry out surveys with Lokole users, as is clear in the excerpt \u201cwe will carry out a digital survey by email among our Lokole users. In this way, we can learn and deeply understand how our solution has improved their lives in health, education, economics and social issues. Please note that no one could conduct such surveys without our technology allowing us to efficiently distribute the survey via email.\u201d Another very important thing here were the KPIs they plotted to measure the success of using this technology in the local community: \u201cHow many people are using the service on a given day? Why do people go to the kiosk and pay for usage? How much money does the operator earn from the business?\u201d. Both this survey and the answers to these questions should also come to our community's attention, either through gitbook or another way of executing this contact. But in general this part of the auditability is very good, very rich in information and monitoring alternatives. And about the ultimate success, they say it can be seen in three ways: \u201cFirst, our project empowers everyone who is disadvantaged by poor communication infrastructure in rural areas\u201d \u2013 they cite many examples of people in vulnerable situations. It would be very positive if they took some examples of students, remote organizations, entrepreneurs, etc. who used technology and demonstrated with verifiable data how important it was for a positive change in their lives. Second, as they themselves state, success could be seen as \u201cin the international development community it is believed that access to efficient ICTs (such as e-mails) is very significant for people and for sustainable development\u201d in addition to the survival\"; and finally, \u201cField testing our proof-of-concept deployment has allowed us to prove that our innovation actually has a significant positive impact by solving a real problem for people living and working in rural DRC\u201d. It is clear how the proponents understand what should be generated, they explain very precisely what the success scenario should look like, so the only thing that remains to be done is to really bring all the information within reach of our community. For a final presentation, I believe that it would be very rich if they participated in a townhall where they would tell success stories and inspired examples generated from this project, always making it very clear if the objectives of the challenge were achieved. Although it was still a little unclear whether this bridge between all the information mentioned above and the Cardano community would exist, the topic is excellent.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 799, "q0": "There is a need for Internet bandwidth optimisation and compression system to achieve economical data usage in areas with very high internet access costs.

There is a way to have offline Cardano node synch with the local device and then upload to the mainnet whenever there is the internet as per Charles Hoskinson which he mentions in one of his videos. This device is promising similar technology and such technology is highly critical for the proliferation of Cardano in Africa which is targetted by Cardano in a major way. Cardano hopes to become the financial operating system for the unbanked. With this aim, there is a critical need to develop offline and low bandwidth low-cost solutions.

The team's full stack developer has experience of working with software giants. The github repository of Lokole software is active with 1500+ commits and about 15 forks. Therefore it can be said that the project is actively in development. The technical risk in achieving Cardano node integration using Lokole and its hardware is likely to be substantial. However, the Cardano node has the unique distinction of running on a raspberry pi without much issue in a stable manner using Solar panels. Therefore it is highly likely that the team will be able to successfully complete the project in the proposed timeframe.

Therefore the proposal gives an impression that one engineer will be able to develop the complete code and customisation for achieving the target. There is a phase in the project for consultation between Lokole system software developers and Cardano Ecosystem developers to share and learn how both topologies work. This is difficult to understand for me in the sense that the team proposing a project in Catalyst should be knowing the Cardano network in a better manner and the process of consultation after the project launch is likely to bring out some risks which were not appreciated during the project formulation phase. A much more detailed breakdown of the budget with better task analysis would have added tremendous value to this important proposal.

The overlap with Cardano is that proposers aims to run a shareable Cardano client web application on the device, and thus provide an access to blockchain for those, who are currently not-connected. I think such solution can cause a large impact especially within Africa region (makes me wonder why it was not submitted withing \u201cgrow Africa, grow Cardano\u201d challenge), nevertheless, its development can onboard many users and is aligned with the long-term Cardano vision in general.

The budget requested is 67 200 USD, and it is calculated as engineer salary and project coordinator, with 35 dollars hourly rate, for a FTE for 6 months. It would be better to outline at what parts of project the engineer or project manager step in, since the roadmap is 9 months, but budget is only for 6 month (so I assume some overlap, but it is not described in the proposal).
