For this, the idea is to integrate the music incubator in Cardano and, in addition, to create an SPO that would work as a \u201cpool of pools\u201d, to finance the artists.\n\nThere are two main problems observed in this project. The first revolves around musicians, as they often lose money to major labels and/or are struggling to get some funding to stay in the music business. The second problem envisioned refers to the idea that small SPOs are fighting for crumbs while large SPOs exist. Therefore, the idea of creating this Music Incubator integrated with the Pool of Pools aims to solve, in a way, these two problems \u2013 musician would be financed and the reward of the larger pool would be distributed among the smaller pools.\n\nThis directly aligns with the challenge at hand because: a) they are bringing in people who might not be interested and would not look into the blockchain ecosystem, and by running this project on Cardano, this new community will interact directly with the ADA; and b) it solves a real-world problem using the Cardano blockchain, potentially increasing blockchain utilization and visibility.\n\nThe metrics and goals of the idea also correlate with the challenge, as they measure the growth of the project and they, indirectly (some metrics) and directly (others), align with those of the goal. Ultimately, it will increase Cardano's integration with the real world and increase the volume of transactions within it.\n\nAs the MVP gets ready, the project starts rolling and the marketing starts to work its magic, it's entirely possible for the project to scale and reach many musicians from all over the world. Furthermore, because music moves many people, it is plausible to think that small SPOs will also join for two reasons: 1) support for artists of their choice; and 2) the possibility of increasing your rewards (even those exclusive to the assisted artists).\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In order to verify its feasibility, we need to verify the following aspects:\n1 \u2013 roadmap: Unfortunately, there wasn't a good detailing of the plan itself. Firstly, the homesite was not provided, which I believe should have more information and, in addition, it was said that it would probably already be available. Perhaps the most elaborate plan, containing the steps to be taken within this project, with a vision of the future, is integrated with the requested budget. However, even checking the two parts together, there is still a need to explain further the allocation of resources and the steps taken. I understand that the development and marketing teams are outsourced and, perhaps for this reason, there are not so many details (neither financial nor procedural). However, to facilitate project feasibility, whether it is this specific project or the specific projects you have asked to deliver, there should be a sequence of events, with deadlines and checkpoints. For example, the first budget listed is for the voting tool, however, there is no deadline for execution, there are no checkpoints, there is not much to work on here. Therefore, I miss more detailed information for the execution of the project.\nDespite knowing that teams are specialized and that individual tasks will be performed, it is necessary to have an idea of the steps so that we can verify the total feasibility, verify that everything will fit together.\n\n2 \u2013 budget: Same thing for the budget. Are these values for hours only? Did you hire a closed package or will you have to pay some tool, monthly fee, etc? It would be interesting to have more detail on this part.\n\n3 \u2013 team: The teams that are working together have a lot of experience in what they do, being well known. So there's no need to worry about deliveries.\n\n4 \u2013 risk management: There are some risks listed by the proposer, however, mitigation actions were not listed (not directly). Obviously, the risk of getting musicians can be reduced with the marketing team, strategizing to talk to the musicians and attract them to the project.\nAnother listed risk that raises some concern is the feasibility of the Pool of pools project (stakingDAO Project), which can directly influence the future development of this idea. It is necessary to join forces for the final execution of both projects for the benefit of blockchain (once it manages to flow with musicians and delegations in its pool, it can generate funding to assist in the completion of the project).\n\n5 \u2013 self-funding/scalability: The project, if successful, is able to sustain itself and, if the marketing strategy is correct, it will be able to scale both to the musicians and to the delegates.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In order to audit, we need:\n1 \u2013 roadmap w/ milestones: As mentioned earlier, because there is not enough information for the roadmap and, with it, there is also no division of smaller tasks that have defined deadlines to assist in the verification, it makes it difficult to audit the project. That is, to allow everyone to follow the development of the project, it is necessary that there is an increase in the total detail of the project development phases.\n\n2 \u2013 Metrics and KPI: The added metrics and KPI are excellent for tracking the development of the project and, if they are on the wrong path, it will be possible to take action to circumvent this situation.\n\n3 \u2013 Channel: It was not provided an own channel to share information (although it was said that there is a channel \u2013 I was not able to find it).\n\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2298", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3981, "q0": "In my understanding of the proposal, the goal is to create and implement a Music incubator, a Project Catalyst of musicians and lovers of music. It is planned to act on a Stakepool-network foundation, where the people staking help decide on what artist that will get funded by voting. As an active musician and a Cardano enthusiast, the idea of a decentralized music incubator is very exciting. In my experience as a recurring PA since fund 6. I have yet to see such a unique proposal that addresses the music industry in this way, especially since it also involves SPOs. The discussion on how the music industry doesn\u2019t allow artists to profit properly, nor have the freedom of being their own creator has been a very prominent reality for a long time, that is why I believe projects such as this is very important. Most similar projects are focused on NFTs and music royalties, which is why this proposal stand out a bit, instead focusing on new artists realizing their creativity into reality. The idea of putting the decisions in the hands of the music enthusiasts via the SPO-idea crosses the border of pure blockchain tech and arts in a natural way, and could act as a stepping stone for people not experienced with Blockchain tech or Cardano. (And thus increasing the number of participants in the Cardano ecosystem). \n\nBut what exactly does the delegates get? Will it be some kind of NFTs from the artists they choose to support, or something else? This is information I would like to have seen included in the proposal, at least a thesis or suggestion on it. (Even if that decision is up to the artists). \n\nDue to the reasons stated above, I believe that there is incredible value in trying to prove this business model, both for the music industry and for the Cardano Ecosystem. I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "First off, the proposer has experience of submitting in Catalyst since several funds back (6), and being funded for one of them. The proposer states within the proposal that they (most likely) will not need to return for further funding, since they plan to be self-sufficient as soon as possible. \u2028\u2028The proposer states that the official project and website is up and running by the time of reading the proposal, but this is sadly not referenced anywhere. Considering that the website is where they\u2019ll post valuable information like a list of the funded artists, it would be very nice to see the website (and preferably social media channels) in the proposal. \nBy reading the proposal we know what the proposer wants to achieve, but it would be beneficial if the proposal included a proper roadmap (with included milestones) set on a timeframe. This way it would be easier to estimate the amount of work that is being done, and when we can expect new functionality and other updates, etc. \n\nCollaborating on this proposal is several known actors within the Cardano ecosystem. AIM has improved the workflow and mindset of numerous Catalyst members (including myself, I\u2019m using the PA-tool right now). Also onboarding the StakingDAO project is a very smart idea, from Rhys\u2019s experiences with decentralized staking and running small SPO-networks. They also mention to have included a popular youtuber, but this is harder to verify the impact on, since youtube influencers are affected by so many different aspects. All of these are linked to in the proposal, so it is easy to verify their existence and previous work. \u2028Regarding the lead proposer, there are some information missing that I would\u2019ve liked to see included. If we had the official website included in the proposal, there would probably be information there but that is out of our reach, as of now. I would have loved to see the expertise validated by some LinkedIn-profiles or social media channels, or references to earlier work related to the areas needed for the completion of this project. \n\nThe total budget requested is 30 400, which seems quite reasonable for starting a project like this. In the budget breakdown provided we can see that almost a third of it will go to AIM and the development of their voting tool, for example. Most funds will go to hired consultants, developers or the initial funding for the musicians. A suggestion could be to include an estimation of the work hours for each responsibility area or person, in order to assess the workload of the proposal, especially if we would also be provided with an estimated timeframe of each milestone. \u2028\u2028Even though this information is missing and I would\u2019ve liked to see it included, the project is stated to be already live as of writing this, which means it is already implemented in its initial phase. This cannot be verified by the information contained in the proposal, which is a shame. Therefore, I neither agree nor disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The KPIs intended for this proposal is spot on, and highly relevant in order to measure the success of implementation. Number of delegators, number of artists, number of value distributed, number of single SPOs, etc. The proposer states that all of these numbers will be published on the official website. As stated under feasibility, it would be wonderful to have that website included in the proposal, since it cannot be verified as of now. Transparency is super important, and the proposal would benefit greatly by allowing the community to give feedback on a variety of channels (social media, official website, etc). Also, if the proposal would include timeframes in conjunction with the milestones, the community would be able to follow the progress of the development, step by step.

DEMU is the kind of innovative, inclusive and self sovereign platform that led Champ Medici to bring his father, Snoop Dogg, to the Cardano community. In actuality, it was Clay Nation that struck the deal with Snoop, but it is exactly this type of forward thinking that brings high caliber artists to our community. In the latest iteration of DEMU, Cruz requests funding for a self governing stake pool community of artists within the DEMU umbrella. The design entails creating a \u201cpool of pools\u201d whereby individual artists can be supported by their own stake pool, but can receive rewards more commonly associated with large pools by amalgamating resources into a host pool that contains all of the smaller individual pools associated with each specific artist.

These highly measurable metrics ensure transparency and full accountability.

The idea, in general, is to allow fans and people interested in music to support the career of artists through financial collection. The music incubator would go main in the Stake Pool model where each pool would finance an artist, as I understand it; it is very interesting that the proponent has made a parallel with Catalyst itself, in which projects are first presented to the community, evaluated and then voted for funding. Photos would be delegated to Pool operators, and artists would reward them with exclusive items, such as music NFTs (it's not really clear whether the NFT would be an artwork, a song, an album cover, or fan articles at all). ). With this, the proponent intends that \u201call artists can become their own record labels and their own participation groups, and their fans can delegate to them. In return, delegating fans can select artists that are financed by the label.\u201d I thought the idea was very good, as it would allow new artists to be able to produce content without necessarily being linked to a traditional label - we know how bureaucratic this market is and also how high the percentages in the profit sharing of the labels are, so that artists not have such a high return. This can generate new opportunities for them, but without a doubt also a project that can bring many benefits to Cardano, because: firstly, the number of transactions being minted on our blockchain would increase, while NFTs would be minted, probably the payments for artists it would be done via smart contracts, new Pools would be created, generally it would increase the circulation of Ada; 2) the idea could be a great attraction for new members to join our ecosystem, as people would be attracted to the music and the new modality of support for independent artists. We would not necessarily attract an audience that already belongs to the cryptographic world. However, some explanations were lacking to better clarify how this relationship would take place between these new people, who would be arriving in the community and getting to know Cardano's technologies: how would they learn to create digital wallets, Ada delegates to support their favorite artists? Apart from this more pragmatic issue, the proposal is very interesting and in line with the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the script, unfortunately there is a big gap of information that should be said.

First, we would need to know more about the work of the developers, what their routines would be like, the partial results expected for each month, how long the site would be in full operation (it is said that it would already be launched when the proposal was published, but I would like to know how long it would be operating at 100%.

That way, we would have tangible material to be audited, to understand if what was planned was being fulfilled. As the proposal is presented, unfortunately it is not possible to audit progress, only partial successes, which would be perceived by metrics such as \u201cmore delegation to small SPOs, more exposure for new artists and direct financial support for them, easier access to new music and less gatekeeping for listeners, more labels represented in Cardano and greater decentralization of Cardano\u201d.

It would be necessary to understand further about how the artists who would be financed would be developing, if in fact their goals would have been achieved through this project, as well as the general public, how they would be using technologies such as NFTs and etc; how they would be making use of the technologies of our ecosystem. In general, in my view, auditability is not so adequate, both because we don't know how the progress could be measured (we don't have a roadmap, this would need to be defined and it would also be necessary for there to be monthly reports, updating our community on advances); we have a certain understanding of the final successes, but not to the point where we can be sure that the context will be well studied and presented to our community.
