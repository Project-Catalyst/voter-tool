In my (relatively short, around 2 years) experience of cryptocurrencies, I\u2019ve noticed that portfolio managers are quite popular and widely used. I have limited knowledge about the market of portfolio managers, but each one that I have encountered or heard of has been facilitated by a third party. Considering that this proposed product is without involving a third party (and being offline)\nI can imagine that many people would be attracted to the idea of it (due to the increased security of it). \nIn the end it is pretty much up to each individual what tools you are using, some people prefer the easiness of automatic updates of the portfolio and backup plans if you lose your password, but with the added risk of a third party managing it. Others are attracted to the safer route. Which one is the \u2018best\u2019 is up to the individual, but there is definitely some value in offering both (or more) options, which is why I believe that this product would be relevant as a product. The proposer states the intended problem (secure offline portfolio managers are non-existent on the current market) and the solution (create encrypted offline portfolio without the need of third party management). \u2028\u2028The proposal includes some information (this could be a bit more detailed) on \u2018how\u2019 the product is intended to work, which is nice to see. For a person who doesn\u2019t have deep technical expertise, maybe a brief explanation on how the AES-256 cipher algorithm works could benefit the proposal. \u2028\u2028If I understand it correctly, this product will be used on Android and iOS phones, but doesn\u2019t that make the security of the portfolio manager only as strong as the security of the device that it is on? A discussion or paragraph mentioning this about under potential risks (apart from the mentioned economic risk) would be highly appreciated, in order to understand the use cases of the product. Also, if the manager is intended to be offline, how will the updates to the portfolio be provided? Will I have to add .csv-files each time I add an asset, and how will the updates work if the app is offline? These might be newbie-questions, but remember that the people intended to use this aren\u2019t all technological experts, and the more information included in the proposal about the product, the better. As a PA (since Fund 6), communicating your whole idea (and execution of it) is imperative, it will make it easier to comprehend the proposal and the possibility of its desired effect. \u2028\u2028It is assumed that the success of the product will be measured by number of users, but I have trouble finding any listed KPIs within the proposal, which I would recommend. Even if I (as PA) assumes what the proposer intends, it should rather be left for the proposer to explain. \u2028\u2028Overall, I agree that this proposal addresses the challenge effectively.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Disclaimer: The app seems to have been released on play store and App Store already, I haven\u2019t gotten around to downloading it and knowing the functionality of it yet, so have that in mind when reading my rationale. It is also a bit confusing when paired with the information contained within the proposal. \n\nWhat speaks well for the feasibility of the proposal and the trust of the proposers is that they aim to develop and release the product whether they get funded or not, which implies high commitment. Also that the process seem to be underway already (since 6 months, with a working prototype ), albeit in its infancy (as shown on the official website provided). What I would like to see included in the proposal is a detailed roadmap that would explain the different milestones that need to be reached before successfully releasing the product, when the team plans to reach each milestone and preferably how. There are some milestones given, but in the wrong place of the proposal (under the budget breakdown).\nThe only timeframe we are given currently is a potential delivery date of December 1, 2022. I\u2019m unsure if the proposer has forgotten to update their proposal with this key information or misunderstood the questions in some way, but it is information that is vital. \n\nAs mentioned before, the budget breakdown does not contain information on the budget allocations, so I would suggest to include information on for example: How many people will work on each responsibility are, and for how many hours per week? What areas will be covered by the budget?\nSpeaking of people, we are provided with information on the expertise of the team, but no information on the team members themselves. This could preferably be further expanded upon by including LinkedIn-profiles or links to previous projects worked on, so that we could verify the competency and proof of person of the team members. The proposer also has another proposal submitted for Fund 9, and I would like to have seen a small paragraph explaining on how the proposer plans to manage the potential workload if both proposals should be funded. \u2028\u2028Considering the lack of information provided in the proposal, I disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. If only some verifications on the team, budget, roadmap and product development would be included, all of this would be entirely different since the project seems to be on good way already. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "After doing some detective work on the official website of the product, I found a discord server created by the proposer. It only contains 14 members (at the time of writing this assessment) and the name doesn\u2019t correlate with the product mentioned in this proposal. \nThe website contains a page with release notes, but this is labeled as \u2018planned to be released soon\u2019, which makes everything confusing since the app apparently is available for download on play store. Having active communication channels open to the public is immensely important, the community needs to be able to track the (updated and consistent) development progress. Having different information on each informational space of the same product, with non consistent information on the progress of development or non-verifiable information on the team building the product does not speak well for the transparency of the proposal. \n\u2028After adding those possibilities for the community, I would suggest (as mentioned briefly under \u2018feasibility\u2019) that the proposer would add relevant KPIs, or measurements of success. For example, number of downloads per month, or measured after each 3 month period. Will the proposer accept feedback from the alpha and beta testers, and are these participants from the community? Transparency and communication, simply put. \u2028\u2028I might have missed this relevant information (please correct me if I\u2019m wrong), but there is very little information included in the proposal that makes it able for me as a PA to assess the level of audibility fairly. I strongly disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.

And this solution aims to increase data security. The problem observed was that the vast majority of existing portfolio apps are connected to the internet in some way, which, on the one hand, is quite comfortable because the user can access their assets anywhere, but, on the other hand, there is a risk of information leakage, which is not interesting, especially these days.\n\nWhile this is a necessary and pertinent application, it does not correlate with the challenge because it does not correlate with the increased use of blockchain. It will not make use of blockchain and it will not encourage people to use blockchain more. Therefore, unfortunately, I believe that sponsorship of this idea is not relevant.\n\nMetrics or objectives for this project were also not presented. Of course, in the end, the goal is to finish the application with various usability, however, there is nothing that correlates with the specific use of the cardano blockchain. In addition, as there are no metrics, it is difficult to assess the impact of the proposal. Therefore, as a suggestion, metrics and objectives should be added that correlate the completion/success of this proposal with the objectives of the ADA.\n\nThe scalability of the project is related to the number of users and people reached, which seems feasible to me. However, no monetization plan was presented and no extra sponsorship was requested.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "In order to verify its feasibility, we need to verify the following aspects:\n1 \u2013 roadmap: A detailed plan to fulfill the project objective was not presented. The only thing presented was a deadline for the launch of the platform. Therefore, it is not possible to verify the possibility of meeting the objectives since it was not presented what will be done. As a suggestion, it would be interesting to add information about the tasks to be performed to complete the project and, with them, who will be allocated to it and the deadline for completion.\n\n2 \u2013 budget: USD 23K was requested, however there was no explanation of any task or tool that this money would be allocated. Therefore, the requirement of this amount of money is not coherent. It would be interesting, as in the plan, to add information on what it will take to complete the project and where that money will be allocated, in as much detail as possible.\n\n3 \u2013 team: The number of members and their capabilities were informed. However, no proof of knowledge/experience was provided.\n\n4 \u2013 risk management: It was said that the only risk is financial and that it would only delay delivery. However, I imagine there may be implementation, disclosure and acceptance risks. It's not just delivering a product, you have to deliver a product that people want to use. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the product together with the customer, receive feedback and improve the tool. In addition, it is important that potential customers know about the existence of the product. Therefore, as a suggestion, it is important to allocate part of the requested resource for marketing.\n\n5 \u2013 self-funding/scalability: As already mentioned, no monetization plan was made explicit. In addition, scalability is linked to the usability of the tool, so if there is risk management together with the client and joint assessment, the project will be scalable.\n\nAlthough there are several lacks of information, it is important to mention that there is a beta version running. Therefore, despite all the lack of information, it may be possible for the project to be completed.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In order to audit, we need:\n1 \u2013 roadmap w/ milestones: A detailed project plan with the \u201cdeliverables\u201d and deadlines was not presented.

Therefore, as a suggestion, you can include some metrics such as number of downloads, number of feedbacks and interaction, etc. It is important for a project to be aware of the indicators that must be followed and their objectives.\n\n3 \u2013 Channel: The proposal has its own website which could share information.\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_2298", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4571, "q0": "This proposal articulates an easily relatable problem/concern to anyone who has built up a diverse mix of crypto assets and is using a cloud-based portfolio tool to track it all: what are those services doing with that information? Given the substantial security risks and frequent hacks within the space, crypto-holders will likely feel a lot better using a tool that they're certain isn't painting a target on their backs.\n\nThe Impact section of this proposal is brief, but it's a straightforward and familiar enough concept to get away with it. I would, however, suggest that the proposer enumerate all the features the app will have when completed within the proposal itself. What, if anything, will the user be giving up by using this solution? \n\nThere could be an argument made that the project doesn't particularly tie into Cardano and therefore doesn't necessarily advance the ecosystem, but I believe Catalyst's reputation would benefit from being attached to a successful implementation of this project, which could in turn draw in cryptoholders invested in other chains.
