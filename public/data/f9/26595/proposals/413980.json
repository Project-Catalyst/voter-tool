The project is now seeking to add a staking pool and a DAO as part of its efforts to scale up and become self-sustaining.\n\nThis proposal is a natural outgrowth of the previous round of funding, and fits in well with Cardano's general community values and guidelines. One could argue this proposal could better fit into the Cardano <3s DAOs challenge due to the DAO component, but in light of the broader project, Dapps, Products, & Integrations should be broad enough to accommodate it.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has a good idea of what this phase of the project will entail and has laid out an adequate roadmap for getting there. Creating an SPO is well-worn territory, but, as the proposal acknowledges, the team is seeking external talent to build and operate C4S, which could lead to some potential complications. At the same time, leadership seems knowledgeable and proactive in forming the necessary partnerships.\n\nThe proposal could also be improved by a further exploration of how the new native asset will work. Tokenomics can be tricky, so this isn't a trivial issue to leave hanging. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A stake pool is one of the more visible and obvious components of the Cardano network, as well as one of the easiest to get metrics on. Therefore, it should be very easy to audit this aspect of the project. The commitment to transparency and Agile development by the team should also make development easy to track.\n\nOn the other hand, there are still some unaccounted for aspects to the DAO element of the project that may be harder to get a handle on. While tokenomics aren't yet finalized, a preliminary strategy would add clarity to this project.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2564", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7462, "q0": "I have gone through a couple of your proposals already, and I have to give it to your team. You are truly tapping a demographic that very few of us even consider. The amount of knowledge and experience that we could gain from seniors could be game changing for us as an ecosystem. One of the biggest things about Cardano is the fact that we have so many highly intelligent, mature adults in our ecosystem ready to help change the world. This project furthers those goals by tapping into a resource that most chains completely overlook. This thinking outside of the box is what makes us so strong as an ecosystem. I think Catalyst needs to fund more independent stake pool operators if we want to become as decentralized as we need to be. My concern right now is the fact that some of the largest corporations, such as coinbase, own an absolutely massive stake in Cardano as a whole. We need to get as far away from centralization as we possibly can if we ever want to not fail where almost every other VC chain has. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Seeing that you are considering AWS as a reliable partner to run the stake pool worries me. Not only for security reasons, but for lack of decentralization implications. AWS is also notorious for going down, and a successful stake pool (especially one that is brand new) MUST be up 99% of the time if you want to have any measurable impact as an SPO. Your team seems very capable of pulling this off, however, the fact that neither of you have the time to dedicate to this worries me that the funding may not be enough to get done what you need. You are asking for a relatively small amount, and I think if you are going to start a stake pool... you should have some personal skin in the game to begin with. I see stake pools as a great way to have long term investment return, but the fact that you are doing this in order to launch just another asset on the blockchain worries me. Your proposal doesn't seem to have as much thought and effort put into it as your others, either. With all of that being said, I will continue to support and champion the ideas your team is striving for. I hope I do not discourage you at all, because what you are doing is truly important work. I just think you should start building a community around your project and leverage them as help for getting your initial costs of running an SPO off the ground.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I think your success metrics are severely lacking in this proposal. There is almost no way to transparently show us, as a community, that you are using the funds in a wise manner. I would like to see your team documenting this as an experience through youtube videos and leverage social media such as Facebook and Twitter to show us what you are doing along the way. I have apprehensions giving funding to anyone that cannot break down every metric they possibly can to indicate success. As an ecosystem, I think it is EXTREMELY important to gain more independent SPOs on Cardano. With that being said, I believe that you guys should secure your team prior to funding and get the initial leg work done to have a solid plan in place before coming to catalyst for funding. Stake pools are the life blood of our ecosystem, and as a result, I feel like if you are gaining funding to create one, you need to be as transparent and open as possible to the community. I would like to see your team build awareness to the C4S team first as to not waste the funding that would be given to you. Build out on social media and make your presence known, gain the followers and potential stakers that you need, build a plan and get a solid team together, and then I will feel comfortable granting funding for such a project.

I end up ranking this section a 4 because I\u2019m optimistic about the whole C4S ecosystem (all 4 proposals including this one). This one is extremely cheap compared to most other Catalyst proposals and it provides a plethora of benefits for this ecosystem, so I greenlight it. I will point out that this proposal is mistaken that the stake pool will not increase Cardano\u2019s TVL because ADA staking is not locked. So that\u2019s not actually a benefit from this proposal. This section does not list a lot of benefits that it will actually bring like measurability of the C4S ecosystem to give us a guage of how much conversion in the senior population that this program has seen. This stake pool will provide a branded stake pool that seniors can develop trust for when being introduced to the Cardano ecosystem because I expect a lot of skepticism for the senior populations. I think they\u2019ve properly assessed the risks and have a solid long-term plan to multiply the resources approved from this proposal. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Since it seems like they have a dedicated stake pool operator that has all the technical skills necessary to run this SPO, I give this section a solid 5. The team will also be engaging with experienced entities with ISPOs to prep for the potential future of building out their own native token (which would be another bonus for developing trust among seniors). They cite projects like Maestro or Genius X to consult for ISPO development but I wonder why they wouldn\u2019t engage with players that have more ISPO experience like MELD and SundaeSwap. I could raise some concerns about whether or not $2500 is necessary to build a sufficient stake pool machine but I feel like it\u2019s insignificant to the greater mission and they certainly do want to provide something that will be reliable long term. If they did want to secure greater voter confidence, I might suggest breaking down budgeted items more to determine spending efficiency. Overall, this seems like an easily accomplished proposal for a potentially high-impact mission. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This section lists various guiding questions as a measuring stick for success but I think there\u2019s a missed opportunity to aim for target metrics on the success of the stake pool. 3 stars. There\u2019s a lot of goals that can be aimed at with a stake pool including uptime, # of wallets, and staked amount. Since C4S has a direct audience that they\u2019re trying to convert into the Cardano ecosystem, this stake pool is basically an additional measure of success for the greater ecosystem. So I think voters would like to see target goals for these metrics to secure voter confidence in ecosystem success. This section does give one quantified metric for success in \u201c100 seniors that stake with the C4S stakepool\u201d but it doesn\u2019t give a timeline for it. I think an objective target would give voters an idea of how successful they expect to be, and committing to a certain level of performance.
