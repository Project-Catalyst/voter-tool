Each stage will have 1 month to perform, during which each sub-task is also listed. So in my opinion the process is fine. The requested budget of $18,020 is also very well allocated, we know what it will be used for in a very specific way. The team presents qualifications and experience consistent with the objectives identified in the proposal. The track record of the individuals involved in this proposal demonstrates their passion, affiliation, and willingness to make this proposal a success.

So in my opinion, the proponent should prepare reports, at least monthly, with project updates, and share them directly with the community. The success of the project is also clearly defined as the evolution of the ESG score and Carbon Tracking model, with its ability to comply with changing international standards.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2299", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3474, "q0": "ESG matters are more and more relevant, specially at big company levels. Reporting these metrics and achievements to society is nowadays crucial for companies to keep up with their reputation, stay compliant with legislations and lower its enviromental impact.\nThere are indeed a lot of discussions around the best practises and standards around, depding on company type, location and main activity. This proposal aims to create a onchain mechanism that may facilitate this report. While having a more reliable and easier mechanism to do so, it is not clear here how blockchain features will help that, whe ncompared to off-chain solutions existing nowadays. Sure, Cardano will levarage this, as a new application for it will be developed (and thefore proposal is aligned with challenge) but the benefits for whomever is adopting th on-chain approach could be better ellaborated. It says only that blockchain will alow for more tranparency but it could be more explored how the blockchaiun features will alow that and how the solution would work in practise (maybe bringing examples).\n For instance, it could explain that having registers that are not changeble, as blockchain ones, could contribuite for this tranparency.\nBesides tranparency, other advantages could also be mentioned, when compared to off chain, to make the value propositon for other stakeholders even more appealing (what else would drive companies/organizations/projects to adopt this rathar than adopting other solutions?)\nOne thing that I liked a lot here is including \"Carbon Credits Tracking and reduction\". I see this as great potential for blockchain application for one of the key challenges humanity faces today.\n\nAll in all, the idea here if developed can be quite powerful and increase Cardano adoption anywhere in the world, but I'll rate it as 4 as the value propsition could be better explained.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "there's a time-framed plan with good activities in it.

This would bring in a large portion of people who care about climate issues into the cardano ecosystem. This would grow the real-world application of cardano and help to improve the overall environmental impact of projects and proposals on Cardano. This tool could be developed by the team who is proposing it and it would help further their own dApp, but also serve as a tool that could validate the ESG measures of other projects as well. While the impact of this could be huge, it is also a really specific project with the possibility of not appealing to a very large market of Cardano projects. It could also turn out to be far more complex to develop this into a tool that could be deployed by other projects than the team estimates.  By deploying this verification process, the projects could appeal to a wider range of investors, even growing beyond crypto markets.

The detailed plan includes key Milestones, but does not include actionable steps. This project is feasible but additional detail could have helped assessment. for example they could have included which team members will be working on which part. They could have expanded how each goal is to be completed. Your time frame does include time for other work on their other proposals. This is a benefit.

The Proposal List success in terms of what it takes to get an ESC score oh, but the plan of The Proposal is to develop a tool to help other projects determine their ESG scores. This leads to some confusion as to the goal and whether or not it will be auditable. Based on the auditability metrics the goal appears to only earn an ESG rating for the proposal team. but the impact statement suggests the goal is to create a rating tool that can be used by other projects. For auditability they should have included measuring their milestones in the timeline, and maintaining your budget. They could have included information on how they were planning on reporting two Catalyst and two other community members. I could have also included information regarding growing a community surrounding their proposal.

It needs to be stated first that the lower requested funds from this proposal gives it WAY more weight for positive outcome than other proposals with a more average cost of $35k-$40k. I would be so bold as to suggest that this proposal could have a higher impact to the Cardano ecosystem than many other proposals because establishes a public standard that will further play into the developing narrative that Cardano is an environmentally concious blockchain community. This ESG standard may be a major tool in attracting adopters that care about environmentalism and/or energy efficiency, which I think could have been quantified with presented data on how many people find this to be an important issue (in the world). While this proposal thoroughly outlines what these standards would be and how they would be reviewed, I think this section is lacking that quantifiabiilty and research that gives voters a sense of magnitude as a result of this proposal being approved. Also, the nature of the problem statement is not presented with a sense of urgency as to why Cardano/cryptocurrency needs these ESG standards. I also think it might benefit this section to provide a little bit more explanation on how these standards/ratings would be displayed, to provide a reliable link to the impacts related to Cardano adoption. I vote overwhelmingly positive because I think it\u2019s important for the world and I can see the theoretical impact on the Cardano ecosystem as a result. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "If the Cardano community was looking for qualified big brains to formulate these standards, they found it here. I rank this section a 5 because of the intimidating level of education, expedient production, and the relative efficiency in spending. While we get a lot of educated individuals in the Cardano ecosystem, we don\u2019t see a lot of PhDs in microbiology that actively work in biotech and Algae Energy Farms. Since it\u2019s not within our regular crowd of experts, I think these individuals are uniquely positioned to see this proposal to completion because they are likely among a small population of individuals educated in biological sciences (not to mention the demonstrable business skill behind it). Plus, it looks like the team already has a strong framework established for the direction of these standards and the systems that enforce it, as demonstrated by the roadmap. As far as spending goes, the labor allocated for ESG advice & consultancy is a little on the higher end but the majority of the budget is allocated for ESG research, which is wildly undervalued in the cost per hour. So the overall evaluation leans much more to the side of efficiency. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question of feasibility here, so my reaction is very positive here. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The nature of this proposal is much different than what we might normally see from Catalyst proposals in a way that sort of modifies the expectation for definitions of success. Normally, I expect to see KPIs that measure platform usage with quantifiable targets and progressive milestone metrics. In this case, I think there is some room for tracking the number of evaluations, the website traffic where ratings might be displayed, or the number of ESG certifications that get awarded. This might give voters a sense of impact calculations and cost-benefit analysis. Still, I\u2019m inclined to lend less weight to the need for those expectations, in favor of a thoroughly formulated standard and a widely recognized authority, which I feel like I get from this section. I also appreciate the closing \u201cfun fact,\u201d as this is a criminally underemphasized truth that does not get enough attention in circles of climate change activists.
