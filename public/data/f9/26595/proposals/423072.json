I enjoy reading and assessing the latter group \u2013 as they usually seem to be potential breakthroughs. Yes, blockchain is early in evolutionary terms and \u201ccommunication\u201d between and among eutxo addresses is mostly enabled through transactions and/or smart contracts. Communication between the people who control the eutxo addresses is not possible \u2013 if they do not Dox themselves [Dox \u2013 has an interesting etymology btw, as it means really to unmask someone by dropping documents/docs on someone\u2019s identity into the public domain. Docs became dox \u2013 and is now a verb\u2026]. So the point of blockchain is a trustless environment with presumed privacy \u2013 hence we come to situation such as the recent announcement by Maladex (a Dex builder in the Cardano ecosystem) that they want to close all their stakepools and they are calling on people who staked with them \u2013 to remove their staked ADA from Maladex pools as they will no longer be earning rewards and will not help secure Cardano. Yet, there is no way to contact these stakers. Some of them will leave their staked ADA in retiring Maladex pools for years. Similar thing happened with the recent Genius Yield pool Gen 4 that had a failed configuration file. Hence, to cut a long story short, this proposal aims to bridge that gap by creating a messaging service. The proposer correctly identified that it is impossible to send a message to an owner of an address, but he proposes a solution that would encrypt such messages and deliver them \u2013 after encrypting them through a CBOR hex datum as metadata of a transaction. Cool.  Seems smack bang in the center of what this challenge is about. As the proposers state, this tool will make it easier to [anonymously] communicate with address and NFT owners, which opens many new opportunities for the Cardano blockchain. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal will be implemented by a team of developers who are the people who developed internet companies Ratecard and WebFeedback \u2013 according to the proposal. I am not aware of the impact of Ratecard and WebFeedback \u2013 however they seem to be platforms for reciprocal communication between service providers and service customers, which is in a way loosely connected to the crux of this catalyst proposal. The team has provided LinkedIn profiles for the team leader Jeroen Sakkers and his two companies, the companies are active \u2013 according to the LinkedIn profile. Ratecard is a company with 4 employees, while Webfeedback is the same. Both companies are Netherlands-based (Amsterdam). The Ratecard.io website has been registered since 2016, so it was not setup recently. The proposal offers a realistic timetable to complete the work \u2013 with three stages of development, with the R&D stage to be completed by August, DMs (direct messaging) by October and Broadcasting by December 2022. The team has budgeted 1,200 hours of development, totaling a budget of $72,000 at an hourly rate of $60/hour. I had to check what is the crux of the encrypting direct messaging mechanism proposed by the team [\u201cencrypt messages through a CBOR hex datum as metadata of a transaction\u201d. CBOR is a Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) - a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, which would seem to be suitable for integration. Wallet owners would connect their wallets with the proposed new platform and be able to anonymously check their inboxes for messages, read, reply and flag messages as spam. Another amazing addition is the ability to connect an email address for receiving new message alerts \u2013 which would be required if the system is to have a realistic chance of real-time communication. What I think could have been included in the proposal (please include it if you will resubmit it) is more details about the technological challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation and how to mitigate them. Also, I miss some more information on the platform and its technical aspects including details or mockups or a walkthough on software architecture and whether and how much Haskell and Plutus integration (and resources) will be needed. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team has identified (and created) a public channel for informing the community about their progress in implementing the proposal. It is a Discord server managed by the proposer Victor Mundi  -for a related project Apewatch (https://apewatch.app/) that watches the value of any address on Cardano. The webpage allows users to watch assets that are owned, listed or transferred by any address \u201cand save time by checking the floors of the NFTs and the rates of the coins\u201d. Although I came to the page \u2013 indirectly \u2013 via the Discord server, it just reinforced my opinion that the proposing team is invested in Cardano in terms of its technology and its abilities, having a CNFT web search platform under their wing. As regards the proposal itself, the team has identified a very important problem in the Cardano space and has a vision of how to address it. I think that for proof of stake systems that rely on user activity and delegation to active pools, this capability of contacting ADA holders (or even CNFT holders) is a win-win for the system, for the stability of Cardano, for SPOs and for the entire ecosystem. We need an anonymous system that is decentralized and resilient \u2013 but adding an optional communication layer is a boost. The solution seems effective, if no special challenges emerge. As regards public updates over the Discord channel \u2013 that is great, and I have to applaud their specificity because the team committed to weekly updates. This is great for auditability purposes. Furthermore, the team also committed to allow the community to vote on the implementation of features, the platform\u2019s design, and more. The team has not relied on simple metrics, but also committed to certain KPIs such as \u201caiming for 100,000 messages to be sent to 10,000+ unique addresses in the first year\u201d. Having a specific goal in mind will help the team strive for success.

The proposer provides an estimated 6months timeline to deliver the project. Owing to the fact that there's not much information about the supposed design of the protocol as well as a technical implementation plan, i still want to draw the attention of team to the fact that if these has to be fully onchain, that means all messages sent will attract a transaction fee and if i have to pay to send regular messages which i can send on whatsApp or other platforms, why then will i use a platform i have to pay (pay crypto fee and also burn my data), secondly, team should also consider the security risk involved with incorporating instant messaging with a wallet that is supposedly meant to hold assets/funds. Major upcoming social media platforms are rather creating incentive for users and not requiring them to pay to send chats. I personally will not socialise using a wallet that hold my cryptos no matter how secure it claims. All these combined pose risk and questions the sustainability of the project although it can be built.\nThe budget dictates hours that'll be put to building the project but how those values were arrived needs clarity (according to the proposer, Research and protocol design is still in progress and will be concluded in August 2022), how then is the proposer able to propose an amount and time required for building an item that is still under research.

One thing I don't understand is broadcasting messages feature, public messages like this will appear when both the receiver and the sender of the message agree, right? And can followers only see or can they still interact? I hope you will be more specific about this small part.\nI like what you think is that each message is a transaction, so I would recommend adding an appropriate transaction fee depending on the address owner.
