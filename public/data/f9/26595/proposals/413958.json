Defi traders want to invest in real-world assets but cannot or do not want to convert crypto to fiat. The solution to this problem is that Curb Finance will build a synthetic asset marketplace for the Cardano ecosystem. Curb Finance will allow users on Cardano to directly invest in real-world assets using stablecoins. Propose shows a legitimate problem and then provides an idea of \u200b\u200ba valid solution. The proposal that directly addresses the challenge's target problem is \"Defi - Stablecoins, DEXs, borrow & lending, synthetic assets, etc.\"\nThe proponent has measured the challenges and risks that may be encountered during the project implementation and has effective methods to address those challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is fine. Regarding the roadmap, the proposal provides a 6-quarter roadmap that shows the strategic vision of this project. Each quarter explains (quite extensive) what will need to be done, and what activities will be developed so that they can work together on the project as a whole. And the great thing about this proposal is that the proposed team is carrying out some work and some work has been completed such as: Establishing a technical group, and Whitepaper (reference link https://linktr. ee/kerbfinance ), Community Building (in progress) MVP development (ongoing)...\nNext is the budget: Curb Finance is proposing a grant of $179,000 for Q1, Q2, and the first month since Q3. The budget presentation has good and bad points. Some costs were reasonably explained, and some were somewhat confusing. And the result was that when I added the budgets together I came up with less than what the proposed team required. So, in my opinion, this part needs to be revised to make it more reasonable.\nAnd finally, about the project team, the Curb Finance team is anonymous. For 2 reasons: 1. The creators of Curb Finance want to develop Curb Finance to a certain extent and then put it completely in the hands of the DAO. And 2. Everyone on the team is dedicated to the project, but some of us are uncomfortable sharing our identities. Although the group's identity is not disclosed, based on the presentation of the budget, we know that the core group consists of 6 members and this is a group with sufficient capacity and expertise to carry out this project. Behind the project was the technical support of Konma Labz, which further strengthened our belief in the team. In other words about the feasibility of the project, I think it is necessary to add details about the budget, the roadmap and the team looks good.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "During the detailed process of the proposal, the proponent informs us of the KPIs, deliverables, and metrics that can determine the success of this project schedule. As a result, we have a lot of material to base our progress audit on. In other words, we know what the mini-goals are, what counts as a partial success, and so on. And the community can fully follow this project in regards to development, testability, and partners... through public reporting on Twitter https://twitter.com/kerbfinance\nAnd finally, the success of the project is mentioned as \"Success for our project will be an exchange that allows permissionless trading of real-world assets with daily trading volume Perhaps, when Curb Finance reaches this stage, with the help of the DAO, it will aim to be the first exchange to do a crypto IPO\".\nIn other words, the success of the project will be:\n- Large enough to compare with a real-world exchange-\n-Run a crypto IPO and set your path to becoming a real-world exchange\nWe found that the team's perception of success was well-defined with that, and we saw that the proposal seemed to have good potential, so it would be interesting if you tried to recalibrate the budget requirements to increase the project's chances of success", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2299", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 3, "ng": 7, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7957, "q0": "The problem with the proposer of this proposal is that no assets can be traded in the real world using crypto.

This system will have a very big impact on the cardano ecosystem because this proposal will appeal to a very large audience of investors. There are a number of features included of Curb Finance that will give many benefits to people who will use it. (without permission, One Stop Solution, 24/7,...)

The petitioner has ensured that each individual has a specialty. The specialties are listed. As stated, the Curb Finance team is anonymous. The reasons for this are included in the proposal. The team will also receive technical support from the Konma LAbz team. A detailed breakdown of the budget is available. A grant of $179,000 will be requested to fund Q1, Q2 and the first month of quarter 3. The budget is divided into one-time costs and monthly costs. This makes it very clear where the funding will go. The budget appears to be sufficient to achieve the stated objectives. The intention is not to come back for further financing. There will only be a return in case of unforeseen circumstances, which means that the costs are much higher than estimated. A realistic timetable has been included to achieve all the objectives. The objectives are included in this timetable for each quarter. This schedule provides a good implementation plan stating how and what will happen. The technical aspects have also been included in the proposal to ensure the best possible implementation. There is 1 major risk included in the proposal. The risk that traditional organizations will not like synthetic assets, this is reasonable because synthetic assets mimic securities. The submitter has offered a solution for this on 3 different levels.

(development, audits, bug rewards, partnerships, outreach programs) The problem outlines the problem that no assets can be traded in the real world using crypto.

This project is also fully scalable regardless of the borders of countries, depending on the legality of each region.\nTherefore, the idea of \u200b\u200bthis project is completely suitable to the requirements of the challenge as well as to anticipate the crypto trend in the near future.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan of the proposal is developed in 6 Quarters ie more than 1 year.

They focus on two main things.\nOne is to build a solid technical foundation. To do this, they will assemble a team of experts (multinational) in the field of finance as well as blockchain technology. At the same time, cooperate with insurance partners to ensure benefits if technical risks occur, and this risk is also clearly audited.\nSecond, they design user-friendly interfaces, promote communication to the community. Although the plan for this part is not detailed, they mentioned it, making me more confident in the feasibility of the project.\nAnd as an end point, they will work legally with the countries they will serve users in. This is still difficult but I believe with more open government about crypto and blockchain this will be achieved sooner or later.\nTheir budget is detailed and reasonable enough for each job.\nParticipating them to remain anonymous.

Kerb Finance will award the asset holders dividends with $KERB token, which has not been applied in existing DeFi protocols such as Mirror and Synthetix.

This is an on-going project, it means they have already finished the Q0 of the proposal, which shows their ability of carrying out this project to some extent. About the team, they decide to be anomynous, and the proposer explains clearly reasons for that.

My concern is that these team is groups of people from different nations, so how could the team monitor and ensure their suitable working time, commitment to the project.
