There is potential to offer the deliver service for a lower cost then traditional delivery services, because a de-centralized DAO competing with a centralized company would not need to pay a delivery drivers full salary, or vehicle maintenance, fuel costs etc. as these costs are absorbed by the user who was already planning to drive their own vehicle to the destination. With this service, the driver can make a little extra money for the trip they were already planning to make. If imagined on the scale of Amazon, and Amazons network of millions of businesses selling products, and their distribution/delivery system, this idea could be very disruptive and could scale up significantly and quickly. This could add significant on chain transaction volume, and more importantly provide real world use cases that align with Cardano's vision of investing in economic opportunities for people in Africa and around the world. Given the larger vision of this plan, the impact of this MVP only proposal is very significant. It is important to note that the proposal states: \"if the analysis of the collected data provides positive feedback, we would ask in a future proposal for funds that would allow us to transform the MVP into a market-ready product.\" \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The teams early success with Catalyst, and their association with Wada https://www.wada.org/ and Ariob Incubator https://ariob.io/startups/ make this proposal highly feasible. The team consists of 6 experienced professionals, and their LinkedIn profiles are included with a record of their relevant skills and experience, such as \"A backend developer with 6+ year experience, who joined Plutus Pioneer Programme #1 & recently finished Cardano professional course at Emurgo.\" \n\nThe proposal includes a larger plan, that would likely require additional funding to realize the full potential of this ambitious vision. However, the plan for this proposal to deliver an MVP is reasonable for the budget requested. The budget is broken down into tasks and hourly compensation, and #hrs expected to complete each task. The proposers wages are lower than market average for developers with their level of experience. Therefore this is a very good value for the $ invested from the Cardano treasury. The order of tasks and timetable included in the plan are logical and feasible. My only recommendation to the proposing team is that they could include an overview of how a potential dispute resolution may work in the case of theft or damage.

Bouazza et al (2019) states that \u201ctransport cost for most African landlocked countries is three to four times higher than in most developed countries\u201d. \nAs a solution, the proposers intend to develop a dApp specifically to improve point to point delivery in Africa by linking package senders (possibly already set on a given package sending route) to packages to be sent in the same route or direction. Package senders (or possibly even commuters) can accept these packages to obtain extra income. Aggregation of packages in this manner is envisioned by the proposers to reduce costs. \nApplication based package delivery in one form or another (e.g. Uber Eats) is not new. However, the way in which the proposers improve on this existing business model by adopt the Cardano blockchain is sufficiently novel. The Cardano blockchain will used to facilitate transactions (wallet) and each transaction will also involve escrow smart contracts on Cardano. Upon agreement by the transporter to send a given item, a predetermined amount of tokens are deposited by the transporter to the escrow smart contract. This amount along with the delivery payment will be released to the transporter upon successful delivery.\nThe proposers describe five risks (business model/ platform risk, mule risk, Insurance risk, Dispute resolution, overall crypto risk) and their mitigation plans. Based on the description, the assessor sees that mainly the risk involves risk common to delivery services, particularly non-delivery or damaged goods. The deposit within the escrow smart contract partially solves the issue. However, the proposers also envision collaboration with insurance companies in the future to alleviate the risk burden on the transporter.  Another possible issue is the enforceability of smart contracts within the country where shipment takes place. However, this is a larger issue that goes beyond the scope of the proposal. \nThe assessor sees that this project has tremendous potential to both improve logistics and postal/delivery services in Africa and increase adoption of the Cardano blockchain. The delivery dApp itself can increase users while be senders, transporters or even both. However, as users of the dApp grow, so will supporting or partner businesses that vary likely can adopt Cardano such as the insurance companies (i.e. insurance based on the Cardano blockchain). The increase is Cardano based smart contracts due to usage of the dApp may also be a driver towards the establishment of national regulations that legitimize Cardano based smart contracts.  \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have provided a timeline from August to September with a sufficiently detailed list of activities along with the PIC involved. The breakdown of activities along with the assignment of PICs is a positive effort. However, the assessor finds this timeline to be very short. While the proposers state that the testing of the application will be conducted with funding from another proposal within Fund9, a single proposal encompassing development of the MVP and testing of the MVP, with a appropriately sized budget, will be better. By including testing, the progress and success of the product can be assessed and measured properly. In addition, potential problems can be addressed before field implementation (which can then be funded by another proposal). \nNevertheless, the assessor does see merit in the proposal as the team\u2019s credentials are convincing. The funds requested are also modest (perhaps too modest) since the team has already begun the project as a side hobby. If the project were resubmitted with a testing regime (with an added budget for testing) thus improving auditability, the proposal would be more attractive to be funded. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposers have only mentioned milestones of the project to track the progress of the project. The proposers further state that \u201cproper testing of the MVP\u201d is not part of the proposal as it is covered by another proposal in Fund9.  Testing is essential in determining the viability of a product. Therefore, it is important that the development of the dApp MVP and the testing be within the same proposal. Within this proposal, the proposers should have determined proper metrics and devised a method to measure those metrics in regards to the function and usability of the product.  \nFor example : Based on the description given by the proposers, the package database and delivery application will be able to combine packages with coinciding delivery times and routes. A possible metric could be the percentage of trials in which the application could successfully deliveries from a determined series of trials. Another, metric could be the percentage of trials in which the application could keep delivery costs under a certain value.  \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2973", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 2, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "\"The funds requested are also modest (perhaps too modest) since the team has already begun the project as a side hobby.\" Why would be the funds too modest especially SINCE we are already doing it as a side project? Why is the \"timeline very short\" as we have already started working on it? with regard to the testing it is not inlcuded in this proposal but done thorugh a seperate proposal as this testing does not concern testing the functionality of the MVP. The testing of the MVP (in the other proposal) related to the product market fit and thus is of a different nature -not technical, not about building and hence not fitting for the dApp, prodcut challenge but rather for the Grow Africa challenge as we look for African community feedback if that product (MVP) is a viable solution to the problem we identified. This testing is more about information spreading and receiving feedback on features that needed to be added later but not to check the functionilty of the MVP. \nThe testing of the functionality (viability) of the product is done basically for free among the Cardano/Catalyst community and our own devs that can play around with this dApp. And of course the intention, which is included in this proposal, is to delvier a working and hence full-fucntioning (viable) MVP so the testing of the functionality is included. The other proposal refers to the testing of the product-market-fit, which is very specific to the target customer segment and thus has to be done on the ground in Africa reaching out to people who are not well versed in using wallets or blockchain applications. For this we need to find and gather and educate the right people. Therefore, we need to work together with local networks and partners facilitating this information spreading through workshops and feedback interviews, which cost money and fits better for Grow Africa challenge.

To solve that problem, the proposal aims to create a blockchain-based P2P parcel delivery solution as a minimum viable product (MVP) to replace the traditional shipping service in Africa. When the sender needs to send an item from location A to location B, dApps will find a transporter with the same route as sender to deliver the item, so the sender can save money on shipping and the transporter can make money on the side for taking the item along his/her way. Sender and transporter will lock ADA into a smart contract, this smart contract will unlock ADA into the transporter's wallet when the receiver confirms receipt of goods. If the transporter damages or loses the parcel, the locked payment and deposit in the smart contract will be transferred to the sender as a compensation. The project is built on smart contracts under the escrow model, so it can eliminate middlemen to optimize costs, creating a competitive advantage compared to 3rd party centralized traditional transportation services. Senders, shippers, and receivers can work directly with each other in a trustless environment. When properly built, this project will serve as a case study for applying the Cardano blockchain to solve the real-world problem and drive a wide adoption in Africa to Cardano ecosystem.
