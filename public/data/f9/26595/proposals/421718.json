It is not clear from the proposal how this digital library will integrate with the Cardano blockchain, other than the fact that the proposer runs a stake pool. It is mentioned that some team members have experience with Plutus and Atala Prism DIDs, but it isn't declared that they intend to build a digital library that uses DIDs checkout verifications/authorizations, and Plutus smart contracts for issuing or transacting the materials. The language in the proposal is vague. I would recommend the proposer clarify the intent of the project, because if they do intend to use the blockchain for library DIDs and smart contracts for transacting digital content, I think this proposal would meet the challenge setting.

I would recommend the proposer provide more context that specifies the intent of the project, the goals of the project, and the plan, in both budgetary terms and functional terms, laid out to accomplish it.

That, combined with the aforementioned vague descriptions of the project's intent, gives off red flags. The proposer only offers the voters two audits for success of the project, that is, source code on GitHub, and a library with three fields of content. Firstly, the GitHub repository linked is new and has very little activity, second the library is never demonstrated in the proposal to be integrated with Cardano save for a line where it is mentioned \"implementation of the site on the blockchain\", which isn't true because the blockchain doesn't host sites. Perhaps the proposers do have good intentions, but the proposal as written won't convince voters to fund it, given the challenge setting goals.

This could create a valuable resource for many people without access to books, and create a body of work that could benefit others to add to the number of books and technological stack. It is not immediately clear to me how the on-chain aspect of the library is supposed to work, and at this stage of the project there is no information about the number of titles that may be included, whether there is a focus on particular languages or specializations. But as far as the general ideation is concerned, this proposal does a good job of following the Challenge Setting as it would integrate a much trusted, loved and needed resource - the good old library - and make it available at a lower cost, much wider accessibility and potentially increase the appeal to a younger generation by making it part of the Goma Cardano Hub.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I expected to find a lot more information about the technical implementation of the blockchain library in the proposal. The Github repository provided does not contain any Cardano development content and it us unclear in which format and how the books would be stored, archived, retrieved. It would be nice to know whether we can expect ebooks format in some kind of doc/pdf format or more blockchain friendly processing, for example into JSON format, and if this would require typing or scanning of some of the physical books shown in the photographs, copying or webcrawling from online content, or purchase of existing online formats and resources. The proposers demonstrate great commitment to our community and are educators and stake pool operators. I would love to give them the benefit of the doubt, but really need more information about the technical solution to be able to assess that this is a good online library idea that leverages the blockchain - as the solution and business plan claim.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As the requested budget is for a prototype or proof of concept, a full audit of the project implementation would probably not be required. The proposers plan over 3 months to test their ideas of feasibility and populate the Github repository. The stated success measure of having a library covering the three areas of study is in my opinion not enough and I encourage the proposers to provide much more detail about the steps they want to take to implement this, and what kind of technological solution and programming languages we should expect to be used, how Cardano fees are paid for, and how many titles/books, pages, languages and so would be covered.

Providing specific metrics will help people judge how successful it is. I also give you a compliment for identifying the risks, difficulties and ways to reduce them.

There is a current challenge in the ecosystem where there is a lack of educational content on-chain. Specifically, in form of a library. Libraries have lost the amount of average users that visit because of the new digital era. The problem statement is that a world without libraries will lead to lack of education throughout the world and we will potentially lose records or books with educational content. The team plans to create a science library that will provide information to users and it will be a place where people can go to access free educational content that is digital and on-chain. This can have a positive influence on the future of Cardano because it will ensure that important records are kept in this \"library.\" It will be a place where you can find any form of educational content that you are looking for.

This is also important to note because it suggests that the team will be capable of carrying-out this project. The proposal provides a detailed roadmap that will be worked on for the next 6 months. There are specific details for each section and specific dates of completion for certain items on their roadmap. The beginning half of the roadmap includes the brainstorming and creation of the website, and will later include the implementation of the documents and educational content. There is also a budget breakdown that provides specific details and shows exactly where the requested funds would be allocated. This is also important because including these specific dates and details will allow accountability which will help ensure that this proposal is implemented successfully.

These principles have been included in the proposal as suggested above and leads me to believe that it is likely that this proposal will be successful. There should also be a focus on transparency from the team because this will allow for a strong community to gravitate towards the project and hold the team accountable.

I hope, they can expand the area field of study once its established such as economic, engineering, historic and culture, etc. Furthermore, the proposer uses Cardano blockchain to make digital library thus, it is good, beside we help the student to provide easy access to digital library, it also gives contribution to Cardano.
