Apparently, it showed the realistic datas, recorded by WHO, about the insufficiency in working out of adults. An affiliate study was also given to demonstrate better the essential of exercises to COVID-19 patients. Accordingly, the proposer offered a very practical solution, aiming at a noble purpose, which is to develop HEALTHFI, an innovative and effective health care application that applies the blockchain technology. The idea was described thoroughly in detail. In general, the application will be developed throughout 4 phases: move-to-plant, coach-to-earn, healthier-to-earn and Healthcare in metaverse. As the name of each phase can tell, every necessary feature would be built and added into the project gradually. Personally, I would love to see how the features of move-to-plant come into progress. Not only does this act as an incentive to promote walking and running among users, but also it helps nature become more healthy and clean, which is even more beneficial towards the health of every person globally. In my opinion, if able, the team should describe more about some characteristics of this function, such as: how many meters a user would walk/run to achieve 1 tree-planting, where the planting activities would happen, whether the resources are enough to assure the planting activity goes on properly,... Moreover, the rewards mechanism has not been clarified on what currency would be paid. They should answer the question: Would a new crypto/token or existing Cardano crypto/token be applied into the project? Since Move-to-plant and Move-to-earn are 2 important initial marketing activities combining into the feature, having further information about these criterias would be helpful for the investors to evaluate the project. Besides, by applying blockchain technology, the application also promised to provide each user a personal coach through the mechanism coach-to-earn, as well as a nutrition plan through healthier-to-earn and healthcare in metaverse. These are the functions that differentiate them from other traditional health care applications, which I believe will make them advantageous compared to direct competitors. Generally, the information offered in this section was well-prepared and comprehensive with a table to compare with existing rivals as well as a specific KPI of users in the first month. The solution was also well-aligned with the challenge and offered confidently, which convinced me about the dedication and ability of the developing team. However, in the risk statement part, I am still confused on the possible problems similar to traditional apps, as well as the way it is mitigated. I believe this needs to be explained more specifically, such as what exact problem exists in their consideration, as well as what exact incentive and affiliate program they use.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In this section, a detailed plan including steps to be done throughout the period of 2022-2023 was provided. It is obvious that some progress has been made even before the proposal. Milestones and timeline were also clarified enough, yet, I believe the estimated amount of time needed to complete each task should be added in order to have a clearer view about the project. Besides, a budget breakdown was brought about with an attached link, which explains carefully on how the money would be used. Also, the number of staff and roles needed were mentioned. Nevertheless, $139500 is a considerable figure for only 3 months operating, for which I believe it needs a lot of thorough consideration. Finally, the information about each member was offered sufficiently with a brief introduction as well as an affiliate link for further background checks.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "A regular report of progress was promised to be given on the community channel as well as a website. Moreover, the updates are also presented on the app. This proves the clarity of the project, helping the investors, potential users and project developers easily keep track of the progress. The KPI of users are also ambitious, though I would highly recommend adding some metrics to measure success such as the amount of rewards claimed by users, the total amount of distance that users walk/run daily, the total amount of trees planted daily,... Lastly, I believe the SDG ratings given are well-prepared and reasonable. From my personal point of view, this is a very innovative business idea that would achieve some proper success in the future.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_4118", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 9, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1673, "q0": "The proposal is well aligned with the objectives of the challenge and represents an investment in a very promising area, health applications, which already has a large audience. With this, the chance of new active members being attracted to our ecosystem is high, in case the app is developed correctly and becomes popular. A very positive point is that the idea is very complete and explained. We know that the objective is to mitigate the deterioration of health in the moment after the pandemic, working to keep users motivated, performing physical exercises on a regular basis and also maintaining a healthy diet. Dapp would focus on some phases, and would relate the exercises to the reward of tokens and NFTs. I think the uses of blockchain here could have been more clear, we know that active tokens would be provided to community members, but apart from the use of NFTs, how would user data be minted on the blockchain? The proponent claims that users would be introduced into the cryptographic universe smoothly, so that they gradually get used to cryptocurrencies - especially Ada. How would this adaptation process be carried out? How did they come to know about Cardano's technologies? In my view, Dapp is very well explained in relation to its activities: we know what the problems are to be solved (mental and physical health are impacted by social pressure and Covid-19, lack of a healthy lifestyle, lack of motivation to exercise etc). We also know that there will be several phases of development of the complete project, the first being aimed at \u201cthe most common users, so that users can participate in Move-to-win or Move-to-Plant running anywhere, anytime \"; the second would have the sense of expanding \u201ctheir sports activities such as swimming, cycling, etc. Integrating with smartwatches to read and record health data in the blockchain system. Thus, HealthFi will add professional trainers in different activities to guide users with specific personal plans that fit their physical conditions\u201d; in the third \u201cdata available and working with experts to create appropriate exercise and nutritional plans, improve the health and physical condition of all users at all ages\u201d; and finally in the fourth, the objective is \u201cto become a super application that cooperates with health partners to provide nutritional services and products to all users\u201d. That is, we know very well what would be done, how, why and in what order, but it is still a little abstract how Cardano's technologies would be related to all this, we know it would be through token rewards, but this explanation is still it gets pretty superficial. It is also said that \u201cwe believe we can build a transparent database to help users achieve the best results by combining blockchain and gamification in one business model\u201d. How would this be done? How would the data be collected, and what data would that be specifically?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In my view, the feasibility of the proposal is average. The part that is presented most adequately is the script, although it is still not ideal. The time division chosen by the proponent is quarters (in 2022), in which he informs us which activities will be developed. In 2023, the explanations get more abstract. Speaking of Q3 of this year: various activities are reported, e.g. \u201dstart app version 1.0 (Move-to-Plant), summer campaign, online/offline tournament promotion, charity campaign, update new features - Start the app version 1.1 (Move2Earn Mode)\u201d and etc. Some activities could be more detailed. What would summer and charity campaigns look like? How would the rewards be diversified, what are our options? What is \u201caggressive marketing\u201d? What strategies would be adopted for the project to be well publicized, what dissemination channels would be used, how can we ensure that the target audience is aware of this project and uses Dapp (actually the target audience here is the general population, at that I understood, so I think the work should be developed in order to reach the maximum number of users possible in the most diverse possible environments). As I argued, some activities could be better explained so that we have a more solid understanding of the project; it would also be good to understand the work routines of the professionals involved. And regarding the temporal division, it would be more appropriate for the proponent to divide the timeline into months instead of quarters, with that the level of specificity of our understanding would also be increased. Talking about the budget, the asking amount is quite high and we are told that it would be enough to cover just three months of the project, which is quite worrying, as it indicates that the project as a whole would be quite expensive to develop. The value is not detailed in the proposal, but in a google docs spreadsheet, in which we see what the expense would be, the amount of it (for example, in the case of developers, it would be 4), the heat of the salaries and how many months are being ordered. It is possible to understand well how the money would be used, but this degree of understanding could be even better understood if the work routines of the professionals involved were better explained. How much time would they dedicate to the development of the project, what would be the value of their working hours? What would the acronyms \u201cCPO\u201d, \u201cBA, GD\u201d, \u201cCMO\u201d and \u201cPR\u201d be included in the spreadsheet? It would be necessary for these names to be better explained, so that we actually have an understanding of what is being said here. Finally, analyzing the team, we have a good level of detail about each professional, which conveys confidence. The problem here is that none of the professionals involved have experience with Cardano - would they hire a different developer to work with our languages? The only person who has studies in the blockchain area is James Nguyen, but even so, he does not make it clear if he has already developed any work at Cardano and, yes, which. Therefore, I believe that the information given is necessary, but not sufficient.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Finally, as to whether the project is auditable or not, the proponent provides us with some information regarding this part, but unfortunately I also think that it is 100% of what we need to carry out adequate monitoring in relation to the final success, as the first part is satisfactory. Talking about the process, it is said that a roadmap would be updated in the whitepaper, that the updates would also be visible in the Dapp itself, and that the progress would be audited for the community through a website created especially for this. As we are told, we will probably have a fairly regular follow-up (every 2 weeks is a very short interval for updates to be published, and the sooner the better, as the Cardano community will be as up to date as possible). That is, this part is very good, I believe that in these updates every two weeks, information will be given both about what has been done (the professionals' work routines and the activities themselves) and the partial results to be achieved. However, for the final success of the past information, they are basic, they say about the amount of installations (50 thousand) and monthly active users (10 thousand) expected for phase 1 of the project. Success is also defined as \u201cchanging users' habits in health education, creating a community with a healthy lifestyle, acting in favor of the environment and contributing to the reduction of harmful emissions and the greenhouse effect\u201d. However, it is possible to observe that these metrics say a lot about the success of Dapp itself and not about how this would have had consequences for Cardano. How can we be sure that the project was positive for our blockchain and reached the specific goals of the challenge? I believe there are two main metrics to think about here: firstly, the amount of NFTs and active tokens being minted on our blockchain and distributed to users as a reward. And then, and most importantly, in my view, is to understand how these users would be getting involved with the cryptographic universe, but specifically with Cardano. Would they be making use of the acquired NFts, would they have learned the basics of how to create their digital wallets, sell the NFTs, if they wish, delegate Ada? Would they be making use of other Dapps, getting involved in other ways with our blockchain, using our technologies more? I believe that it would be necessary for a study to be carried out, even though the project has a total of 5 phases, it is necessary to understand from now on, from the end of the first phase, what the consequences would be for Cardano. So I believe that the auditability is good, but it could still improve if more information had been passed on about the auditability of success.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 14834, "q0": "This proposal entirely fits the standards as well as the aim of The Challenge by developing ADA Solar, a Cardano blockchain Solar Farm that combines the solar energy of San Juan - the sun's land. Everything is really well planned and thorough, from the solution of the problem to the way to address future difficulties. Creating a solar energy system at a location with the longest hours of sunlight and the finest solar energy output not only cuts expenses but also assures long-term quality. Furthermore, the proposal's outcomes are entirely aligned with Key Metrics such as improving the quality of existing items through feasibility and technical study in fund 7's phase 1 or incorporating a combination of the marketplace, DEFI, gaming, environmental, and other innovations. Furthermore, I entirely agree with the proposer's approach to the hazards they projected. In particular, the plan chose to pay two programmers to cross-compare all platform designs to assure transaction security concerns and even asked a third party to check and ensure safety. A really intelligent and prudent decision.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It tends to be seen that an arrangement for stage 1 has been definite, sound, and coherent by the proposer. Each quarter will have around 9 to 14 tasks to deal with, an extremely great number that shows the earnestness of the staff investing a ton of energy and work into research. Activities are likewise organized in a logical and exceptionally connected way. Furthermore, I like that they continually utilize large advertising, in spite of the fact that it isn't clear what strategy they will utilize, yet, in order to have more to known and take part in the project, advancing is the quickest and most reasonable technique. Specifically, in Q1 and 2, it appears to be that the entire group has proactively gone midway and finished very what is outlined here.\nWith respect to the work crew chosen here, I am totally fulfilled by their experience as well as their dynamism during their past work. Specifically, rather than simply featuring the crew by expressing the accomplishments and experiences of team members, this proposition likewise shows what every individual's central mission is.  highly appreciate this arrangement because thanks to that, the voter will properly assess the capacity of each member as well as whether that person is really suitable for the assigned task or not.\nLike the two sections over, the proposer in all actuality does very well what is expected, in the spending plan segment,  all the necessary parameters also show up. It very well may be seen that this proposition just requests a spending plan for the exercises of the final quarter, demonstrating that the activities of the remaining quarters have been prepared and will be carried out as soon as the proposal in Fund 9 is successful. Furthermore, the proposer likewise attaches a separate file on the spending plan for each activity calculated by quantity and month in an extremely point-by-point and clear way.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The last piece of the proposal, generally, the proposer has provided relatively what is required. The specific numbers of participants mentioned are up to 50,000 installs and 10,000 monthly active users, a great number for Phrase 1. Notwithstanding, there are 2 things that I wish the creator could explain more clear. First of all, the author mentioned updating the roadmap on the website, but as of now, I can't see any links being attached. In the past segment, the proposer worked really hard in arranging each quarter, yet in this part, voters need to keep a close eye on the progress of the fourth quarter alone. So you should plainly frame the activities that should be finished in how many weeks or days for financial backers to have a superior outline of the improvement progress of the proposition. Moreover, as per the arrangement, the proposition has finished almost 50% of the exercises of the first and second quarters, yet there is no particular proof for that here.

People would be motivated to follow a healthier lifestyle, especially after the Covid-19 Pandemic, the society\u2019s health has gone down with recording some sequelae related to this pandemic. This idea focuses mostly on creating a guideline in order to raise the community's health by constructing a Dapp on Cardano\u2019s blockchain. The aggregate functions will remind participants to follow a healthy diet combined with regular exercise. Since the practicality and important value from this proposal, I would expect to see the success of it. The proposer is very intelligent when he realizes that a reward after each completed stage through HealthFi will be an incentive to the users and motivate them to complete the challenge. Thereby significantly increasing the on-chain activities.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal has been planned carefully since it included a specific conducting path, how much funds they need in order to fulfill their budget, and how reliable their teammates are. Firstly, they provided a detailed plan about which technologies and design would be used in conducting the proposal as well as developing the foundation platform to the public. They suggest a 4-stage plan in the proposal which consists of move to plant, coach to earn, healthier to earn, healthcare in metaverse and the corresponding duration for each stage. The application of UX/UI design has surprised me by its fundamental mechanism, and the modernization. Moreover, due to the diversified features of the project, this team has decided to rent the outsource to ensure the quality of the product they want to release/perform via HealthFi to Cardano\u2019s community. Hence, the participating members would be divided into two teams which are the renting programmers\u2019 team and the core team. In which the core-team would be supervisors and guarantee the proposal is progressing and finished on time. Moreover, they are really clever when taking advantage of the Internet for advertising their proposal. Therefore, a marketing strategy has been built for being suitable to most recent social media platforms. I thought this proposal would cost a lot due to this group wanting to use the outsource programmer team and also imagine how large the amount of cost will be. Nevertheless, the budgeted plan has amazed me again with each detailed cost and the amount that is compared to the price of labor work on the current market is approximately equal.

This would be shown via the statistical function of the app store or on that proposal\u2019s main website. By the way, based on those provided information about each member in the core-team, the verified procedure would be quicker as all the data is shown via popular platforms like Linkedin. In the proposal, we can easily identify which members take responsibility for which role and their importance in the project.

Financially, I think the amount requested is reasonable given the scope of the project, and it's very simple to understand how it will be used.

So is it mandatory to buy shoes or not? What is the earning tool? How much does it cost to own a pair of shoes?
