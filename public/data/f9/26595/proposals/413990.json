To exemplify what I\u2019m saying, one can see that deliverables are put in concise terms, and the proposers managed to bring an example of user of their platform. This helps readers to understand how normal people could be impacted by their platform. \nProposers say that they will host \u201cWada and Wada-affiliated products\u201d, but they didn\u2019t specify if non-Wada products would also have a place on their platform. This is important to give clarity for the community about the scope, size and market of the proposed solution. Having a Wada-only platform might be a limiting issue. It\u2019s not that they are saying it is, but they are not saying it isn\u2019t. Finally, they address correctly the challenge and gives future use-cases that can be more related to Cardano ecosystem. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Budget is not well detailed. Proposers do not tell how they arrived to those numbers (eg. Team fees and developer fees), by saying how many people or how many human hours are expected to be paid with such values. In addition, I the proposal doesn\u2019t tell in any moment where it will be developed, or at least which country(ies) they are taking as reference for the budget and salaries. In a relatively high budget as the one they are asking, it is important for the community to see more detailing of how it will be spent.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In terms of auditability, the proposal has clear deliverables and a reasonable roadmap. Moreover, the team has provided some evidence of their previous experience in such projects, and they will recruit more developers to complete the team once they are funded. They have presented product-related metrics and their key-metric will demonstrate the success of the project (\u201cnumber and percentage of its products that have been successfully listed,\u201d). To improve the auditability, proposers could have been presented an estimate of this number of products that they expect, or some evidence that shows their knowledge of the market. However, this doesn't compromise the overall auditability.

It seeks to introduce more high quality use-cases to the Cardano ecosystem through a marketplace poised on product integration and shared user base, while introducing quality products and Dapps in an accessible manner for all actors (users, developers, businesses). \n\nThe solution given has provided ways it could improve the marketplace aspect of the Cardano ecosystem. Notably, the solution heavily centres on providing greater access to all actors, great user-experience, integration of all products with Wada marketplaces, a standardised practice for high quality products and scalability. Hence, I foresee a marketplace useful for the masses as it provides a more interactive, participatory environment for all with lower barriers of entry. Additionally, the proposal even highlights the potential future use cases of its marketplace, further establishing itself as an impactful proposal. \n\nI believe the key metrics provided by this proposal serve as great indicators of the potential of this project. As the Cardano ecosystem is still at its infancy, there is a good chance this marketplace would encourage the development of new products within Cardano, bringing about integration between products and user base while levelling the playing field between users and solution providers. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal has provided us with a detailed explanation of the team member\u2019s individual professional experiences, role and responsibilities within the team and their respective experiences in Blockchain technology, particularly Cardano. This implies a capable team that understands their tasks, end-goal and how to steer the project towards the fulfilment of this challenge for the benefit of Cardano. \n\nDetailed role explanations aside, I think the team conveys much confidence due to their active participation in Cardano Catalyst (in which they have several funded projects from previous funds). This showcases a dedicated and committed team with an excellent track record in Catalyst. Given the potential of this project and presence of an excellent team, this further increases the feasibility of this project. \n\nI think the proposal has done excellently in identifying potential challenges. The challenges and solutions to the challenges cover the nature of this project thoroughly, that is involving tight collaboration with various teams, technical capabilities and requirements. \n\nGIven the technical requirements and scale of this project, I think the proposed budget of $152,000 is completely justifiable for a duration of 12 months. There is also a detailed budget breakdown of how the proposed budget will be distributed amongst various roles and tasks. \n\nTimeline given is reasonable and comprehensive wherein there is no sign of overpromising. We are given a clear timeline with deliverables/milestones on a quarterly basis. However, one issue I have is the typical Blockchain development cycle where delays are seemingly inevitable due to technical issues. Given the high possibilities of this happening, the team does not present a contingency timeline in case of hiccups. Despite the team having several underway funded proposals and proposals in Fund 9, the team conveys confidence in executing their projects (should it be funded) with no hiccups as they ensure they will assign dedicated project managers for only up to 3 funded proposals. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Description of targeted problem is well-defined, along with a solution and proposal that align with it. The given roadmap has sufficient information to audit the progress and success of the proposal in the first 12 months. \n\t\nThe metrics and KPIs serve as great indicators to evaluate the project\u2019s success as it is highly relevant to the proposal (a marketplace) and the Challenge\u2019s goals. To be specific, the chosen metrics and KPIs are founded in terms of 1) quantity and quality of product listed in the marketplace, 2) traits of a successful marketplace. \n\nAs far as transparency and integrity go, the team has conveyed much confidence as they have identified public channels for the community to evaluate its success and progress. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2729", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8556, "q0": "According to the proposers, there is a lack of integration between dApps and products, resulting in projects functioning in silos. To make the problem more explicit, more information and examples would have been beneficial. The proposers solve the issue by establishing a platform marketplace where innovative Cardano dApps and products may host their solutions and get access to new markets. I think the proposal is valuable and aligns well with the challenge's aims. It's also great that the team gave a link to clarify their experience. The proposed solution was described in a well-structured manner, with main deliverable and secondary deliverable which are relatively a landing page directory that hosts Wada and Wada-affiliated products, providing product roadmaps, sign-up information and launch details and an online platform that hosts Wada and Wada-affiliated products in an integrated fashion, paying close attention to seamless user experiences and standardized design principles. To me, the proposal clearly defines how and why it would offer value to the Cardano ecosystem, and hence the KPIs are linked with the outlined challenge. I appreciate the effort they took to explain risk management. However, the only suggestion I have is that the proposers include a risk section that analyzes possible threats to the proposal's success and how to minimize or lessen such risks.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In terms of feasibility, the strategy specified to implement this idea is clear and reasonable for me, providing a vision for the first 30 days, three months, six months, and twelve months, for which I praise them. Members of the core team have assembled a highly varied mix of talents and expertise across a wide variety of fields. Referrals on LinkedIn were presented, so experience may be validated from that standpoint. I note that the proposers intend to bring in more talent for the project. It would be more beneficial for the team to provide detailed info on the requirements for applying for a position in the core team structure, as \u201cwho can act as both project manager and solutions architect for the duration of its implementation\u201d seems quite subjective. However, when it comes to the budget, there is a fairly specific description of the elements that comprise it, and the cost is also attached with each item, which seems reasonable to me. As a result, it is easy to make an accurate assessment of the fairness of the fund requested. My only concern is that the team requested $128,000, but the overall budget is $152,000; where would the remaining funds come from? Overall, I believe this plan has a high probability of success.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The welll-defined measurements make it even more compelling, as do the well-described 30-day, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month milestones. Key metrics and KPIs are relevant, described in detail and most importantly present. These metrics, in my opinion, are critical markers for tracking the impact. It is also commendable that the team provided quantitative measures and a defined definition of what success looks like.

The information of the products is fully demonstrated. I understand that the team currently has 15+ dApps and products and they would like to form an integration among them from both a technical and user-experience perspective. The team builds a landing page directory and an online platform which host Wada and Vada-affiliated products. In this writing, I find it clear about the idea, the components to carry out the project, and the potential objects that they orient. The example of Sarah Lakely is a bright point of the proposal. The example is that Sarah can apply for a loan to cover her rent and school fees with two ways. The first one is through a haphazard search of available products of various discords, search engines, social media, \u2026And the second way for her is to visit Wada product dashboard to see where each product is in its development cycle which have integrations. This has shown the outstanding strength of Wada. Another point of this proposal that I highly appreciate is the results of the projects. This is explained clearly with Future Use Cases.  On answering how the proposed solution will address the Challenge, the proposer has given two apparent points: the idea helps create and improve different Dapps, products, and integrations and raise the integrations with other existing services, products and protocols that improve the end-user experience. These are closely aligned with the KPIs or key metrics of the challenge. The proposal has illustrated three kinds of risks which are coordination and agreement, but it is better for the team to give full solutions to all the problems. The first one is that pre-existing coordination and agreement between hubs and product teams can reduce full independence and deny the integration requests. The second one is the V1 product will likely require a custom build due to the nature of accessing products directly. And the last one is proof of concept. With three risks, the team has had a suitable solution for the second one, but they could have had solutions for the first and the last one.

The plan is arranged in months or quarters. In each period of time, the results of the projects are listed which is easy to understand. The use of the budget is separated into categories like team fees, marketing and brandings, design fees, platform fees. The total fee is $152,000, but the proposed budget is only $128,000 then the gap will be covered by treasury funds and other funding sources. About team members, they are the ones who joined Catalyst in the previous fund, worked as a Haskell and Plutus trainer, consultant, graphic designer, \u2026 They will be the talents for the success of the project.

Also, alot of quantitative measures are listed such as No. of products listed on the platform, % products agreed to standardized technical specifications.
