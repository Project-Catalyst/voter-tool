It is about creating a platform to bring projects together with future investors, this would be useful since, according to the proponent himself, it is difficult for startups to find people to raise capital for their blockchain projects, in a \u201cstructured, organized and reliable\u201d. Therefore, the solution would be to create a platform with different types of investors (Founders, Venture Capitalists, Angel Investors, Accelerators, Launchpads and Open Innovation), so that this type of action could be done in a more orderly manner. In my view, it is a project that theoretically would bring great benefits to Cardano, since it would add new projects to our ecosystem (since they would be able to receive investment). This would, in a domino effect, meet several other specific objectives of the challenge: more developers would have a favorable context to work and develop the various technologies relevant to Cardano; more active members would be added, since some projects are aimed at specific and new audiences that are not necessarily part of the cryptographic world bubble (for example, I have already evaluated a proposal aimed at the music market and another for the audiovisual in this same challenge, so that these audiences would be encouraged to participate in the ecosystem); with the greater establishment of the projects, the number of Ada in circulation (and being delegated), of CNFTs being minted in the Cardano network, and so on, would certainly increase. That is, the gains would be multiples. However, as I said at the beginning of the analysis, I think there was a lack of explanations to understand how the platform would work in practice. Most important of all in my view would be to attract investors. How could we open the eyes of those who have the financial capital to bet on Cardano's technologies? How would the most appropriate projects and investors be aligned for the type of approach being studied and put into practice? For example, for the proposal involving the music industry, perhaps potential investors are large artists who are interested in blockchain and believe in the technology, and have a way to drive the adoption of the platforms being created. But how would we make these artists aware of the project? The proponent claims to have a website (Cardano Feed) that has about 1 million monthly hits, so most likely some advertising would be done in this medium, but whether or not the public accessing the site must already be relevant to the blockchain ecosystem, so it would be important for us to understand how this project would reach the ears of those who are not necessarily familiar with either Cardano or another blockchain. Another point that I would have liked to have been more detailed would be the question of how investment would be encouraged in itself, for example, it is said that an event would be held \u201cin which selected startups can present their pitch to the network of investors in order to create business connections\u201d. What would the characteristics of this event be like, would it be something totally online, in person? Due to this lack of information, it is not so clear how the proposal would happen in practice, compromising our confidence in the impact.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "When it comes to the script, the proposal is ok, the ideal would be that each month was divided into some activities to be carried out (months 2 and 3 are presented together). It would also be interesting for each activity to be a little more detailed, especially the more complex ones, such as creating screens and interfaces, defining the UX/U design, validating requirements and functionalities (what would these requirements and functionalities be?)\u2026 Some parts are not so clear, for example: searching for contacts in Crunchbase - what would Crunchbase be? Feedback validation and platform improvements: how would feedback be collected, who would be the audience that would use the interface during testing and how would their opinions be considered? Regarding the official launch of the platform, how would the project be formally presented in the business world, for small and large investors and also for the Cardano community? It is said that communication would be established with media, content portals, sites specializing in cryptography, it would be interesting if we already had a definition of who these partners would be and how contact with them would be established. Regarding the budget, the requested amount is quite compatible with the complexity and proportion of this project (round up, it is 30 thousand dollars), but unfortunately this amount is not explained in the most adequate way. I say this because some expenses here needed a better justification. Who would the journalist be, what would he do about the project? Why would it take $800 for social media, would there be any paid advertising that would require such a cost? How would the work routine of the developer and designer be, what would be the hourly rate of work charged? The proponent states that \u201cmore complete details can be provided if and when we are selected by Catalyst\u201d, however ideally these details would have already been provided by the time the proposal is launched on ideascale, so that we have the best possible understanding of the proposal. how the money would be spent. So finally, analyzing the team, it is very positive how they gather a lot of information about themselves, we know a little about their CVs, previous experiences, who here has some kind of experience with Cardano and how this experience is established and etc - in relation to the last part of the feasibility, there aren't many suggestions to be made, in my view the team's presentation is very good. That said, I think we have strengths in this topic, but some improvements still need to be made.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This part of the proposal is not so adequate because the information provided 1) is very lean/small; 2) in the case of progress, they do not seek to cover what has been done behind the partial results, and in the case of success, the ideal scenario is still quite restricted to the success or otherwise of the project itself. Talking about the progress, it is said that the advances would be noticed through the \u201cNumber of registered investors + Diversity of investor types + View investor profiles\u201d. How could we be sure that the activities delegated for each month were being carried out properly, by the selected people and on time? It would be necessary for the proponent to make it clear that he would constantly check the processes, so that he would provide relevant information to the Cardano community at the end of each month, for example. As they attached a script with several activities being scored, it was enough for, for example, the proponent (or the project leader, if it is not him) to hold a meeting with the entire team, in order to understand what progress would be observed that month, whether the tasks that would have been delegated were actually being carried out and whether there were problems (and how they were overcome). Regarding the final result, in addition to understanding which contracts were signed as a result of this project, it would be positive to carry out a more extensive monitoring of the activities being carried out here. Would the financed projects be successful in their nature, would they be developing as planned, would the medium and long-term results be being realized as expected? How could we be sure of this and how the startups funded here would be contributing to Cardano's constant growth and establishment within the cryptographic universe? A more detailed analysis, both quantitative and qualitative, should be carried out, so that it was possible to truly understand what consequences were left in Cardano from the development of this project. That said, I think the topic needs to be rethought, it is necessary that more details are included in the two parts of the auditability so that it becomes ideal, so that we actually have the means to monitor the project and it would also be necessary for everything to be informed of precise way for the Cardano community (it is not clear, in this topic, how this communicative bridge would be established).", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2800, "q0": "hello Ot\u00e1vio Lima the founder of this idea. Your idea is good but in my opinion it still has some shortcomings and here are some suggestions to make your team's proposal even better.\nThe main goal of this proposal is to act as an intermediary for both business owners and investors interested in cryptocurrencies, DeFi, Cardano, Token, CNFT, so the purpose of your group is clear but about the plan for the solutions announced by your group, is incomplete, for example: your group is planning to organize events to create a playground for selected businesses, for them to present about the benefits benefits that their company brings to investors, or in other words convince investors to put money into their company, and here are my suggestions:\n- First, you need to plan for the criteria for selecting companies to present at the meeting, so that your group's criteria can protect investors with the money they invest in the company. that avoids the risk for investors.\n- secondly you should have a plan for how many 30-minute meetings your team has covered under the funding of this proposal, and a fixed schedule for those meetings. several times a week or a month, in addition, your team also needs to outline a plan for how to reach the target audience ie those investors. if so, then your team's plan and solution will be more certain.\nIn addition, the team mentioned in the roadmap will set up a website for connection purposes, but there is no explanation for the features of that website in the solution section, so it is difficult to determine. This proposed determination will effectively address the challenge required.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposed team commits to a period of 7 months to complete this proposal. and there is a lot of content published with important milestones identified, however it is difficult for the review community to identify the work contents, which the proposed team has published. Is the roadmap statement necessary and is it appropriate, for example: Research UX/UI for a \"user interface/user experience\" website. because it has never been mentioned in the solution that there will be a website or what are the features of the website.\nAs with budgetary expenditures for development activities, I would disagree with journalist spending: $1,200 x 4 months = $4,800, as it was never included in the tournament's plan. France. and since the team stated 2 media expenditures: Social Media = $800 x 5 months = $4,000, and Marketing Assistant = $600 x 6 months = $3,600, so there are two spend on marketing so the team needs to review and maybe explain more for this section.\nhowever, in the team information section based on the proposal I have identified 4 core members, and all relevant information is provided by the team such as relevant experience, or identity.\nHowever, this is not enough to determine whether this proposal will be successful in the future, so the proposal team needs to have additional and additional calculations for the budget and plan.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "different from impact and feasibility, in this transparent part, the proposed team has provided a lot of information and indicators, so that the community can track the amount of work completed, and in addition, the team is also committed to In the end, more than 5,000 investor profiles will be viewed. along with that the team also explicitly declares for the monthly reporting on Cardano Feed, and will make sure to provide statistics of the stats to provide to Catalyst.\nremove barriers of investors and projects to bring them closer together, investments and capital raising will be made and successful, absorb and improve platform improvements.\nso all monitoring and auditing indicators provided by the proposed team can be easily tracked and verified.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2352", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3455, "q0": "The idea of having a platform for connecting invertors, projects, startups and entrepeneurs is nice and does align with challenge as it is a product that can help increase Cardano adoption and integrate different parties of the ecossystem. However, the strucutre of this platform is not very clear in the proposal.\n\nIt would be interesting to see how the platform would work and what features and services it would have, that would help its users and make it compelling. Moreover, it would be good to uncerstand the business model that would keep it finacially sustainable (charge fees for users, freemium model, ads, etc).\nIt's also mentioned an event, the CryptoDemoDay. This event seems really interesting but not much information is provided about it. Maybe it could be mention whether it would be online, in person or both, how often it would heappen, etc.\nLast, another good addition to the proposal would be the strategy to engage with all the parties (investors, start ups and ecosystem as whole). It's a diverse target audience located in several places of the world so having the right plan for it is key to make the platform rich , dynamic and useful for all.\n\nIn conclusion, it is a good a idea but proposal could have more key elements to help understand its full impact and value proposition for users.

My only question would be to make more clear the role of the journalist on the project since it is not mentioned in any place before. Would it be in the platform marketing?
