Additionally, there are projects that intentionally make their NFT. Investors have a very difficult time deciding whether or not to buy or sell a security when pump or dump is in play. This is a market that is better suited for speculation than it is for investment, and the fact that liquidity is low is the most important factor to consider here. It is full, from the total trading volume to the graph, and it is arranged in many different aspects, pretty good. When I access https://cnftjungle.io, I see an interface that is pretty eye-catching and has many features that current CNFT exchanges do not have. Developing a valuation tool and incorporating it into https://cnftjungle.io is not only possible but also meaningful. This will not only help investors understand the market better, but it will also cut down on the amount of guesswork they do.\n\nThe majority of the dangers and challenges associated with assigning a value to a particular project or NFT have been described by the group, but they have not really demonstrated how to overcome these challenges. It becomes more difficult to find a solution to the problem, in part also due to the fact that this is a new market that is being supported by a number of \"market makers,\" also known as \"whales.\" Therefore, in order to effectively resolve the issue, a significant investment of both time and resources is necessary. Best of luck. I rate the significance of this event as a 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team mentioned four stages of development: research, coding, testing, and public API; however, there is no specific time for each category or stage, and I really don't know when the team started working on this project approximately.

That is a moderately insignificant contribution on my part to the overall cost incurred by the group.\n\nConcerning the capabilities of the project: despite the fact that the team was successful in launching the CNFT Jungle Platform (which can be found at https://cnftjungle.io) and the CNFT Predator | NFT Sniping browser extension (which can be found at https://bit.ly/3x9E0K3), I don't see any actual talk about the team itself.

So it fits perfectly with the main objective of this challenge. This proposal will minimize information leakage, informing buyers and sellers of the true value of NFTs they are looking for on-demand through CNFT Jungle Platform - an active website where they aggregate Consolidate Cardano's NFTs in one place. CNFT Jungle will provide APIs to ensure scalability and easy integration of the NFT valuation engine. This project will leverage CNFT Jungle's rare database, NFT transaction histories combined with advanced analytics to estimate market prices. I consider the proponent to have knowledge of the project, they have identified some risks that may be encountered when implementing, But if there are more solutions to limit these risks, it would be better. In addition, I recommend the proponent to focus more on the impact of this tool on NFT projects on the Cardano platform, making it more prominent in the proposal.

However, I need to define more specifically what \"choosing the right model\" is? what is the detailed content of this work to be done, and how many people does it need to be implemented? and how many hours it takes to complete it. The above contents are similar for the remaining jobs. With the content as presented by the proponent, I do not have enough basis to assess whether the requested budget is reasonable or not, or whether this amount is sufficient to implement the proposal. I advise the proponent to clarify the above contents.\n- About the implementation team, the proponent said that they have experience and expertise in NFT, and have built and provided NFT tools such as the CNFT Jungle platform, and CNFT Predator extension - the site and extension is up and running and has thousands of people using it, which is a plus.

Other projects also do not provide information about project members.

The floor for a cat bud is 4,200 ADA while the floor for a shark bud is 17,000 ADA. That is a difference of 12,800 ADA! Most people in the Cardano community are familiar with SpaceBudz and have more or less good idea of which ones are valuable and rare. A collection which is a bit more complex is https://www.oldmoney.io/. They have a variety of items that make each NFT unique in their own way and it is much harder for a novice user to gauge the value of that NFT. The proposer aims to create a CNFT valuation tool. This can allow holders of CNFTs to have an approximate value of their CNFT portfolio. I can definitely see most of the CNFT holders utilizing a tool like this. The tool that I regularly used, which is sadly  no longer in use, was  https://cnftwhales.com/calculator.  They did something similar, but only evaluated one\u2019s portfolio using floor prices.
