The solution was to create an Open Source API for NFT minting that anyone can use in their dApp. It will be a fully documented, primitive piece of software that will be certified in the dApp store. APIs, or \u201cApplication Programming Interfaces\u201d, will allow easy communication between software. It allows forwarding a series of instructions in a way that ensures mutual execution. So the APIs allow for consistent coding and predictable delivery of functions that can be replicated on every request. An API for minting NFTs allows developers the ability to add minting to dApps and platforms with ease and minimal coding. This proposal is well thought out, very mature in its presentation, and argues for its appropriateness in this challenging context.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This proposal provides a roadmap of four stages, in each stage, there are basic tasks to be performed. But it would be better if these stages would include a smaller list of tasks and each task would also have to be set for a specific time, and who would do them. Regarding the budget of $68900 requested and we know what it is used for, it would be great if the proposal could explain more specifically about those funds eg: Audit inspection and certification = $17,225, you can separate these 2 costs and preferably the small ones listed. That will help us understand if the requested amount is reasonable or not? And finally, about the team, this proposal only provides information about the project lead Sebastian Pereira, we have a lot of information about him in terms of his experience, LinkedIn links, and contacts. with Cardano. It would be great if it is proposed to provide more core members to participate in this project so that we have more information about them and have a solid basis to evaluate the team's ability to implement the proposal. Unfortunately, the information provided by the proposal is not enough for me to evaluate the feasibility of the project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As with budget and roadmap explanations, auditability is current but could be more detailed. Progress is forecast for more than 7 months, where it is briefly explained what is expected for that period. However, I would like to understand on a smaller scale what progress will be achieved. In the first month, we expect this and it will be achieved. In the second month, we want to see more of this progress. That way, we will have a more solid view of what they are expecting. Regarding the final product, i.e. what is expected to be the success of this project, I believe complete and satisfactory information has been established.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2299", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 2, "ng": 8, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3130, "q0": "Without a doubt an open source API to integrate and mint NFT would be amazing and would influence new developers to build on Cardano NFT space. I would have rate this proposal higher if it was created under the Developer Ecosystem Challenge, as this proposal seems to be geared towards developers. With that in mind, the proposal clearly will increase the adoption rate of Cardano, and many new developers will benefit from tools like this. Again, I would have give maximum score if it was created under Developer Ecosystem Challenge but since this would increase the adoption rate, I give it a solid 4 out of 5. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal listed a detailed and well organized timeline and deliverables thru a period of approximately 7 months. The budget breakdown are well detailed as well. With that the timeline seems reasonable and achievable. The proposal did state the head of project, and I find him well suited for the job. However with there seems to be a lack of information regarding the other team member in this proposal. Would appreciate if there are more information given regarding that. All in all, it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As mentioned the proposal clearly listed a detailed and well organized timeline and deliverables. Due to the nature of the proposal KPI and metric indicators to track the progress will be limited during the development phrase of the project. However, would appreciate if the author could add more details on KPI or indicators to measure the success of the project (i.e x number of pull request).

The proposer wants to resolve this by creating a Open Source API for NFT minting that anyone can use in their dApp and they are building a library of primitives that are composable. By creating this it would help a lot of dApps which are built around NFT and this is beneficial to cardano ecosystem. Hence the proposal resolves the issue successfully  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer and their team has already successful built fund 8 funded project which is great and based on the proposal it can be said that the proposal and their team has required experience and skills to successfully implement the proposal. The proposer has requested a budget of $68900 USD but haven't provided a clear budget breakdown. The proposal consist of rough budget distribution due to which is hard to assess whether the fund demanded is justified or no. They have also considered possible risks that being Vasil Hardfork Changes. It is likely this proposal will be implemented successfully ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer has provided a clear plan with work being divided into 4 stages which is very helpful for auditing.

That would reduce the need for developers to mint NFTs manually or use marketplaces to do so. In other words, it is a solution built on top of Cardano that increases the number of products available, raises the number of integrations for a seamless experience for the dApp developers and improves the overall quality of the Cardano ecosystem by enhancing the tooling available. Additionally, the proposer has mentioned that the EZ-mint software is a primitive just as the EZ-Pay they have built previously. Their plan is to create these software building blocks to improve developers' experience and avoid redundant work and they intend to keep on doing that for other needs they have identified. Finally, their metrics align with the challenge settings as they are focusing in number of integrations and usage of the API.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal will be conducted by the company AppliedBlockchain and Sebastian Pereira will be the head of the project. There is a link to his LinkedIn page where there is evidence of his past experiences as well as a link to the company's website where we can learn about their expertise and past projects. However, from the detailed plan and budget it is not clear how many and what type of team members will be necessary to implement the project. The budget, in turn, is based on three topics: architecture of the API, API developments and testing and certification. These are macro topics and the team does not explain further how they have reached the amounts estimated for each of them. Using the time horizons found on the plan, we can roughly estimate a cost of USD 13.8k/month for the first topic, USD 12.6k/month for the second one and USD 5.7k/month for the third. It is not clear why there is such a big difference of costs per month for each topic. Nevertheless, the timetable of the project is provided within the detailed plan and it is realistic. Finally, the proposer has pointed the Vasil hard fork changes as the main risk of the project, which indeed could hinder its progress. On the other hand, they claim to be up-to-date with the news regarding the fork and will be able to adapt the API if that is necessary.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap provided is divided into four stages and the milestones for each of them are clearly stated. The time horizons for each of the phases is also given and they are reasonable given the workload. The KPIs defined in the proposal are basically how many people interact with the repository and how many projects integrate the API for their own use. They are great metrics because they help identify if the project is delivering what it proposed to do in the first place. In other words, they help us measure if the plan has been successful. Also, the team has provided a clear explanation of the problem tackled; the lack of such an API in the Cardano ecosystem. Lastly, the team claims they will report on sprint deliverables and timelines but they could have indicated where those updates will be posted.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2513", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5507, "q0": "Everyone wants to get their hands on NFTs because they have just gained worldwide attention. However, because of the complicated understandings around them, the majority of projects that lack the technical skills refrain from ever keeping or minting them, which reduces their overall value. Additionally, some projects wind up spending a lot of money trying to find experts to complete this task. The proposer here makes an attempt to partially alleviate this issue by giving the DApps an open-source API to mint NFTs. Additionally, as the proposer notes, they will attempt to make this feature open-source in order to help other applications, attract visitors to the chain, and ultimately boost the number of transactions using ADA. This suggestion has a huge impact on the ecosystem and other chains, especially given the comparable overall picture that the team and community share. The team is aware of the Vasil hard fork and potential architectural modifications that could interfere with their plans, but they guarantee to stay up to current on all new information and account for such situations.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal's primary focus is application development, therefore the proposer does not overburden us with technical details while yet providing the readers with a sufficient action plan. Additionally, we can see that the majority of the requested funds are ostensibly being used to pay for the development, so the consumption aspect is pretty evident. The amount of cash sought is also quite justifiable and does not significantly deplete the challenge's overall reserve. The team appears to have broken down their project into manageable steps and is soliciting money for the complete thing at once, which is admirable for not calculating the overall expenditures. There isn't a lot of information provided regarding the squad in question. NFT-DAO submitted the proposal, although it only includes an introduction of one member. As a result, in my opinion as a reader, the team has covered every aspect, although I would have wanted to see a bit more depth about the team's experience. As a result, I receive a 4 out of 5 on the metrics for viability.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In the proposal, no precise quantitative metrics are offered individually. However, to back up their claim, they have included all the development tracking approaches that can be used to monitor their advancement. The team pledges to support the audit process by regularly updating their sprint plans on Github and reporting on their progress there. The success criteria are an expansion of the objectives they have set. Once apps begin integrating the API and the API is eventually certified, the results can be assessed at the conclusion of their development cycle. The team will also publish API documentation using Swagger and integrate the API first in their own NFT platform, akkadia.io. Since the team is submitting a brand-new proposal this time, they have done an amazing job of anticipating the capabilities of their API and are fairly confident in those capabilities, thus they have identified the metrics in accordance with those capabilities. Therefore, I don't discover many red flags in the auditability section.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2704", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6083, "q0": "The \"Open-Source NFT Minting API\" would allow medium-sized and small dApp builders to access NFT minting capabilities. Who is this for? The way I see it is occupying a niche between highly sophisticated and large-scale users who can simply use smart contracts or the command line interface and mint unique-UTxO native tokens, aka cNFTs, directly, and \"blue pill\" kind of users who don't mind using an off-the-shelf, 3rd party minting service. For everyone else, this is a potentially highly useful addition to the toolkit. By choosing to propose in the Dapps, Products & Integrations Challenge, the proposers have in my opinion made a very good choice, as this would not only provide tooling for developer-dApp builders (Dev Ecosystem challenge) or DAOs (Cardano <3 DAOs challenge), but provide an easy to use product for a lot of DIY dApp builders and a project that will contribute to make creating dApps on Cardano much easier.

The budget, also not cheap, is provided in good detail, and this project would not require future funding and be ready to use for dApp developers in a year or a bit under. It would have been great to see a list of other proposals made by the team this fund, and those they are working on, to get a feeling how much focus and attention will go towards this project, but the quality and the experience of the team make successful shipping of the finished product highly likely.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This project will be build as open source and auditing the success and progress of the proposal will be easy as the team behind it have provided the relevant Github and Twitter links, their websites and even email addresses. Success of this project is defined as providing the API and passing certification of the dApp store. These definitions could have been described with a little more detail, such as the exact certification aimed for, and the standard of the launched product, for example how popular it is (forks, downloads, stars, mentions, retweets - anything measurable and indicative of quality). It is mentioned that the team will track how many projects integrate the API, but I assume that this is a long-term metric beyond the timeline of the implementation or trial. \nA good project with good auditability.

I think there was room in this section to frame some of the impact as a merging of the Dapp and NFT worlds, as I feel like they are often operating in different categories. Still, this section does a great job at enabling any Cardano Dapp to buildout their own NFT minting capabilities right into their own Daap, without having to take any focus away from anything else they might be building. As much as I really liked the argument that this proposal adds elements of decentralization and competition for NFT minting services, I would\u2019ve liked to see a little more competitive differentiation between these other existing services and what is being built here (as an appeal to advancing innovation). These are extraordinarily minor criticisms because the impact potential here is widespread across the ecosystem by offering open source code to all Cardano Dapps that will save time unnecessarily spent on building their own NFT minting mechanisms.

I think some additional substance could have been added to the roadmap in quantifying hours of labor needed to accomplish each stage of this proposal. The timeframes provided in month are nice for understanding how long it would take to see results/completion but it doesn\u2019t help voters understand efficiency. This addition would have helped voters better evaluate the efficiency of the budget based on hourly rates. Since this information isn\u2019t provided (or at least estimated), the voter is not offered the option to determine if the approved funding is spent efficiently. If this can be clearly established, voters are much more likely to respond positively. This is a minor concern since the average salary for an API developer is around $140k and this proposal adds up to something like $118k (if it is just the one person on it). Unless this project wouldn\u2019t warrant full-time hours/comittment, it appears to be pretty fair compensation and an overall positive feasibility section.

If this proposal were to include target metrics for how many projects  use this API, it would show voters that the proposer is anticipating/pursuing an objectively definable target for post-proposal impact.
