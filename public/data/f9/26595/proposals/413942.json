This way of fundraising has become quite popular in recent years, having been responsible for launching several successful projects, such as the game Knights of Hollow, which became a huge success. But it is also a fact that clearer and more trackable ways can be established to observe the progress of projects on these platforms. And so we see here that the project is very insightful in proposing the use of Cardano technologies, such as smart contracts, to promote a more equitable way to realize capital distribution. We see that the success of the project will bring more visibility for good ideas that need Crowdfunding, as well as more visibility with Cardano. The amount requested is consistent with the current state of the project and the planned steps to be taken. It is proposed to try to create a Crowdfunding platform with built KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) through mediation/conflict resolution and reputation credit rating algorithms to enhance the credibility of all users. Participation. I find the ideas very interesting and can add value to the Cardano ecosystem. The proposal also has a solid plan+ for how they will deliver on those ambitions through clear milestones and a roadmap. The team also offers potential risks from the marketing to the legal aspects. However, with thorough planning, the team I'm sure they can sort those challenges out. You wrote this part in detail, and it helped me to understand your proposed solution a lot. In addition, you also give me a closer look at your background when implementing real-life examples of how your DAPP will work, corresponding to each stage of development. Your target users are also clearly mentioned, and they seem to be very diverse, which will likely increase your chances of attracting Cardano farmers. Your key metrics seem to match the requirements of the test. Challenging, but I think you can put a lot of words into this to successfully convince yourself how your project can handle the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The organization of the possible phases of the project is very well done, and we have found that the signs of several implementations are consistent with the innovation the project aims to deliver. For example, using an algorithm to check a contractor's reputation is a great idea and certainly one of the concepts that increase the viability of a project. Another very positive point is the gradual release of funds through a mediator, who will also be rewarded in the future. This has mitigated the problem existing in other existing platforms, which can often raise the necessary funds, but with no guarantees of continuity. We found that the proposal was able to make good use of blockchain advantages to creating a fairer process through decentralization. One of the biggest differences will be the complete harmonization between the requested budget ($10,000) and what is desired to be accomplished at that time, in addition to clearly defining the actions to be taken. do at different times this and the following year. We see that this money is being distributed well to implement the project in schools in the pilot phase. And in the budget breakdown, we can see that a significant amount of capital ($4,000) will be revealed, which makes a lot of sense at the early stages of implementation and validation. With this strategy, we realize that before the platform is effectively rolled out to a broader range, some risks will be mitigated and adjustments made. Regarding the project team, we found that the professionals involved were experienced in development (a fundamental attribute for this project) but also in marketing and project management. We also noticed that Gabriele's GitHub address was made available. The proposal has a clear roadmap and milestones, including phase one, phase two, and phase three. The team provides budget information and sound analysis of how they will use the proposed budget. However, I find the budget to be very small, especially in terms of development costing only 1k/year per backend and frontend, are those enough remuneration? Are there any server costs? I have a concern there will be an unexpected cost in addition to writing one of the proposals.\nTeams provide brief information about each team member's background. However, it would be better if they also provide a personal LinkedIn profile or GitHub account so that the community can easily verify the capabilities that a team member has.\n\nFirst and foremost, the work plan you provide in this proposal is very clear. The three stages of your project's progress are clearly laid out with adequate timeframes for reaching the milestones. Specifically, you attach every goal to a certain month, which is the period in which it will be achieved.\n\nSecond, your budget breakdown is kind of transparent and sticks to the plan for the first and second phases. However, there is one point on this list I can figure out, the marketing fee. The cost allocation list includes two marketing fees, shown in the third and last sentences. I wonder how it can be two charges for the same strategy? Please elaborate more on this so all voters can understand how your requested funds will be consumed throughout.\nMy final concern in this section is the details of your team members. According to your workgroup's written recommendation, I'm not sure it's detailed enough to convince the community that your team is qualified to develop the project. As some of your employees have had a few years of experience working in their primary occupation (namely 2+ and 3+), it would be better if you could describe more about their outstanding qualifications, background, and background. Related background and notable achievements for the purpose of proving they're eligible to help this project grow more. The same goes for the other members. In particular, it would be the best bet if you could show the community their LinkedIn profile to demonstrate everything you've covered in this section.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding the established ways to audit project progress, one of the positives is the division of tasks into phases 1 and 2. This facilitates understanding of the achievement of each. Stage.\nWe even found that the numerical parameters that were set help in monitoring this, in this case, the number of students registered in stages 1 and 2. Also, one of the ways to understand the success The goal of the project is to seek feedback on the Usability of the platform, and in this context, we observe that videos are being produced to teach how to use the platform. It will also be interesting to periodically publish results on how intuitive the platform is for students.\n\nThe team understands very well what the ultimate goal of the platform should be, based on the ideas exposed about the perceived success of the platform. We found this to be a very realistic proposition and that it seemed to have a good chance of succeeding, partly because of its organization.\n\nThe metrics/KPIs for measuring success are concise and well defined as the number of students enrolled in Phase 1 and Phase 2. However, some items could be more elaborate; for example, how much learning material in video format will be produced? Or is there a measurable way to determine a participant's knowledge after using the platform? How many project discussions on society does it take to be considered successful (and what constitutes discussion)? Et cetera.\n\nI really love the specific numbers you presented in this section based on success criteria. Sadly, on the technical topic, your team has already determined what measurement tools you will use to publish training videos/documents or subscription statistics for each phase of the project. Besides, undeniably, you managed to come up with some success metrics close to your project's original goals. But I think it could be more detailed. For example, instead of referring to increased participation in social discussion projects, People who participate in social discussion projects will be considered a success factor for your team.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2583", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 0, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3587, "q0": "Are startups in Africa going to ICO on the exchange and start raising capital from the block community in the world?.

The work has already been underway with some visible results. When it comes to the timeline budget,  one thing that stood out to me is the number of engineers.

I also expect to see more technical documents on how they think about building the launchpad and crowdfunding (in terms of mechanism and infrastructure). Milestone for the 1st year, whitepaper.

If a project is not successfully funded, whether the reason is low liquidity in the marketplace or the project itself is falling short of quality.

I am told, that Ennarea Finance is asking for $350,000 for the first year of project development and management, and the team is asking for $55,000 in this funding round, the rest will be claimed in another funding challenge.

Some of these sources could be GitHub, social media, native website progress reports, or anywhere that voters can visit to follow up on the progress of this project. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3063", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11428, "q0": "The proposer would like to platform called Ennarea which is the combination of a cryptocurrency exchange for their local currency, and crowdfunding which enable startups in blockchain to raise fund for their project within the African market.

Startsup can take advantage of their exchange users to raise funs and the funded projects will also be able to list their tokens in their exchange. Therefore, this product will include 3 components: Ennarea for beginner traders, Ennarea Pro for professional traders, and Ennarea Launchpad for crowdfunding.

From the website (https://www.ennarea.com/), the team claims that it is on pilot release since September 2021, though the website is quite plain and there's not much interaction to be tested. But, the featured services and its milestones are interesting once released. Also, for the Pro version, I think that the whole trading interface is lacking usability and theme. I hope that the team could consider improving its branding and UI visually - as this is important for user functionality. The team has provided relevant links for contact and claims to also have experience to execute the project. From the proposal, the budget allocation is under progress, therefore, though the milestones and roadmap are detailed, it is difficult to fund the project if the budget information is lacking. Hiring UI/UX designers, researchers, graphic designers for marketing purposes, can be added to the team members.

Many are yet to adopt to blockchain and cryptocurrency in these communities in Africa. Some parts of Africa express the need for blockchain and cryptocurrency which more education and key ideas is to be regarded to ensure it's acceptance in this areas.

After the new projects are funded, they can be listed on the centralised exchange which increases the chance of success, because they can be actively traded. \nOverall the idea looks awesome but it is highly dependent on the acceptance and use from other projects.
