The proposers mention the downsides of the AMM model as used in Uniswap v2 that results in impermanent loss and lacks efficiency. The team propose to research and propose new liquidity provision models that help to address these problems. The results of this proposal will be made open source to the benefit of the wider ecosystem. The proposers could have added more specifics on what exactly would be novel with the research they are carrying out with some examples to be more explicit on how they will try to solve the problem. This proposal would ideally be located in a development and infrastructure type of category as they are producing open source work for the betterment of the ecosystem. Overall as the proposal will be fully open source and be usable and relevant for all the DeFi products in the ecosystem I would agree this proposal could create impact for the ecosystem.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The breakdown of the timeline for this proposal is divided into research, development and audit. During the research stage a paper will be produced to disclose the findings of the work, development will take that work and make examples and finally the code will be audited to provide more confidence that it is secure. The budget breakdown is then provided which adds more depth into where the funding will be used. They mention they will cover the remainder of costs to get this work done as it will not cover everything. The itemised list breaking down the tasks and hours is sufficiently detailed and even breaks up the on-chain and off-chain work. For the team involved they mention there are 9 developers involved in the MuesiliSwap team and mention their release of the MuesiliSwap DEX which is an order book model which is what gives them the relevant experience. The proposers provide a Github repository showing evidence of their previous work and also have the evidence of a fully functioning DEX using the order book model. It would have been good for the team to share their professional link backgrounds if possible. Overall with the evidence provided of previous execution and development delivery it appears very likely that this proposal will be feasible due to the teams experience in this area.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Tracking the progress of the proposal consists of the research paper, the open source development and the audit. All of these key progress points are open source and publicly available to the community which will make them easy for the community to audit but also good for the community to benefit from the efforts made in this proposal. The success for this proposal looks at enriching the DeFi ecosystem with better approaches to utilise the eUTXO model over competing account based mode blockchains. The only main feedback here would it would be good to have been more specific on the exact innovations and outcomes the proposal is looking to deliver in more depth than improved liquidity provision models. This would make it easier to verify and audit whether this has been achieved. Overall it should be easy to audit this proposal for the community. In future proposals the team would be advised to provide as much depth as possible into the exact areas of focus for the research so it can be more easily scrutinised and evaluated or the statements that we are unsure on exactly what we will confirm out of this research.

MuesliSwap is a Dex exchange combining AMM and orderbook on the cardano platform that has been in operation since November 2021.

This might be triggered by the fact that we are in a bear market. However, this is signaling that Cardano accomplished and successful builders are not being lax and not giving up building. Here I am also seeing the positive side effects of having many DEXs in Cardano. They are sharpening themselves to be better than their competitors so one of them can be the market leader. Ultimately, the end users or customes will enjoy the greatest benefits from this betterment.\n\nIt is true that our presently working DEX still have a lot of room for improvement. Upcoming DEXs such as MalaDex is promising to solve the impermanent lose issue and better capital liquidity and efficiency, while WingRiders has USDC and interoperability via EVM sidechain such as Milkomeda. I just reviewed BashoSwap\u2019s proposal and they are developing transaction-chaining model for better UX through reduced latency and no/less slippage. It feels so good to see that ecosystem is so vibrant and the competition is so healthy in Cardano ecosystem despite current market condition. This proposal will also be beneficial to all these DEXs since the result will be utilizing the power and advantages of eUTXO-based blockchain. I believe all those benefits outlined and detailed in the proposals will push deeper and vast adoption through much more effective and efficient yet still enjoyable consumption of the products of blockchain technology.

Although it is not the AMM everyone expects for, it still provided important service such as the price discovery of fungible native assets/tokens. This achievement speaks volume for itself and a solid proof that the team especially the developers in OpenSwap/MuesliSwap have the necessary experience, skills, and knowledge to deliver this proposal. Budget is detailed in clarity and reasonable at development/engineering hourly rate of roughly USD 80. The rate is fair when compared with other projects in the ecosystem and similar service providers in Haskell/Plutus-based smart contracts.\n\nImplementation timeframe of roughly 6 months is also perfectly acceptable since this is a development work with good amount of investigation and research works preceding it. The deficit in budget will be covered by MuesliSwap team which mitigate the risk of budget/financial problems. Other risks are also well-addressed and the proposer team is assuring they are well-prepared to tackle any challenges in the delivery process.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The execution of this proposal is divided into three major phase serving as the key milestones: research which result in paper (2 months), development (3 months) which result in the improved smart contracts, and audit (1 months) for security purpose.

The research papers will be published and open for anyone to read and the smart contract codes will be in public Github repositories that can be monitored and tracked by curious and interested community members. The audit details and results/reports will also be made public. Twitter Spaces that can serve as AMA session as well will be held weekly.\n\nThe success is simply defined as the outcome delivered through this proposal will be beneficial and applied by all dApps in the Cardano, enriching the ecosystem especially DeFi area, and ultimately giving Cardano extra competitive advantage over account-based model blockchain. This success can easily be quantifiable with the number of projects or protocols using the resulted research and smart contracts. I think this is as transparent as we can get. Lastly, I want to conclude that all of these invaluable findings will be made into open-source for the greater good of the whole Cardano ecosystem.
