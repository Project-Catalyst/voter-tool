In addition, they have achieved success in funds 6 7 8 (Universal Skills Authentication, PACE: Skills credentials, PeopleCert DevOps Pilot on Cardano). All of the above information makes us completely confident in the ability of this team, they are really talented people. However, it would be great to have more profiles (Linkedin, telegram,...) of UX UI designer and Junior Developer.\nA detailed roadmap within 7 months is provided quite specifically. You have identified what needs to be done for each individual month. This brings many benefits to everyone (easy to monitor and evaluate) and to the project itself (helps the project develop in the right direction, right target). Detailed budget has been calculated. However, I think it is necessary to split the budget further.

The information provided is sufficient for everyone to judge the success of this project. In addition to the issues that I mentioned in the previous section, I think there should be a few more metrics to evaluate the success of the project (for example, after implementation, there will be 500 monthly visits,. ..). Besides that, I also want to give you a compliment for identifying the risks, challenges and ways to mitigate them. This is an important factor that directly affects the long-term development of the project. Another plus point of the project is that you have been aiming for autonomy, which will help optimize the amount of investment that the Cardano ecosystem spends.\nThis is a helpful suggestion.
