However, the team also realized that implementing this idea and bringing the Golang community to Cardano is not easy at all, there will be many difficulties in these two languages. as well as the opinion I have joined in the other proposal of the group to note the advantages, being supported from the Haskell language to the Plutus language. to know the advantage of Plutus. but with that we optimize it for Golang. \"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\"statement of the proposal that landmark 1 has been completed, the most important part of preparation is, that the literature for the study of the Ouroboros protocol has been collected. and milestone 2 is identified as the focal point of this proposal, it will be implemented as soon as funding is received.\n  published budget, apparently total uptime is 300 hours. and milestone 1 was done by the team prior to submission of the proposal. however the implementation of the idea: incorporate Ouroboros into the Golang language to run outside the official Haskell language. is a lot of technical, and academic work. so maybe the completion time will be slower than expected because of errors arising during integration and testing. Therefore, the group needs to have a contingency fund plan.

If you compare the two language repositories Golang and Haskell, we can see from the provided data that Golang has much more development potential than Haskell. The project wants to bridge the gap between Golang developers and the Cardano blockchain to attract more developers, but you say that it is difficult to assess the size of the community when the indicators are only Are you a representative? So how do you fix them for us as well as the developers to evaluate? When will the data be official instead of just being representative or specific evidence you can find out and answer? The risk you can overcome to minimize is to use a map with check keys in encrypted data that cannot be represented natively in Golang. Besides, there is a bigger risk that you have not seen a solution to it? So how do you guys calculate it when I see it as a big problem in completing this project? There is a lack of documentation of the specific parts of the Ouroboros networking protocol that are the challenge you're trying to bring into Golang, but are related to Haskell that you're comparing and competing against.

Both are described in great detail, showing that they are really knowledgeable and experienced in the field and have great awareness of tackling issues.  \nThey suggest two milestones, one of which has already been delivered. This is certainly a testament to the team's competency.\nWith regard to success metrics, I feel it is a little bit confusing to determine whether those success metrics are aligned with the challenge\u2019s objectives since the mention is quite brief and its language is a little bit technical and complicated.

Perhaps I would expect to know the specific timeline at least for the in-progress milestone as it is apparently the focus of this proposal, making it easier for the community to track the progress of activities. Having said that, the fact that the initial deliverable was completed and released, which can be verified, helps assure they can provide the outcome of the 2nd milestone on time and within budget.\nThe budget breakdown should be included for both stages. First, since the proposal is requesting funds that cover both stages, it is essential to make it apparent the allocation of funds in the initial phase. Also, it would be better to clarify the estimate of the number of engineering hours of both stages which I think is well-defined and realistic. It is worth adding the amount of time it will take to complete this project.

These are broken down by hours worked on the project. We can add some task sizing estimates directly in the tasks and some target dates for the milestones, but we do not employ rigid and inflexible programming methodologies like Waterfall, so we do not have a specific, preconceived line-by-line breakdown plan of the work completion. Instead, each item is enumerated in our project board and we use dynamic planning based on real time needs. Our metrics for success are completion of tasks and milestones, as defined in the project board.
