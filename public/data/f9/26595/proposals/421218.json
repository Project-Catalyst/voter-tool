The solution proposed is a verified members only Web application that would essentially eliminate the need for central certification organizations, and create a Decentralized and democratic community by way of using the Cardano blockchain technology to enable a completely transparent form of data collection, which in time & adoption, provide a more efficient path for carbon removal projects to be certified at a fraction of the cost. Research provided by the proposer on the current carbon credit revenue: (http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/files/Offsetting_with_CDM_credits.pdf). The web application to be developed if funding, will combine all collected data sources by means of satellite imagery and self reporting, as well as validators from each carbon removal project to have displayed for the entire community's viewing pleasure. This already existing community could then more effectively monitor projects and their progress, as well as flag any concerns that may arise, while solutions within the community can be easily made in a democratic way. The need for better climate change measures all starts with the individual and the actions being done on a local level. Having this solution to the problem implemented could have an enormous impact, firstly towards the local communities being involved, by lowering carbon emissions in a systematic and efficient fashion, and most of all show the world what the Cardano blockchain and it's growing communities can achieve on a global scale right now and in the future. Securing fathomable solutions to climate change is beneficial to all life on Earth. For those reasons and more, the rationale for this proposal is scored a 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As the proposer states, this is a stepping stone in building a web application fully functional given the time and funding, as an effort to combat climate change with the help of the Cardano community and Project Catalyst. The team in charge of developing the solution to the problem is well documented and shared here within the proposal, as well as in past Catalyst funding rounds through ideas shared (links in description) but directly correlates to a funded proposal in fund 8 (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/403695). The Pond Foundation, led by Scott Poynton is well known for his efforts to climate change and bettering the industry while working with farmers in Africa. WhatIfFood (https://whatif-foods.com/) commissioned the Pond Foundation for the project in Ghana and have a team that's been operating for the last 9 months*. All members of the team associated with this proposal's solution and other commitments from previous funding rounds have been shared with their respected LinkedIn profiles where you can find past work and educational experience. The plan is to develop a \u201cCommunity validation solution product v1\u201d which is outlined to take 4 months of dedicated time by all members including more research on community models, UI & UX design for the web & Dapp development, as well as establishing a product roadmap once testing has been completed. With a budget clearly described in monthly increments, it seems more than sensible for the amount of work that needs to take place, perhaps a undervalued request. This is the only concern I have, is that the team with any additional funding from other ideas from Catalyst, will they have the time management to accomplish these goals. Workload management plan is shared here: (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hz4uUg4oMJGWugGxblLRtiR5ODfQM5if15YrKnIan9Q/edit#) And with that, that rationale for Feasibility given is a 4, only because it may require more than 4 months to implement the solution successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer has a clear understanding of the problem and the solution as outlined in the roadmap and shared budget breakdown of the milestones needed to be accomplished.

The clear measure of success for this proposal would be to deliver a functioning web application, capable of validating carbon removal projects from Ghanian farmers, these participants signing up and earning rewards from the blockchain and community driven service. The proposer plans on providing full transparency of the project's progress by means of GoogleDocs and Github that will enable the Project Catalyst community to view monthly status reports.

The problem statement is presented with great clarity that includes the current system's constraints, data to show that the project's target group is significant (accounting for 70%-80% of total voluntary carbon credit revenue), and today's largest challenges towards stopping climate change. The proposal clearly articulates how it does not only address the challenge (by creating an impactful dApp, the Carbon marketplaces, and physical products - Carbon credits), but it also meets a Fund9's strategic goal (by building a real-world solution on Cardano), and satisfy a strategic goal of Cardano (by contributing to Cardano For Climate movement).

Overall, the team has a long track record of working in agriculture sustainability and technology development. The proposer gives high-level activities and deliverables by the month for the 4-month duration of the project. The budget is broken down into roles and monthly salaries for each role. Both the roadmap and budget look reasonable and easy to follow. The proposer gives very thoughtful considerations to the risks (i.e., product adoption and unit economics) and provides mitigations to those risks (i.e., identifying a strong, loyal group of the first users - Cardano4Climate community, local climate experts, experts from the Pond Foundation; and having a carbon credit premium pricing strategy).

If success is reached and therefore a new way of proving carbon removal, the whole world will know and awareness will be massive.

This will help the project stay on track, on schedule. The budget allocation section, you present very clearly, calculate the budget based on the number of working months, the salary for each month. However, I think the budget should be further broken down. By determining the number of hours worked, the hourly wage, this will make the budget a lot more transparent.

For example, after 4 months, there are 500 visits to the web application, etc. Having specific numbers will be easier for people to compare and evaluate.\nEnvironmental issues, carbon reduction is always an issue that attracts the attention of all mankind.

The community can monitor data collected, approve new decarbonization projects, evaluate data, estimate carbon credits, and more. A farm in Ghana was selected to test this proposal. 10 -30 Ghanaian farmers will use biochar as fertilizer to reduce their carbon footprint.
