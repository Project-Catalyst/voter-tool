In addition, computer products in the local market are two to three times more expensive than the value practiced in the international market.", "f6_no_assessments": 7, "f6_rating": 3.4285714285714284, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 109, "q0": "First just a note for the proposers who are based in the Amaz\u00f4nia Legal region also known as Brazil's Legal Amazon (BLA) region \u2013 specifically in the state of Para. The title of the proposal might be confusing [I am only mentioning this aspect - if the proposal is not accepted this Fund and is resubmitted in Fund 10] as many people will initially think that the proposal is about an integration between Cardano and the US online retailer Amazon. Hence, the problem statement \u201cThere is no adoption of blockchain solutions on Amazon\u201d might be better redefined to a more focused region \u2013 is it Para state? Or is it the Brazilian Amazon region (Amazonia Legal] or is the entire Amazon region of South America [including Peru, etc\u2026]. The other part of the problem statement \u201cIn addition, computer products in the local market are two to three times more expensive than the value practiced in the international market\u201d \u2013 is a problem indeed, but it is in large part due to the relatively protectionist trade policies that Brazil has in order to disincentivize imports. For that very reason, many multinationals are based in the Zona France de Manaus duty-free zone in order to avoid high customs tariffs and taxes. The proposed solution is to create a store that will offer subsidized products that will only accept Cardano as payment. The proposed solution of offering subsidized products through a \u201cmegastore\u201d seems unsustainable in the long-term as a long-term source of funding is needed, aside from Catalyst. However, my main gripe with the proposal it that it seems very loosely aligned with the Dapps, Products & Integrations challenge, as it is not a DApp, nor a product, nor really an integration \u2013 but a proposal to use ADA for payment. Which is laudable, but would not really require Catalyst support apart from the subsidy component. The team states that this will be a self-sustaining project, however a credible plan for self-sustaining operations of the megatore is not included. There is a proposed switch to a different model of operations \u2013 after only one month \u2013 if the model is not sustainable: \u201cif adoption is not sustainable in 1 month, we plan to implement alternative payment solutions to ADA Cardano, but with market prices\u201d. This to me seems more like a marketing plan for opening a new web store that will use Catalyst subsidized initial prices likely only for one month with a high likelihood of moving away from ADA payments following that month. If the proposal is resubmitted, I would advise the team to think about other possibilities for keeping the business sustainable long-term. Instead of moving to \u201calternative payment systems\u201d \u2013 it would be good to start with several payment systems initially and develop a good business model that does not rely on subsidized prices from the get-go. The team does wish for the proposal to be self-sustainable, however the added financing from a stakepool will not be sufficient. The CRIP stakepool currently has 1 ADA pledged and has minted two blocks in the past 26 epochs as of today. Increasing the pledge from 1 ADA \u2013 even with the entire Catalyst funding will not change the fundamentals without a more detailed plan. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "In my view the feasibility of implementing this proposal as currently planned \u2013 is solid. There is a local, knowledgeable and competent team for setting up a store of computer-related products \u2013 although I did not see someone with expertise in retail store management. The budget seems realistic for what is planned \u2013 marketing plan, acquisition of equipment to sell ($30,000), renovation of store, website, monthly operational costs\u2026 etc.. I would have liked to have seen a detailed business plan for the store and some type of control that the subsidized first batch of equipment $30,000 will not be sold to project insiders who are aware of the subsidy. Also, the plan does not include details on how big a subsidy this will represent \u2013 nor what is the attraction of the store when the subsidized equipment sales run out of Catalyst funded subsidizes. It will then become a regular store \u2026 so it will have to have a competitive advantage in relation to traditional players in the market. What would be the competitive advantage in this case? {I am asking in case the team resubmits this proposal in Fund 10, if they do not attract sufficient votes in this round}. This proposal does offer a realistic timetable for completing the work \u2013 the store\u2019s opening is planned for September 2022. There is a plan included that shows what will be done and also how and by whom. The challenges and risks seem do not seem to include a risk analysis of how to deal with the existing competition in computer equipment sales. The subsidized equipment sales is not a long-term or mid-terms strategy for success and the team \u2013 if resubmitting \u2013 should include a plan that details the edge that they plan to have in relation to competition, if the adoption of ADA and subsidized equipment fails. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team has a roadmap with milestones for opening their store and they have offered store success metrics that would measure the success of their proposal. The team specifies that they have an \u201caccountant, responsible for the store's sales and stock statistics\u201d \u2013 however there is no information whether this information will be made public and whether the Catalyst community will be given access to this information. One possible conflict of interest that would need to be avoided \u2013 is a situation in which a store is launched and the equipment is sold off at subsidized prices to people who are affiliated with the team. Conflict of interest is an important issue, when subsidies are offered in the form of below-market prices and I do not think that the proposal is clear enough and auditable enough in that aspect. If the proposal is resubmitted in Fund 10, this could be addressed. Some aspects of the success \u2013 such as using renewable energy \u2013 depend on the Green Crypto Farm, however these claims need to be substantiated with some more auditable information \u2013 apart from photographs of solar panels on the website. How much fossil fuel energy is used by the company, how much photovoltaic electricity is generated per month, how much is the electricity consumption in total of the company. Real auditability requires a lot of data, not only claims. I am mentioning this as the auditability section requires precise power distribution verification & information that would corroborate the \u201csolar mining farm\u201d status as Carbon Zero (which is visible on the Green Crypto site (https://greencripto.com/?p=11197&lang=en). The team\u2019s web page states: \u201cToday, VGMD uses only its own solar energy, contributing to the preservation of the planet and the Amazon.\u201d \u2013 however this is \u2013 at it currently stands \u2013 not really auditable, if the team does not provide documentation. Carbon Zero status implies adding all the energy use of the company and then subtracting the renewable energy generation and that equals zero. Many companies make that claim, but the data needs to back it up. I mention this as one of the definitions of the success of this proposal is \u201cParticipants will know that non-renewable energy will not be used and that the company and Cardano invest in the preservation of nature\u201d. I am not sure how will participants know this, if the complete energy balance of the company and its employees (travel to work, use of electric vehicles for business travel, etc.) is not tallied somewhere.  Another definition of success states \u201cThe advertising pieces are the main key of this project that tend to reach at least 1 million people through radio, TV and social networks\u201d \u2013 however it does not seem realistic with an advertising budget of $1,000. Might be better to think of effective advertising \u2013 which is converted into sales. One more definition of the success of the proposal is \u201cUsers, consumers of this project, will create a Cardano wallet - probably on mobile - to purchase computer-related hardware at low cost\u201d. Opening a wallet is not an easy task for an average person and buying ADA is another important hurdle. There is another hurdle to achieve the next definition of success: \u201cThese same users will stake ADA Cardano and contribute to the decentralization and growth of this ecosystem\u201d- namely those users will probably spend most of the ADA on the subsidized computer equipment, that is the main attraction \u2013 not staking.

The team has been running a solar-powered minting farm in the amazon for 2 years and run Cardano pool: CRIP (green cripto). They choose to trade computer as they have the most knowledge and contact also because product is in high demand in the Amazon and Brazil. They will trade at attractive price with low margin. The proposed megastore could be the good initiative to draw other commercial centers in the region. The team mentions the risk of low adoption which could be quite important to the success of this project as it will involve educating people on their payment on ADA. They plan to mitigate this by implementing alternative payment solutions, but with market prices. This should be an enough incentive for the local to use ADA instead. The crime is also a concern along with bureucracy but taken these risk factors into account, the proposed dapp can be implemented to bring use cases to Cardano and increase Cardano adoption in the Amazon (Belem) area. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project has outlined a very detailed plan on how to bring this project into a success. The proposer should include the pay rate for any manpower related cost and the number of hours working on the project. This will bring clarity to some of cost items like website, logo, branding $10,000 and also the store opening and advertising on local radio and TV $10,000  These are big ticket items that need some more clarification as to how the personnels are compensated. Also the team member online profile to accompany each team member responsibilties would be a great addition to the proposal. The fact that some team members are running stake pool and maintain solar panels are good signal that this project can be implemented successfully as they are involved within Cardano ecosystem.

Detailed roadmap has been provided, tasks for each time period have been identified. As for the budget, although it has been calculated, it would be great to break it down even further.

I don't know why we are applying for this funding instead of investing our own money and asking for funding from Catalyst to focus on integrating ADA as a payment gateway?

My advice for this situation is to add more resources to make this clear.\nSecond, regarding the budget, the proposal does not indicate what portion of the budget will be used for the development of the ADA payment channel. The entire budget is only used to buy equipment and hardware for the business as well as to overhaul the store. This I think is unreasonable. Besides, in the section of the main risk preventing the project implementation, the proposed team mentioned that they will deploy another alternative solution instead of ADA in case the acceptance rate is low. This is the weak point of the project, which seems to be claiming you will quit ADA if there are any difficulties.
