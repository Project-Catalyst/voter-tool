The prototype is meant to be used as a mitigation for the upcoming risks that might appear during development, and strengthen the final product. I would like to have seen some clarity if the true purpose of this proposal is to provide a version available to the public, or if this prototype only will be for a small number of people that can test it (an alpha version of the final game, for example). Looking at the roadmap, each milestone concerns development only, the blockchain integration also appear under a milestone not covered in this proposal. So if I understand it correctly, this prototype will be closed and tested within a closed group of people or possibly community members? \n\u2028This means that this proposal in its finished form will leave us with the promised potential of attracting users to the Cardano Ecosystem, but this proposal itself will not generate any users to the Ecosystem until the final product is released (which is excluded from this proposal). \u2028\u2028The proposer mentions four areas of risk that the proposal is meant to investigate, analyse and mitigate. I have no issue with the purpose of that, but I would have liked to see some mentions of the risks related to completing this proposal. For example, the team consists of three members. Is there a possible risk of work-overload? Is the project dependent on VC funding in addition to the potential funds gained from this funding round in Catalyst? \u2028Play2earn-games are popular and relevant, but considering the general sentiment of the world right now, it is kind of risky to release play2earn-games during a recession. (Perfect time to build, but maybe not for release) And how will this particular play2earn game keep up with the generally fast paced-sentiment of mobile gaming? A couple of months ago, AxieInfinity was super popular, then came Move2earn but is also declining in popularity. \u2028\u2028Due to the reasons listed above, I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "We are provided with a detailed roadmap with milestones related to development progress, estimated on a timeframe of 96 days. Speaking from my experience as a recurring community advisor (since Fund 6), it could be presented a bit more clearly if the timeframe was shown in months. This way we could expect a final date for the proposal to be finished. In its current form, these working days could be portioned out over a timeframe of 10 years.\u2028I\u2019m assuming that the responsibility areas will be divided between the three team members, will all of them work full time at the same time period, or will the intensity of each responsibility area be split between different stages of development? Questions like these I would like to have clarified in order to assess the feasibility of the project more smoothly. \u2028The budget breakdown could beneficially be presented and split up between the different responsibility areas (For example, music integration-16 hours-960 USD). This way we could compare the budget breakdown with both roadmap and team member information and make a fair estimate of the whole picture. As I hinted at before, it would be nice to see some mentions in the proposal on the relation with Cardano, and the blockchain experience needed for this project. \n\nThe proposer has included links to each team members LinkedIn-profiles in order for us to verify the experience and competency stated in the proposal, which is important. We are also given the official website of Ziberbugs, along with the Darkpaper (white paper) of the project. It seems serious enough, but this proposal is about the prototype and the development that the team aims to complete, and not launching the finished product. I have some questions and concerns about the AxieInfinity-like system of creating two in-game-tokens, but that is not relevant to this proposal. I recommend skimming through the white paper, since it provides a good insight to the process and future plans of the proposing team. The team might return to Catalyst submitting proposals for future Funds depending on how the project develops. \u2028\u2028Overall, I neither agree nor disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team plans to communicate the development progress and other updates through their official website and dedicated Discord server. They mention that they will have a detailed project plan that they\u2019ll review each week, and I would love to have seen an example for that, and the progress metrics mentioned.\nI would also suggest to include some other relevant KPIs, but to be honest I\u2019m not sure if I have a good suggestion. Maybe tracking the number of community members involved in testing and giving feedback to the project, and a metric that relates to the outreach of the project. Tracking number of members in the Discord Server, website visits, etc. Since the measurements of success stated in the proposal is attracting thousands of people from other networks to Cardano. \u2028Another interesting point would be a paragraph on how the team will measure intangible aspects like \u2018how fun is the game to play?\u2019. What will the framework of that analysis be, and how will they measure it?\u2028Conclusively, I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to asses the progress in attaining its stated goals.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2504", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 9498, "q0": "For uncertainty in the articulated impacts, I rank this section a 3. As someone who consistently ranks Platinum 2 in League of Legends TFT, I\u2019m plenty excited about seeing a dedicated autobattler strategy game built on Cardano. The concern here is with how some of the information is presented about the representation of TFT. There\u2019s a brief mention of TFT as \u201cone of the most popular esports games\u201d that I find a little questionable, at least as far as the attainaility. For a long time, TFT was desolate in both the esports and participation perspectives, despite being produced by the (at different times) top esports game. The viewership has grown substantially since its origins but the biggest reason for its rapid increase in viewership and participation was it being one of the first AAA rated 120 fps games that launched on iOS, along with some help from Apple to push it out to the masses. I\u2019m still a huge fan but the viewership and participation in the game has taken a bit of a dip in recent months and has stagnated a it. That being said, this proposal needs to provide greater tangibility and quantify this section with more data/research than just the modeling evidence of TFT. There is a rather small attempt to quantify impacts here at the mention of \u201cliterally millions\u201d of people but Catalyst voters will definitely need to see more specificity. In this section, I\u2019d like to see a lot more content about this game (lore, mechanics, strat diversity, graphics, etc) and a well-researched/argued transaltion to impacts on the Cardano ecosystem. Arguably, the biggest appeal to TFT (from its inception) was the familiarity with existing Legaue of Legends characters in the TFT mechanics, so this proposal needs to put a lot more effort into emphasizing the uniqueness of this game instead of trying to be like a game that has had plenty of obstacles on its road to success. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "For a highly capable team, a clear laid out roadmap of actionable tasks and a perfectly efficient spening plan, I rank this section a 4. I\u2019m rather enthusiastic about this development team because there appears to be all the necessary elements to create a quality game. They\u2019ve got top tier talent in software development, game design/development, and graphic design. The only thing missing is a high-level marketer, which will be more necessary later down the road but still a very important element. The rodmap does a great job at outlining actionable steps and how many days worth of laor will be needed to complete each task but it doesn\u2019t clearly breakdown how long they expect to reach completion of the project, as I assume many of these tasks will be worked on simultaneous with other tasks. Signposting with macro timeframe milestones would do a lot for organization here. While the budget is much less detailed than I would like to see, it does successfully breakdown the allocated hours of labor with hourly rate. The given information demonstrates efficiency in spending with industry standard rates set for roles across the board, so I can\u2019t complain. The main issues I see with this section are little organizational/visual preferences that could help voters better comprehend the content, so I can\u2019t complain here. Perfectly feasible. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "For lack of presented standards for success beyond product completion, I rank this section a 2. This section of the proposal doesn\u2019t really show anything that voters can use to tangibly evaluate. I think there\u2019s a lot of room to introduce additional KPIs like usership statistics, the amount of games played (and maybe getting a little fancy with games played per player), the amount of NFTs sold/owned/used, game downloads, beta testers, etc. Once these categories are defined and identified, further definition can be added with target metrics for each category that shows commitment to a certain level of performance and an acute vision of success that directly translates to potential impacts. If the proposal wants to take it a step further, this quantification can set progressive targets at different timeframes to establish milestone goals that gives the team a guage to measure the need to adjust at different points in the future of the project. There\u2019s a lot of room to provide substance for voters to evaluate that just isn\u2019t there in this draft of the proposal.

The idea is to create a high-quality NFT game that will attract potentially millions of users to the Cardano space similar to what Axie Infinity did to Ethereum. The only part that is not 100% clear to me is that they mentioned that ZiberBugs was created in 2021 so I'm assuming they are really early in the project and have not been able to build a prototype yet and this is what the proposal is for (as a suggestion it could be clearer in the team 's next proposals because I had to read four times to make sure I wasn't missing something). Despite that, it is a novel application built on top of Cardano with the intention of attracting new users which strongly aligns with the goals of the campaign. Additionally, it adds a new use case to the network which enriches the ecosystem. Finally, another downside of the proposal is the empty sustainable development goals rating section (or more precisely filled with a \"TBD\"). It shows a lack of commitment of the team and even though I really liked the proposal I cannot give a grade 5, otherwise I would not be consistent with other proposals assessed.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team formed by Tom Metzger, Simon Isback and Fabio Persegani has a really strong skillset and solid experience in software development, game developing and graphic designing. Moreover, they have presented LinkedIn links for the three members to provide evidence of those skills and experiences. In addition, the budget is very detailed and has been broken down into each of the activities that will be performed in programming, creative work and others works. This way they arrived at a sensible number of hours of work required and by using a USD 60 average cost rate they estimated the total amount requested in the proposal, which is reasonable. Nevertheless, the plan is blended with the budget, and it would have been nice to see a clearer roadmap showing when those work hours will actually take place (does the creative work happen in tandem with the programming work or it has to wait until the programming work has reached a specific point? it is not clear from the proposal). Finally, the team has appropriately considered four risks that could impair the project and they hope to mitigate them by finding answers to their questions with the prototype.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As mentioned before the plan is blended with the budget and it is not clear when those work hours will take place (they could all happen simultaneously or some activities could depend on others). In other words, there is no clear roadmap with milestones so we can assess if the project is according to the plan every week or so, for example. That compromises the time horizons as well because we only know the total amount of time that will be needed to complete the project but don't know how much time it will take to reach each milestone. Additionally, the team has not defined clear KPIs to measure the success of the proposal in terms of the campaign. As a suggestion they could use number of people playing the game, number of new Cardano users onboarded and level of satisfaction of the gamers (could be measured through survey or other means) among others. On the other hand, they have superbly explained their proposed solution and it is effective as it addresses the problem of pulling more adoption to the Cardano ecosystem.

The proposer and team are transparent about their professional background and profiles, and have done some impressive work with the video and design impressions on their website and Youtube.
