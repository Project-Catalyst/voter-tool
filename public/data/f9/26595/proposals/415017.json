This problem will be exacerbated with the rise of play-to-earn as cheaters have more incentive now than ever.", "f6_no_assessments": 7, "f6_rating": 4.523809523809524, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 4250, "q0": "The proposal identifies a problem affecting most games, especially those where gaming actions create a payoff for the player, i.e. the demand for bad actors who, with irregular game actions, ruin the gaming experience and risk creating damage to the ecosystem. These irregular game actions can be both the use of cheat mechanisms to enhance one's skills (e.g. aimbot) and the opening of a new game account by an experienced player in order to take advantage of matchmaking. to battle inexperienced players.\nThe current solution chosen by most games is to rely on centralized services to detect cheaters, but this solution is a partial solution since, especially in free games, the cheater, once kicked out, can open new accounts. To stop this behavior, the proposal aims to create an evaluation system based on DID, in which the player creates trust based on the game metrics (e.g. number of hours played) and wallet without having to provide personal, therefore the higher the level of reliability of the player. player the greater the rewards and the amount of prizes. The proposer therefore that these incentives can prove to be the winning weapon to entice the player to keep their account (no smurfing) and not to use cheat mechanisms. For these reasons, the objective of the challenge is that it proposes the answer to an integration that aims to become a valid alternative to the service provided to centralized providers of current anti-cheat mechanisms and brings a use case that could have a great impact. in the Cardano ecosystem and more generally in the game.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal aims to solve the problem of cheating and smurfing thanks to the introduction of a reputation system based on DID.\nThis system could be effective however it presents some major risks that the proposer must consider:\nMany times the cheating and skill boosting mechanisms are so sophisticated that even companies specializing in preventing them struggle to discover them (An experienced Fortnite player, Kona, has deliberately demonstrated that it is possible to get to the FNCS using cheating mechanisms without being discovered. Doesn 't know the FNCS are the most important Fortnite tournament with millions of euros up for grabs. Here the article for more info: https://www.sportskeeda.com/fortnite-events/news-hacker-shows-easy-bypass - fortnite-anti-cheat-making-fncs-finals).\nThis means that a player using cheats may go undetected for a long time. During all this time he would accumulate reputation points so paradoxically he could be paid more than an honest player who starts earning PMX after him.\nOnce the cheater is identified and expelled, nothing would prevent him from opening another account. Sure, he'd be earning slightly less than before because he's lost his reputation points, but he's still using cheats. Keep in mind that a player starting out as a console has a shooting accuracy between 15 and 25%, but with aimbot the aim can be even 100%, this is a huge difference it would take a very large multiplier to guarantee equity. And if the player is not discovered immediately when he reopens an account he will start earning reputation points again.\nFinally, if the established metrics do not compensate for the differences due to the game structure it could still be worthwhile for the player to smurf. Playermint will measure gameplay in a mode called arena mode, which features a hype-based gameplay mechanism. This mechanism leads players to level up (= division) with increasing game difficulty, until reaching the champions league (= divisions 8.9.10) which gives access to competitions with huge cash prizes.\nThe current model of Playermint PSP (playemintskillpoint) partly recalls the hype model but does not consider the level (division) at which the player is.\nThis could be a problem because a player who plays in Division 10 (highest level of all) faces tremendously strong players (for most people it takes months of \"training\" to get to a similar level. Trust level is based are metrics such as game hours played, number of games owned etc. (which are not part of the traditional Hype-based game rewards structure) these metrics will be the same for all players.\nWith the current PSP earnings structure with equal hours played, number of games owned etc. playing in division 10 (level higher than all) will be decidedly disadvantaged compared to a player in division 1 because they both receive the same multiplier but the players they face are substantially different (and this difference is enormous), so the experienced player will be brought to open a new profile rather than keep his. The case would be different if a true decentralized digital identity issued by an SSI (self-sovereign identiy) platform was requested, but this could be difficult to attract players from outside the world of cryptocurrencies in Cardano.\nAn easier solution for Playermint might be to create a more arena-like game structure, with incentives for players reaching higher levels, then use Overwolf to read the division the player belongs to. In the following google document I show more precisely the differences between the hype and PSP models, possible consequences and solutions:\n(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BAvEUifDQTWDiDDGNIwHeroUsWDBQ2ychonsVn801GI)\nIn the event that this proposal is financed, my suggestion is therefore to evaluate regardless of a change in the PSP earnings structure, then perform an integration with the DID-based reputation system.\nReturning to the proposal, the proposer knows precisely the number and type of team members needed to implement the proposal. The playermint team, which overall has years of experience in blockchain and gaming, will be supported by some members of the MLabs team as regards the Cardano development side and will be supported by the Proof of space team. Linkedin references of members who will work on the project are given. The required budget is clearly delineated and divided into identifiable items and it seems reasonable to me for the realization of the proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer presents a defined roadmap, with milestones and a time horizon for achieving that should lead to a functioning product in 4 months.

So, if the project will succeed, the added value to the Cardano ecosystem has the potential to be consistent, as blockchain games can attract more good (as in opposite to bad) players.\nThe proposer presents a large list of metrics necessary to measure the success of this proposal and they are inline with the Challenge settings (increasing the quality of the blockchain games etc.) and also there is a clear plan provided in support for the project's future which shows us that the proposer has presented this section very well.\n\nBased on the info provided I rate this section with a rating of 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The presented team seems to have the necessary skills and experience to successfully implement this project as there are traits (including LinkedIn links) in support of this, and the team has successfully funded proposals from previous Funds (since Fund4) but is somehow unclear how many members the PlayerMint team has, as the proposer mentioned \"a team of of 7 with 1 advisor\" that are taking care of each proposal submitted this Fund, but only 6 are presented. A better presentation for this aspect is required as there is also a brief presentation of \"team of 5\" in the General section of this proposal. But since the proposer makes a clear statement of 6 members that are working on this proposal, I will take this as a reference.\nThe requested budget of $34,500 is broken down into items, but for some of them additional info is required for a better understanding for the community (thus a little difference when sum them up as there are $34,426, not far from the requested amount). It is recommended to set a hourly rate, where is appropriate, and multiply it by the estimated number of working hours thus having a better view for the community. Also it is unclear what is to be done for the requested $15k (MLabs development work) in terms of working hours or other quantifiable measure.\nThe offered timetable seems to be realistic to complete the necessary work as there are 4 months in the workflow and each one has deliverables attached.\nThe proposer is aware of the main risks that could put in jeopardy this project and offers a way to mitigate them as the project aims to deliver a \"truly authentic trust score\" which seems difficult to achieve, as the proposer states.\n\nBased on what is to be done for the identifiable items of the requested budget, to make things more clear, I rate it 4 stars.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A roadmap with milestones is offered for the 4 months timetable which seems reasonable for what is to be achieved.\nThe progress of this proposal will be tracked via a Discord channel and the PlayerMint website could be used as a gateway for other channels of communication (Twitter and Instagram)\nThe presented metrics/KPIs are inline with the Challenge settings and SGO goals and subgoals are offered.\n\nBased on the info presented I rate this proposal with 5 stars.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2336", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 15132, "q0": "Its a pitty this proposal was not put forward in Self Soverign Identity from F7 and 8. It would fit perfectly there to promote/integrate Prism. With respect to the alignment of this proposal in the Challenge, it would obviously either suit gamaing and or decentralized ID, however these challnges do not exist, Dapps and integrations is the best place for this proposal as it does include \"gaming\" and the idea of integrating a DID/score into the gaming ecosystem to counter fake accounts etc is a good one. Im a little unsure exactly where the blockchain itself needs to be in this process as an immutable ledger of this. The DID doesnt necessarily need to interact with the blockchain itself (even if it is within a decentralized wallet), i.e., the VC can be issued and go straight to the gaming platform, it would seem from the proposal that the blockchain would come into play when players interact with game rewards that are encapsulated in NFTs.  The proposer has however identified how the trust score would be used by game studios and one could use this trust score on games that are not only run on the blockchain but also off. The questions is, is this proposal specific to Cardano or can it be used by any blockchain given the right integrations, and therefore, should the community support this if its non specific to Cardano?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal outlines a 4 month development plan to implement the trust score integration to PlayersMind with the help of ProofSpace.

The experience of the team of PlayerMint Grant, Aidan, Josh, Jack, Courtney, Greg seems fairly typical of such a gaming/blockchain team. The Proofspace team, Viktor, Ruslan, Alexey, Viacheslav, Olesya, Nick, looks like a far more established team with more experience overall.

Because according to the proponent, cheating is now a big problem in the game and negatively impacts the player experience. This problem will be exacerbated with the rise of the game for money as cheaters have more incentives than ever before. The solution to this is to use encryption to make playing the game as a trusted entity, as opposed to a constantly shuffling list of cheat accounts. This is done through a DID-based reputation system, where players build trust based on their game and wallet metrics.
