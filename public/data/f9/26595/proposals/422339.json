Small business owners and vendors are not crypto-savvy, they don't know how to set up crypto-alternative payments. There is no alternative payment method for small businesses. So the solution is to create DApp software that will give merchants access to the technology they need to tailor crypto payments to their business. DApp will approach the adaptation of cryptocurrency in real life. This proposal addresses several key issues that are key to this challenge. The \u201cSmall Business Crypto Payments DApp\u201d will be executed on top of the Cardano blockchain\u2019s compute layer and thus will spark awareness of the Cardano blockchain. This proposal, if successfully implemented, will help global providers in the developing country community know about the Cardano blockchain's ability to solve problems with payments and increase interaction with the Cardano community. Several challenges and risks have been mentioned and the proponent has an appropriate solution to those challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This project is planned to be implemented within 5 months and is divided into 3 phases. Each phase is presented very clearly and in detail about the activities that will take place so we have a very overview of the implementation process. The budget requires $50,000, we know what the money will be allocated for, so the investment need is very clear giving us more confidence in the project's budgeting needs. And finally, about the team that implemented the proposal, all the team members have a lot of experience that I think is suitable for successfully implementing this proposal. Each member is introduced to their field of training, experience, and role in the project and attached a link to the member's CV. Therefore, I have a lot of confidence in this team, based on what the proposal provides I am very confident in the feasibility of this project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Proponents provide several ways to track project progress:\n- Statistics of the number of application installs, will indicate whether the interest in the project is increasing or decreasing.\n-Measure DApp interest by the number of subscribers and compare these metrics each month.\n-Statistics of the number of transactions per month, which will show the adaptation of Crypto payments by small businesses and vendors.\nIt can be seen that all products offered are specific, providing clear dates so progress can be tracked. However, what is missing from the proposal is to provide a means by which the community can check the number of data generated. So in my opinion, the proponent should prepare reports, at least monthly, with project updates, and share them directly with the community. This will make it easier for the community to track the project's progress.\nThe success of the project is clear, it has been determined from the moment the issue was raised that the DApp project will empower small businesses and willing vendors, with mobile applications easy to use to receive payments for goods and services in cryptocurrencies, as an alternative payment method without additional hardware or software", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2299", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4495, "q0": "Creating a crypto payment dApp for small businesses, online and brick-and-mortar alike, is almost the \"holy grail\" of cryptocurrency adoption in the mainstream. This proposal claims that this is currently held back by lack of savvy of small merchants, but does not address the elephants in the room: crypto volatility, KYC, taxes, fiat-crypto ramps. There was a dedicated COTI Pay challenge in Fund-7 where a solution for integrating real world payments and the ADA-verse already exists, and many proposals wanted to create plugins, integrate Shopify and other such noble solutions. Unfortunately, none of this matters if the jurisdiction your shop is based in does not recognize crypto as money, the local currency that the shops pays its rent or payroll has huge swings against ADA, there is no stablecoin that merchants would understand and trust, and exchanging between fiat cash accounts and crypto is expensive and complicated.\nI appreciate greatly that the proposer wants to start working on this huge problem, and help bridge the legacy economy and cryptocurrencies, in particular our ADA. This should be done step-by-step with small, credible wins. Simply giving merchants the \"tech\" that they would need to accept crypto is not a huge step in the direction of overcoming the divide. It has been done before, and unfortunately, other parts of the puzzle need to be solved before any value to merchants can be provided by a solution such as the one proposed. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer shares the team CVs online, which shows commitment and respect to Project Catalyst. The team seems to be likeable and enthusiastic. I would have loved to see more discussion and milestones about overcoming the problems that have held back crypto adoption by merchants before. Ada has been around for many years, and many merchants are quite savvy at using Apple Pay or AliPay etc. Please think about this issue and try to discuss and solve.\nThe skills presented by the team do not appear to be sufficient to create a crypto-fiat bridge for small merchants wanting to accept ADA in their stores. It may make sense to collaborate with crypto payment experts, and reach out to the community to learn about existing projects to maybe team up. \nThe first milestone of the project is a feasibility study whether Cardano can be used by local merchants, and in my opinion it would have been better to carry this out before submitting the proposal. I would have loved to hear some of the feedback and problems produced by any market research or even interviews, Google forms or anecdotes from friends and family. Overcoming huge price swings, know-your-customer processes, on-and off ramps for local currency and integration of payment solutions like COTI would all require some very specific domain knowledge. \nThe business plan and project outline how to create a mobile app is fairly detailed, and the team have strong backgrounds in mobile app development. The part that would need much more coverage by the timeline and business plan is the crypto integration: how to create wallets for merchants, transfer ada to their bank accounts via foreign exchange platforms, how to consult them about taxes or legal implications, and give them ways to track or manage price volatility.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The stated goal of this proposal and key performance metric is to achieve adaptation of ada by small-businesses and vendors from developing countries. This would, I suppose, be traceable via app downloads and providing links to use cases. As it is unlikely that the proposal in its current form will produce a minimum viable product (MVP) mobile app that merchants can and will already use to accept ADA, this goal could have been aligned much better with some realistic proof-of-concept character of the project, such as number of merchants listed on the project's website, Zoom meetings with said merchants, transaction volume in ADA, or other goals more appropriate for piloting a completely new concept to the target audience. \nIt is positive that the proposing team is transparent about their identity and ways to be contacted, but without meaningful metrics to evaluate the roll-out of the solution, Project Catalyst is unlikely to gain enough information to keep up to date with progress.

Additionally, applying the Cardano platform to build this Dapp will create a decentralized environment that securely protects merchants against fraud. I love this idea because the proposer help to increase awareness about blockchain application in solving business problem, not trading cryptocurrencies as most people know.\n\nI think the idea is good in terms of risk forecasting, but it would be better if the proposer showed the strategy to help small businesses join while the legal policies of some countries still do not recognize payments via cryptocurrencies, what would you do if their government does not allow cryptocurrencies payment? Additionally, I would like to understand more insight on their plan to specifically attract small businesses into this Dapp?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal included 3 phases running in 5 months to complete the Dapp. The proposer describes granularly step-by-step to accomplish the technical portion of the app. With this timeline, the Dapp can be done on time. However, my concern here is that there is no audit phase in the timeline, so it's difficult to prove its safety and reliability, I think the proposer has their thinking sleeves but not showing here. Apart from that, the proposal would be more significant if it had a clear long-term roadmap in the big picture: how it goes into the market, the business model,... Because the detailed plan focus more on technical information.\n\nI think you guys provided clear and detailed information about human resources in their CVs, including images, and relating experiences,...", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There are many ways to measure the progress the proposer indicated in the proposal. I strongly agree and want to add my opinion more because this is a dapp used for payment, so I think KPIs should measure it related to transaction time and smooth user experience.

In addition, I would also like to commend you for identifying the risks, challenges and ways to reduce them. This is one of the necessary conditions for the project to develop sustainably.

Having specific numbers makes it easy for people to evaluate and track.\nAnyway, this is your team's first time submitting a proposal, you guys did a great job.

For payment projects, having someone knowledgeable about payment methods, finance and banking is essential, so I'm a bit concerned about this issue.\nThere is no information on working experience with blockchain technology for payment methods in the proposal.\nAnd as mentioned in the impact section, the proposal does not provide solutions to overcome the disadvantages of electronic payment, which will pose a very high risk to users, making it difficult for them to accept this DApp.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "They only give parameters to measure when the product has launched.\nIt is still possible to track project progress through the milestones they are released.

Those are small business owners and their partners. Regarding the benefits of the proposal, it helps to reduce the transaction fees that both sellers have to pay to the banking system.\nLike myself, I am paying fees from banks for international payment activities from 1-2.5%. It will be a very large number if the monthly payments are over 100,000 USD with a fee of 1,000 - 2,500 USD.\nIf you look at transactions with ADA, that transaction fee will probably only be a few USD. A number about 500 times lower than the bank side.\nI think this is a potential business model and there are opportunities for new developers. Helps eliminate middlemen and make transactions more transparent and less fee-based. This helps buyers and sellers own more value.\nThis proposal addresses the challenge's requirements very well. This is a potential application to make international traditional purchases more flexible and cheaper. This application will attract traditional business owners who know Cardano and use the Cardano ecosystem more often.\nWhat I just find lacking is the presentation of the proposal on how the application will use which technology to get the data that provides the price for coins like ADA or other Stablecoins. To help accurately update price pairs when users trade.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In the proposal, the proposed implementation plan is lacking in details. The author is describing the implementation plan in phases. Question here? The period that the author gives is how many months.\nNext, the author needs to provide details about who will perform each of the tasks listed in the period. This allows me and the voters to assess whether team members have the skills and experience to complete all of the tasks to complete the proposal.\nDuring the development process, I found the author did not mention the design of the user interface. But in the cost, it refers to the design cost. Could this be a shortcoming?\nNext, the author does not mention an important cost in developing applications that is the cost of data storage. The author should also add a cost of 10% of the total amount required to hedge against the risk of ADA slippage. This will result in the project not having enough funds to complete the proposal.\nThe author should take a closer look at this supplement of mine.\nFinally, in terms of information about the members, I see that they have a lot of experience in developing centralized applications. But they don't have much experience in developing decentralized applications on blockchain. That would be a huge minus and a big hurdle in completing this proposal.

That makes them not able to measure all the risks that may occur during the implementation of the proposal and may prolong the implementation time.
