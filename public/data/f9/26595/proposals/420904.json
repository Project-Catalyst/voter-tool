If the team can create a dynamic NFT platform, it will be great for the community and the Cardano ecosystem. As such, the proposal has a strong impact on the Cardano ecosystem and adds value to the ecosystem (it helps to increase the value and number of NFTs on the Cardano platform). Being a multi-asset NFT, it also holds a huge potential for future scaling and challenges. It would not be an exaggeration to consider it as a premise for continuing to build an NFT community to promote Cardano blockchain adoption, NFT management, asset management, attestation, etc...in the national area. Vietnam, East Asia, and even countries around the world if deployed widely. With so much room for continued deployment and exploitation by the community, I think this is one of the most impactful proposals I've come across.

You have a lot of experience after successfully building the Dare NFT project providing solutions for launch, market, and IOG services on BSC. This is the clearest proof of the team's credibility. All documents provided by the team in the proposal are very open and transparent, which confirms the feasibility of the proposal and the openness of team members. I see the professionalism in the presentation, and that professionalism is real with the DareNFT website. If possible, the team should post the social media links of some key members directly on the proposal, this will be easier for the community to access to find out the publicity of the members' identities rather than having to lose access to team-specific documents. It is my contribution to increasing the credibility of the team while increasing the feasibility of the proposal. I have seen the budget analysis, but I think it is short and a bit sketchy, not to be called detailed. The team can add more in terms of items that are broken down by items or by the progress of the work to be reasonable with the price and reasonable with the goal. This is important to demonstrate feasibility. I understand that to implement dynamic NFT, there are many stages related to technical and labor involved. So my advice is: Please list in detail each job with costs and prices, as detailed as possible so that the community can base on that to evaluate the feasibility of the proposal. If the fund has not been granted to create this Fund 9, will the team continue to implement the proposal? Behind the team is the company, so is there any other source of money to support the implementation of this proposal? The team has a clear implementation plan, and how to do it. The required resources are sufficient to implement despite the implementation of other proposals in Fund 9 by members. I have full confidence in the plan outlined in the team's implementation resources in the proposal. The technical aspect has been saved detailing the application of the technology and how to proceed to successfully create the dynamic NFT platform. This team is not difficult to do because the team is a collection of members who are good at technology or even experts. I have no further comments on these aspects. Creating dynamic NFT also has a great meaning in terms of communication for the project and the team, because when successfully implementing the proposal, it will attract a large number of interested people in the community, from which they will Know more about the team and each member. The measurement team presents the risks that may arise after the project is implemented and offers solutions, I agree with this. Thus, the feasibility of the proposal is clear, I am confident to say that if this proposal is successfully implemented in practice, it will attract a large amount of community interest. And it could even become the start of a new type of NFT on the market. Recently I gave suggestions to improve to make the proposal more perfect. You can refer to it and add it if you think it's reasonable. I vote 4 stars.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "To further demonstrate transparency, you've laid out a pretty reasonable roadmap and milestones. I think it would be better if you attached the roadmap, this milestone to a specific month in a year. This will make it much easier for the community to conduct a review of the proposal's transparency and auditability. In terms of \"what does the success of this project look like\", the team has come up with clear criteria to measure success. Criteria tied to specific numbers: 20 NFT games, reaching 5,000 users, etc... I strongly agree with this definition of success because it makes sense compared to reality. After the proposal is successfully applied and fully implemented, these numbers will gradually increase and confirm its role in the Cardano blockchain community. However, I still regret that the KPI and key metrics are not mentioned in the proposal. This is also one of the criteria to help the market evaluate the transparency and auditability of the proposal. I would like to suggest, that the team should quickly add it to complete the audit. I have no opinion about the clear and easy-to-understand description of problems and solutions throughout the proposal because the team that did it was professional and worthy of a company with many members. Recently, there are positive comments to build my more complete project. Hope the team considers the reference. I want the proposal to be strongly supported, funded, and quickly put into practice.

The problem raised in the proposal is that existing NFT holders \"do not own the NFT\". Because the NFT information is still stored on a centralized server. NFT is not interoperable. Therefore, it is not possible to build a metaverse in the future. The proposed solution is to create a dynamic NFT platform that can help NFT holders \"actually own the NFT.\" The platform also helps users create interoperable NFTs. The user's NFT can contain multiple assets. NFT games may update on-chain item or hero stats to ensure all user NFT information is not lost when the game server crashes. Different games can use the information of an on-chain game to create interaction with their game. NFT and NFT games can integrate NFT 2.0 into their projects to increase NFT sustainability and interoperability. There are several issues of concern to the proponent when an NFT can contain many different assets from different issuers. Who will receive revenue from the sale of these NFTs?

However, for the plan to bring the highest confidence, I think it is advisable to add each week to each phase what will be accomplished.

The detailed roadmap will increase the feasibility of the project, ensure the progress of the work and complete it on time. Next is the budget. The proposal requires a $93,000 budget.

Furthermore it would enable the NFT's to be used in more then one game, or more then one project. It would also allow for true ownership of the NFT, which, with current setups is not the case. This new dynamic NFT platform would be a Daap that would allow more integration as well as collaboration between projects on the Cardano blockchain.\n\nTodays NFT's are mainly static in nature and locked once they are minted.

So most of the information about NFT is stored on the server of NFT publishers. It is nearly impossible to recover NFTs if the server crashes. Therefore, the value of the NFT is easy to lose.\nIf there is a platform that can help users create multi-asset NFTs, that would be great. Because the fate of the NFTs will not be determined by a particular server. If an NFT publisher closes the server, the NFT is still valid.\nIn addition, dynamic NFT can also update metadata on-chain. So the information about NFT will be saved on-chain. If the server crashes, you can still recover. Since the information of the NFTs is all public on-chain, different projects can also use each other's NFT information. This is great for creating interactivity for NFTs.\nMetaverse desperately needs multi-asset NFTs like this to be able to connect multiple assets on just one NFT.
