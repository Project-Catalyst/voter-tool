Few journals benefit from the work of millions of scientists who provide their services for free and even pay to publish.", "f6_no_assessments": 12, "f6_rating": 4.944444444444445, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 9699, "q0": "This proposal addresses one of the most challenging problems in academic publishing. As the team describes, the current system is rigged in a way that prevents the ownership of the scientists\u2019 own work. What comes on top of it, is that citizens who actually paid for the research (with their tax money) are often prevented to read the work due to enormously high subscription costs of the journal. Additionally, the peer-review system creates no costs for the journals as scientists are currently doing it on a voluntary basis and are not getting paid for the work they are doing for the journal. The team is fully aware of these problems and outlines them clearly in the beginning. With their proposal, they want to break this unfair publishing cycle and instead make it more transparent, fair and accessible. The proposers want to develop a decentralized academic publishing platform which will use a treasury system to cover costs for editing and publishing. As decentralized science (DeSci) is becoming more and more popular, this proposal really hits the nerve of time and tries to solve one of the biggest issues in academic publishing. The team seems to have thought through the treasury system, nonetheless the proposers are aware of potential challenges (e.g. required social traction) that could impede the implementation of their dApp. What is currently missing is information on the peer-review process (are reviewers rewarded? If so, how much? Is this already accounted for in the treasury system), as this will be an important aspect of a peer-reviewed academic publishing platform. Overall, this proposal aligns well with the challenge. It not only brings a novel dApp to the Cardano blockchain but rather introduces a new ecosystem that, if successful, would attract thousands of people to Cardano and make scientific publishing more accessible to tax payers and give scientists back their ownership rights.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal highlights a link to their website, where one can find additional information on the team and consultants. The team has knowledge in various fields including blockchain development, software engineering, science communication and several advisors who have experience as CEOs. Most of the team members have worked in science and are therefore aware of the publishing issues. Importantly, it is stated that external partners will do the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d.  Due to privacy reasons the team did not state who these external collaborators will be, thereby making it difficult to assess their respective competencies.\nThe team has outlined a detailed plan for executing their proposal. Their plan, which is separated into 3 phases, describes the milestones and deliverables. A timeframe is indicated for the first three phases. The amount of work specified for each phase is feasible, if experienced teams/companies can be hired. The requested budget is reasonable given the workload that will be necessary (within the first 9-12 months), although I am certain that the requested funds won\u2019t be sufficient. First, the budget required for blockchain integration should be increased given the scarcity of good blockchain developers. Additionally, more funds should be allocated for marketing and educational purposes as the success of this dApp will strongly depend on the social traction and number of users. \nOverall, the team provides a detailed breakdown of their plan and requested budget. In additional, the experience the team has, provides them with a solid foundation to tackle the challenges. Unfortunately, it is not clear which company or companies will perform the heavy lifting (as stated so by the team), making it difficult to determine whether this plan is feasible. However, I am confident that with the right collaborators, the execution of this proposal is doable.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As described in the proposal, the work of this project can be split into four phases. The first three phases will be covered in this proposal. Every phase has an allocated time of three months. For each phase, the team has provided several indicators based on which the progress will be measured. Indicators in phase 1 are github commits, number of blog articles, the catalyst progress report and public presentations. For each category, the team has provided clear aims. The range of github commits is quite wide (which the team has stated as well), but reasonable and a good indicator for the technical progress of the project. Number of blog articles on Medium are important due raise awareness for the project and increase social traction. Depending on how well this goes, the team might consider increase the number of articles per months (e.g 2-3) and providing a thorough FAQ. Public presentations will also be a decisive indicator and potentially even a success metric. This is because in the scientific world, knowledge is often shared and presented during talks and presentation (seomtimes even at large conferences (> 500 people)). Following these presentations will be useful to audit the progress in a non-technical manner (in contrast to Github commits). In phase 2, a new indicator is introduced which are the number of academics/institutions expressing interest. While in principle this is a good metric to assess the overall progress and success of the project, the aims stated here is quite vague. What does it mean \u201c1 new institution in talks with our team\u201d? This could imply so many different things, starting from general interest up to really interested in using PubWeave. It would have been good if the team had provided a more precise aim for this indicator. In phase 3 emphasis is put on new researchers signing up and the number of preprints uploaded. While both metrics are useful to assess the success of the project, the latter is the decisive one, as this will determine whether researcher actually want to use PubWeave or not. Without any preprints uploaded in that phase, PubWeave will most likely fail.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3084", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1338, "q0": "The problem statement chosen recognizes the fact that academic publishing industry is affected by its centralized nature because of which only a few number of journal which publish these academic research works are solely beniifited for works of millions of scientists who provide insights of all their work for free sometimes even pay inplace of actually getting the fruits of it. The solution proposed is to create an ecosystem which can host a platform for publishing scholary research paper in a democratized decentralized way with provision for peer-review and funding by treasury  in a democratic way for long term sustainability. The platform \"PubWeave\"that will bedeveloped through this proposal will help bring one of the key paerts of  \"DeSci\" movement and help cardano become a go to blockchain as such a platform will bring n number of academias onboard as it becomes a portal which is decentraized, permissionless and censorshi resistant in nature and boost cardano in the related communities.

They have provided clear details regarding timeline for each of the phases which can be key point in measuring the progress of the proposal as they advance from one phase to the next (3 months a phase).

Albert\u2019s idea and writing is always impressive, enjoyable and easy to understand. He often makes relevant analogy to open our mind. This kind of project with serious impact to world through resolving tough and real issues on a grand scale is still rare in Cardano ecosystem and community. Albert is always thinking forward and holistically and it is evident in the highly integrated but decentralized ecosystem he is trying to build through the series of proposal he has written in Catalyst Funds.\n\nHis proposal is educating and exciting readers\u2019 thought through the variety of information he provided about the academic publishing industry. This proposal explains clearly how the advantages and benefits of blockchain and cryptocurrency could empower weaker-positioned stakeholders over the exploitative actors and middlemen. This idea can be a multi-billion-dollar worth when we realize that global publishing market size is roughly a hundred billion USD. Project Catalyst must take part in this grand initiative, sending the message to the world that Cardano blockchain technology is transforming the world into a much better place slowly but surely.

Attention and traction of the project are high and maintained through its life cycle since the expectation will be absolutely high. The team is really living the value of crypto and blockchain. Metrics are also really detailed and open while also being quantifiable. A testament to their devotion to this proposal and dedication to the Cardano ecosystem. Although the one or two-liner weekly updates in their website is concise we may want to see more solid updates such as Twitter or Medium blog posts and open AMA sessions so we have more conviction about the team and project. Lastly, I must also attest that this Fund 9 proposal is much more developed compared to the Fund 8 version and the Intellart team is showing some real and promising progresses and result with their funded proposals, especially through the Github repo and commits they made.

As we know, the content creation industry might face a sad truth when the benefits or profits created always belongs to a groups of people at the top because of the centralized control system. One of the industry we might rarely think of is the scientific publishing industry, in which big journals take most of the profits generated from scientists' work. Currently, there is no mechanism that scientists can claim their ownership and profits from their published research. Therefore, the proposer would like to create PubWeave, a full-stack decentralized peer-review academic publishing platform on Cardano blockchain. Their ecosystem is comprised of 3 main components: Veritheum, PanDao and PubWeave which will be run parallel. PubWeave is the subject of this proposal and contains parts that will have to be integrated with the other 2. The core technology is OpenScienceNFT Marketplace that allows the author to associate an NFT to their published academic article. In fact, this is an on-going project, it means they are successful in Fund 6 and 7, and the MVP is being deployed (link provided for community checking). This somehow shows the proposer's seriousness and ability in implementing this project. If successfully, their solution could bring a lot of positive benefits for scientists, publishers, the academic publishing industry, as a result, help onboard new people and increase the adoption of Cardano blockchain. I highly appreciate the proposer's effort for giving more information about the background of the academic publishing process for those unfamiliar, and clearly explain their idea and identify some risks and giving solution for mitigating these risks. In a nutshell, I would like to give a full mark for this park because of the details it provides. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of this proposal is very high. As we know, this project is is built upon the previous funded proposals, so I am more convinced about the implementing ability of this proposal with some proof of works shown by the author. Regarding their roadmap, the plan will last for beyond 9 months, divided into 4 phrases, with 3 months for each phrase, except Phrase 4 is not clear about the timeline. I think, it is quite detailed about what activities would be done in each phrase, in which I could have a better understanding of the flow of works. For example, their main focus for Phrase 1 is building: UI, backkend, Plutus development, constant creation of educational content as a form of marketing and outreach. My only suggestion is that the proposer should add information of who will be in charge of which tasks. Next, considering their budget, I think, the required cost is reasonable for professionals. These costs will cover Plutus smart contract engineering, Cardano blockchain integration, SmartWeave smart contract engineering, DevOps, UI/UX development, Backkend development, Blog/Education/Marketing/Meetings. I know exactly how many weeks, how many hours per week they could spend on each task, and it is calculated based on hourly rate, ranging from $40 to $80 for technical and non-technical works, so the total required project's expense is $214,800 is correctly calculated. Finally, speaking of their team, I am impressed about the team members for variety of experience in Bioinformatics, Python, JS, Big Data, ML, AI, Blockchain, Plutus Pioneers, fluent language spoken with Linkedin link for community reference. Moreover, many of those members have published peer-reviewed scientific articles, with some examples via provided link, showing their deep understanding and capacity to execute this project. Besides, they also consult other advisors and outsource some parts of the work from software development companies, and recruit more Haskell and Plutus progammers for the future project development that shows their seriousness and broad vision.

Additionally, in their official website, they have a separate part for weekly updates of the project in a succinct manner ( intellart.ca/#/weeklyUpdate), so community could track what they have finished, when they have finished it.

However, the solution is very cleaver in the sense that the parts are independent from each other and, should one fail, it will not affect the functionality of the others. And if they all succeed, which I believe the will, they will create a strong and self-sustaining ecosystem which can grow in time.\n \nIt seems that the team has managed to solve all technical issues and has thought seriously about potential challenges that might occur and set up a plan that would allow them time to fix any bugs. \n\nOne final point on impact \u2013 the team is multilingual and already plans to expand their blog and comms activities to French and Spanish which are native languages for some of the members, which is an absolute plus, as between English, French and Spanish, they will target markets of millions of native speakers. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is very experienced and part of the academic world, which gives them an advantage, as they understand how this works. They are also most likely to have the networks needed to promote the solution and attract new people to Cardano. Thirdly, they have part of the technical skills to create and maintain the infrastructure of the system.\nAs mentioned before, this solution is part of a triad and the other pieces of the puzzle are already in place, one up and running, and the other one close to. So the team have already demonstrated that they can implement their solutions. \nThe project has a 4 phase implementation plan which is very detailed. It is clear what actions will be taken at each phase and how feedback will be gathered. It is my understanding, however, that a significant part of the implementation, especially UI/UX and Haskell development, will be externalized. I think this poses a risk which might not be completely under the control of the core team. So they will have to be very careful that they reach their milestones. \nThe budget is also clearly divided based on the implementation plan and seems to have taken into account increases in prices for software development. \nIt is at this point that I would like to raise 2 issues and give some constructive feedback, which will also explain the score I have given for this criterion. \nThe first one relates to the budget. I am slightly concerned by one of the statements in the proposal, i.e \u2018additional funding will be scaling linearly with the work. The amounts we ask for are not enough to saturate the workforce of our collaborators\u2019. Despite having identified a potential challenge which can have implications on the feasibility of the project, I have not understood how the proposer might prepare for this. I would have welcomed more clarity on this or perhaps, they could have increased their initial ask? I am not sure from the proposal how this issue would be solved, should it arise. They do mention wanting to attract software developers to the project, but it is not very clear if this is part of the solution. \nThe second one relates to social traction for the project, which the proposer very well identifies from the beginning, as a potential challenge. I liked the fact that that they have added a comms person to the team, who already has a blog and that they started Twitter accounts. They have also hired a person to write articles and deal with community engagement. However, I would have liked to see a bit more on their comms plan and how they would consider to attract people. The idea is very good, but it needs audience in order to work (like all ideas, but this even more so) and I would encourage a bit more detail on that.\nIt can seem a bit harsh to take on point off because of these 2 issues, but I believe that this can be an incentive to the team to think about how to plan for total success. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap is very clear and the proposer used specific  KPIs at each phase to track success. They have and will continue to publish weekly updates and offer monthly reports on their progress, making is extremely easy and timely for anyone to check the implementation.  \nI really see no issues in this category, which is I believe they deserve a full score. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3891", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14746, "q0": "\"As a person working in academic fields, I understand that the process of publishing journal articles is the cumbersome, time-consuming, costing and suffering process. I agree with the proposers that we urgently need a decentralized scientific platform. As I understand, the project was about associate the NFT to the already published peer-reviewed article. The articles are published in PubWeave, a full-stack decentralized peer-review academic publishing platform. \nIn the proposal, the proposers explained clearly the mechanisms of publishing. The greatest benefits by using the blockchain technology were cost reduction for both the researchers and readers, transparent copyrights, and higher incomes for the researchers. In terms of the risks, the proposers already addressed well and had the in-detail strategic plan to mitigate the risks. \nThe success of this project could gain great attraction in the scientific community, and I firmly believe a great number of researchers would use this platform instead of the traditional platform. This solution is well aligned with the challenge setting.\n\"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\"The project's detailed roadmap was presented, along with the amount of time required for each job procedure. From my perspective, it would be more satisfying if the proposers were given an actual due date. It was really detailed and precise in terms of the budget. I just have one bit of feedback: the budget should be in line with the task procedure/phase for easy following. The more easy-to-follow the proposal, the higher feasibility of the project. \nThe human resources comprised of several experienced professionals in terms of blockchain and academic fields, these are people with \u201cskin in the game\u201d, having essential skills & knowledge for Cardano project implementation.

Moreover, blog articles were provided for updates and educational purposes. The provided KPIs/metrics were sufficient. One more good point was that the KPIs/metrics are specific, in-line with the roadmap set above and have a clear timeline to accomplish.
