Best practices include auditing of code.", "f6_no_assessments": 5, "f6_rating": 4.066666666666666, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 6677, "q0": "NewM will be a decentralized music ecosystem, a marketplace where artists can monetize and take control of their work. The team behind the project has great development plans and they are betting big on Catalyst funding, since this is one of their five Fund 9 proposals funding the core of the project, for a total of 480k USD, and an additional proposal seeking funding for an open source project that will indirectly benefit NewM. \n\nThis proposal seeks funding for hiring a third party company to perform an audit of their smart contract developed. As a reminder, this challenge is all about supporting the creation of new decentralized applications and integrations between them, so there is a very good connection between the proposal and the challenge since we have a good example of supporting a key feature for a dapp: ensuring security of the underlying code. Let\u2019s go through the project in a bit more detail. \n\nFor a better understanding of the subject it\u2019s necessary first of all to put things into a wider context - and that is to understand the great potential of the music royalties market. More than a decade ago the industry was suffering due to extensive piracy, but in the last years the industry has begun to grow again, due mainly to online streaming and its advantages compared to the old distribution channels: convenience, personalization, accessibility. Therefore the music industry is generating constant revenue every year, and there is even a school of thought that considers the royalties associated with it to be an asset class of its own. Barron\u2019s estimates that US annual royalty revenues to be over 40 billion USD, while the proposers estimate the overall market for at over 1 trillion USD (a bit optimistic let\u2019s say). The main idea being that the music royalties market has a great potential to tap into, and gaining even a small market share from the overall pie is going to be a very lucrative business in the long run. \n\nThere is also a very good scalability potential behind the project, since after the development phase, the marginal cost of servicing an additional artist, an additional NFT or an additional smart contract are negligible in comparison to the high margins ubiquitous among the industry. \n\nWhy is a third party audit important? This tactical decision of going for a third party audit of their code is an excellent choice,and let me explain why. IOG has recently released a video outlining the future of Cardano dapps, offering details regarding how their security would influence the way in which the dapps will be displayed on the upcoming dapp store. This highlights Cardano\u2019s increased focus towards security, and having a dapp already externally audited is definitely a competitive advantage over other dapps which will soon have to compete for \u201cprime space\u201d within the dapp store. \n\nIn conclusion, NewM has excellent development prospects, can be a tremendous asset for the Cardano community in the long run, and this proposal is very well aligned with the challenge since third party audits are key components of ensuring a dapp\u2019s security.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A first excellent point relevant for the proposal\u2019s feasibility is that the proposal is complemented by a white paper in which the concept and business model are presented in great detail, and the writers go to great lengths to ensure that no details are left out. There are extensive descriptions of the functionalities of the marketplace, the utilities of the token they wish to launch as well as how the DAO accompanying the marketplace will function. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about the team. Ryan, the CEO, has a very deep understanding of the music industry, can articulate extremely well the value proposition that NewM can bring and he is also in charge of developing partnerships. Florian, the finance guy, was instrumental at the beginning, since he was the one that shaped the business model. Andrew, the CTO and security guy, has a long track record of delivering open source tools to the Cardano community, amongst other the development of a Cardano node CLI tool (command line interface). Including advisors, they have onboarded in excess of 30 members, very diverse in their backgrounds and a fairly geographically distributed team. All of them are presented on their website with links to their profiles (and what music they listen to, of course). So there\u2019s a solid team behind the project. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about funding sources and financial viability. Right now the team self-funds the development of NewM, and they are securing additional funding through their own stakepool. A strength of NewM\u2019s business model (once it launches) is that it will not be reliant on just one stream for revenues - from the beginning the marketplace will focus on two separate sources of revenue: a streaming component trying to give established streaming companies a run for their money and a marketplace component focused on fractionalizing and distributing intellectual property rights as NFTs. In the whitepaper we are also offered a breakdown of their token distribution, which will begin modestly in 2022 and will continue until 2027. In conclusion, in addition to Catalyst, NewM will have various revenue streams, another excellent indication of the project\u2019s good feasibility prospects. \n\nThe roadmap is split into two milestones: (1) selecting the third party audit partner and (2) performing the audit complete and implementing any potential recommendations. A worrying point is the timeliness of the proposal, or rather lack of it. If the project is still under development and it will take a while for the code to be complete (we know this for a fact given the other proposals for funding) would it not have made more sense to ask for the third party audit funds at a later date, perhaps in Fund 10 or even 11? \n\nThe budget \u2026 it is what it is, since the entire amount will go to the third party auditor. And sadly this is where the actual details end regarding the roadmap and the budget. From my point of view, there is definitely a missed opportunity here to turn this proposal into an excellent one, by offering more details regarding the selection criteria of the third party auditor, since they will be the key actor of this proposal. Does NewM have the internal competence in order to run a solid due diligence procedure? How will they avoid potential conflicts of interest and ensure full objectivity of the auditor? What happens if the breadth of their code is too extensive for the allocated budget? Will the team cover out of pocket any excess funds or will they opt for a \u201clight\u201d or limited scope auditing process? Will the selection process be transparent towards the community? Answering at least some of these questions would have definitely helped. \n\nConsidering the paramount importance of the third party audit for ensuring the security of the project, but given the lack of details with regards to the auditor selection process and the lack of timeliness, I can only offer four stars in the feasibility area. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team is in the right spot to ensure full auditability of the project. They have already set-up community engagement tools (Discord, Telegram, Twitter, etcetera) and are frequently present on podcasts (Learn Cardano for instance). The founders are making themselves available within these channels and are actively engaging in discussions with the community when being queried regarding the details of the project (I have firsthand experience on this). We have therefore good reasons to believe that the Cardano community will be in a good position to interact with the team, as they are connected to the ecosystem in more than one way. \n\nWe are also informed that the team pledges to offer bi-weekly performance indicator updates and weekly progress summary via twitter. A great addition to the proposal would have been perhaps to add some sort of feedback loop to the entire process valuable to the Cardano developers community. An example of an external feedback loop is a pledge from the team to share in a meaningful way the findings of the auditor with the community, for instance as a summary of findings or tips for future development teams. Nevertheless, we have good auditability prospects for the project, but not perfect.

The detailed plan consists of 2 milestones but some amount of work would go into each phase and it is recommended to add phases or increments to the detailed map where the milestone is the goal of each phase. Furthermore, time estimations should be included in this plan. \nThe budget is not existing, only a promise that claims \u201ceverything will be spent on the auditing company\u201d. A suggestion is to connect with at least 2-3 firms and get an estimated cost for the auditing. The claimed budget is not credible since there are no facts or hard numbers to back it up. \nIt is stated in the proposal that 2 persons from projectNEWM will work on things related to this proposal, but the budget will solely go towards funding of the 3rd party company. Will the people from projectNEWM work for free? This could be clarified to avoid confusion.\n\nAs mentioned, an audit is feasible as long as funds exist, but the proposal fails to meet the expected standard in terms of feasibility.

But the milestones are rather sparse, there is more information required that goes on before each milestone. For example an estimated timeline for phases and selection criteria, these metrics could then be used to audit the project. Furthermore, a set of KPIs with real metrics could be used to increase the auditability. An example could be \u2018Five 3rd parties consulated\u2019 etc. \n\nThe team will share their progress on Twitter, which is a suitable medium given the nature of the proposal.

They will try to elicit multiple offers to ensure that they get the best offer in the market and that there is no lack of resource.

The team might want to share the criteria for selecting their auditing company or any detail they could provide. It will definitely be a good practice for other protocols who have to go through the audit stage. Also they might come back to request audit of new set of smart contracts.

There are many projects that are building right now and we need to make sure that security measures are taken into consideration. ProjectNEWM is requesting funds from Catalyst to hire a team that can audit their code. This can have a huge impact on the overall growth of the Cardano ecosystem. Security is one of the most important features on Cardano and allows the blockchain to be distinguishable between others because of this focus on security. The proposal suggests that if in the future there are 1 trillion dollars of IP rights, the project needs to make sure that their coding is secure and safe for all users. Especially for new users to the ecosystem. This proposal could have a global impact by keeping their project secure and preventing any series of unfortunate events that could bring negativity into the ecosystem.

This leads to more openness and transparency from the team and will lead to a higher rate of success for this proposal. The budget breakdown shows that all of the requested funds will go to the auditing team. There can still be more information on who this team is and exactly what they will be doing and where the funds will be allocated specifically.

When a team is open with their community, it helps build trust between people. When there is trust in a project and community, there is room for accountability. By allowing the community to be aware of this proposal. There can be an increased amount of accountability that will ensure that the team completes this proposal in a timely manner.

Smart contract auditing is critically important to give peace of mind for application users and developers. These audits should be a standard in the DeFi industry. As far as the proposal's robustness, I would like to see a more detailed as to how you will begin to contact a 3rd party to conduct this type of audit. As for the impact to the Cardano ecosystem all I see is a general statement that states project NEWM will enhance the ecosystem. Why is this true? A long explanation is not necessary but a brief description of what project NEWM is and how it intends to operate should be considered. Finally, the risk stated is a fair one, but the mitigation statement doesn't seem to be clear.
