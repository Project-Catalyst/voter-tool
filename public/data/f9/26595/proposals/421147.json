The team plans to build a dApp with digital identities of farmers in Ghana to certify them to incorporate carbon removing farming with biochar (a soil fertilizer to remove carbon). The proposal also gives evidence of the lack of transparency in carbon credits in the world and low income of the farmers from a developing country. The team intends to tackle these problems by building dApps on Cardano blockchain making the carbon removal in the environment transparent and traceable. Hence, the farmers can create carbon credits. The team also will add a feature of earning and selling carbon credits marketplace in the dApp producing income for the farmers. The dApps can slowly scale globally starting with Ghana as it incentivizes farmers, corporations, and NGOs to help the sustain the environment and increasing carbon credits with transparency and verifications.

This is important area of expertise for them to build a suitable dAppss for the farmers to lower the carbon in the environment. However, my concern is that the team do not have Plutus/Marlowe or Haskell coding language to build on Cardano blockchain. With all the hacks happening on many dApps in Ethereum, Binance and Solana, it is important to have high security to build on Cardano blockchain. The timeline is laid out over 5 months and enough information was broken down. The milestones are realistic and achievable for the team to deliver this project because they have the skills and experience in blockchain development including relevant partnerships to work together. The team have broken down the budget of where the funds are allocated for this project. Considering the expertise of the team, the amount requested is more than enough for them to execute this project. The success rate of this proposal is medium to high because they have the experience, but they need to consider the high security of the dApps to avoid hacks and loss of funds.

The updates will include team\u2019s status, number of farmers onboarded, carbon credit creation, dApp usage (marketplace usage by volume) and DIDs of the farmers.

However from a practical standpoint, it is unlikely that a privately developed solution can bring a dysfunctional market back to functioning levels, and no matter how  brilliant the solution and the implementation will be, the fact will remain that the ecosystem will simply not be right for such a solution to flourish, let alone one that increases the complexity level by proposing a blockchain solution. \n\nFor all the reasons above, and many more, I shall maintain neutral on the possible impact of this proposal at this point in time - so three stars only.

Will it be sold at any point in time? Will the Ghanian government recognize that NFT as a right, and can it be transferable?\n- who actually will buy those carbon credits?\n- can the solution be scalable in other countries? Can it at least be scalable within the entire Ghana?\n- how big is the carbon market in Ghana? Is it liquid? Is it regulated?\n- What are the hourly rates charged for the proposal\u2019s activities?\n\nThere are way too many questions than answers concerning this project, and it is not clear at all what their end game is.

Improving this system would benefit these farmers but also the global fight against climate change. The potential of this project is immense. The initial certification is achieved through the blockchain and its inherent transparency and is based on community validation. Continuous validation is achieved the same way. Some more information on how that works would be useful as there seems to be potential for some people to band together to fraudulently register a non-operational carbon offset program and some safeguards against fraud may be necessary.\n\nThe authors evidently have detailed knowledge of the problem and expertise from working in that field. They provide many links for supporting information to validate their claims about the state of the problem and why they think their solutions are promising. Also, the authors have already involved several stakeholders ranging from the farmers and communities they want to help, to international companies and NGOs. The number and varying levels of influence of the interested parties is encouraging because this project could have a positive impact on many tiers of the global agriculture system if well-implemented. This project is strongly tied to the Cardano ecosystem and is well-aligned with the challenge settings. While the authors acknowledge that there is risk in the scalability of the project as well as risk in its sustainability, the authors appear to have sensible plans in place to mitigate these risks and will have help from another stakeholder to achieve this. The project also involves team members who are locals (in Ghana) where the project is to take place which is also encouraging because that will help overcome language and cultural hurdles as well as ensure that the project actually takes the farmers\u2019 needs into account properly.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "WhatIf Foods have committed to buying a number of carbon removal offsets from this program, but the authors do not specify how much or how that will be determined. This would be useful to know as the buy-in from companies will be very important for the success of this project. \nThe timetable with the goals they aim to achieve is detailed and spans over 5 months. However, some more information on how they plan to collaborate with the farmers in developing the app, specifically for the UX and UI will be useful to have as significant issues can arise if the app is not precisely targeted enough. It is not entirely clear who exactly will be using the app \u2013 will it be team members on the ground or will farmers be able to use it themselves? Will the app be in English, or will they employ a translator to make it accessible in the farmers\u2019 home language? There was nothing in the budget specifically regarding this, but it could be under the \u201cWada\u201d section (the local team) of the budget but clarification on how this will be achieved would be good to know. Also, this issue could present a significant issue for scalability in future as each region of farmers will need to be able to understand and use the app properly so other local teams need to be recruited for this and it will not be possible for team members to provide the necessary assistance if the project scales up. How will this be addressed in future?\nThe app is going to be designed for Android smartphones and while there is a lack of smartphones in the areas the app is designed to be used in, as smartphones become more accessible, the scalability of the project will improve. \nThe budget is detailed and includes both pay rates for team member but also other costs such as infrastructure. The project is building on a project that has already received funding from Fund8 and so has already accomplished WHAT and the team members have already received funds from Fund7 so they appear to be reliable.\nThe team members and their duties are all clearly delineated and a detailed breakdown of what they have achieved already and what they are planning is given. The team\u2019s experience and expertise is impressive and the project as a whole seems to be well-planned out and has driven people behind it.\nThe project intends to continue applying for funding via Catalyst in future rounds as they have more ideas for different dapps that all focus on agriculture and conservation.
