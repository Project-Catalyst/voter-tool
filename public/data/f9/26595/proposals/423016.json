They strive to lead the change towards a more open employment model and to help their members map their skills while discovering opportunities and making new connections. Goodwall has over 2 million users and is active in over 150 countries. I have actually joined the platform to understand it better - and there is definitely an interesting blend of job board / social media / course directory, focused on students and young professionals (16 to 24 years old). Goodwall have had one proposal funded in Fund 8 and have now come back in Fund 9 with six proposals totalling over 650k USD. \n\nTheir value proposition in this one is for Goodwall to create an ID management tool through Atala Prism. Further, these digital IDs will present multiple use cases of what they can actually enable: (1) access to better services and perhaps goods, (2) store user data and simplify hiring / admission processes, (3) validating Goodwall\u2019s skill verification system (see their other proposal) and (4) verify information and create a safer social media environment. \n\nThere are many positive aspects of this proposal. Goodwall has 2 million users, they are targeting an excellent cohort (young, educated, worldwide audience), and the community should support them to build their DID solution on Cardano! Definitely five stars for potential impact.   ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Goodwall seems to have a fully fledged team, and they are super transparent about it. Their CEO is Taha Bawa, a Forbes 30 under 30 and Global Shaper (and that means a lot). Their website shows 65+ employees (all with Goodwall accounts of course, so easy to interact directly), and Linkedin shows 80+. I think their HQ is in Madrid, but they seem to be geographically distributed throughout Spain, Philippines, Switzerland and many other locations.  In the proposal itself they have included a list of management team and also three team members who will be leading this project as well as taking the Atala Prism pioneer course. So you can\u2019t really ask for anything more in terms of team transparency.  \n\nWhat is their plan? A 34 weeks timeline, divided in three main parts: preparation (requirements, user stories, architecture), execution (smart contracts, front end, back end, QA) and results (track users with a DID, marketing plan execution). Budgetwise, the project will necessitate 1.500+ hours, with hourly rates between 50 for QA and 100 development (most of them). A definite plus of this proposal (compared to their other ones) is that this one is a logical step, and a clear enabler for all the other ones - so it definitely has a more timely characteristic attached to it. However, a 150k USD proposal should have definitely come before the voters with a much better problem definition scope of necessary work and demonstrate without a doubt that for an Atala Prism integration with their systems all the budgeted work is sufficient, and necessary, for project completion. \n\nWith an excellent team and a good but not excellently detailed plan (but with a proposal that can enable many more projects on Goodwall\u2019s platform), I shall err on the optimistic side and offer the full five stars for this proposal\u2019s feasibility.

However, an excellent proposal should have included: \n\n- a demonstrated capacity to interact with the Cardano community (already set-up Telegram / Discord / Twitter social media accounts) and why not, a few video blogs explaining in detail how they want to interact with the ecosystem\n- a better explanation of what success will mean for the project and some clear set targets (number of DIDs created after one year, number of Atala Prism developers).", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2824", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 579, "q0": "This proposal effectively addresses the challenge and is a perfect use case for Atala Prism and Cardano.

This is a valuable large budget proposal, and one of several proposals by Goodwall. I would suggest that Goodwall try to improve on the auditability KPIs in future proposals, and make it easy for the community to measure the success of each funded proposal by Goodwall.

The proposed solution is to add to the current identification front end an encryption in the blockchain of identity credentials. Several classical DiD use cases are mentionned (education credentials, vote validation).\nThe problem statement (lack of legally recognised identification for millions of youth) is clear, but the description of the solution does not explain how this specific problem will be solved by adding an encryption of the centralized Goodwall ID into the blockchain. \nHow would this ID become a \"legally recognised identification\" ? does the recognition of this identification rely on GoodWall ? this legal questions should be elaborated.\nIn the risk analysis, the proposer mentions a \"lack of information or resistance by users\" risk, and plans to create a users guide.

I am suprised to see a marketing plan being developped at the very first stage of the project. For a more convincing proposal, I recommend to create user stories and use it in the proposal to provide a better vision of the product. \nRessources and budget needed for the implementation are provided, but as the team does not demonstrate having experience in blockchain or smart contract development my confidence in the accuracy of the budget estimation is limited.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Goodwall claims 2 proposals funded in Fund 8 but I had to look which one they are as they were not named in this proposal.

A live dashboard will be set, and a full report is promised at the end of implementation.\nWhile the deliverables and success definition are clear, the proposal lacks essentials details about how this will be achieved and how the community will monitor it.

That is made possible by adapting Cardanos Atala Prism technology to the proposer's established partner network Goodwall. This integration allows to reach more people and for the people to reach more institutions or organizations they wouldn't be otherwise able to reach. This will add value to the Cardano ecosystem by uniting the two networks, and their userbases, presenting secure and privacy-preserving identity solutions, and bringing new user feedback in the process. This also aligns well with the challenge of integrating successful existing services with Cardano, which makes for the average user the experience more straightforward.\n\nThe key metrics for this proposal are based on how many digital IDs are created, testing these use cases, and tracking related user data. This aligns directly with the challenge goals since getting more users through Cardano-provided technology to reach our community directly or indirectly is the goal.\n\nSince this is a large-scale project the first goal is the adaption of the hardware and development side. This means, that the extraction of visible success metrics, that align with the challenge may take months to reveal themselves. The fact that the project could be scalable for the future is not yet to be seen. In addition,  it would be beneficial to see future details past the 8-month mark.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Proposers partner Goodwall has already proven itself by building a large community in advance of this proposal.

For most jobs, there is a full team member list and they certainly seem experienced and capable of most of the tasks outlined. Questions do arise on the technological implementation side. This is the most important category for this proposal since most of the budget weighs on the tech side. While info on leaders of the technological development team is outlined we could also know more about the rest of the team members to identify them and raise voters' confidence.\n\nThe budget categories are transparent as are the resources needed for the work. The high costs of integrating this project into a decentralized platform and everything that comes with it seem rightfully justified. \n\nThe risks for this project seem to be well measured and thought out. For example, some new or existing Goodwall users may not see the merit of using a digital ID. To counter this issue a full guide on this topic, for the general user will be made.

It would help to have more categories to audit. For example, process-oriented intermediate key milestone updates.\n\nThe proposer suggests that by adopting Atala Prism they can reach millions of youth around the world, but the \u201chow\u201d could use more elaboration.
