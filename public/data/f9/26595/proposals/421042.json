I might be misinterpreting the solution (the problem addressed being combating FUD spreading), but this proposal is stated to be possibly implemented in any project with an annual subscription fee. As a further functionality, the proposer states that the admin of the project that has this chat app can limit the users to what they\u2019re allowed to do. I understand the good-willed intention of limiting FUD to be spread by users and trolls, but it is my personal biased opinion that this approach might be a non constructive way of addressing those issues. Let me explain. The key question that I\u2019m asking is this: If Blockchain technology allows people the freedom of not being censored or regulated by a centralized entity, wouldn\u2019t this approach undermine that philosophy? \n\nIn my (limited) experience in contact with blockchain technology (2 years or so) and after being a PA since Fund 6, people tend to react very strongly when their options are limited in any way (even if the intention is good). From what I understand, most places where communications take place in any project are run by a set of admins that regulate the spaces through a set of rules. The difference between that approach and the one suggested in this proposal is that the participants enter the space with a code of conduct, but they are still free to do whatever. The responsibility is ultimately in their own hands, and it is up to them to choose what to do with it. I believe that choice is very important. So why am I having this philosophical monologue included in this assessment? Well, I believe that the approach of this chat-app might have the possibility of people reacting negatively, and thus ending up not using the project. I\u2019m not saying it is a bad idea, but I am raising some concerns in regards to the philosophy of it. \n\nI really like the idea of having a chat app that many different projects are using, but what will make this different than a more regulated form of Telegram, Discord? What willl make it different from its competitors, in a way that is valuable to the users? \nThe proposer is clear in stating what they want to do, but I would love to see some more details of the underlying background to the problem statement, as explained above.  \u2028\u2028The goal addresses the social media-aspect of this challenge setting, which has the potential to span over many different projects and a huge user base of potential customers/users. There is definitely some great value if the chat-app automatically can sort out bots, scammers and malicious people and take some workload off of the admins. \n\nHad the proposer included more detailed explanations on how and what they aim to do, I would be more confident in my understanding of this challenge. Overall, I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal effectively addresses this challenge.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal contains a roadmap with included milestones, set on a timeframe of 13 months (start to finish). In its current form, the roadmap does not seem to include an estimation on when the product will be rolled out to the public, which means that the proposer will need to return to Catalyst for further funding, or covering the costs by being sponsored elsewhere. It is mentioned later in the proposal that the subscription fees of the product will be used to cover the costs, but I\u2019m having trouble understanding if this will be before launch. I would suggest to make the roadmap more detailed, including this information related to the progress development. \n\u2028While speaking about budget, the proposal is asking for a total of 400 000 USD for the implementation of this product, which is quite the substantial amount (even though this challenge setting has a huge \u2019treasury\u2019). In my experience as a PA since fund 6, it is one of the largest ones that I have seen for a single fund. In order for it to be more likely to be funded, I would suggest to split the project in different stages of development, split between funds with a lower funding amount. \nI have very limited knowledge about estimated salaries for the responsibilities listed in the budget breakdown, but the salaries listed for each responsibility area seems very high. (I\u2019m from a quite developed and \u2019expensive\u2019 country, and the monthly salaries would be considered CEO-level even here). It would be highly beneficial if there was some numbers on how many team members that are planned to be included, preferably with an estimation of work hours. Having that information, we can calculate the hourly wage, workload and compare the different roles within the team. For example, how many people will be included in the Android development team, how many work hours are they expected to work, and how does their individual wages compare to the project managers salary and responsibilities? Is it realistic? \n\u2028I\u2019m also missing links that helps us verify the listed expertise of the current team member(s). What projects has the team been working on before, and where can I find proof of it? Is the expertise from education, work experience, or both?  Any information about who is in charge of the project is immensely helpful. The only information I could find was that the proposer only seems to have this project active, through Catalyst. \u2028Due to the reasons stated above, I disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "As mentioned under \u2019feasibility\u2019, the roadmap could be expanded with more info regarding important milestones.

For example, how many users/subscribers to the product will we hope to have achieved 3 months after implementation? What areas of the Cardano ecosystem will we target (community platforms for everything, or just DeFi, gaming, Catalyst, etc). \nConsider the lack of detailed information contained in this proposal, I disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2504", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5347, "q0": "The Let's make it professional proposal aims to develop a chat app that will connect to the blockchain and read the address of user to confirm that the user belongs to the community.

The proposal addressed a rather important issue today, that is every day the new projects fighting the FUD in the community chats up to levels where the FUD makes a project almost fail. it is time to have a professional way of communicating with communities. The proposal emphasized the goal of developing a chat application through which people can discuss projects of their interest together, avoiding the noise of the entire industry and focusing on communicating with those who are interested in the holder, limiting the problems of external influences. I agree with this opinion and find this to be a necessary thing. Currently, there are still cases where users want to learn, in-depth research on projects but they do not know how to connect with owners, this is very limited and it will reduce the interaction between parties. So to overcome this, the proponent has come up with a solution that is to provide functions to the project administrator about what the owner can do, and then the application can also connect refers to the user to ensure that the user accesses the correct owner. Thereby, it will increase connectivity, ensure supply and demand, increase the likelihood of success and avoid wasting time searching and choosing. By showing this reality, the impact of the problem has been emphasized.

In each month, the proponent has also allocated and identified specific tasks and tasks to facilitate monitoring and control of the progress and quality of each milestone. Regarding the budget of the project, the proponent also made a plan on how to allocate and use it, as well as the specific cost for each part. The budget is divided into 3 main parts, which are: one is to pay staff salaries; the second is to pay the fees for providing services and consulting, and the third is for other expenses. I think this part, if possible, the proponent should have a more detailed plan, such as the iOS and Android development team every year is paid $ 65,000, so how many people the team has, this payment will be divided equally for everyone or will rely on their experience and level of work completion to encourage their creativity and contribution to the common project. In addition, in my opinion, if possible, the proponent should deduct a small part of the budget or apply for additional funding to set up a risk reserve fund, because when implementing any project, it is inevitable unexpected difficulties. Or set up a reward fund to motivate outstanding individuals and groups. Regarding the team participating in the project, the proponent has also divided it into phases and clearly stated the necessary positions for each stage.

I think this part, if added, will be clear, increasing the auditability of the project.
