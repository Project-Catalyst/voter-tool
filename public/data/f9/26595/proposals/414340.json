Cardano mainnet.\n\n   The solution the team came up with to solve the problem was to remove the manual way of managing the owner's assets and it is now fixed on a device like a computer...etc instead the owner will use by smart contract, for example you need to pay some fixed amount monthly, then this way you can use smart contract with auto settlement feature of this idea developed . However, this solution says that no one but the owner will know the balance in the owner's wallet, which reminds me of the traditional banking system, but this proposal is better than it. is to keep the balance in the wallet secure, because many owners do not want their balance to be published or a second person to know about it. the examples given by the team in this presentation can easily understand this automatic feature of the suggestion, in the future this feature will bring a lot of advantages and benefits to the owner.\n\n    complexity was mentioned from the proposal team because they considered to be as focused as possible to develop the project and be ready for possible risks how to ensure the project is included safe and efficient operation. \"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\"The implementation of this project is divided into several phases, each of which will last an average of 3 to 4 months, with many clearly defined small goals in each phase.\n\n   a certain amount of spending has been provisioned for for generation, and the cloud cost, the amount spent on project development that is aggregated by each stage of the team also explains the average how much will it cost per month,\n    \n    Although there are evidences about the project developers themselves and their contributions to the development of Decentralized-Accounting, it would be better to have a presentation about themselves and the team, so that the community whether you are working with someone or are you developing this proposal on your own,\"", "q1r": 4, "q2": "\" how the community can get a glimpse of your work and progress in completing the stage of your proposal, which hasn't been covered by you in this briefing e.g. maybe you will report progress in phases of the proposal or possibly more,\n  \n    The success of the proposal will show in the number of users of this feature through smart contracts, and it gives less time consuming to the users it is very helpful to bring it to the real world .

In a large project, there will be a lot of work that needs to be done: marketing and communication, building the front-end, building the back-end,... . Breaking these tasks down will help reduce the project implementation time, helping the project to achieve better quality. For these reasons, here's my advice to you: if you can, find yourself some partners. Then provide some information about them: name, skills, profile (linkedin, telegram,...), experience,... .\nA detailed roadmap has been provided, but since working alone, this project will take quite a while to implement (15 months). Also, how do you plan to do the communication and marketing, and for how long? The budget part has been calculated, but it is still quite vague.

The proposal comes with diagrams illustrating the process of asset management. At the moment, financial management is a new area for blockchain technology. The proposer manages to utilize the characteristics of smart contracts and cloud-based services and integrate into asset management that can be used for regular payment using ADA. Smart contract is a great security as it can only be opened under certain circumstances, and the proposer will use a cloud app to manage smart contract and frontend to control the system. This proposal has the potential of putting Cardano blockchain technology at the forefront as its idea is constructed with smart contracts and cloud apps - the building blocks of blockchain technology. The proposal has a high degree of flexibility and could be utilized for various purposes and services by professionals and non-professionals. The proposer should highlight this flexibility and its contribution to expand the Cardano community and ecosystem even more by giving specific examples of the \u201cessential services layered on the Cardano blockchain\u201d elaborate on their inner workings. For example: the proposer mentions subscription fee, rental, leasing. This can be expanded into trading, shopping, booking,... The main risk is the complexity of developing such a system. Visualization does help simplify the process of developing. However, the proposer should offer more mitigation by upgrading the expertise pool, infrastructure and specifying the detailed cautionary measures that will counter security risks.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The roadmap is divided into 7 stages with time spans and activities. The procedure that the proposer goes through to set up the system is logical but can be more detailed. For example, in stage 1, the proposer could elaborate what the development environment and first tests will entail. Similarly, in stage 2, the proposer mentions testing smart contracts on Quickcheck. How will the outcome be assessed and dealt with should there be any problem? What can be anticipated during the tests on Quickcheck. What parts may be finetuned and how long will the process take? In stage 3, the proposer should actually describe more details about the cloud architecture and environment. The more specific, the higher feasibility the proposal will have. For example, during the construction of cloud architecture and environment, what tools will be used and what does that choice have to offer (visuals, security, familiarity, \u2026). What types of cloud environment will be used? In stage 6, the proposer could be more specific about the steps it takes to build the frontend. In stage 7, what conclusion may be made after alpha testing? There are many questions that can be raised throughout the roadmap. Answering these will allow for a high rating of feasibility. The budget breakdown is too general and requires more specification where those budgets will go as each stage comprises different steps, procedures for various purposes. I understand that maybe the technicalities are too minute, but it is the clear analysis of one\u2019s budget that gives transparency and feasibility for the proposal, so a minute breakdown is essential for funding to be granted. The proposer must account for these amounts more specifically, for ex: unforeseen expenses is too vague. From what is indicated, it seems that only Quirin Schlegel will be working on this project. This raises the question of whether one person could handle the complexity of such a system that manages assets - a very sensitive matter that requires an advanced system and utmost assurance for people to entrust their assets to. The lack of human resources in this proposal can be the biggest obstacle to productivity and feasibility as the project of one person may take much longer than the intended time span provided in the roadmap. A long-term project usually needs a pool of expertise and long working experiences, which is applicable to a project with this kind of ambition.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The auditability is transparent due to the nature of this system.

The proposal has not yet given the results and analyzed whether it is really suitable and synchronized with the KPI/ Key metrics of the challenge.
