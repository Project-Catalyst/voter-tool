Alexander has contributed immensely to Cardano NFT ecosystem and dApp by authoring the wallet. Its my favout wallet too. Therefore the proposal to update it to manifest  v3 sounds quite important. It is likely the Nami wallet team will also be undertaking the same, however an alternate solution is always a good option in this important area. The purpose of the proposal is well articulated in the justification as follows \u2018impact that ADA holders will benefit from this project is ensuring Nami wallet remains functional, but also providing open source opportunities for new wallets to fork. The proposal is also for refactoring and auditing the code for security. With these additional security audits and the open source nature of the Nami will ensure that the Cardan ecosystem has strong and diverse wallet support.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "THe proposal is from Abraham Zawodni more than 12 years experience in project management and Benjamin Zawodni who is a senior software engineer with more than 15 years in development.

The proposers want to fork and improve the Nami wallet to be compatible with the new standards chrome has put calling it Lucem. Nami has been an integral part and has a proven beneficial role in the development and adoption of the Cardano ecosystem. This leads me to believe this is a necessary effort that needs to be spent to continue the growth and enable other wallets to build on top of this open-source effort impact that ADA holders will benefit from this project is to ensure the Nami wallet remains active, but also provides an open-source opportunity for new wallets to fork (with SPOs being the main beneficiaries of the opportunity).

It is essential to hire a web development security agency to review the code.

Although the budget requirement is not high, it is necessary to interpret the amount more carefully.

The current phase which is phase 2(Fund9) is all aboout validating and auditing the security of the new Lucem Wallet.

In all these aspects, the proposal is a very close fit for the challenge and matches its goals and KPIs closely.

However, in general it would be preferable to either request funding for several parts with all the detail necessary to assess them on their own, or alternatively submit a larger proposal.
