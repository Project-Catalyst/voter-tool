The proponent argues very well how necessary this is, how super important Ukraine is (\"Ukraine is one of the leading exporters of agricultural produce including #1 in Sunflower Oil (46% of Global exports) and #3 in Rapeseed (20 % of Global exports). Many of the world's major international corporations, particularly in the food sector depend on these supplies\u201d); therefore it is essential that we help in its recovery in economic terms. But humanitarian aid is also needed. The Dapp idea is excellent, and it fits in with many of the fundamentals present in the challenge; works with the development of use cases (cited in the fundamentals of the challenge): \"Nation governance systems - New governance systems for nation-states + Environment - Solutions that help to solve environmental issues\", and also achieves the specific objectives of \u201ccreation or improvement of different Dapps, products, and integrations that provide value to the Cardano community and wider ecosystem + integrations with other existing services, products, and protocols that improve the end-user experience whether that's giving the user more options or making something easier to use that benefits the wider ecosystem.\u201d This would all be done in different ways, but the main objective, as I understand it, would be to work towards the recovery of land contaminated by mines and explosives released in war. affected in the country, according to the proponent. He makes the problem very clear: with so much land compromised, agriculture is also the most affected, which is an important source of income for the country (that is, the economy is directly affected). In addition to working on land demining, Dapp would have other features such as mapping land, marking suspicious targets, making the local population aware of which territories are safe or not for civil activities, etc. Users would receive reports containing information regarding security. All this would relate to Cardano as this information would be minted on the blockchain, from what I understand Dapp would also be a DeFi center where civilians would be encouraged to donate to the cause (it is not very clear if it would be donation in Ada, USD or in the local currency of Ukraine, but the transactions would be done via blockchain anyway). In other words, Cardano technologies would be directly used, new users would learn about our blockchain, not out of interest in the technology itself, but because they want to help (in the case of donors) or need security information (in the case of the local population). ). And in this way, the objectives of the challenge would be met, a high-value Dapp that would be very useful for propagating the technologies of our ecosystem would be created. In addition, the proponent talks very well about the risks that developing this application could present, such as administrative and security - and he already points out how these challenges would be overcome. Overall, I thought it was an extremely necessary proposal, which would be working in favor of an extremely important social cause, which in itself already speaks very well with Cardano's holistic goals, to help everyone have more equal opportunities.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is very feasible, all 3 aspects of this topic - roadmap, team and budget - are explained in detail. Starting with the script, the project is super complex, some phases are established and we know what would happen in certain time intervals; an excerpt that well exemplifies the degree of specificity of the explanation of the development process is \u201cWP1: Month 0 - Month 2 Mobile app for civil users (MVP released, development in progress): User management and authentication, Suspicious objects report, Flow Camera Workflow, Marking Workflow, MobileDev+BackEnd Submission, and View Threat Map\u201d. I was a little in doubt about what month zero would be maybe before the financing? Proposals rarely use this term. Regarding my suggestions, I usually suggest splitting the timeline by months, but as this project involves many parts and complex actions, the current split of it is satisfactory for us to have a good degree of understanding of the whole. Some actions, such as \u201csee report, edit report, approve report\u201d (from month 1 to 3) could be even more detailed, however, it is the same situation of temporality - the wealth of necessary actions makes the way in which the information is passed is sufficient. In other words, due to the complexity of the project, if everything was explained in minute detail, it would take many pages. Perhaps the project deserved a whitepaper, for example, in which all the factors were further unraveled (but this is just a suggestion to enrich the project). The requested funding is very high, 120 thousand dollars, but it is well explained, as we can see for example in the excerpt \u201cWP2: System operator interface: $ 28,000 - We estimate 560 hours of software development at an hourly rate of $ 50 for the following deliverables: UX/UI design, Web app development and Integration with DSNS and GICHD IMSMA\u201d. We know what part the total amount would be split into, and those parts are well scored. For example, in the system operator interface, the proponent points out that small parts would make up this (UX/UI Design, Web Application Development and Integration with DSNS and GICHD IMSMA), how many hours of work would be needed to complete these works and value of every hour. That is, as much as it is an expensive project, it is possible to understand the need for such an investment, the reasons are very clear. When it comes to the team, a lot of people are involved here. As the proponent points out, \u201cThe development will be carried out in close collaboration with the professional demining team of the State Emergency Services of Ukraine and with the direct endorsement of the official adviser and a former deputy minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. Anton Gerashanko\u201d. Some of the more active members have a resume attached, but some smaller teams are presented via links. In one way or another, it is possible to prove the preparedness of those involved, which conveys a lot of confidence. Everything is properly explained and argued here. In other words, this project will most likely be successfully implemented, we have a very solid understanding of what would be done, how it would be done, who would do it and for how much investment.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Progress can be measured against several KPIs. The development will be followed through Sprints, posted on gitbook, as I understand it. Reports will be prepared at the end of each milestone, I believe containing both quantitative and qualitative information regarding what will be done. The proponent states that user engagement, number of suspicious objects reported, information about affected areas, etc. will be monitored. That is, in several ways, we can be aware of partial results. My only suggestion regarding this part would be that: I would like the phase tracking to be explained more precisely. At first, the statement of how the project could be audited is a bit abstract (\u201cThe MineFree mobile app for mine and suspicious object communication will be officially released to the general public and widely disseminated in collaboration with the State Emergency Services Ukraine. The launch will be accompanied by a broad publicity and educational campaign\u201d). But it soon becomes more tangible through the quantitative and qualitative data that the proponent suggests that we follow through the phases. As it is a super complex project, as I said before, it is difficult to directly audit all the areas involved. There is a detailed roadmap that can help guide this follow-up, but even so, it is very necessary for the project team to make the advances perceptible, not only in relation to the generated products, but also in relation to the activities that generated them. Finally, speaking of final results, unfortunately this part left a little to be desired in the sense of being very number-based, but not so much in relation to the impact of Dapp for Cardano, for example. It would be interesting if we knew how the actions performed impacted our blockchain. Were the objectives of the challenge met, in the end? How many active users were brought to Cardano from this idea, and how are they relating to our blockchain? How has the circulation of Ada, the number of smart contracts been increased? I believe that everything should be analyzed, from the benefits for Ukraine to our community and our ecosystem. It would be interesting to have some online meetings to update the community, after, for example, a few months of funding. And at the end of development and after the dApp is released, it would be critical for the proponent to provide us with an analysis on how this technology has been used in practice, in what way it has positively affected the local Ukrainian population and how it has contributed to them getting to know better. to Cardano and perhaps become active members of a new community, as they saw fit. That said, I think this topic is also very good, but some things could still be improved, so that the degree of detail and depth was as perfect as it is in the previous topics.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 13874, "q0": "This proposal is highly relevant to the challenge, succinctly conveys a detailed plan and has an impressive potential socio-economic impact for those in Ukraine and beyond.\nThe proposal aims to further develop the dapp \u2018MineFree\u2019 Ukraine, which has successfully passed proof of concept and been trialled, to help Ukraine recover land that has been decimated during the ongoing conflict. Initial sponsorship was acquired outside Cardano, showing others value this project, and the funding requested will greatly increase the scale and adoption pace of the technology and program. The ambitious goal of using citizen scientists, Cardano technology and crowdsourced funding to solve this extremely relevant real life problem is a worthy goal for Cardano to sponsor and fund. The proposers offer strong justifications and evidence based research about the current state of contaminated territory and the future benefits for Ukraine, and the world, when this land can be cleared to resume agricultural production. From personal experience, visiting Ukraine several times (prior to this conflict), discussions with friends and former colleagues in country, I know of the determination and willingness of the Ukrainian people to use whatever they can to help themselves, their neighbours and the country. The impact will be directly visible to Ukrainians, supporting agencies and the Cardano community around the world. The immediate impact for civilians will be a live updated database of safe and unsafe areas for land mines. Furthermore, land owners can report mines or other contamination on their farms and request support to clear the area. International and local donors will have a quick, easy and direct channel to sponsor clearing of the land by professional operators and be satisfied that their philanthropic donation is going directly into the hands of someone who needs it, which is sometimes not the case with charities and general crowd funding. The dapp itself will highlight Cardano as a leader in the field of socio-economic dapp development and hopefully foster many connections to international organizations that may investigate the platform for their own needs.\nOverall, I feel the probable impact of this proposal is immense, there are many details to be worked out in terms of feasibility and auditability, however, for impact alone I rate this proposal 5 stars. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Like any proposal, solving a problem comes with risks, however, solving a problem in the middle of a conflict zone has a lot more risks to be mitigrated. I feel the team have made a good effort to acknowledge these risks and what can be done to minimize the possible derailment of the program. The main risks identified are the danger and security needs, not only for those operating in the field to use the dapp, but ensuring accurate data and verified users. They acknowledge the chance of malcious actors and plan to give careful attention to the authentication mechanisms and user validification. As the project brings more users online, the mass of data should even out and provide overall safety even if there are a few of these bad actors who slip through the net.\nIn terms of financial feasibility they have an comprehensive budget planned for the different phases of the project. One minor issue is the set rate of $50 per hour for every single staffing budget need. This could be more clearly detailed as to roughly how many hours each staff member/team or development squad would need payment for per phase. As with most projects, there is a project management pool of money, of $25,000, which they\u2019ve itemized to some extent, however, particulars could be a little more detailed for an item such as marketing which could be given a ball park cash figure.\nThe proposal team are described in detail, with relevant qualifications, and direct links to biographies in LinkedIn. This adds a great deal of confidence to the possible success of the program by knowing the people involved, their skill sets and motivations. In addition, it is fantastic to note they have already identified Ukrainian based design and software development agencies that they will hire for sections of the project - proof that the team are invested and believe in their mission by striving to hire people in Ukraine who probably need this extra work and financial support. A last confidence boost for the team members working on this project is the acknowledged collaboration with the existing OpenLitterMap project, in which the dapp has been successfully developed and deployed years ago. With this experience of a dapp with prior Cardano support, the MineFree proposal team are in a good position to move forward.\nOverall, the proposers make a strong case for the plan they have put together. However, the glaring issue that the implementation of this project is during a conflict time and region means that I will give it a 4 star rating for feasibility due to the myriad of possible risks that can occur at any time without possible solutions that may unfortunately derail the proposal.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The success, and in terms of auditability of their proposal can be measured in many ways with the metrics supplied, and they have provided this information as a six month and one year target. They detail the number of app installations, objects reported, area demined and funding acquired. The initial six month targets seem achievable, then the one year targets are all a 10-fold increase above those numbers, which is of some concern, will the marketing, word-of-mouth and success of the program allow it to grow this quickly? I honestly hope it does, however, there is a chance of much slower growth, and with the location and timing during an open conflict I think there is less chance of achieving this growth than in normal \u2018safe\u2019 situations.\nReporting directly to the public, and Cardano community, they list several reports and procedures that will be followed. Each 2 weeks will see Github commits for each sprint, each milestone on the clearly set out timeline will have a report and deliverable, and the releases of the web and mobile applications will be obvious. In addition, with thought to security and data protection they state that relevant information about affected areas in Ukraine will be released to the public in consultation with Ukrainian authorities. \nI would like to see in the proposal some sort of budget sheet, or statement of expenses to confirm the spending on particular aspects of the proposal and identifying over/under spends along the way. This could be as simple as a public google spreadsheet or the spending information contained within each milestones public report. Perhaps this is planned, however it is not described in the proposal.\nOverall, the proposal is clearly auditable and gives measurable definitions of success, hence, I give it a rating of 5 stars.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3840", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3, "q0": "What happens in Ukraine now is unprecedented act of russian aggression and their crimes against humanity.

Also, the potential of the Dapp used by more than 30 million people (age 15+) of all age demographics can help the adaptation of blockchain. The platform would make it possible to support the mine-clearing as an individual, and you could follow up on where your money is being used. This feature is mainly possible because the proposal envisions a platform with multiple integrated apps that makes this possible. The security that the Cardano blockchain can provide, when carefully built, can make a real difference.

The team is professional and works with nationally based software development companies and, therefore, will help to be endorsed by the Ukrainian government.

I am completely convinced by the reasons given by the proponent to prove the feasibility and necessity of the main product. The main purpose of this project is to develop and implement a management system that includes multiple Dapps for each different audience and is used for data collection, reporting, and demining planning in Ukraine. Based on data from a study on landmine contamination in Ukraine; assumptions about negative impacts on agricultural exports and world food markets if no measures are taken to rehabilitate contaminated land in Ukraine; assumptions about the positive impact on the Ukrainian people/economy and Cardano's image/status in society if the project is funded and successful, the proponents have proven their proposal real conformity with the primary measure of Challenge and humanity pursued by Cardano.\nFrom the information provided by the author, we can clearly understand the main components of the system, how it works in information collection and demining. Furthermore, this proposal is a continuation of the previous system development work done, MVP and version 1.0 of the mobile application for civilian users have been released. Therefore, we have a basis to believe in their ability to perform this project well. With such a multi-layered development system and integration of many applications, the biggest risks are inefficient management and user base security, fortunately, the proponent has really paid attention to two issues as well as provided mitigation measures.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The schedule presented in this proposal is a continuation of the work of the previous work sections. Each established milestone clearly outlines the target applications to be completed and the work required to complete the application. The amount of funding is fully consistent with the proposed goals and development plans.

This is the most cost-effective formula so that experts can make comparisons between the proposal and the development plan, between this proposal and other proposals in a similar field to conclude whether the cost is appropriate or not. The feasibility of this proposal is very high as demonstrated by the previous development work on parts of the system that they have done.

This is a humanitarian project to improve food security and transport chain crises caused by the war in the current state of protracted armed conflict. While Ukraine is one of the leading exporters of agricultural produce, the aftermath of the war affects the entire world economy.\nThe plan focuses on the priority demining of critical infrastructure and farmland. That would be easier than the full demining of affected territories. The project covered how the information collection system works, but it didn't focus on the technical aspects, which made it difficult for me to understand how the system works technically. Proposer can consider additional technological issues, as it requires a large amount of information about complex problems such as positioning, identity verification, remote sensing, etc.\nBesides, the proposal doesn't mention the use of source data. This is an application that needs to use a geographic background, so using data from a third party like Google Maps/ Sygic GPS Navigation & Maps\u2026 is a critical issue that should be mentioned in the proposal. It helps to add a reliable source of information for future development projects.\nIn the description of risks that may be encountered during project implementation, the proposer mentions administrative and security risks. While those are important factors, I recognize that there are still many other dangers that stand in the way of the project. The proposer can refer to the following comments to make the project better. It is highly prioritizing quality and a short time to market. Because this is a time-critical project, the proposer planned to get it done as soon as possible. In addition, the proposer may consider using ISTQB as a standard for quality assurance and test automation.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I found the proposer to have a good, long-term vision, and a detailed timeline to stick to that vision.
