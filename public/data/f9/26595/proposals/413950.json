How do we accomplish this - GLOBALLY?", "f6_no_assessments": 8, "f6_rating": 4.5, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 2044, "q0": "This proposal is very good and certainly fits the objectives of the challenge. The idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal is to teach the elderly about our blockchain, in a way that is more adaptive to their learning process, certainly, explanations are provided for a young person who is already familiar with the technology and an elderly person who has never been exposed to Blockchain is very different. Having a program specifically designed to educate the elderly will most likely need to explain things at a different pace and with more detail than a great idea can have an impact. Big impact not only on the Cardano ecosystem but on the entire blockchain. This proposal has received funding from fund 8 and it has completed phase 1 (completed an educational language-ELI65 and started SM marketing). Back to this Fund 9, the proposed team wants to find funding to carry out phase 2, which is to create cartoon characters for this educational platform. I am very interested in this idea because visual education is a solution to help the elderly to be more interested in learning about a difficult-to-reach area. This proposal will create 4 animated characters with 4 different personalities, through their talks will animate the educational messages the proposal is aiming for and will then translate the conversations into multiple languages. There is clarity about the problem, the solution, and how they relate to the challenge. The proposal directly refers to the first objective of Fund 9's Strategic Goal which is \"Prepare a group of people willing and able to contribute to the ecosystem\"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is good but some parts are not ideal in my opinion. First, about the roadmap, we are presented with what will happen each quarter, there are several activities listed. The concept of time per quarter is well described, but it would be nice to suggest dividing these tasks into monthly, and also better explaining who should be in charge of those tasks. Next comes the budget, the proposal asks for $35,000 and breaks it down into large chunks, each of which is broken down into smaller details. Here we are also provided with the hours for each stage as well as the total cost for each stage. So we know exactly what the money will be used for.\nFinally, as far as the team is concerned, we are introduced to the team members Tom Frey, Theresa K, and Kevin Burke. Their area of \u200b\u200bexpertise is explained, however, it is not clear, we know their role in this proposal but it would be more convincing if their LinkedIn Profile is attached, where we can have more realistic examples of their past experiences. Therefore, I think the feasibility of the project is good, but it can still be improved.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Project audibility is good, we have ways to track both the process and the result of this project. The proponent is very transparent in tracking the process of the project, the Team will use an Agile system to track and measure the progress of the project besides the proponent says that the task diagram will be generated will be available in the Miro tool; This tool is interesting because it allows videos, links, images, drawings, and text to be posted. In addition, the community can fully follow the project through Telegram channels, Discord and weekly updates will be published. Therefore, the progress of the period is audited.\nThe final successful outcome to mention is a series of 8+ PSA-type videos on YouTube translated into different languages \u200b\u200bon Higher education using ELI65 with a focus on Risk Management. Can see that the success of the project is also clearly defined and consistent with the original roadmap and goals of the project.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2299", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 3, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3588, "q0": "I still do not understand the purpose of the proposal for the elderly, what it means to educate them about crypto & Cardano.\nWhen reading the solution summary I learned that this proposal has received funding from Fund 8 for educational language development- ELI65, to begin with, phase 2 is to create animated characters to translate . It is my understanding that the proposal is creating multilingual virtual cartoon characters to be friends with tall people.\nExcept for Asia, in developed countries they do not have the tradition of generations of families living in the same roof. I often see the younger generation living separately, the elderly living separately or living with other elderly people in nursing homes.\nThe development and construction of a virtual community center for the elderly is a very good and appropriate proposal that will help the elderly to be less lonely, to devote their soul and energy to the community.\nLet's build a Cardano community suitable for all ages\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The author of the proposal is also a senior with over 20 years of legal practice for the elderly, 40 years of experience in a variety of styles and mediums including animation, the author is very knowledgeable about seniors age, the development of detailed plans, budget allocation is completely reasonable and full of stages.\nI see the risk that this project, if it has a significant impact on the success of the project, is effective translation, if the project does not translate the right languages according to each country, the proposal will not convey the full meaning. of the story, the conversation. Using Google may not convey the full meaning or misinterpret the story you want to convey\nThe team consists of 3 main members with extensive professional experience with other members also supporting the completed work.\nProposed with the goal of building virtual characters in the virtual community with full personality, voice, appearance and demeanor suitable for many elderly people in the world.\nJust like Cardano aims to be for the community. I believe in the feasibility of the project", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I am not a professional in the field of art, so I do not fully understand the detailed plan written down and the price paid for each stage and labor, but I will consult the relevant documents.\nIt is recommended to use the Agile system to measure project progress, this use is also reasonable because the creative, artistic, and dub nature are difficult to measure.\nThe audience's reaction to the new project measures the success of the project.\nAs with other proposals, public reports on the channels will demonstrate the transparency of the project.\nI will find and watch videos of the proposed release on Youtubes", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2464", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6788, "q0": "Sharing useful knowledge is important.

The proposer clearly state the expected deliverables and milestones for respective timelines for example, Q3 will feature some segmented storyline for the project and the conceptual design of the animation. Q4 will feature script writting and editing alongside other related activities. The budget is clearly explained and appear fairly reasonable. All items add up and teams information is well articulated and presented.

The proposal made a very reasonable educational idea. However, I still have doubts about using animated characters for education because not all countries or cultures accept it.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Project members not having enough animation skills to fulfill the project's requirements is also a risk worth thinking about, but it also shows the careful preparation of the project team because there is a backup plan to solve it.\nThe proposed milestones and plans seem reasonable, but the product is not clearly described (eg \"\"Deliverable = the characters\"\" but no characters are described).\nThe budget allocation in my opinion is not reasonable because the proposal is almost equal to the price, which is not reasonable because the cost for the KOL must be very different from the cost of another. This will greatly affect the project members as well as having to outsource other people to implement the project items, it will affect the feasibility.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "It's great to see the project team using the tools to track and measure a process.\nWith the transparency of project information via Telegram, Discord and a weekly update newsletter is also a support point for the project's audit.\nHowever, as mentioned in impact and feasibility, it is very difficult to measure animation quality because it is almost qualitative.

By teaching seniors how to navigate, and use the cryptospace, and the caradano space more specifically, they can make meaningful contributions and bring more traffic to the platform. I believe this proposal targeting seniors is very interesting for multiple reasons. Seniors are often left out of innovative spaces such as crypto, because there is a lack of educational content that is relatable, and catered to them. I believe there is an significant community of seniors that have a lot of ideas and a lot of interest for the cardano ecosystem, but lack the knowledge to enter it. Through animations that feature fun, familiar, well-liked characters, the author seeks to bring educational content to the older audience. I believe this proposal is very meaningful, and answers the challenge well. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I believe there are 3 major componentsthat will determine the success of this proposal. Firstly, the team that works on it. The team is comprised of seniors, to be able to understand the needs and the likes of their audiences, to be the most appealing possible. However, for an animation project, the author indicates that their animator might not be skilled enough to deliver the quality they want. This is very worrying, as the main workload is animation. I think they should seek a skilled animator as soon as possible. The team also seems to lack a technically knowledgeable member, such as a seasoned code developer or blockchain technology expert, to really be able to write educational content that is correct, easy to understand, and relevant. The second component that I would like to talk about is the content itself. There is not yet a clear script of what the content will be,or t the very least, the topics that will be touched upon. With the lack of a team member familiar and skilled in the crypto space, i worry about the quality of the content that will be put out. Finally, regarding the budget and timeline, I believe they are very reasonable and realistic, I hope they will be able to deliver according to the timeline. Taking into consideration the aforementioned elements, I am not completely confident about the success of this proposal.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The progress is easily auditable by comparing their updates with the very detailed timeline given.
