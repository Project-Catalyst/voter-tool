The problem to be solved is quite clear, there is no platform that meets the needs of stakeholders in our blockchain, so that they can visualize the performance and growth of their activities within our ecosystem. As the proponents say, there is no tool that works to investigate problems and detect opportunities. And so this proposal comes in, a dApp called Adaglass would be created whose main goal is to carry out this investigative work on data. The proponents explain that the dApp will act in the part of visualization and analysis tools in relation to all doubts that say more about our blockchain. I think it is super important that this solution is developed, we are a third generation blockchain, which means that some features that already exist in other older networks on the market may not be available to our community, and if we want to act in relation to the growth of the Cardano, it is necessary that this type of investment be made. Speaking more specifically about this solution, it is based on several main points, according to the proponents, which would be promoting the community to maximize Cardano\u2019s growth, this would be done through greater awareness and credibility of blockchain with developers. /researchers/influencers (the solution would develop more tangible material so that, for example, those who have youtube channels could understand and evaluate aspects of our ecosystem, spreading this information). There would also be more trust in our blockchain, as an investment would be made in the data, processes would all be properly correlated. This solution would also provide further expansion into new areas, as insights would be made possible through a technology called actionable decision-making intelligence - according to our proponents. Based on what was said in the detailing of the impact and also because of my understanding of what is being sought here, the proposal is directly related to the topics present in the challenge summary: \u201cDeFi - Total value locked, the total number of users, number of active daily/weekly/monthly users + Hardware - Number of items sold, number of total users, number of interactions with hardware solution + Increasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases\u201d. The proposal also fits the developers' challenge, as it will produce a more favorable environment for these people to work. The Cardano Search & Analytics service would be the heart of the proposal, according to the proponents, providing aggregated and structured data for Cardano Service Intelligence. The way the proponent explains this application to us is positive, as it is technical but not to the point that ordinary readers (like me) of the proposal do not understand well what will be developed. A paragraph that sums up well the activities to be developed is \u201cThe platform combines modern, enterprise-grade and open source telemetry, search and machine learning technologies to provide the community with unparalleled transparency of the Cardano ecosystem, helping everyone to track, learn and report on key events, actors, assets and performance indicators\u201d. Apart from that, the proponents inform us precisely what some possible risks the project would face, including how likely they are to happen and the degree of damage they would cause to the project (rare information to be given, but very interesting); for example: heavy reliance on third-party data, applications, and interfaces. They also already provide us with possible solutions.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The script is good, but not ideal. We know what would happen at certain time intervals within the total 5 months of project development. The problem is that we don't know when each of the actions would take place; even though we were told what the main deliverables would be (System and Application Design Documentation, CSA Backend Application, CSI Frontend Application (Enhancement with Deeper Capabilities). which are classified as in the example: CSI Application Enhancement (months 2, 3 and 4) However, among the many small actions that make up this group (\"develop high-level CSA application design, create CSA application data connectors, create surveys based on kpi of the CSA application\u201d, etc) what would happen in month 2, and 3? more precisely what would happen in each exact month, besides also naming these months, for example what would happen in August, September, October? The second thing is that, ideally, the activities are better broken down. eg \u201creview and iterate on initial design + develop and upload high-level product backlog\u201d: how would design development be done? How would the interface characteristics be chosen? Speaking of usability, what would the user guide documentation documents be? What would the backlog be loaded? I wish these questions could be clarified better, so that our understanding of the development process here would be more solid. So, in my view, the script is not bad, but neither is it in the best way it should be presented. The use of the budget is also not so well explained. The total amount of USD 62475 is divided into a few parts, for example \u201cProject Setup = USD 1,000, Product Design = USD 2,425, Stake Pool Infrastructure Execution (5 months) = USD 4,500, CSA Infrastructure Execution (5 months) = USD 9,000 (\u2026)\u201d. As with the script, more detail would be welcome. The construction part of the CSA infrastructure would cost 9 thousand dollars, or 1800 dollars per month. It is a fair value, but it would be even better if we knew how much time professionals in this area would dedicate to the project, so that we could calculate the value of the work hour. We know it would be 1800 for the month, but we don't know if they would work full-time or part-time for the project, for example. What content is part of \u201ccontent production\u201d? The amount requested is low in relation to the whole, but it would still be positive to understand this expense better. Finally, about the engineers who will participate in the project, we have more information about Damien than about Hugo (it would have been ideal if the two had provided approximately the same degree of detail). A lot of confidence in Damien is conveyed as he has included a short resume about himself (\"I bring a mix of management, technical and operational and expertise in areas such as business strategy, technical architecture, product design, team management, projects, software development, IT operations, user experience, and data engineering. More recently, I have specialized in technologies covering content management, e-commerce\u2026\u201d etc); but I still wish he had pointed out some examples of previous work and how he relates to Cardano. It is unclear whether professionals have a good involvement with our blockchain. That said, some points need improvement here.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of progress is very good, however some things cited here are not so easily understood, for example: \u201cwe follow an agile approach that uses a combination of Kanban and DevOps practices to enable the design, development and continuous deployment of the service\u201d. What would these Kanban and DevOps practices be? How do they work and would they contribute to the auditability of progress? In \u201cOn a day-to-day basis, all work is driven by the ongoing construction, development and management of a product backlog with work items that move through 4 delivery gates (Design, Development, QA, Live)\u201d, again the concept of backlog is mentioned, but it would need to be better defined. When searching, I found the following definition - it refers to a log of accumulation of work in a certain time interval. Backlog is a kind of inventory of requisition/order sheets related to products not yet produced. It would be important to have this clarity, as mentioned in a previous topic. However, as auditability progresses, the proponents explain that they will keep the community updated through monthly reports, which will include (as I understand it) news on both progress (\"delivery plan, activities completed, key risks, issues and decisions the team made or encountered and a few words about the next steps\u201d); as about some partial results. The way in which the script is built in this proposal contributes to an easier auditability, as many activities that will have to be completed are scored - for our understanding to be better, in this case, it would also be important to understand beyond what would happen and in which intervals, when they would happen - what I mentioned in the script about having more specificity in relation to the temporality of things. Overall, luckily, it's a lot of understanding about what would be delivered and where it would be delivered (\"to manage, plan, track, and report on progress, we use Jira; to help us create, collaborate, and organize information and knowledge, we use Jira.\" Confluence; to help us optimize the build-test-release cycle for reliable and continuous service delivery, we use the Go CD\u201d). Moving on to our last topic of analysis, which is the auditability of the final success, I believe that we also have a lot of information about this, the proponents state what the results would be to watch (\u201d page to list, search and open CSI Deep Dives, set of 11 CSI system deep dives, set of CSA APIs to give, Deep Dives data delivery support, updated Adaglass website (subscribe, catalog pages), set of project completion reports (governance) and etc) ; and also states several communication channels that would be used (medium, telegram, twitter and etc). So my only suggestion is that, in addition to these more specific data, the proponents also carry out a broader survey to understand how users would be making use of the minimum viable product in question and how this would have improved their relationship with Cardano. However, the topic is great.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1337, "q0": "The problem statement refers to the problem that there is no particular platform or environment to monitor and visualize the performance and growth of the ecosystem for the major Stake holders of cardano ecosystem.

The team lead Damien Despas is working as CTO in cunsulting and digital marketing and has blend of management, technical and operational expertise in multiple areas, along with Hugo Allamel who is working as Engineer to operate infrastructure in domains of cloud and security. The team according to me however \"IMHO\" would definitely benefit including someone from with background in Blockchain specifically cardano into the team which can help them aechitecture the solution in better way with his./her exposure and root level requirement and expertise required to go beyond MVP and reduce dependency of CSA which the team has recognised as risk. The proposal how ever is a continuation of previously funded proposal where they have successfully built MVP for the same without a blockchain resource so this is proposal is likely to be implemented successfully based on the detailed plan of action and risks mitigated.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer have put up and neat proposal addressing the problem statement recognised by the team and the solution that they are planning to implement.

The feedback shows a real interest in understanding where Adaglass stands to date. Two main concerns were raised.\n\nFirst the assessor outlines that this proposal might not align with the challenge, due to both (1) a lack of clarity between what our funded F8 poposal will deliver in comparison to this new F9 proposal, and (2) missing customer feedback to justify the integration of additional metrics into the platform.\n\nSecondly, the assessor highlights the poor amount of public content available to date on social channels regarding the progress of our Fund 8 proposal scope, this causing confidence issues.\n\nWith regards to point 1: we strongly believe that the proposal meets the scope of the challenge, which is broad in this round, from both a product development and data integration standpoints.\n\nRe product, this proposal aims to build a new and isolated analytical tool on top of our in development MVP. The MVP funded as part of Fund 8 solely focuses on building the Stake-To-Subscribe user journey, 50+ tracked metrics and our bluechip Homeview dashboard; whereas the scope of Fund 9 is to build the Deep Dive product into the platform (defined in details in the proposal).\n\nRe integration, this round proposes to add another and small set of Tier 1 metrics that was identified but not prioritized as part of our Fund 8 design work that happened in June 2022. Metrics are the heart of the platform. Tier 1 metrics are readily available and not resource heavy metrics to process, available for free. Supporting as many as possible metrics intrinsically brings more value to end users. We see this as continuous improvement based on team inputs and not user inputs just yet based on the state of the project. Adding metrics requires integration with new data sources.\n\nWith regards to point 2: we would like to highlight that our focus has been to date (since beginning of June) to progress the design work and start the build of the back-end components over the management of the social channels. We take on board the assessor feedback and understand the importance in priority that pushing our updates is as critical as the development of the platform to reach success. We will make our reports available shortly.

The team should produce a timeline table, which will provide a better overview of when each task is completed and in what order. That is the only recommendation I offer. Budgetarily, $62,475 is the proposed amount of the fund, which will last for 5 months. The budget is defined in detail, divided into distinct sections, and appears appropriate. In my opinion it could have been split further, rather than giving up a big $13,750 number as salary for each front-end and back-end developer, the team could offer more info, for instance : what is their rate per hour/month, and how many working hours a month? The reason why I expect an hourly rate is because it is the most suitable way to determine the salary\u2019s fairness in comparison to today\u2019s market value. This proposer doesn't allow any room for doubt in regards to the team in charge of this project. They provide crucial components in a subtle way, I mean. Regarding the team members, two individuals have already committed to the project with management, technical, operational expertise and a level of understanding of IT operations, engineering and cybersecurity. They have been able to bring together a very diverse mix of skills and knowledge from many different sectors. Referrals were given via LinkedIn, so experience can be supported by that.
