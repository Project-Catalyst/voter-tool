The problem is that the new Dapps built on Cardano lack the market marketing resources to bring the community to the conferences and grow by 100x users. Community is one of the most valuable resources and also a resource that contributes to the rapid development of any project or ecosystem. The Cardano Community is a decentralized global community.\nThe solution of this proposal is described in detail and clear and the method of reasoning is rigorous. The solution is to exhibit at major industry conferences with free tickets for the Cardano community to share the Cardano gospel. The author used photographs, and evidence from previous successful events (such as Consensus) to demonstrate the importance of the exhibits. Apparently, the effects of the exhibits are great for Cardano. The author has also described the registration process and the selection process of the participants in great detail. Meeting in person at Cardano conferences, events, and exhibitions will be an extremely impactful Proof of Community for those inside and outside of Cardano.\nI found that the author's proposed solution met the challenge because it had enough things to join the challenge (\"Many others - Any other idea, product, or integration that someone thinks should be built into the Cardano ecosystem\") and solve the problems of the challenge (increasing number of users, number of meaningful interactions...)\nIn addition, the team has outlined the main risks that may be encountered when implementing this project and they also have appropriate solutions to minimize these risks.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponent provided a detailed plan.

In addition, some other work was done such as: creating an exclusive Grow Cardano bonus at the Conference on Snapbrillia for the Cardano community to register for conference and event tickets and commit to representing Cardano; order 1000 shirts and upgrade Linktr.ee to access Special Analytics.\nThe proposed budget of $420,000 represents 5.35% of the total Challenge budget. This money is allocated for specific conferences as the author presented in the proposal and detailed allocation for other expenses such as: Sponsoring group tickets requested by the community, additional exhibitions supplement and sponsor; cNFTs minting fees; DID authentication fee; the cost of ordering 1,000 shirts; Linktr.ee upgrade fee. The author also explained the proposed amount and budget allocation.\nInformation about the members of the implementation group is described in full and in detail by the author. They are all experienced and competent in implementing AI and Blockchain solutions in Healthcare Tech, FinTech, E-Commerce, Legal, Non-Profit and HR Tech. They have run AI and Web3 startups. In addition to this proposal, they have a number of other proposals also submitted in Fund 9 and they also have proposals funded from previous Funds.

For example: hold a Snapbrillia & Progress Demo behind City Hall at least once to twice a month and attend most Catalyst Town Halls to capture community feedback and input. In addition, they will provide the latest information and updates on the project's Discord channel.\nThe team defined the success of the project very clearly.

It is a quick way to refer to the current milestones/goals of the Cardano ecosystem as a whole to contribute and serve back to the community.\n\nWe may be able to advertise and do several marketing campaigns, but the quick surefire way to spread the word is from fellow human to another.

The solution makes appropriate arguments for how to solve the stated problem. The proposal identifies 8 risks: There is not enough funding to meet demand. ADA and funding price fluctuations. Bad actors. Some conferences won't produce high ROI. International members will not be able to attend many of these conferences in the United States and vice versa due to restricted visas, travel costs, etc. Travel problems, illness such as Covid, and other complications. Not enough goods aka. SWAG to give. We can see that the project author has taken into account a lot of risks and has also taken appropriate mitigation measures. The preparation for mitigating risks is consistent with performance capacity, the project has a major impact on the community, and the risks shared by the community are appropriate.\n I rated: 5\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan for implementing the project has determined the timeline according to the number of organized sessions in the month.

These conferences also serve as great marketing for the Cardano community as a whole. For example, the Consensus conference this year had thousands of visitors. Having great community members at that conference shows the world what Cardano is up to.\nThe proposal also explained to us ways they will be able to scale in the future.
