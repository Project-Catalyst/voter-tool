It\u2019s clear that the team has already put in a lot of work into this project and that inspires a lot confidence in the ability of this team to deliver on this specific proposal.\nA core team of 6 people + Ada Anvil team seems like a very appropriate number for a proposal of this complexity. The LinkedIn profiles of each of core team members is available and a diverse set of skills and experience was noted.

The team asks for $5000 for marketing, which is also a reasonable amount, but it would have strengthened the proposal if the team provided further details on how and where they intend to market the game. \nAlthough the proposal could be improved by addition of further details as mentioned above, given that the team has already developed an advanced concept and working NFT\u2019s I have a very high confidence it can successfully deliver this proposal and hence I\u2019m given it 5 stars for feasibility\n\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The milestones for each of the 2-week sprints can be used of measure progress of the proposal, although given this doesn\u2019t seem to be an opensource project (with a GitHub page) it\u2019s unclear how the community can verify the progress. Will the team provide updates in their Discord page or other media? Some further clarity here would strengthen the proposal.\nAlthough some KPI\u2019s are mentioned such as how many players complete a progression and time spent while earning, there are no quantitative estimates presented.

Their unique selling point is that they reward players with NFTs once they reach certain milestones and not rely exclusively on the battle pass to draw back the players to return to the game. Along with ADA Anvil, the team has created a mystery box minting system that they collaborated with 6 other NFT projects to make minting NFT more fun (ie. Earn NFTs together) and they plan to integrate this group progression system into Future Fest. The team proposal fits the challenge very well as this will add utility to CNFTs. It will be a great proof of concept for other projects who are exploring this concept of multiple users to earn NFTs in solving their quests (more common is solving quest for single users) and ultimately draw game players and developers into Cardano.

You have carefully explained your main product, namely its working manner, co-partners, functions, and target audience. However, my advice is that you should mention directly who these players are, like what age they are, etc. Much as your proposal can match the key metrics of the challenge, it ought to be more detailed. Focusing more on the results that your game can bring out as well as suitable for the challenge is a right choice to demonstrate that your project has the potential to address it.

Yet the problem is the voters will not be able to figure out the exact timeline for every milestone to be attained. You should know that a good proposal often goes with a detailed plan and schedule for tracking. I highly advise you to attach every goal to a particular timeline, such as at which month or which week of a month, etc so that the community could follow your progress effortlessly. Your budget allotment list is fine but there\u2019s still a loophole inside. To be specific, you are capable of declaring all expenses related to the development process, comprising UI/UX designs, backend & frontend, unity, and dApp development, whereas art and marketing weren\u2019t declared in such detail.
