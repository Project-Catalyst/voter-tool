Starting with the problem statement, we find out that delivery apps take a 20 to 30 percent cut from food deliveries, which is definitely the case not only for food delivery platform, but as well for ride sharing and short term rentals - this is the way the business model works since the initial creation of the platform takes significant resources to build and afterwards network effects kick in in case of a successful implementation. \n\nMunchy Go intends to use smart contracts in order to increase efficiency and automate and simplify delivery services, but it is not very clear what the benefits of using a blockchain application really are. The success of similar applications (and there are plenty around the globe) rests more in the way it is implemented and in the fine balance between usability, network effects, keeping costs down and end customers happy. It is also a market prone to dumping prices by new entrants, and we frequently see races to the bottom in individual applications for countries or cities in particular niches. \n\nThe proposers also claim that one of their goals in building a decentralized delivery solution is to cut the middlemen, but I not sure this is possible or even desirable on this market - since there are a multitude of players on each side of the isle: restaurants, delivery services, consumers, and an incredible number of regional specificities that have to be catered for. Given the ferocious and diverse competition existing in this niche, I am not convinced that a blockchain solution would bring real benefits to end users or end up being more cost efficient. Also, the team does not mention at all transaction costs and network utilization. Since it will be a blockchain solution that means a myriad of mini transactions have to be recorded perhaps: food orders, pick-ups, payments, cancellations, etc, all of them in real time and with minimal interference for the end users, with seamless integration. Despite this challenge there is nowhere in the proposal any meaningful discussion on necessary throughput, transaction costs and the adequacy of the Cardano ecosystem for this. \n\nMy honest advice is for the team to go back to the drawing board, analyze the business model of existing players in great detail and find a way to offer a blockchain based solution that can integrate into an existing platform instead of starting something from scratch: for instance payments, or a zero knowledge solution for end users to have less access to personal information. \n\nGiven all of the above I remain neutral towards the impact that this proposal might have and I am only offering three stars.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Munchy Go seems to have a marketing and business development team behind it, which is very good news since it seems to be the type of project can can be made or broken depending on the team\u2019s capacity of building solid business solutions and partnerships with other stakeholders. The actual build will most likely be outsourced to Mlabs, but it is not very clear - since they are listed as partners and the budget mentions hourly pay, but without being very specific on the details of who actually will develop the application. \n\nThe budget lists around 1k hours for the development, at an hourly rate of 80 USD, and 25k USD for marketing, but without going into the details of what kind of marketing efforts will be undertaken. \n\nHaving Mlabs as partners and a solid business development team, it is likely that they will come up with a workable MVP at the end of the build, so one can\u2019t really fault their capacity to deliver on their promises or to question the feasibility of the project. Five stars. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team promises monthly reports for tracking the project's development.Interestingly, they provide three levels of success in terms of adoption. Level 1 would be an MVP, thus a functioning product. Level 2 mentions a more efficient, cheaper and safer application, but without offering additional adoption measures (number of restaurants, end users, cities covered, etc.). Level 3 would be a flourishing ecosystem rivaling existing delivery applications. From my point of view this is an interesting approach but not at all operationalized wisely. None of the three levels of success bring any tangible numbers to the table and it will be very difficult to judge it in time, especially Level 2. Level 3 on the other hand seems overly optimistic and it is very unlikely for such a solution to be available to the big players on the market within a meaningful timeframe.  \n\nI think four stars are almost appropriate, indulgently since the proposal needs better success metrics.

It\u2019s also well-organized, the intention is straightforward and methodology is efficient, and I believe that it is a smart decision by the proposers to target the food and beverage world as the industry has not been receiving the attention it deserves. \nOverall, the proposal wishes to cut down the expenses for restaurants, increase courier pay and at the same time save up an amount for users, thus improving the general productivity of businesses and quicken the process of food ordering and delivery. \nUsing Smart Contracts, the project shall remove the conventional presence of a middleman-like platform and connect directly to the target stakeholders (and also the benefitians above), which are the Restaurants, Couriers and Customers who want to migrate to the app. The Smart Contracts are said to speed up the process of ordering and delivery via app efficiency and automation, applied from the moment you look through the menu of a restaurant or vendor to the second your food is delivered at your doorstep. \nWith this project, the proposers aim to tackle the existing issues with fee-charging within two existing models, B2B (business-to-business) and B2C (business-to-customer), specifically to reduce expenses as mentioned above. Currently, traditional food delivery platforms charge on average between 20% to 30% for each order made in-app, and an additional 1.5% to 3% fee is charged for each transaction if you use payment gateways, such as credit or debit cards. With Smart Contracts, all stages are scaled down into one single page and a much lower fee rate of only 2.5% to 5%, thus enabling customers to save some money, which should be extremely welcoming since the world economy has been receiving a major strike from the COVID-19 pandemic and gas prices have been skyrocketing ever since the war between Russia and Ukraine broke out.  On the B2C level, the Smart Contracts tackle the concern of security and customer satisfaction due to the fact that, as mentioned above, Smart Contracts remove the involvement of third parties payment platforms and integrate every step of the process into one united front, the customers will now pay directly from their linked wallet or payment method and their money will come straight to their vendors or delivery parties. This project also aims to benefit Cardano by concentrating on delivering a fully functional and seamless app that will hopefully soon pave the way towards a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which should fit inside the scope that this Dapps, Products and Integrations requires from each proposal. \nHowever, there is one small flaw I would like to point out. That is the lack of key metrics used to measure the different standards of success and profits they expect to gain with this project.\nThe proposal has also listed down a major risk for the project, which relates to the ability to create enough wallets that interact smoothly with the Smart Contracts via API, and a slight concern regarding the Marketing process. The team has yet to have a plausible resolution to mitigate or eliminate the risk, for now they hope to be able to tackle it in the coming months with extra efforts amongst the involved parties, but the Marketing concern has already been underway with the handling, with multiple social media channels being utilized and partnership with Youtube KOLs and community leaders to help promote the project.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "From the provided timeline and assigned tasks at each segment, I have high hopes that the team will be able to finish this project with all features and functions available and achieve what they set out initially. Nevertheless, the team has not mentioned the beginning date of execution yet, thus no expected final day either, and the milestones for each phase as well.\nOne highlight of this section is the analysis of the requested budget, where the team has carefully dissected and described in detail what would take place at each activity and how much they will cost respectively. Therefore, I can safely say that the applied funding is justifiable. \nThe list of team members involved in this project is another job well-done. All 4 of them come with the descriptions of their positions, duties and responsibilities, along with the relevant experience to the project. And the team has also enlisted the support of Mlabs, a blockchain consultancy company well-known in the cryptocurrency world. The only things I would hope to be additionally included are perhaps the LinkedIn profiles that demonstrate further the capabilities of the hands on deck for further verification and assurement.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In terms of auditability, I strongly believe that the team has obtained a positive-looking level of it, as illustrated via the team meetings and monthly reports. To be specific, the team meetings will be dedicated to assigning work and report progress and updates of the project, both actions made on productivity-targeted platforms of Slack and Asana. And every detail of the meetings will be publicly available later on. The same thing applies to the monthly reports as well, where news, changes and updates to the project will be published, along with the numerous milestone-based key metrics and adjustments to the MVP.\nFor the team\u2019s vision of success, they have presented 3 variations ranking from initial short-term to medium and long-term. All of them depict the gradual growth and desirable outcome of the project, and has not failed to include Cardano into the mix, with the ultimate success seeing Munchy Go become the industry leading food delivery app and massive adoption of users to both the app and Cardano, all of which aligns comfortably well with the objectives of this Dapps, Products and Integrations challenge. I would have loved to see some estimated figures to further solidify a great performance, but this is just as sufficiently well-rounded as it is.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2974", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3671, "q0": "This project wants to create a decentralized food delivery app. This would give greater ownership and a voice to stakeholders like restaurant owners and delivery drivers.

The platform could also be expanded in the future to include other forms of delivery such as for postal services and last mile ecommerce delivery. If successful, the project could also mobilize their huge network of delivery drivers to do ride hailing too. However, some of the team\u2019s claims should be moderated such as it being \u201ca new product category\u201d as this already exists. Most consumers do not care if food is being delivered in a web2 or web3 way, they care about cost, timeliness, choice and quality. \nThis project wants to create a decentralized food delivery app. This would give greater ownership and a voice to stakeholders like restaurant owners and delivery drivers.

It is up to the voters to decide if $117,800 is worth spending on an area which is extremely competitive and margins are low even though centralized food delivery apps impose seemingly high and extractive fees.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team has many years of experience across different aspects of software engineering in general and more specifically Haskell and Plutus, plus their partnerships with Clear Contracts and Mlabs should help them with most obstacles that they might encounter. 7 months is ample time to implement the project given that it is not a new product category.\n\nWhat isn\u2019t clear however, is whether the team needs to clear regulatory hurdles to handle food deliveries. Since the team did not mention where they would launch, some countries also might not recognize cryptocurrency as a valid form of payment and many restaurants might be hesitant to accept payment in cryptocurrency. If the team finds that they need to build a crypto to fiat bridge for restaurants if they do not want to receive crypto, the project could take longer than expected and hence I stress again, that is why proposers should always include a buffer to their timelines as there would be something that will almost always delay their \u2018perfect\u2019 plans. \n\nThere is also the issue of starting network effects which is vital for a business like this. If there are not enough consumers using the dApp, restaurants are less likely to come onboard. When there are fewer restaurants onboard, consumers are less likely to use it compared to the web2 alternatives, a classic chicken and egg problem. But this could be mitigated if the team deployed their tokens effectively to jump start their network. In conclusion, the main feasibility issue is not technical but business and legal.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team will publish their meeting minutes and release monthly reports detailing things from the dApp\u2019s usage statistics to code. While all this is good, it will be even better if the team could open source their project and link a github with their proposal which should only take 2 minutes to create. The team can also consider building a dashboard like those seen on Dune Analytics both for themselves to monitor key business metrics and accountability for the community.\u2003", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2468", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5985, "q0": "As a marketplace for food delivery, the proposal meets the challenge goals. Munchy Go wants to enter an existing market and has to compete with several other rivals (for example, Uber eats). Munch Go intends to compete by being more cost-effective through the Cardano Blockchain and, secondly, enhance the user experience by implementing a smart contract, so the user is only charged when the smart contract is fulfilled. If both featuers are met, I think they can compete in this market.

They also aspire to work with a Blockchain consultancy company, Mlabs, which is a good thing because there is no mention of any prior Dapps developed by any team members in the proposal. The team members' descriptions are well written, but I would advise adding links to the team members Linkedin for extra clarity.

The proposal's key metrics and goals correspond with the defined challenge settings, and the author did a good job of presenting the impact such a project may have on the Cardano ecosystems in a brief but thorough manner. The team thinks that by leveraging Cardano smart contract security and verifiability in daily use cases, they will drive business to Cardano and significantly increase Cardano widespread adoption. As a result, I feel this idea is of great value and fits the requirements of the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In terms of the proposed team and team members' expertise, I am certain that they have what it takes to deliver the expected results. It is evident that they have the necessary expertise and experience to carry out this project. However, no links or sources were offered to validate this information. It would be beneficial to add at least their Linkedin profiles or social media accounts in the proposal so that the community can get to know the team behind this idea better. Also, the team named MLabs as their partnering company, which gives voters trust because MLabs obviously has extensive expertise in the ecosystem, having worked on some of the most important Cardano projects. I would recommend including a link to the company website rather than simply stating it so that readers can learn further about the team, their previous work, and their skills. The implementation plan outlines each task, as well as the milestones and the time frame within which they are expected to be completed. The budget proposal is $117,800, which is appropriate considering the workload necessary to finish the project and should provide enough resources for the 27 weeks projected coverage. The team divided the budget into three major components, each with a short statement indicating what activities were included. I consider the hourly rate the team estimated to be reasonable, it is positive that they tried to make everything realistic as much as possible by researching market prices per hour for Plutus/Haskell developers/engineers. The allocation of $25,000 for Marketing and communication might appear vague at first, the community will need to know how the team makes use of the $25,000 they requested in a specific manner. But as it is considered an essential engine of the risk section, I can find details dedicating how their Munchy Go community of early users will be built in order to do justice to the finance division presented. At last, I wholeheartedly believe this proposal is likely to be successfully implemented.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The detail in the action plan and the possible difficulties that the team may confront is fascinating and in line with the suggested idea.

Furthermore, the team outlines in detail what success metrics they anticipate to have, which I believe are significant, allowing the community to keep track of the development. The success definition is thorough, including levels of successful adoption, so we can know for sure how this Dapp would scale up particularly, but I would recommend the team to clarify the timeline for each level they presented. For example, the proposers expect how long the first level of success will be reached and so on. This will help the community to fully comprehend how the project is developing and where it is heading. Aside from that, it's really encouraging how the team will keep the community in touch with the monthly report and a list of what will be included within it, which I think will be very useful to have a picture of the implementation as over the months data was shown and the exact current status of the project explained. It is also incredibly beneficial because a team meeting will be held every two weeks to overview input updates, and afterwards meeting minutes will be made public.

By doing this, the proposer would be able to reduce operational costs, increase customers\u2019 satisfaction and generate more efficiency towards restaurants. The advantage of this project, compared to other existing traditional food delivery services, is that it applies Blockchain technology to automate every step included in a transaction. This allows the application to optimizely reduce its partners\u2019 transaction fees into 2.5%-5%, different from traditional platforms with 20-30% charges for each delivery. Moreover, developing a service focusing on customers\u2019 feedback and attitude is also a great point, which might create loyal customers, attract more potential customers and ensure a long-term development of the business. However, there is one omission point that I would like to offer. As the author mentioned that the payments would be done after the customers are well-served, I believe that there would be some cases that someone tries to abuse the business by ghosting orders or giving negative feedback intentionally. These are the problems that might happen and cause business partners\u2019 dissatisfaction when all the priorities are towards customers.

Besides, the budget breakdown is quite specific with the amount of hours per week, price for work per hour, the total amount of work hours throughout 27 weeks and the total amount of money required given. I believe that this is a huge number that needs a thorough consideration from the Catalyst.
