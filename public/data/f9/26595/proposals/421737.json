Strategic goals from fund 9 including increased adoption rates, integration of open source projects and development of tools on Cardano offer significant impacts and clearly align with the missions of Cardano and this particular challenge setting.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "When assessing feasibility, team strength and the history of past deliverables are the two most important metrics. This project has that and more! Catalyst Swarm, Aim, The Treasury Guild and Fluid 7 all have a verified history of success, and 60% of the activities identified on the roadmap have already been achieved. Many Project Assessors use the tools created by AIM on a regular basis, and the tool kit developed by Swarm also has a high usage rate. All metrics align to point in the direction of maximizing the likelihood for success.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "KPIs are similarly the most important metrics to use in determining whether or not a given project can be audited to verify incremental progress that leads to successful implementation. In this case, development can be tracked through Discord and DeWork, with Github submissions also available for transparent investigation of the progress being made. Transparency and sufficient measurable metrics clearly demonstrate that this project is highly auditable and all progress can be verified.

The problem is that with the development of more and more projects on Catalyst, it is difficult and time-consuming to set up a transparent budgeting & accounting system and there is no time and focus on the development of those systems. It can be seen that this is a pretty important topic for Cardano's success to acquire skilled developers, this proposal positively affects the development of Cardano. The solution was to develop tools and systems that provide fully transparent accounting and treasury management for projects, built on the Cardano & Catalyst Ecosystem. together with the Catalyst Swarm & The Treasury Guild, we develop the first tools & suits, platforms, and services for the Cardano Community which help to build strong and transparent auditable, Treasury and Accounting processes. This proposal's problem and solution statement is presented simply and clearly, and it is agreed that the proposal effectively addresses the challenge. Guild & SwarmLabs funds build and develop products from the Community, for the community. At the heart of this proposal and on building Accountability and trust between Projects & Communities and aligned with the goals of this challenge:\n-Increasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use helps enrich the ecosystem with new use cases\n-Increased number of integrations bringing existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between disparate products\n-Enhance the quality of existing products and integrations through suggested improvements supported by customer feedback or increased usage", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This project has been in operation since the fourth quarter of 2022 and has so far accomplished certain goals that we can fully track based on the links that the proposal provides. Since the proposed work has already been done, I take it as an answer that the proposal will be successfully implemented. It's great that the proposal provided enough information so that we can understand more from the scale to the roadmap, the team as well as the major partners behind this project. Regarding the roadmap, the proposal provides a detailed plan for the 3rd & 4th quarters of -2022 so we have a very clear view of the project's process. Next is the budget, $66,100 was requested and also explained clearly and convincingly. We understand what the money will be used for in great detail. And finally, about the team, the recommended team is also very well described, we know who they are, what their experience is, and what role they play in this proposal, through each member's LinkedIn page, the more I strengthen my faith in the group. Without a doubt, with the experience and plan presented, I am confident that it is very likely that this proposal will be successfully implemented.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the proposal provides enough evidence to audit its progress and success. The community can completely follow the project based on the links that the group has provided. This way the testability is done well, and there is enough detail to understand how things are going and how we can monitor them. It is impressive that such a large amount of work has been initiated, and beyond the scope of the funds required for this proposal. A very detailed scheme is presented, the proponents are very transparent about themselves and the requested funds are very low, which clearly shows the honest motivation of the proponent\nThe success of the project is so clearly defined it is the progressive development of our Treasury & Accounting products & services, the successful integration of our tools with the Projects Catalyst & Cardano communities, and the set up of a SwarmLabs environment that allows developers to collaborate on the Projects that are best for them while being rewarded and paid for the interaction and time invested.

Make it easier for projects to report their finances and progress when funded. Therefore this proposal is a perfect fit for the Challenge\nThe developers, builders, and teams on Catalyst are really messed up about financials and reporting. Since they are really not good at that, they always focus on their expertise. This tool, if successful, will be like a breath of fresh air for the entire Catalyst community\nI was really impressed with the previously built toolset, which includes 7 seamless workflows that help build robust accounting, treasury, and audit workflows. As for the audit, I really don't understand how the project evaluates the activities of the projects correctly when all the projects are spread in many areas and many aspects. Not to mention whether the completed result report is really accurate or not. The project please clarify this, and help the community understand more deeply about the project.\nAs for the risk, the project fears that no one will use these tools and has a mitigation plan for that. In addition to promoting the community, I have a few suggestions as follows, take the initiative from small projects to large projects completely free, give them results, and help with their reporting process. Accurate, fast, and transparent.\nAs for the impact, the project is very detailed, I rate it 5 points\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project is expected to last for 2 quarters of 2022, with 12 specific items listed.

For example, spreadsheets, columns, business tables, diagrams, analysis tables, etc. It is suitable for many audiences, easy to provide services, and projects can report progress in many ways differently. As for the detailed budget, the full project listing, all estimated by hours, is very intuitive. With a total application budget of $66,100 accounting for 0.8% of the entire Challenge, a fairly reasonable number to implement\nThe team consists of 2 main members and 4 support members. With 2 social network links provided, you have a lot of experience in the development of treasury automation, and treasury accounting, which is very suitable for project development. I appreciate this. Despite spending all their time on Catalyst, do members participate in other projects in this fund? So how do you arrange your schedule to get the job done well? Please describe specifically for the community to evaluate.\nI trust the feasibility of the project. 5 points for this part\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "You have a lot of links, and social networks to deliver and report on progress. I appreciate this transparency. However, you should list specific indicators for the community to rely on to review the progress of the operation.

Currently, the team is completing the remaining roadmaps of the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2022. The goals for the progress of the project are listed in detail and clearly by the author. The project's progress is easily checkable by followers through the group's attachment pages, which makes it easier for the community to follow. The success is clearly described by the author by integrating the proposal's tools with other Catalyst & Cardano Community Projects and establishing a SwarmLabs environment that allows developers to collaborate on the Projects that are best suited for the project while being rewarded and paid for the interaction and time invested. The success of this proposal is entirely related to the challenge of the campaign it is to create sustainability for the core team and growth by establishing enough relationships with customers. The solution to this challenge is to fundraise Guild & SwarmLabs to build and develops products from the Community.
