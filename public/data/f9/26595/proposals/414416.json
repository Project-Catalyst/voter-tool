The investor community can use this active portal to assess the viability and transparency of projects that are currently being built in the Cardano ecosystem.\nThe solution satisfies the challenge's requirements by offering tools and facilitating users' quick access to information via Telegram, Discord, and text messages on mobile devices. For investors with a long-term interest in the ecosystem, these utilities can offer information and services.\nThe project also listed a number of potential hazards, and there are ways to get around them during implementation, like: server failures, unforeseen expenses, competition from rivals,...\nI give the project a five-star rating since the amenities it offers are highly useful and the team took great care to anticipate and prepare for any challenging circumstances or risks that might arise.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The initiative is a long-term strategy with the aim of issuing tokens soon to pique people' attention.

I understand that on your website, the projects will be publicly displayed for the community to know and understand. The following website serves as a focal point for information about reliable projects for everyone to refer to. Thus, the proposal has solved the goal set out in the Challenge. When everyone has information about projects built on the Cardano blockchain, there will be more opportunities for investors and developers to act, discuss and evaluate the projects they care about. heart. This adds value to the Cardano ecosystem. So I can confirm this proposal has an impact on the Cardano ecosystem. But this effect takes time for us to see clearly. And it will take time to scale and address future challenges. What I find interesting is that the website is built on a multilingual platform. This is not possible on any website in Vietnam. From here it is clear that the team has focused on web development and community development. This challenge desperately needs such impactful proposals. I completely agree with the impact of the proposal. I vote 5 stars.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I am quite impressed to know that the team has experienced people in the blockchain and crypto fields. The number of team members is not much, but I understand that behind the team there are collaborators to implement the proposal. What makes me very satisfied is that the members' identities have been clearly shown through social networks. Here the community can look up the exact identity of each member. This is also an important factor to confirm the feasibility of the proposal and the credibility of the team. However, I wonder if the team has the staff to do market marketing? In your team, the number of programmers is the majority, but there are not many members in charge of marketing. Can you be more specific about this? I rate this as a very good community project. Even so, we need to go deeper into controllability. When project owners propose their projects to be posted on the website, do the project owners' proposals control the interactive content? If so, how? I want to ask this because we need to take measures to avoid junk projects, and non-standard projects, only select qualified projects and show them on the website for the community to see clearly. I have comments on the content of projects posted by project owners that must be censored. Or you can consult my other advice is to charge the project owner when they intend to put the project on DCOne's website (collect fee to avoid garbage project). Do the projects selected to be posted on the website have to meet any criteria? Especially in the early stages of implementing the proposal, this censorship must be rigorous to select the best. Create a premise in the future, the reputation of the website and the team will be improved. I believe that the team can do well on that part of the censorship, even taking into account the case of content attacks, and how to deal with them to get the best results in the fastest time possible. I understand the team that built this proposal toward two audiences, DApps developers and users, the important thing is to attract users. This has a lot to do with communication so that people can know the implementation proposal in action and then become users. That's why I want to emphasize the importance of advertising and marketing. It is very good that the team has a majority of members writing programming, but there should also be more members in charge of communication, marketing, and product advertising to the community to attract users. The budget has been broken down by items, which I find reasonable with the goal. The only thing I recommend about the budget is the time to pay wages, calculate the cost should be calculated according to the working hours. For revenue, besides the team asking for Catalyst to sponsor, does the team have any other sources of income? I think that with your existing software development capacity, you can completely create another source of revenue to continue developing the proposal in case you have not yet applied for funding. The use of multiple languages \u200b\u200bon the website makes me feel interesting and I have a question: For the language to be expressed so richly, what means does the team use to do and how? This is something that other websites can learn from. In terms of risks and challenges, the team booked $2000 in advance for unforeseen expenses during the implementation process. I find this very rewarding, however, I recommend that the team come up with a verifiable plan if additional funding is needed. In summary, I feel quite satisfied with the aspects of the team presented in the proposal. I just put up a few comments to help clarify the issue. I vote 4 stars.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is quite clear in terms of auditability and transparency. That is shown in detail in the roadmap and divided milestones by months. I think it's much nicer in terms of layout when you tie the implementation roadmap to specific months of a year. The KPIs are quite clear with the main criteria. Throughout the proposal, problems are clearly described and solutions are attached. I am very pleased with this. However, I would like to contribute to the team with constructive questions: What mechanism can you consider to increase the transparency of the proposal? Is it a centralized mechanism to track community interactions with project owners? I think the team should move towards decentralization and issue tokens. Issuing tokens is also a way to promote this proposal when applied in practice, and further demonstrate the professionalism of the proposal. I think the team's proposal for this project is very good, but I think there will be high competition in the future, so my advice is that we should move towards decentralization to improve competition. Becoming decentralized is also an inevitable trend for applications built on the Cardano blockchain platform. Regarding the censorship mechanism, does the team plan to tighten the censorship mechanism when the number of projects is increasing on the website? I know building apps requires huge infrastructure? If only relying on DCOne, is it possible to do the whole thing? Then when the whole implementation is done, can transparency be ensured? I find it convincing to watch the team define project success. It is based on actual updates from the number of projects shown on the website and the number of users. The number is expected to increase gradually over the months (mainly from investors who follow projects working in the blockchain, crypto environment and developers associated with businesses - they need more information working environment is needed). All in all, I completely agree that this proposal should be able to raise funds with the budget you requested, along with some work that needs to be done to ensure transparency and easy audit. easy.

This is a useful and very beneficial product for the Cardano ecosystem because it creates a multi-dimensional, multilingual information exchange channel for the Cardano community, helping the ecosystem move towards the goal of decentralization. The solution of the project is to build a multilingual website, help users get official information from project owners, and use many free tools and bots. For project owners, they also have an effective information channel to reach a wider community of users. Therefore, the project has a huge impact on the Cardano ecosystem. Moreover, because the website is built on a multilingual basis, it can reach a lot of people because it is not limited due to language barrier.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project's staff is relatively complete and experienced, suitable for developers from FPT company - where leading experts in the field of information technology in Vietnam are concentrated.

According to the team\u2019s plan, the platform will support multi-languages. Because language barrier is still a big problem, people who speak other languages would benefit greatly from this effort. It will be a huge information resource. This project is a general information project so it helps to keep the community as fully informed as possible. It also provides SDK for programmers to quickly access their work and connect with the Cardano blockchain.

They declared: \u201cif their project isn\u2019t funded in Catalyst, they will continue their project\u201d. I can see how passionate they are about their project. They need $30300 to make their project, and their plan for this budget is very detailed. In their team, they have staff members who have technical knowledge, blockchain knowledge and experience with their project so they absolutely can do it. Moreover, they also have a demo of their platform and they are still building it. But there are some points which they should consider when they work on this project.\nFirst, due to having to collect a lot of information from many projects, the team needs more human resources in communication and marketing. But according to the team, they haven\u2019t had enough people having skills in communication and marketing. \nSecond, I have some questions with the team. When there are many projects participating in their platform, how do they ensure that all project information can be controlled? I mean how do they check all project information? And, they should also have solutions for this situation.\nThird point, It is very difficult to determine whether a project is a scam or not so it is necessary to develop a set of criteria to evaluate a project. In addition, the team should let the community participate in the assessment which will bring more objectivity.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "When the DCone's team presented their project on Zoom, they answered all our questions about techniques and solutions for the project.

Yes, information on the project owner's communication channels is usually one-way, dominated by the project owner. There are cases where information that is correct but detrimental to the project will often be discarded. This condition occurs often but is very difficult to recognize. The community needs a solution for this. So I welcome this project.\nYour solution will help users get information quickly through the web tools you develop. Look up information about the project via tools Telegram, discord,... This not only makes information about the project transparent, but also increases the interaction between the community and the project, making it easy for the community to access when The number of projects is increasing.\nI think you need a method of categorizing information sources, because not all information is completely correct and automatic updating will not solve this. For example information provided by the project owner, as you mentioned, this information could be wrong as it is presented in favor of the project. You need to check carefully before confirming this information and giving it to users.
