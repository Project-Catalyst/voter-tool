The costs are detailed and reasonable compared to the common ground for each job position with blockchain developer $80 an hour, graphic designer $55 an hour,... The only thing The most I think about the feasibility of this proposal is that in addition to this project they have submitted 4 more proposals for funding, assuming all 5 are funded ( this is difficult but it is not impossible), how will they allocate time to implement all 5 proposals to ensure the proposals meet the committed schedule.

Maybe football leagues in the world really need applications for bookies like this, the English Premier League, the Spanish, French, German, or European football leagues, which are very exciting every weekend. Different from the traditional applications ADABET App is built on Cardano's blockchain technology, players can transact via ADA cryptocurrency and combine it directly with their wallet. As described in the recommendation Sports Betting Mobile App is a decentralized application for sports betting that allows players to create their own accounts, place bets, and self-monitor their wealth management. With most traditional betting platforms evaluating bookmakers and focusing entirely on credit card transactions and payment systems, this limits the transparency of bet transactions. Therefore, there are many betting platforms that are established with low reputations, causing damage to players participating on these platforms that lack safety and security.\nIt is clear that this is an application that affects traditional betting applications, affecting betting and crypto enthusiasts, especially in the Cardano community.\nThe proposed risks include:\nPolicy, Technology not yet supported, ADA Coin Down and Internal team are all manageable issues. I have looked through the betting licenses they attached which are indeed reputable organizations (Cagayan Economic Zone Authority, Isle of Man, PAGCOR..)

I believe they are serious and very intelligent people. They have built several startups that develop games and mobile apps. Such quality personnel will be more likely to complete this project well.\nSome of the things that I review in this section are project budget requirements, and development plans. All of them are reasonable and there is nothing to worry about here, very complete and suitable for the proposal.\nOne point to add is that allocating into projects is so good and responsible, I've seen many of their proposals, quote:\n\u201cResponsibilities of members:\nConsulting technology and learning solutions to solve problems appearing in the project.\nExecuting the assigned tasks in the project.\nDevelop detailed functionality of the designed application.\nBuild and deploy Apps.\nSecurity, network, implementation platform.\nAll our proposals in Fund 9 & team members:\nANIMETA | Anime Museum Metaverse\nCardano NO MORE Plastic Straws |C4O\nADABET.iO | Cardano Betting DApp\nThis => ADABET.iO |Sports Betting Mobile App\nIRONSKY NFT GAME | Build on Mobile\u201d\n\nEverything is great.

There is no denying that the potential for cryptocurrency fusion with the global betting market is huge, with high entertainment and spillover value to the sports-related entertainment industries in the future.\nThis is a completely new application and has never been built on Cardano.

According to my observation, the sports betting market is a huge market, with an annual transaction value of up to hundreds of billions of dollars. The sport is growing and the industry supporting it brings huge revenue. According to the figures, this proposal gives separate numbers for betting on sports such as football, tennis, golf, racing, and basketball .. to ~ $ 76 billion, a very impressive number. \nHowever, most of the betting platforms today are centralized and the bookie has full control of the player's decisions such as transactions, betting odds, payment methods, or payout times. That system is not completely automatic, but most of the players are controlled. The ADABET APP is a small proposal in the ADABET.iO platform that solves the existing problems of the traditional operating platform. This application allows players to have complete autonomy in depositing, withdrawing, and placing bets as well as without needing to prove an account in the bank. ADABET APP will integrate many features of the blockchain platform, players can directly integrate ADA wallet to create connections for transactions as well as manage their assets. \nThis is completely independent of the house because your assets are completely on the Cardano blockchain that the house can not interfere with, each completed transaction of your crypto assets will be instantly updated and recorded on the Cardano blockchain.

Jobs from small to large are also fully listed with quarterly time. A project lasting 6 months to 1 year will ensure a certain level of success. The progress and timeline of this project are completely up to me. As a user, I think it is advisable to develop a trial version within 6 months to get feedback from players and perfect it.\nThe members working on this project are developers of mobile applications with many years of experience. I trust their expertise and what they are building for this application. They are not contractors but engineers who work directly to create the product. I have authenticated these members through the communication channels they provide in the proposal. Often contractors, advertising marketers or SEO (only analyzing the market) will not be able to write detailed technical work like this proposal. The level of capital calling for this project is not large, about $81,000 for the whole project, especially since it has been broken down to ensure all jobs have associated expenses. We can see more demos and screens that ADABET App is building, there are many new features that traditional betting apps do not have, such as ADA wallet connection, asset management, graphs catalog, functions, and rich betting content.

Fast deposit and low fee asset transactions based on Cardano blockchain transactions, customers only wait a few seconds for the transaction to complete in real-time.\nIf you are a sports betting lover, independent of traditional finance, independent of focusing on 1 bookmaker, ADABET APP is the application that completely satisfies you and replaces the old platform, It will solve the problems for the old betting app: (transaction speed, liquidity, transaction fee, intuitive interface).\nIn this proposal, the developers provide internal project management tools as well as sharing links for the community to track the project progress, making it completely easy to look up and see the development through their website. www.adabet.io.

You may not change, or interfere with, any transaction on it once the transaction has been completed. Data is recorded in real-time and synchronized across Cardano's more than 3500 nodes, ensuring the complete decentralization of the ADABET system. Now you can imagine enjoying your weekend with friends watching sports and betting on ADABET, you don't need a credit card or any bank cash, you just need an ADA Wallet to connect. Connected to the system, you can bet on whatever you want. Because the system works on the blockchain, you can completely deposit and withdraw your cryptocurrencies at any time, from there you can cash out into your bank account, really this is a great application.

Everything here could not find a single error in the presentation of deployment plans, work tasks, execution times, and amounts for each item.

This is very convenient for players without losing much time, their identities are secure, and their assets are completely under their control. These are the characteristics of Web 3 and blockchain technology changing the world of digital content on the internet.

Complete graphic design of the App user interface. Finished building APIs for connection to ADABET.IO platform. Completed programming the basic functions of the App. Integrate the ADA wallet connection into the App. Release of MVP version of ADABET App on Smartphones and Table.\nShort-Term Success After 6-12 Months: Complete smart-contract programming in ADABET App. Complete programming of the App features. Complete testing and debugging of the App. Release ADABET App version 1.0 up to Google play store. Release ADABET App version 1.0 up to the Apple store.
