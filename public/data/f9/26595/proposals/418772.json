It is about creating a board game, which, according to the proponent, \u201cuses traditional elements such as dice, hourglass, board and puzzle cards, and can be played in teams or individually. The goal is to overcome puzzles and certain activities to simulate how the blockchain works.\u201d The problem raised is very real, there is no very simple (much less fun) way for people without a technical background to learn about blockchain and Cardano. So the strategy of running a game that can engage people by overcoming challenges they can handle is very necessary. The proponent also states that some activities would be carried out during the match - it would be interesting for him to describe more about them in the scope of the proposal. although it was not explained so clearly in the proposal (\"it is an educational board game with dynamic difficulty where participants buy cards from different decks to advance on the board as quickly as possible, while earning rewards as they progress and affect the board mechanics through \"Smart Contracts\"); the bidder provides an attached document where he explains better about the game mechanics. This is very positive, but I think the best way to understand would be with a video demonstration of some game, it would be great if this was also made available, as it would greatly increase our level of understanding about the exact functioning of each game. In addition to developing the game itself, the idea is to promote a series of events, which from what I understand would be tournaments. Students would compete, under the guidance of instructors, compete for prizes, and learn about a range of topics in the crip world. graphic, as mentioned in the attached document: \u201cwhat are cryptocurrencies? what is Blockchain? what are consensus mechanisms? First Generation Blockchain, Test of Work, Second Generation Blockchain, Smart Contracts\u201d and etc. It is positive as the proponent intends to reach a very high number of faculties (200), but it would be even better if he scored some examples of places where he would work; how he would draw students' attention to events and so on. About the events themselves, we don't have as many explanations attached, we know the percentage of the prize that would be distributed among the winners and etc, but a lot is said about how these events would be planned and organized. Another very important part of the proposal is the survey of risks and possible solutions, well established by the proposer. I believe that the main objective to be accomplished here would be to attract new people to the Cardano community through a new product (the game). More specifically, the topics present in the scope of the challenge that I think are directly related to the proposal are: \u201cIncreasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases + Creation or improvement of different Dapps, products, and integrations that provide value to the Cardano community and wider ecosystem + Integrations with other existing services, products, and protocols that improve the end-user experience whether that's giving the user more options or making something easier to use that benefits the wider ecosystem\u201d. That said, in terms of impact, despite some small pieces of information being missing, the project seems very beneficial and fully aligned with the proposed challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In the matter of the script, unfortunately the information is not passed in an adequate way. I believe that a series of activities would need to be developed for the project to become possible as a whole: in addition to the development of the game itself (improved card and board design + packaging design + create 200 board games). But first commenting on these activities, it would be very positive if we had more detail about each. How would the card and packaging design be created? Which professional would be responsible for this? In the team presentation, no one is introduced as a designer; So would you hire an extra professional for that? Now speaking in relation to the organization of the events, there is no comment on any activity that talks about the pre-production of the same, that is, how to get in touch with the schools (and which schools); how to set the event date; whether there would be any outreach campaigns, so that students who 1) have never heard of blockchain; 2) is not from the technology area; may be interested in the meetings\u2026 It is said in which provinces the events would take place per month, but much more detail should have been given, as I mentioned. The responsibilities of instructors and coordinators are good examples of these activities that should have been better explained. (eg: \u201cCoordinate and supervise quality standards in the manufacture of games. Organize the logistics of learning events in schools/institutes in Ecuador. Interview with school authorities/institutes in Ecuador\u201d). Talking about the costs, the amount requested is high, in my view, and it is well explained and a few points - as in the breakdown of the cost to create the game, we know exactly how much each little part would cost, like the decks, deck separators, boxes and etc; But other expenses could be better argued. We know what the salaries of instructors and coordinators would be, but we don't know how many hours they would dedicate each month to creating the game, so it's not possible to understand the amount charged per hour of work. On the part of air and bus tickets, it would be beneficial to understand which tickets would be, how many would they be, from where to where, and if there would be no way to make this expense cheaper (for example, instead of air travel, it could be organized so that you can who lived closer to the colleges to organize events there, I don't know). All this could be better explained. Finally talking about the team, once again this topic is also not suitable, unfortunately. We don't know who the team members are in detail. In total there will be 5 people, only 3 of which are already defined (ideally, they all were). And about David, Fernando and Andr\u00e9s, it would be necessary to attach a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 about each one, explaining what their areas of training are and how they relate to Cardano, and not just their linkedin profiles. For these reasons, I believe there is still a lot to be reformulated on the topic of feasibility.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The metrics raised to monitor progress only allow us to understand the partial results and are entirely numerical: \u201cNumber of board games delivered to schools/technical institutes after the learning session + players participating in the game + portfolios created\u201d. I believe that a number of necessary information are pending. For example, how could we monitor the improvement of the game's design, its distribution among educational institutions, the definition of these places for the tournaments, the publicity of the events, how many students would be engaging and in what way? The first thing that could be improved is the detailing of the roadmap, we understand more precisely what would need to be done, how, by whom, when\u2026 Unfortunately, the way this auditability is suggested, it is not possible to adequately monitor the activities that would be behind these partial successes. So my suggestion is that the bidder first make the script more accurate; then, create reports at the end of each month, with updates on how the professionals involved have been working, in addition to the KPIs mentioned here; and after that is easily achievable by our community. This communication channel could be on the discord server reserved for us to audit the funded proposals. We know that a monthly report is always sent to the Catalyst coordinators, but our community needs to be aware of the news as well. Talking now about the success scenario, again the suggested information is scarce, the success indicators are also entirely numerical (\"delivery of 200 board games to 200 schools/educational institutes after a learning session + participation of at least 6000 people in-game + creation of at least 800 wallets). It is necessary that we have a much deeper understanding of the consequences of the project. Were all the planned tournaments held? How was the involvement of the students who participated? If there would be 200 faculties, the goal is for 6000 people to participate in the tournaments, so 30 people are expected to participate in each event. Would they have gone? And how could we understand how, after playing and understanding blockchain better, they would have joined the cryptographic community? Had they become active members of our community? Would technology students have engaged in studying our tools, such as Cardano's programming languages \u200b\u200b(Haskell and Plutus)? Would those young people who are not in the technology area have sought to get involved with blockchain, either through Catalyst (such as PAs, for example), or by becoming project interns, in the various areas that we need skilled labor? As can be seen, a series of research could be done. My suggestion is that the proponent keeps in touch with some participants of the events after the event so that they can collect this feedback and present it to us, for example, during some post Townhall space.

The game set will be put into universities to teach in order to popularize blockchain to students and graduate students. Through games, players will remember longer the knowledge that seems to be academic and hard to remember. At the same time, it creates curiosity for participants about blockchain technology as well as Cardano and then delves into this technology.

Aspects to evaluate include:\n- Detailed plan: the proposed team has provided us with excellent and detailed information about the process of implementing this project. First we have time to mass produce the board game. Next we have a plan with each timeline that will approach the Colleges/Technical Institutes. A roadmap proved to be very systematic and I believe that the proposed team has prepared carefully for this plan.\n- Budget breakdown: includes production costs and teaching costs. I am quite pleased with each specific expense explained. We have quantities and unit prices for each game set material. We have teaching hours and what is the average hourly wage. Very detailed here!\n- Team experience: the instructor has a certain amount of experience in blockchain, and he is also a systems engineer so I believe in how he conveys this understanding to the surrounding community.
