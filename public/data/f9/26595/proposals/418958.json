Through the information they provide as well as the reference links they are experienced people corresponding to the positions in the proposal, which is fine but if they can provide more information about the credentials received, or the products they have actually made will help readers evaluate more visually. on the budget they asked for $63000 detailed listed corresponding to obvious specific jobs, at a cost of $30 an hour for API development and database design is quite suitable, but if it's possible to clarify more specifically what it is, why get the figure of 370 hours for API development similar to database work time from where? 260 hours. similar to other jobs. The proponent should provide more completeness so that I can judge these numbers as factual and not random numbers for cost calculation. Final blueprint including progress and milestones. The proponent has provided a plan from Q3 2022 to Q1 2023 and has further plans for the future. corresponding to the amount of time each proponent has listed clear work items. but if there are more timelines for announcing achievements, it will be more complete, for example on 15/07/2022 announcing the assignment of tasks to the community; dated 30/7/2022 announced project plan and POC,...

The reason I don\u2019t rank this section a 5 is because there isn\u2019t enough tangibly quantified impacts to weigh against the cost to determine if this is a worthwhile investment (which is much more important for proposals that are a bit more expensive such as this one). I would\u2019ve liked to see some kind of research on how effective loyalty programs can be, how different companies do with/without loyalty programs, and any other type of status quo data/research. This information can help voters see the need for this type of development and/or what greater benefit this might serve that would be worth the requested funding. The rest of this section has plenty of substance for voters to react positively to but I think this little bit of extra detail will secure that confidence. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "For an extremely detailed roadmap, a budget that demonstrates impressive efficiency, and a demonstrably capable team (with junior developer participation to increase experience) I rank this section a 5. I think voters will respond well to this core team because the junior developers having a chance to learn from more experienced developers could be an impact on its own. The experience of all core team members is well cited with LinkedIn profiles and capability is clear. The roadmap is painfully detailed with every bit of information and description about every task that will be worked on and how long it will take to deliver a completed product. Furthermore, the budget breaksdown every hour of labor needed to complete the project AND makes a more expensive proposal sound like a cheap one with the impressive level of efficiency applied here. It might be worth noting that the hours allocated for each task seems a bit more than other proposals I have seen but I doubt that any Cardano community members are likely to vote against the slow and steady approach. I think they do everything right here. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For providing an unprecedented depth of observation in their definition for succes, I rank this section a 5. This proposal lists KPIs that I wouldn\u2019t have even thought of to point out, which I think points to an intended extraordinary standard of quality for this product. The number of measured categories is beyond anything that I typically see in Catalyst proposals and I expect voters will recognize the tremendous degree of advanced forethought put into the expectations for the future of this project. I do wish that I would\u2019ve seen more projected milestone based metrics that sets goals for different timeframes post-proposal, but that\u2019s honestly just personal preference at this point. I think voters will be paying attention to this one to make sure this portion of the proposal isn\u2019t just \u201call talk\u201d but it seems clear to me that this is a higher-level proposal.

ADALoyal is a loyalty platform on the Cardano network that applies to real-life applications, and on Dapps, ADALoyal has a real impact on users, they receive rewards from programs, customers will also be consulted and use the best services. Data about loyal customers is needed for businesses to attract and grow the market. The solution enhances the user experience with the way of \"building a collection anyone can use. For example, Play to Earn, Buy to Make Money, Go Shopping and Earn NFT, etc.\" The right solution helps users get creative and participate in Cardano's projects, which develop the Cardano ecosystem. NFT contains information for identity loyalty created that helps clients manage and increase the communication of project owners and customers, which is consistent with the implementation solution. The author has identified the risks that could affect the proposal, the shortage of Cardano smart contract resources will be addressed with appropriate research and development strategies.

This time works that is going to the length of the 9-month start from Q3/2022 to Q1/2023. In each quarter, the tasks were listed and one thing I liked about this was that the proponent carefully provided the outputs of the tasks. So we have a very clear vision of the project's plan.\nNext is the project team, we know who the team members are in their way and detail, like their names, a brief description of their area of \u200b\u200bexpertise and experience, as well as a profile link that we can take a look at. The proposal also outlines the roles of all members of this project, with the profile provided, I am very confident that this team will successfully implement the proposal.\nFinally, the allotted budget can work and get straight to the point. The proposal asks for $63,000 to be broken down into verifiable categories.

The proposal is also given several quantifiable KPIs, and the team will also use Github auto-deploy to push the latest code onto the servers to make the development product available to everyone. This proposal is fully trackable by the community through weekly reporting.\nThe success of the project is also described in great detail, the team proposal is listed some of the successes from the user point of view, the business point of view, and the product development point of view. If the proposal is financially supported, the team will return for another round to bring their loyalty to real-life applications.

It can also be stated that this type of program allows the brand to know its customers better, what they like and dislike, so as to \"keep them happy\" so that they not only continue buying, but also, very possibly, that customer can naturally become an ambassador of the brand. According to the team preparing this proposal, the lack of loyalty programs in the ecosystem represents a lost opportunity for different projects. Even though we are aware that the above mentioned works in the \"traditional world\" or web2, it would have been interesting if the team would have provided data or research to support the argument that such solutions are imperative in the web3. Assuming that the same benefits mentioned above can be replicated in crypto users I can agree that this proposal would add value to Cardano.

The plan closes with a description of the actions that are expected to be implemented in the future, once L2 solutions and Babel fees are available. Regarding the budget, once again they do an excellent job of breaking it down into 9 clearly identifiable line items, which briefly describe what is expected to be completed for each item, the total hours estimated for each, as well as the cost per hour of work according to specialty. I find the hourly rate assigned to smart contract development lower than what I have encountered in other projects at Catalyst. However, from a high level, the budget seems appropriate.
