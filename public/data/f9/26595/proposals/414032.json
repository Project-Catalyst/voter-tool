The proposal was also well received by the CAs in Fund 8, but it did not receive funding due to unforeseen circumstances; and now we find ourselves with you in Fund 9! Building a decentralized application (Dapp) that allows users to \"easily transact with their stablecoin collateral, forget about slippage and impermanent loss, apply leverage for efficiency, higher capital utilization, collateral protection through partial liquidation and insurance funds, participation in trading contests and other incentives\" is a very reasonable proposition, so that long-term investors as well as short-term investors can increase their assets. This is a large-scale proposition. The group has proposed a concept that they call \"perpetual contract.\" Although it may sound very novel, if they are successful in building Dapps, this may be a way to solve the issue of slippage as well as the loss of assets that occurs during trading. Building a Dapp with such outstanding advantages is not only necessary but also reasonable. Not only does it meet the requirements of the vast majority of investors with regard to transaction fees, as some existing DEX exchanges do, but it also reduces the likelihood of price slippage. The proposal also provides an in-depth analysis of the challenges that will be faced by the team, as well as reasonable suggestions for overcoming those challenges.

Their experience explains the hourly pay so it seems fair to me. Therefore the budget is reasonable. The project needs additional funding to become a fully functional dApp. \nI strongly agree because if the skills of the team, the clear budget outline.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team has provided the timeplan for one, three and six months. The goals seem reasonable. It would be nice to have a bigger look into the future. Maybe some plans when you want to develop the dApp. Please provide some more infos on when you want to use the created knowledge from this fund.\nThe Metrics of success are easily observable but I would have liked to see some specific numbers. For example you could have specialized the engagement on social media like 500 Followers\u2026. \nThey will post development milestones on a social media channel so the development and progress should be observable from the outside.

This would be a significant advance for Cardano DeFi and might have a significant effect on the ecosystem as a whole. If implemented, the idea will add a number of really intriguing new characteristics to the landscape and is very convincingly detailed. Since the platform aims to be a viable choice for high-frequency trading, the concern of L1 network congestion is brought up; nevertheless, since the engineers on the proposal team are closely working with the development of Hydra, the product should be ready to launch as soon as scaling solutions are live. This proposal does effectively addresses the challenge", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team's expertise and track record are sufficient to carry out this plan successfully. Additionally, each team member's github links have been supplied, which is great. The proposal makes a convincing case for the roadmap and the requirement for developing a comprehensive engineering document for technical specification. This proposal just serves as a seed for the product's development rather than serving as funding for the full project. As a result, the suggested budget of US$66,800 is adequate for the required work. All of the specified phases make sense in the context of the broader pre-production stage of the product, and the budget is clearly broken down according to the number of hours needed to perform each work. I am confident that MLabs will be able to deliver on the extent of this proposal given their track record in the Cardano arena. Given their expertise and skills, the deliverables listed on the roadmap have a very high probability of being accomplished.\u00a0", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is clearly quite audible. Their social media channels, which will publish development milestones, will allow you to keep up with the proposal's progress. They also gave information on the project's impact as well as critical KPIs that will be highly useful to the auditors. They have also included a list of EternalSwap's fundamental features and anticipated features. These alone are sufficient to gauge the proposal's development. The goals stated for one month, three months, and six months can be used to gauge how well the idea is working.
