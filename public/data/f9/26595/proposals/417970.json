This proposal is exactly that. The proposal is creating an Open Source platform for NFT Analytic tool which I believe many of Cardano NFT users would benefit from. The proposal mentioned that they would create their own platform and even integrate with existing platforms which is a huge plus for me. There are many existing NFT marketplace in Cardano that requires analytic tools to further drive adoption. However established marketplace has similar tools as described by this proposal, thus the impact may not be as groundbreaking. All in all, I score it a solid 4 out of 5 as this proposal still effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal has all the detailed listed down. By allocating each deliverables by modules, the proposal clearly shows the time needed and cost breakdown of each modules over a time range of 6 months. With this information, the project seems achievable. The team seems solid, with an experienced graphic designer along with a group of software engineers with experience ranging from 2 to 3 years. Though lacking track record, I still believe the team can accomplished the task. With this, it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Clear and precise deliverables and roadmap are listed in this proposal. There is a clear communication channel with Discord as well, which is good for community to track the progress. The proposal stated the KPI and metric indicator to quantify the success of the project clearly and precisely.

There indeed is a dire need for an NFT platform with inbuild analytics in the Cardano chain. It is also the main reason that hinders the growth of Cardano-based NFTs. We have seen many proposals that are facilitating the migration of Ethereum to Cardano and also a lot of proposals working on FIAT payments from Cardano NFTs, but with a lack of a solid Analytics platform, there will always be a sense of doubt amongst the buyers and would prefer not to take chances. This proposal might be a great addition to all the projects working on NFT improvement. The Cardano NFTs would get great exposure and demand if a tool such as this is integrated into every explorer through the open-source APIs. The impact of this proposal is in alignment with the Challenge's expectation of increasing the Cardano adoption and also increasing its popularity.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provides the readers with a detailed game plan and also shows that an extensive amount of research has already been done. The proposer also duly notes the skills required and also provides substantiated evidence to prove that the team has the same. Any reader who goes through the plan can easily estimate that the amount of backend API work is overwhelming compared to the UI/UX work and the funds allocated follows a similar trend. But the team irrespective of how experienced they are in their respective fields seems to be Frontend heavy. The division of workload and pay is something of concern to me as a reader. However, the plan is elaborate with crystal clear milestones associated with every phase of the timeline. There has been extensive background work already been done and it is evident in the features the analytics platform will provide and also the timeline to achieve each of them is apt and just, all in all, the proposal can be viewed optimistically and said that there is substantial evidence to assume the that the team will come through if funded.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Apart from the concern with the team structure, there are no other issues with the way the author has presented the proposal in front of the community. There are clear indicators that the auditors could use to measure the progress of the project. The open-source nature makes it more easy to keep an eye on the development. Regular commits are a great way to track the progress in addition to the other pre-launch KPIs that the author mentions briefly in the proposal. Research documents, monthly reports, feedback loops, and announcements over discord channels are the available ways for the community to know about the progress. Post completion, other perceptible metrics such as the number of adoptions, and the number of logins come into the picture. The short-term goals and the long-term goals are distinct and separate but both lies within the requirements of the challenge at hand. Hence, the provided KPIs are plenty and apt for easy monitoring of the implementation and the overall success.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2704", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7898, "q0": "The proposer aims to build an \u201cOpen Source NFT analytics platform with free and open individual tool API integration\u201d. This will help individuals and businesses who are building on Cardano. OpenCNFT has a free API but it has its limitations. For example, on policyIDs it only allows up to five pages of data.  You can check out their API here: https://api.opencnft.io/1/#/Public/PublicController_getAssetTransaction. A free open source tool like this can allow anyone with the know-how to extract CNFT data and do some analytics. Free tools like this will enable more people to develop on the Cardano ecosystem. More people developing in the ecosystem will result in a better and more variety of products and services. Better and diverse products and services will add value to the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has provided reference links for all the team members. The team is well educated and has a broad range of skills which includes web developering, graphics designing, UI/UX and product design. One of the team members is a graduate of the Plutus pioneer program. Some of the team members are involved in already working products in the Cardano ecosystem, These factors add a lot to the credibility of the team. \n\nThe budget is well load out and mostly includes the budgeted hours for this project. One can easily link the budget to the roadmap which was also good to see. The proposer has also considered the risks and ways to mitigate these risks. For example, to ensure \u201cease of use \u201d for the user, the team has suggested having \u201cuser experience research & iterative design feedback loops\u201d. This will allow the team to tweak their tool for the best user experience. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "What will define the success for this project was well outlined. I liked that the proposer split this section into short-term and long-term success.The roadmap was very articulate describing each phase in detail with how long each phase will take. This shows that the team has put a lot of thought into this plan and knows what to execute and when. \n\nThe problem(CNFT analytics APIs) the team wants to solve is well described and the open source API solution addresses the target problem. The proposer also extensively listed out how the community will be to audit this proposal. This ranges from bi-weekly announcements on their Discord servers, to progress reports and progress viewable on their github repository.

The suggestion is to develop an open source NFT analytics platform with free and open individual tool API integration for any organization or individual building on Cardano. I have no difficulty defining the relationship between the problem statement and the appropriate follow-up solution. Personally, I like the idea and believe it is in accordance with the challenge setting, not to mention that it is cool and impactful. The team has supplied sufficient and precise (which is equally necessary) information on the technical specifics for implementation, as well as a section devoted to potential threats that may occur negatively affecting the executed plan, as well as reasonable measures to mitigate them. This project can easily scale up, in my opinion. This proposal will fulfill a void in the present ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As much as I enjoyed the idea, I like the description of the team experience and plan section for this proposal. The proposal's main team is completely transparent. Each team member's expertise and skill are clearly shown, and these are reinforced by both linkedin profiles. This is an advantage in my opinion since it is critical to validate the proposer's claims that they already have a certain level of abilities and knowledge necessary to assist this proposal succeed. Concerning the implemented plan, it is provided in the sense of what they want to achieve in the following six months, which is split progressively and fairly elaborate. They outlined how this project would be approached by defining the development processes (in a particular period of days), the milestones for each step are presented precisely and can be achieved. Not only did the team do a good job of providing a Discord link so that the community can monitor the progress of the UX/UI phase, but they also provided additional information on the backend and frontend development timelines so we know what tasks will be completed after a specific time horizon and in what order. Given the timing and objectives, the proposal's development effort seems realistic. Budget-wise, the amount of the requested fund makes sense to me in light of the hourly rates for each role and the workload necessary to finish this work. It's great to have a breakdown of the real prices outlined in the roadmap. The frontend and backend efforts are divided into hourly rates, and additional information is provided to the community on the hours dedicated by each expert, how much work (X days * X hours * X hourly rate) it takes to complete each of the parts, so that voter trust is robust. Overall, a fantastic plan with a lot of promise.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "It is transparent how the project's progress will be audited. I like the clear and thorough success definition, the success indicators, and the list of post-launch KPIs given in the proposal text, which, in my opinion, match well with the challenge's objectives. I also feel that this would assist any community member in determining the effectiveness of the plan. It's fantastic that the proposal also specifies how the community can follow progress; the current status of the implementation will be available on their Discord with a direct link, making it much easier to determine whether or not the project is a success. The team behind this proposal is undoubtedly dedicated, and by analyzing them, I am confident that they will eliminate any potential obstacles for the community in doing audit activities at any moment. In addition, I observe a clear identification of a problem as well as a highly technical and in-depth comprehension of the proposed solution.
