The intention is to build Startverse (a metaverse) on which people can build real startups with minimal spending. Metaverse gives the opportunity to people who want to create a startup but no capital, no knowledge and that if the startup fails you still have money left. The main problems are already included in the proposal (NFT game problems). To solve these problems, the creators of this proposal have opted for a unique concept, brand features, action to earn, free to play, high quality and technique. It has already been clearly described how this metaverse will be constructed. This will consist of 8 core elements. These are clearly written out. This proposal offers a solution to the requested problem statement. This project will have a positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem provided there is sufficient marketing to publicize this project. The proposal includes a roadmap that clearly states how the proposed solution addresses the challenge. The project will be carried out in 3 phases, each lasting 6 months. The risks that could prevent the project from succeeding have also been taken into account (long project, downward trend of the market, 3 projects in fund 9). The proposal is very transparent and gives a clear picture that this project can have a major impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal includes the people involved in this project. The entire team is well described on their website (https://startverse.io/#team). It would be useful to include relevance links in the proposal. The proposal contains a clear description of who is needed to make this project a success. The team has provided a document detailing what the funding will be used for. .The budget will be sufficient to partially finance the project. It is stated that financing will probably be required in the future. A realistic timetable is included. (about 2 years). Normally there will be enough time to finish this. It will be important that the market is in a positive flow. The proposal lists the resources needed to carry out the project (for money). The proposal clearly states what the technical aspects of startverse will be. It also states everything that will be present in the project. A clear study has been made of the risks that must be considered for the project to be successful. I am a supporter of this project. With sufficient financing, this can be a great success.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is a very clear road map with associated milestones. This roadmap is very comprehensive and offers a lot of transparency for the people. Parts of the project have already been completed. On the website of the project you can clearly see that a lot of hard work has been done. The website can also be used to report interim evaluations of the project. KPIs are clearly included to measure project success. It is good that short-term and long-term success are taken into account. I think it is certainly possible to have more than 100 000 fans on social media channels. It will be very important to conduct good marketing campaigns and to have cooperation with large communities. Startverse can certainly offer a solution for this requested problem.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2940", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 2, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8670, "q0": "The race to build Metaverse is becoming fierce because of the participation of technology giants, corporations are pouring all their enthusiasm and resources to develop a Metaverse that belongs to them, because they know that those who hold a stronger metaverse infrastructure will gain an advantage in the future. How to create the greatest competitive advantage for metaverse projects that do not come from big technology companies/groups when they have great advantages in terms of brand awareness, loyal customers/users? It's a sprint to growth, with diverse, unique, and genuinely outstanding features, borrowing the names of the big brands. I think it's a wise move for this proponent to call for funding and develop the project in Cardano's name. Despite the advantages of technology and resources, the interconnectedness between the metaverse and concepts like decentralization, NFTs, stablecoins is limiting the conversion of users for corporations, while it is a beneficial advantage of blockchains like Cardano because we have a user base that has a certain understanding of the above concepts and it is a good starting point for later user conversion. I believe, Cardano will not pass up any opportunity to build their own metaverse, including this project. So far, this project has had a clear outline of the concepts they will build into the metaverse, clearly describing salient features, and user engagement guides. Time is the biggest advantage and also the biggest risk in this project if anything delays the completion of the metaverse, so the proponent has also set out mitigation options for this problem. I think 2 years is the suitable amount of time to complete, to be able to reduce the risk of users getting impatient in the meantime, a proper marketing campaign, community building, user experience releases, etc can be an effective way to retain users. Luckily, I saw these options in their proposal presentation.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Some pieces of work and demo have been completed before the funding call, which shows the ability to execute the project and can trust the team that developed this project. The plan table is presented in a very detailed and logical way, we can easily know when the listed works will be completed, the time for MVP and the official version release. In addition to the blueprint for the development of the metaverse's architectural base, the author also provides a roadmap for the development of ancillary work such as marketing, community building, etc. Because of the relatively heavy workload on this project, such splitting of the two planners will make it easier for the community to track the progress of the project. Estimates of budgets for activities, and documents are too general, they can not provide an overview of the work efforts, I encourage the author to provide additional estimates of the number of projects working hours to facilitate the audit work later. With a long-term and ambitious project like this one, it is necessary to expand the staff in the future. Although there are no clear descriptions for this plan, it is undeniable that the working capacity and the ability to execute the project well of the current main members of the project. Evidence of the results of previous well-done work, the link to the member's verification records, the commitment to professional competence and the ability to complete the project provided by the proponent are the best things to prove my conclusion.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is a roadmap for the audit clearly outlined here, the indicators given are ideal and appropriate for project development capacity and for success assessment. However, the long-term timeline for measurement should be estimated with a more specific number.

They show how to handle these problems through the Startverse project in a clear and understandable way for the reader.\n\t Players in Startverse have the ability to build their own company or just want to generate extra income and can even join this project without fees. The team's idea is to create a world where everyone can do everything like go to work, eat, go to the gym, entertain, interact with others, and more.With this idea, participants can feel a second world that is not much different from the outside world.\n\tThe proposer gives a clear plan consisting of 3 phases and each stage takes 6 months with the tasks to be completed. When the project is completed, they will measure key metrics such as the number of active users, the NFTs exchanged, the brands that work with them, and the number of social media followers.\n\tWith such a large metaverse project, the completion time will be very long.

I believe this is a robust technical team due to the fact that the game has been developed on the website. As I enter the link provided in the solution section, I get to know literally everything about their game. For example, I learn about the features and activities users can do to earn in the game.\nIn the scope of this proposal, the solution they are trying to deliver is to release Marketplace and MVP where users can buy NFTs and start to play the game. This belongs to the 1st phase of the over-two-year project. Key metrics for the 1st phase are well-defined and they help me understand how the project is closely aligned with the challenge\u2019s objective and how it can bring an impact on the adoption of Cardano blockchain. \nOne thing I suppose is missing is probably an explanation of technical aspects about two key products, including MVP on web and Marketplace to sell NFTs. In addition, while they have outlined some kind of challenges they are facing, I would expect them to describe some steps they are planning to take to tackle them well. \"", "q0r": 4, "q1": "\"In terms of feasibility, it is easy to assess since I have no difficulty understanding their roadmap and timeline.

They have broken down the budget for the scope of this proposal - quarter 3, 2022. \nThe experience and expertise related to the core team members has been described as a paragraph which helps me understand how they are a good fit for a project in the game industry. \nHowever, it seems that something is missing. First, the number of members will be required. Secondly, regarding verification, there is no link to personal profiles for checking the information. \nThere are just a few suggestions for further improving the presentation of the roadmap and budget breakdown. Regarding the roadmap, since the focus is on quarter 3, 2022 which has two key deliverables (MVP on web and Marketplace to sell NFTs), the community probably would like to know what will be done in this particular phase, who is/will be in charge of the tasks, and when the tasks will be done.\nAs for the budget breakdown, for instance, since they have the need for hiring more developers and artists, they should specify how much they plan to spend on recruitment and since they plan to improve marketing activities, how much they plan to use for this purpose. \nOverall, I'd say I agree that they have the ability to fulfill the goals. \"", "q1r": 3, "q2": "\"With regard to auditability, I totally agree that there will be little difficulty performing audit exercises in the future.

I just want to know how many blogs per week they plan to publish if possible. \nThe success they can deliver in the scope of this proposal is well-defined as KPIs such as in a 6-month period.
