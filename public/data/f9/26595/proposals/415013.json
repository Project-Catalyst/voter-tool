These same gamers also lack an easy way to montize their gameplay performance.", "f6_no_assessments": 5, "f6_rating": 4.666666666666667, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1628, "q0": "In terms of impact, this proposal is very strong. It perfectly meets the objectives of the challenge, since the idea is to develop a protocol that integrates with existing games (they use Fortnite as an example, which we know is one of the most popular games today); this protocol would act by converting the tokens earned from the game normally (for example, in Fortnite there is a digital currency of its own that is used for purchases in the game universe) into decentralized active tokens, minted on the Cardano blockchain. The idea is for these tokens to be traded as NFTs. It's a very good solution, in my view - the PMX token will be a kind of connector between something that already exists - popular and well-established games in the market, along with their entire audience - and the Cardano ecosystem. That is, the topics: \u201cincrease the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products +increased quality of existing products & integrations through suggested improvements that is supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community \u201d, present in the summary of the challenge, would be directly contemplated by the idea. If the project runs correctly, it will be a simple and practical way to integrate Web2 players into the crypto world. I believe it's a more efficient way than attracting people to new projects - they're already regular players, for example, of Fortnite; they already play and already earn a virtual currency: once they have the possibility to generate profits from there, why wouldn't they do that? In terms of impact, I don't think there is any (constructive) criticism to be said, as the project is already very adequate and consistent with what we are looking for. One topic that perfectly sums up what would be done is: \u201cthe new play-to-win approach can highlight Cardano\u2019s technological advantages and attract new users to the ecosystem, while providing a central gaming hub for the existing community.\u201d . PlayerMint is a unique platform that also attracts a large audience of crypto-native and non-crypto-native users, which makes it an ideal candidate for F9: Dapps, Products, and Integrations.\u201d Another point that I found interesting was the way in which these tokens would be redeemed, the proponents explain that PlayerMint will integrate into the games, map the winnings and every 5 days players could collect their prizes - that is, it is a very similar operation to stake pools, which in my view is also a positive way for us to introduce this new wave of community members to our tools. Other positive points are how the proponents explain the technical part and the usability of the technology to be developed here: some tools are mentioned, such as the Cardano Transaction Library, developed by MLabs and which would allow translations of player actions in transactions and smart contracts , minted on our blockchain. Proponents also include in the details of the impact how the player would use this functionality, as we can see in the parts \u201cthe user accesses the PlayerMint website + the user clicks on \u201cHow it works\u201d or \u201cWhat is a wallet\u201d if need more information about cryptocurrencies + user connects their CIP-30 compatible wallet (\u2026)\u201d; As with the user journey, we know how their profile would be configured and how marketplaces would be explored. In addition, the proponents also identify some risks that could be faced during the realization of the project, such as rejection by game studios, and mitigate them accordingly.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The topic is good, the proposal is viable. However, to give us even more confidence and solidity about how this project would be implemented, I would like to make some suggestions for improvements. Starting with the script analysis, this part is the best part of feasibility. At first, the proponents tell us what has already been done (\u201cDevelopment of PlayerMints started last year when we started a partnership with development consultancy MLabs. MLabs has contributed to notable Cardano projects such as Liqwid, SundaeSwap, Minswap and SingularityNet \u201d). We also know where they are at the moment - at the testnet launch. About what will come, the explanation is defined through 4 phases, my first suggestion is that they were divided with a more precise temporality. For example, only in the budget explanation part we are told how long during the phase: 1 month, 2 months, 2 months and 3 months, respectively. Aside from phase 1, I would have preferred the bidders to have broken down what would happen in each month of the other phases, because that way our degree of understanding about what would happen when would be more accurate. Another suggestion would be to better detail some activities, it is positive as first they give a general explanation of what would happen - phase 1 for example is focused on the launch of the testnet: how would the initial disclosure be carried out to attract these first users? How would the qualitative report of this experience be collected? We see that in the phases it is explained what the focus would be and also what would be the partial results that should happen in these time intervals, such as the \u201cfounder launch launch + number of users + amount of PMX being earned by NFT Founder holders + qualitative report of founder launch experience\u201d in phase 2. I would like the activities behind this to be better specified as well, not only what should be generated, but what work should be done to make these partial successes possible (I will comment further on this in the auditability part). The other two parts, budget and staff, are discussed more superficially. I would like this information to be given in more detail. We are told how the $85,000 requested in the financing would be spent: Phase 1 - $10,625, Phase 2 - $21,250, Phase 3 - $21,250 and Phase 4 - $31,875. But it would be much better if they had argued why each phase costs the amount it is asked for. What activities would be carried out in phase 1, exactly, and how much would each cost? How would the approximately $10,000 total be divided? Unfortunately, many doubts are still in the air about the way in which this explanation of financing is made, in addition to knowing the price of each phase, it would be necessary to know why the value would have to be that one. A similar thing happens with the presentation of the team, we are introduced to each member in a very superficial way. The people who make up the complete coordination team (along with the help of MLabs) are briefly described, as we can see in the examples: \u201cGrant Scholl - CEO. He has 2 years of gaming experience and 4 years of blockchain experience. He works to build the ultimate vision of PlayerMint and how it will evolve over time\u201d and \u201cAidan Rankin-Williams - Director of Experience. He has 2 years of gaming experience and 4 years of blockchain experience. It works to shape the user experience from first contact marketing to full product engagement and customer support.\u201d More details would need to be presented about each, in addition to the linkedin profiles also being included.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is more auditable in terms of progress than success. I say this because the proponents inform many, many KPIs that could serve as checkpoints for what the project would be generating, progressively. Some of these are \u201cmonthly active users (unique wallets connected each month), total PMX earned through game performance (amount of PMX claimed by users), number of accounts, PlayerMint Pro, USD amount earned through game performance, game (USD valuation of the total PMX claimed by users), number of mentions on social networks\u201d and so on. I think it is quite possible to follow what would be done in the script because the division of the phases already allows us to have a secure understanding of what must be achieved at the end of each of these periods, the only thing that remains pending, so, is to know more on the daily work of the professionals involved. What have they been doing, what have they been doing, how are these successes being built behind the scenes, let's say. All this would also be valid to be understood. So my suggestion is that at the end of each phase, at least (because ideally we would have updates at the end and each month, in my view) one of the team members would provide us with updates on the work that was done for the month and the partial results that would have been achieved. This information can be passed on in different ways, such as a written report, or a short video, posted on youtube and disseminated on our community's communication channels\u2026 The important thing is that this contact is really established with a fixed frequency. And now speaking of ultimate success, it is defined \u201cby the number of newly connected active users and the size of the digital asset economy that exists in its ecosystem. 100K weekly active players, 10K weekly pro accounts and over $50M in total digital asset volume would be a hit for PlayerMint and Cardano and it is possible as 100K users is a tiny fraction of Fortnite\u2019s user base.\u201d . As we can see, the proponents focus a lot on quantitative data, I think it would be appropriate and necessary for a more complete analysis to be done, for example, how would these players be relating to Cardano, in general? In my view, this understanding is essential to evaluate the success of the project. Would they have become active members of our community, if so, how? It would be interesting to know if this functionality was a gateway for them to act, at least, in the CNFT ecosystem. So my suggestion is that feedback is collected directly with the target audience, the players, so that we can understand the palpable impacts of this technology for Cardano, and if, in the end, the objectives of the challenge would have been truly achieved.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 4249, "q0": "Playermint wants to create a Dapp that allows players of Web2 games such as Fortnite to monetize their gaming performance by connecting in a completely decentralized way to the Cardano blockchain and interacting with its ecosystem.
