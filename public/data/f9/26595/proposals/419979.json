The verbatim explanation from the proposal is \u201cA link would be provided to the proposer to be sent to the potential acceptor of the trade. After the trade is accepted, both parties would be prompted to send the agreed-upon items to a temporary wallet until all agreed-upon native assets are collected from both parties. Once all agreed-upon assets are received, both parties will receive their agreed-upon items. In the event that one or both parties fail to send the agreed upon assets within a given time limit, the smart contract will revert and return any assets it has received to the proper wallets.\u201d. I doubt if any smart contact would execute without a transaction fee and the requirement of minimum ADA for any transaction. If this is not the aim of the proposal then I feel similar sites to swap NFTs/Native assets exit in the ecosystem and have been funded even in the catalyst.  Therefore there is a need for more clarity and explanation on how this smart contract will be different from the other, or will the application will be a pseudo-centralised one. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "\nThe proposal is from William H, who is a Software Engineering Student and Bryant V - Cyber Security Student from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University. First of all, it is heartening to see Young minds interested in the Cardano ecosystem. We had the first successful NFT project launched in Cardano by innovative use of Mary hard fork by Alexander. Therefore there is a very high chance the proposing pair will be able to deliver the proposal successfully. However, any reference to any of their past work would have brought more confidence in their proposal.

The developer's compensation is fixed at $50 USD per hour which has been the rate quoted by all US-based proposals. The project is expected to be delivered in four months. There is no mention of the written code is open source. It can be seen that the proposers are planning to host and operate the site since they have included website registration and operation cost. Less the concerns regarding the feasibility of executing transactions in Cardano without using ADA, the proposal is a fairly straightforward dApp application. However, the concern is fundamental and has the potential to alter the appreciation of the proposal. Therefore the output is not clear at this instance and the exact value addition is not very apparent.

NFTs are growing in popularity on Cardano, and providing an NFT swapping centric project would enrich the Cardano dAPP experience. I am not currently aware of any direct NFT to NFT swapping projects on Cardano at this time. However, I feel that not enough information is presented in this proposal as to how it will be implemented, or what type of experience the user would have. For example, will there be a fee on top of the network fee, collected by the proposer? Will the swapping mechanism be built with Marlow or with Plutus? Will there be any dispute resolution service? So yes, the idea meets the challenge setting, but the proposal needs some additional details. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer is a student and doesn't explain how his or her team experience relates to smart contract writing on Cardano. The proposer should demonstrate to what level of experience they have in full stack developing. I would recommend they provide links to projects they have built in school or in their spare time, or at least talk to their experience in whatever stack they are leaning. Object-oriented programming skills do not directly translate to functional programming, and if they are going to write the contract in Plutus, users need to feel that their assets are safe. Marlow is a domain specific language using Plutus that is designed to be dummy proof, and this project sounds like a perfect use case. However, Marlowe is not on main net yet. The simple swap approach they are taking should be fairly easy to write, but because the proposer isn't illuminating their level of experience and convincing the voters that they can complete the task, I am rating it two starts.

They should also hire a third party to audit the code base and make the audit results publically available. In addition, the proposer should make as many updates and announcements using multiple social media platforms. Unfortunately, the proposer doesn't specify and only mentions using social media.

That doesn't necessarily mean that you are asking for much but may you take that into consideration for future proposals.

This is completely against the values that this challenge wants to create and expect the proposals in the challenge to make sense for the Cardano ecosystem.

When we first look at the project's implementation roadmap, we all see that the project focuses on building infrastructure such as websites, smart contracts, and testing.

This is great when building the platform but besides developing the platform another important factor that needs to be done is  marketing. Good marketing will bring the project to more users, creating a buzz for the project. However, the marketing phase has not been mentioned in the roadmap yet.

For example, provide specific social networking sites that will be used to update project news (maybe Twitter, Telegram, Facebook ) In addition, there are no numbers to assess the exact level of a successful project, KPI performance. For example, after 6 months, the number of users using the solution is 100 people, the number of transactions made is 50 transactions.
