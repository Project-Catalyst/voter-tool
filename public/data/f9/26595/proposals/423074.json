I say this because what will be developed here is still very abstract, it is not possible to understand exactly what will be done and how it will impact Cardano and directly relate to the objectives of the challenge. It would take a lot more detail for us to understand if the proposal would meet any of the goals of the challenge, if it would be 1) creating a new dApp, integration or solution that would foster our community, attracting new active members to it, increasing the number of contracts intelligent and outstanding Ada; or 2) that technologies that already exist would be worked on in a way that would evolve, so that they would be better used and bring benefits to our blockchain ecosystem. In theory, the project relates well to the topic cited in the challenge summary: \u201cEnvironment - Total number of users, total CO2 sequestered, amount of awareness being produced, number of people changing an environmentally damaging habit\u201d. It is said that some environmental projects would be developed, and also that \u201cthe sustainability goals of the world (SDGs, Climate, Green Economy, Finance 4.0) can only be achieved at a global level through highly scalable projects with real and measurable impact. \u201d. However, how this real and measurable impact will be worked out is quite inaccurate - NOMICA will provide ESG producer (what would that be?), and that can be achieved at a global level by highly scalable projects. in what way? It is said that \u201cNOMICA has the ambition to be the leading supplier of ESG products and for the market to become the main purchase destination of NFTs for these ESG products\u201d \u2013 how would this be done? First it would be important for us to understand more about these NFTs, what they constitute themselves, and then how they would be related to these global projects - we would also need to better understand what these projects would be and also how the NFTs could relate to them. It is said that ESG products would appeal to the world's biggest brands, but why? What would be the characteristics of these active tokens, how would they put the performance of such projects? It is said that \u201cthey (the projects) will use our NOMICA NFTs in their campaigns to showcase the actions and positive impact they are having in areas that matter\u201d. But again: it is not clear how companies will get to know these NFTs, nor what their characteristics would be. The proponent further explains that the group is working on two types of projects, ocean-related and urban - what would those projects be? It would be necessary for examples to be cited, so that we could understand which direct actions would be measured and aggregated, and in what way the NFTs would be part of it all. In the excerpt \u201cFor each project we will know exactly the impact that each action will have on the problem it is trying to solve. We will further increase the impact by reinvesting the sale of the NFTs back into the projects, creating a sustainable cycle\u201d - it is necessary that we know what the impact of the projects, how this would be increased by the sale investment in the active tokens, in what way a sustainable cycle would be established and so on. Finally, the risks presented, which would be related to the speed of integration and the validation of project actions, are mentioned, but are not resolved. For these reasons, unfortunately, due to the lack of explanations, there is not much confidence in the proposal and its impact.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The script is the best part of this topic, but still many points should be clarified. For example, right at the beginning of the explanations about the development process of this project, a series of information is passed on; it is said that, from what I understood as of August 15th, the \u201cDetailing of the complete work, flowcharts, logic, definition of smart contract functionality and L1 interactions (step-by-step flowcharts), definition of interfaces and APIs, list of components available in repositories (Github), regulatory checks initiated, etc etc\u201d. In my view, the ideal would be for all of this to have already been presented from the moment the proposal is presented to us, especially the complete details of the work to be done. What would happen, when, how, who would do it, for what purposes? Another comment I would like to make is in relation to the way temporality is divided. The abbreviations D1, D2, D3 and etc are used - what would these definitions be? In D1, it says that a \u201cWork Breakdown Chart and List, including team assignments\u201d would be made. In my view, this should also be defined here, we should know who would do what, and that the qualification of these professionals would be better presented to us, so that we could have more confidence in their preparation to successfully execute the proposal (I will comment more on this in the team). In D4 it is said that \u201cModels ready for distribution\u201d would be made - which models would these be, how would they be distributed and for whom would they be destined? In D6: \u201cMarketing, social, site up materials\u201d; How would marketing be done? What would be the target audience, what would be the worldwide projects, the brands they intend to reach, how would the dissemination be carried out, etc? In the section \u201c1-2 Pilot projects executed in prototype (Urbanomica!). Impact/pricing algorithm inputs (oracles) connected. More work on UI, UX almost completed, token tests and NFT started\u201d - it would be very important that all these projects, even if in the prototype phase, had been properly presented to the drafting of the proposal. So, when it comes to script, I cited several examples to be able to argue that we need to have a better detail. Yes, some information is passed on what would be done and when, but we don't know exactly how, several important points are missing here. Speaking of funding, it's serious as we don't have any details or direct information on how the 50,000 dollars would be used. It would be necessary for the bidder to split the amount into some key parts, such as 1) payment of staff salaries; 2) marketing/dissemination; 3) transport (if necessary); 4) payment of users who could test the initial versions of the technologies to be developed\u2026 It would be necessary for us to know what would be spent, how it would be spent, to argue the need for that expense and so on. Therefore, this is the part that leaves something to be desired, without a doubt, as we need to understand precisely the need for such an investment, which is not low, and unfortunately here we do not have any information about it, since the proponent repeats the information said in the part of the road map. Finally speaking of the team, this part is also not ideal because very little is said about those involved (e.g. Christoph Ebell, CEO, Founder, Technology, Economics, Execution, Bj\u00f6rn Rosendahl, Business Development, Sales, Finance, Laura Bernier , digital preservation, knowledge management, NFTs, etc). We would need to know more about their CVs and also how they relate to Cardano.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Finally, analyzing the auditability of the proposal, once again, unfortunately, our level of knowledge is very restricted. It is said that to monitor the process the metrics used would be \u201cthe growing number of customers (community), business community engagements and integration projects\u201d. How could we be privy to such information? How can we perceive how the community engagement would be, in what way the project would be being accepted? More details need to be provided - what are the projects that are part of the initiative, how they would be monitored, how we can see the increase in the number of users, as time goes by and so on. It would also be necessary for us to know more about how the activities set out in the roadmap would be monitored. How can we understand if the activities were being done within the specified time, in the correct way, by the chosen people? For that, it would be necessary that, first, such details had been exposed. Therefore, regarding project monitoring, the proposal lacks explanations both in terms of how the partial results would be understood and how the process of development of the roadmap itself could be followed, the products and what would be behind them, in summary. And about success, it is also very superficially defined as \u201can active market with thousands of ESG NFTs listed and a thriving community leveraging the NFTs as their contribution to good deeds taken\u201d. Many things should be understood here: which projects would be making use of ESG NFTs, how would they be taking advantage of the technology, how the environment would have benefited, and, above all, how can we guarantee that Cardano would also have benefited from of it all? How can we be sure that this project was important for our blockchain, that it achieved the goals of the challenge? In theory, this proposal would fit in with the specific objective of \u201cincreasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases\u201d. But it would be necessary for us to know how, if indeed the product would enrich the ecosystem with new use cases. Therefore, all topics need more detail, the information provided is, in general, very superficial.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 406, "q0": "NOMICA Incentive Platform is a proposing an ESG product marketplace that would utilize NFTs for campaigns to showcase their actions and positive impact. They are initially focussing on ocean and urban related projects where direct actions can be measured and aggregated. Sales of NFTs will be reinvested back into the project. In the presentation link provided an example is given about a ship changing course to help with marine conservation due to the impact sea traffic has on marine populations such as whales. In the proposal there isn't a itemised list of examples of what these ESG products would be and how they would function. In the early adoption phase of this project there is little incentive to game the system, however if any real adoption was achieved there is an incentive for organisations to create and maintain a positive record using a system like this. It is therefore vital that this proposal outlines some of the exact ESG products that would be relevant for this NFT solution and how those NFTs are issued, verified and audited. The proposer mentions that validating the actions in the risks but does not provide details of the examples and risks in the initial solution nor how that risk is mitigated. It may be possible to prevent this from happening but what is the cost of that process? It is the result of that calculation that helps to determine whether this business model is sustainable or would not be effective at preventing bad actors. Overall more depth is needed on the solution being presented, the key product that will exist, why they are a problem and what incentives will be in place to effectively verify and cost efficiently audit that what is suppose to happen due to the usage of buying ESG products on this marketplace is what actually is happening in real life.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "For the breakdown of progress a list is given of the different tasks that need to be completed to execute this propsoal. There are two dates provided with the list of tasks below each one. The task list appears to be reasonable however it would have been good to know roughly how long they think each task will take to give a rough indication of the workload intended for each part of tihs proposal. In terms of the budget break down the team seem to have copied the same content from the previous section in this budget section. Due to that there is no breakdown of exactly how the funds for this proposal will be used which makes it difficult to know whether the proposal team will distribute the funding effectively to achieve the goals of the proposal. In regards to the team a list of members are provided an their professional profiles. It does not appear they have someone who has much or any experience in Plutus or handling NFT policies/minting in the Cardano ecosystem.

The proposers could have listed how they intend to achieve each milestone of delivery here such as a public Trello board of an open source Github repository so that community can see what is being executed. In terms of updates they could have also mentioned where they will post reports or information for the community to find out more and also they could have specified what, if anything, will be open source from the work they are producing. In terms of success they mention a marketplace with thousands of ESG NFT's listed. This is a very high level goal and does not add any specific objectives towards how they will achieve this. For instance they could have mentioned a specific ESG product that they believe will be an important initial product that has evidence it may have demand in the short term. Then with this make estimations towards what would be a good result in terms of adoption and usage for that specific product. This then gives the assessors and voters a good indication of how well the proposer knows the market and also whether their objectives are realistic towards adoption of these more specific product examples. Overall the proposal could do with far more clarity on exactly what will be delivered with more depth on the examples exact ESG products that will be useful to the end user. With this clarity it would be easier to determine whether the success of this proposal can be effectively audited by the community.

Using Cardano blockchain and NFTs as an innovative way to address the environment issues and the implementation of ESG products is an important step forward to finding a global solution. The team describes the proposed solution as onboarding ocean and urban related projects to their platform for ESG NFTs, although at a high level it looks sensible it would be better in my opinion to address only one of these two categories first, at least during the first steps of the project. One area of the proposal that would require more detail and inshight are the risks that could prevent the delivery of the project.

The proposal states that \"for each project we will know exactly the impact each action will have on the problem they are trying to solve\". I do not agree with either premise. Firstly, I believe that the Cardano community and many other grassroots impact builders around the global have already shown that resilience, sustainability and a greener and cleaner future require grassroots activity and a paradigm shift in consumer and voter thinking. Secondly, I am of the opinion that \"impact\" as a buzzword is rather vague and it will never be possible to exactly measure whether a business is purely good or purely bad/evil. Even emissions from the largest corporates are almost impossible to quantify due to the supply chains and indirect effects, and in areas like gender diversity, indigenous empowerment, well-being of minors or biodiversity, to name just a few, this will be even more difficult.\nNFTs are a game changer for crypto, but the possibilities and limitations are currently not well understood. Will adoption be mainly boosted by rare, high-value collectibles, proof of provenance, proof of impact (how?), all of these, or completely new directions and use cases? I like the idea of using the blockchain for good and providing certification, but if this is done without the necessary critical thinking it might create more compliance problems than it solves and waste money that could be spent at the grassroots levels.\nAs far as the challenge setting is concerned, NFTs are a border case, not explicitly mentioned in the possible directions for dapps and integrations, but a possible feature and draw for products and services boosting blockchain adoption and user growth.\nConsidering all these factors, I agree that this proposal is likely to have positive impact for Cardano, but see the potential for reputational risk (\"greenwashing\") and a lack of immediate fit with the challenge goals defined.\nIt is not clear how much of the NFTs this platform will issue will be Cardano NFTs and it would have been great to receive information about additional investors and other chains that will be involved.\nESG is a big trend, and despite recent setbacks (focus on war in Ukraine, high energy prices instead of global warming; accusations of greenwashing and lawsuits involving banks' claims on ESG) will continue to grow. I am supportive of projects that try to tap into this high potential growth area for Cardano, but like to see clear commitment to Cardano, some involvement of local communities and a multi-stakeholder approach, as well as a good demonstration of the technical feasibility on the eUTxO model and with cNFTs including credible plans to cover any skills gap.

The budget is ample for steps planned though, and the team has a broad talent pool of business managers and advisors.
