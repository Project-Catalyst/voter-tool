Being active and physically and mentally healthy is a chore for the average person, who goes to work and comes home in a cyclical manner. Routine is key to a healthy lifestyle and the proposer aims to promote healthy living through the use of a Cardano based dApp that will complete activities in accordance to their mood. As the user performs more tasks, they'll be able to earn rewards which can then later be converted into non fungible tokens. The user's profile will be tracked on a monthly basis by how many challenges they've successfully done. Those challenges are geared towards mental, physical, spiritual and social categories in which the dApp will assign once the user rates their mood. If the proposer could solve the problem by using the dapp's functions to get users engaged in a more healthy lifestyle, and increase happiness or at the least have them do something positive, it would be a win win. Using the Cardano ecosystem and it's thriving NFT community as a starting point, this creation and development of said dApp could have a great positive impact on those users and NFT enthusiast who are most likely fine without it, but be given a little encouragement, could gain rewards while feeling better externally and internally. The impact of this proposal is given a 3 based on the probability of this reaching a wider audience.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer has outlined a solid and sensible budget to be accomplished within a 3 month period. It may very well take longer than that, though with an already working design, it might be doable. Having a team already in place, the proposal shows a core team being experienced with Cardano NFTs and in the health and wellbeing. The team consists of core members capable of web development and blockchain smart contracts along with the most important aspect of the solution to the problem being healthy living. Audrey and Scorchill sited in the proposal are mental health professionals with the education credentials to certify themselves as team members focused on the community's well being. LinkedIn profiles can be found for all members within the proposal. There's a clear understanding that developing the dApp and managing an existing community that's being built and growing will take time but with the use of online project management, the team is confident it can stay on task and deliver a working product if funded. The budget is well defined and breaks down the cost efficiently for the tasks involved for implementing the solution proposed. The feasibility of this proposal is scored a 5 as the team is more than capable of promoting healthy choices while making it fun with the existing NFT community members by adding rewards through a dApp that seems challenging and fun all while staying healthier.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability of the project and it's team are not well defined in regards to keeping Project Catalyst up to date on the dApp development progress as well as the community growth which is hoped to grow by 10%. It is more so after the completion of the roadmap and milestones are met, that the rate of success will be achieved by looking at the number of downloads and interactions with the dApp itself. This proposal would be best if those milestones were recorded in a transparent way to ensure publicly that all funds are being allocated and the tasks needed to be finished to implement the solution are being completed on time. Using GoogleDocs or Github services could be a better solution for sharing the progress of the team and the development that's taking place if and after being funded. The short to long-term goals is the overall promotion of well being within the Cardano community and the biggest challenge may be using the roadmap's Advertising Campaign to accomplish a larger user base once the dApp is available.

It prompts the user upon completion of the exercise to share his experience. Users  will be given incentives, NFT as rewards, for their efforts and sharing through the Discord community. The dApp's discord will run a wellbeing challenge every month.\n\nThe creation of dApp and integration with other platforms do meet the challenge criteria and the campaign in that it increases value and uses to the Cardano community.\n\nI therefore strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal has a three-month plan to complete and launch the product. The stages involve product design, technical design, and product development. Accordingly the budget requested is 24500 USD with the highest amount allocated to the coder.

Especially lots of these projects that are working tirelessly each day to ensure that they meet the requirements and wants of their community. Creating a Dapp that can promotes the idea of self-care can be important. In the proposal it suggests that it will be a Dapp that helps monitor your self-care and will reward you when you accomplish certain steps. You can then trade in points to receive rewards such as nfts. This can be a really cool project. It would be interesting to see implementation of other nft projects that could partner with this project in promotion of self-care. The proposal does a good job on addressing the challenge.

The plan gives a detailed roadmap on what they expect to see happen in the future and how it can benefit many users in the Cardano community. There is an obvious use-case for this proposal and will likely be successful if there is a specific way to hold the team accountable.

So as to address this problem, the author proposes to create a dApp that encourages regular self-care activities with incentives, social feedback and monitoring to maintain a good baseline of wellbeing. I liked the overall idea, the appropriate solution, and the general stated activities and milestones, which seemed like a reasonable idea to me, not only for the required investment value but also for the whole proposal. Similarly, I felt this proposal to be highly relevant and in accordance with the goals of the challenge. Also, I like how the proposers give well-designed project constructions so that we have a clear image of how this Dapp will work as well as demonstrations of its value. Such a project would have a positive influence on the Cardano ecosystem, and if implemented efficiently, this solution may easily scale up. I wish it had included more information aside from the actual growth process. Consider marketing. How do they plan to advertise the dApp? This might have been stated more clearly.

It is really encouraging that the team has already established connections with our community and other Cardano NFT communities, as well as a reputation as health and wellness advocates. The core team's knowledge includes a diverse set of talents, which may justify their capacity to carry out this project. The team resumes are verified using linkedin connections, making it simple to assess their expertise and skill, as well as previous work. I've noticed that the proposers mention advisors who will give guidance during the development stage, but I can't discover any information about them. I would advise the team to provide their names and also a brief summary of their backgrounds. As for the total amount of $24,500 requested for 3 months of design, development and a test launch, the budget mentioned seems reasonable given the time and tasks that will be put into the project. The team clarifies how it would be distributed, which greatly enhances the proposal. That is a reasonable financial breakdown, however the cost of launch could be more specific. What, for example, is included in \"Advertising Campaigns\" and \"User Incentives\"? Perhaps a brief breakdown here would be beneficial and more accurately reflect the budget's fairness. The roadmap and milestones for the accomplished plan are practical, transparent, and objective. The proposers outlined what needed to be done in order to implement the Dapp and then split it into detail with a clear timeframe and activities to be completed.

These KPIs are added in conjunction with the roadmap and can be used by the community to get a sense of how short-term and long-term success will appear. The team improved the proposal's clarity by adding a few statistics and quantifying the KPIs. Furthermore, I appreciate how the proposal precisely defines how the community may stay up to date with the project via the Discord server. The executed plan is understandable, and the milestones provided make it simple for voters to follow progress. There is already mention of potential risks such as workload and currency exchange volatility, but if the proposal also included a short text on some potential challenges that could arise during the development of this project, it would increase the community's trust in the team's credibility and competence in completing this project.

Wellbeing is a huge subject in life and concerns almost everybody.

The users input their mood, energy, and efforts level they want to spend. The output of the app will be the recommended activities as well as their descriptions. This app will tackle into four main health areas: mental/emotional, physical, spiritual, and social. After finishing the activities, users have opportunities to reflect, share with the community, and receive awarded points that can be converted to rewards such as NFTs. \nApart from the risks mentioned, I just wonder how to verify that the users actually complete the physical tasks? Because from my experiences, for current health care mobile apps, even the users do not complete the tasks, they just tick \u201cfinish\u201d button and tasks are done. \nStill, I think this is a meaningful project to promote human well-being.

However, the impact of this application is still ambiguous, for example, the team expects the number of app downloads in the mid-term to be 20 downloads, which is a small number compared to the budget spent. In addition, the increase in Discord Community size does not correspond to the number of App downloads.
