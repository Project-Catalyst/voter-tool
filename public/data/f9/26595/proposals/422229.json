In addition, the solution will bring convenience to investors as they can easily manage their investment portfolios on the same application.

And in this respect, this project does effectively address the challenge.\n\nThis application also has the capability to distribute Cardano native tokens for relatively free to anyone as delegation rewards. And this feature will also attract new players coming to the Cardano ecosystem as this type of service can not be found on other chains.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Having read through the team's backgrounds and expertise in details, I have no doubt this proposal will be implemented successfully. And besides that, it is so wonderful to see that they have bootstrapped everything to make this project work at the early stage. Such dedication should be much appreciated.\n\nThe funds they proposed and their budget allocation for a 6-month period of work is so reasonable given that they have clearly outlined, already factored in the inflation rate and identified the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal including those who are soon to be added.\n\nThe plan they presented in the proposal for a period of 6 months in my opinion is far from being fabricated at all, as these deliverables are simply the basic things a user-friendly DApps platform needs to provide.\n\nI have noticed that there are several goals, which actually are the important features on their platform, that have not yet been functioned. And as stated in the proposal\u2019s risk analysis, this is because of their lack of funds. So, if this proposal gets funded, these features will be up and running within the planned time frame, making this all-in-one platform one of the flagship DApps in Cardano ecosystem.\n\nAnother great thing is that they are open to pivot in 2023, which means they are expecting a further increase in scalability and sustainability in the future.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They are implementing several Google Analytics tools to monitor the growth of audience interaction with their projects. This is, in my opinion, one of the best ways to make anyone able to easily audit their work at any time. The metrics of KPI will be available to be monitored not only on a monthly or even weekly basis, but virtually anytime upon request.\n\nSo far, metrics of improvement, such as how many wallets are actively interacting with their apps and how many tokens are claimed each month are regularly published on their Twitter.\n\nI would like to suggest the team to deliver their updates using Discord. I have seen there is a lot of transparent communication in Discord regarding updates, improvements as well as issue resolvings on many projects. Maybe the team forgot to mention Discord in the proposal but I can see that this is the most reliable tool to keep track of the progress of any project development.\n\nAnd finally, success, by their definition is when all members of Cardano community can utilize the price analytics tool and swap, create tokens, distribute tokens, track all of their Cardano wallets all in one platform, as well as create an NFT collection with a payment gateway and launchpad without too much hassle. This type of success should be well-monitored using a user-friendly application so that everybody can see every metric on any stage of the project as well as the pace of the development.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3214", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11327, "q0": "This proposal was put forth in the Daaps, Products & integration challenge. Cardano needs a thriving ecosystem of different Dapps, products and integrations for the community to use that increasingly become the better alternatives over current centralized providers.\n\nCardano native assets are not picked up by coingecko, coin market cap, or DexTools. There is no way to get the information that is needed on CNFT's, Dex's, or any other area of Cardano native assets.  There is no \"all in one\" platform that a user of Cardano can go to gather information as well as execute trades, distribute tokens, do swaps, get technical analysis, and many other things. This is what this proposal seeks to fix. \n\nThis would bring value to the Cardano blockchain as none of what they want to accomplish is currently all wrapped up on one platform making it easy for the user to do everything they need without having to go to 4 or 5 platforms. \n\nThis proposal is being brought forth from TapTools, which has already been successful, and already has a platform in place. This proposal is offering a very positive impact for Cardano. Here it is in their own words:\n\"\nTapTools will provide data-rich access to conduct chart analysis, DEX integration to perform a \"swap\", a FT/NFT creation tool that will attract thousands of project creators into the ecosystem from across the world, a portfolio tracker that will give Cardano native asset holders a dashboard with full organization of all their holdings throughout various wallets, a smart contract based distribution tool for SPOs/project creators, and much more - all on one platform.\n\"\nThey also have this to say:\n\"\nTapTools is building a platform that will enable creators to build their projects on Cardano in a seamless manner. This will increase the amount of entrepreneurs entering the ecosystem that currently lack the development skills needed.\n\nOur platform will empower businesses, creators, and the community as a whole with real-time accurate information on price data analytics as well as tools to build their dream project on Cardano. These tools overall will increase the likelihood that any business or entrepreneur will enter the ecosystem.\n\"\nThis proposal effectively addresses the challenge of Daaps, Products & integrations.

They have a fully working platform, and now want to upgrade the software to become all inclusive of all things that are needed into a single platform.\n\nThe proposal has beautifully laid out a timeline of each major thing, and has broken those major things down into smaller parts that will be done to get to the larger parts. The timeline is reasonable, and should be easily achievable based on how they ordered it all with precision. They have also laid out a very detailed budget that is very reasonable in achieving the goals of this proposal. The level of detail in this budget is very very well done.\n\nThe team already has a proven track record within Cardano based on the success of https://www.taptools.io/ .Never the less the proposer has laid out all of the team members, provided links to study out the skills and education and experience of the team players, and even went on to allow the voter know that:\n\n\"\nSeeking:\nSmart Contract Developer\n\nBack End Developer (2)\n\nFront End Developer\n\"\nThe time table given for this project is on point and reasonable.

With that said, you can easily see this information in the feasibility section of the proposal, but it should also be a part of this section with additional metrics for people to track the progress and success of the project after it has been funded.\n\nMoving on, the team is using several different internal metrics to track it's own progress and keep up with what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process. They will be measuring their progress based on accounts created, page views, projects onboarded, token claims, projects created, and NFTs sold on an epoch-to-epoch bases.\n\nThey have also let us know that \"each week, we will be able to provide a comprehensive view of our total analytics to support our progress, growth and success.
