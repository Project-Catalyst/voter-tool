This proposal can be scaled up to address future challenges. This solution is clearly defined by the author by building a tool that allows any user to trade any token in any amount peer-to-peer (OTC), with no slippage and no DEX liquidity requirements. The author wants to move this trustless DEX to Cardano this solution solves the problem of the challenge. Proponents have identified the main risk that the proposal's authors do not have much experience building originals for Cardano.

The project progress is also clearly listed by the author. This is a good project if the project is funded I think the project will be successful. The success of the project is well defined and the team appears to be highly qualified and well connected within the good community they leverage their connections at CardStarter, Spores and GeroWallet partners to find projects that will benefit from the free tool they are looking to serve. The success of the project is reflected in the trading volume on this peer-to-peer DEX growing steadily, supporting the life of smaller projects in an expected bear market. The solution to this problem is that the Cardano ecosystem will achieve an important part of the peer-to-peer transaction infrastructure. The author expects this to make the Cardano ecosystem a more investor-friendly environment. They hope this contributes to better overall network health. The DEX will also support trading other types of derivatives.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "A time-specific quantified project progress and development metric providing a stable and secure Cardano-compatible gateway of our OTC dApp is our initial measure of success.

I\u2019m intrigued by the solution to the given problem statement but I\u2019m not entirely convinced that the problem statement encourages enough urgency for voters to find this proposal to be worth a rather high $68.8k. Starting with the issue of slippage, all notable DEXs on Cardano have the ability to set slippage tolerance ranging between 0.1% up to 5%, which I expect all Cardano community members to be relatively aware of. So this doesn\u2019t present a substantial enough issue. The concept of users needing a way to trade peer to peer without the AMM model is an interesting layer though. Technically, Cardano already has an order book model DEX through Muesliswap, so any focus on this part of the problem statement will require some differentiation that shows this DEX in its uniqueness. This section does mention \u201cAtomic Swap\u201d but I don\u2019t expect all voters to know that this means cross-chain swapping. Of course, we also aren\u2019t given any information about which different chains will be plugged in here, so it\u2019s hard to lend any credit on that point. I\u2019m convinced that this could be a very powerful tool to be built into Cardano\u2019s infrastructure but I don\u2019t think this part of the proposal is ready for a secure positive response from Catalyst voters.

The development team is rather impressive with some indicated top-tier experience in the disclosure of the core team but without LinkedIn profiles for voters to verify the given information. I assume this part of the section is telling the truth but I don\u2019t give full credit because of the lack of verifiability. The roadmap appears to have a relatively solid framework for actionable steps and a timeline but I think there\u2019s room for more detail in the provided actions with descriptions and allocated hours to each task. This will help play into the budget that only breaks down allocations for broad categories of different expenses. However, voters have no reference point to evaluate efficiency in spending because there is no breakdown of hourly rates for labor and/or a provided rationale as to why each expense costs the amount listed. With missing depth in every section of this category, I don\u2019t think voters are given enough information to properly evaluate feasibility of this proposal. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "For a lack of thoroughly measurable KPIs and omitting quantifiable targets, I rank this section a 2. There\u2019s an interesting thought that I came across when the proposal indicated TVL as a category for measuring performance/success. Since it is my understanding that TVL in AMM DEXs is measured by liquidity provided to the platform, I\u2019m wondering how TVL would be measured if liquidity provision is not a feature of this DEX. If a future iteration of this proposal is attempted, I would like to see some more explanation on that. So there\u2019s some question about the KPI categories that are given, so I think there\u2019s a lot more room to present more KPIs that maintain a direct link to potential impacts. Some of these could be the number of wallets connected to the platform, the number of swaps performed both on-chain and cross-chain, the amount of traffic that the Dapp site gets, and the amount of different assets that are traded/listed on the platform. Beyond just the expansion of identified KPIs, I think this proposal would benefit from quantifying those KPIs with target metrics across different stages in the life of the project. This could provide voters with a sense of objectivity in knowing that the team has an acute sense of success and is committing to a certain level of performance. It also acts as a mechanism to guage the need for course correction if things are not on-par. WIth what\u2019s given, I don\u2019t think voters are given enough substance to demonstrate a clear vision/definiton for success.

If I want to buy and sell according to the oderbook model on Cardano I will choose https://ada.muesliswap.com/.\nThis is an Oderbook model Dex and easy to use.\nI think the author needs to develop more ideas and bring more benefits to users. At the same time, it must be superior to other apps with similar models on the market, such as muesliswap.com. Cardano desperately needs applications that make a difference from the applications available in the market, which will help Cardano get noticed by many new users.\nRegarding the risk assessment, the author gives the future risks as reasonable.

The author should add the name of the member who will perform the task. This will help me and the voters assess whether team members are qualified to complete this proposal. Or is there still a lack of other members?\nAs for the cost description, I find it reasonable. If there are more, I think the author should add 5-10% of the total amount requested to hedge against the risk of ADA falling. This ensures that the proposal has enough funds to cover costs and complete the proposal.\nRegarding the members, I think this is a very good team and has a lot of knowledge about application development on blockchain. Unfortunately, the information of these members is anonymous, I and the voters will not have any further references to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the author. That can be a big minus. Because the success of a proposal depends a lot on the competence, experience, skills and reputation of the team members.

According to your website, you are betting on being multichain, which is always something to be celebrated. The problem you raised, unfortunately, shows your lack of knowledge regarding the ecosystem. Due to the way Cardano was built, the issue you have with EVM chains, where constant slippage is problematic, does not exist here. In fact, the first DEX in Cardano (https://ada.muesliswap.com/) was launched in December 2021 with great success, have the characteristic of an orderbook, exactly what you argue as a differentiator. So from now on, if you are requesting the allocation of funds, I would at least expect you to already have this information. Having said that, if you intend to compete with MuesliSwap I think it's perfectly alright, much more so if you intend to be a multichain DEX (based on your references to working with atomic swap mechanisms), but I would have expected you to demonstrate your success in implementing this type of contract in other chains. I would also like to mention that this challenge, although it could be perfectly within this category, I think it would be better aligned with the 'Cross-chain Collaboration\" challenge. I recommend you to contact the team of that challenge so they can offer you a guide, like onboarding at Cardano, since the development paradigm is VERY different, and cannot be underestimated. Just for the fact that bringing a DEX with the possibility to do atomic swaps would add a lot of value, I gave it a score of 3. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Unfortunately in this section there are several elements that are described in a very superficial way, preventing a proper evaluation of the feasibility of your project. To start with, I'm glad Alan Soares has been included as someone who has experience with functional programming; this is a minimum requirement. However, while I do not have a problem with the teams remaining anonymous at the start of the projects, the fact that you claim to be a successful project and yet remain anonymous does not give me confidence; names are mentioned in the proposal but there are no links provided to verify the information. For the implementation plan, I would expect far more detail on the actions to be undertaken. Regarding the time allocated to rewrite the code to Haskell, I believe there is a significant underestimation, much more considering all the changes that are going to be launched with Vasil. Another significant red flag is the fact that an audit of the code is neither in the plan nor the budget.
