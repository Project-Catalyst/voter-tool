However, booking guests do not have control over their data when using these online booking applications. The Decentralized Traveller ID on the Cardano platform is a new way to allow bookers to control their data when booking and increase the efficiency of travel and booking websites. The proposer integrates official identity, COVID-19 vaccination/test status, booking history, and some other data of customers into this Traveler ID. This Traveller ID is used within a hotel ecosystem and is reusable in the booking process. The use of Traveller ID is also effortless, saves travelers a lot of time when booking, and actively controls personal data. Besides, the Cardano community also expands when Traveller ID is widely used. In the future, the proposed team intends to link with other services developed on the Cardano platform, such as allowing ADA payments, creating travel NFTs, etc. Thus, this proposal's impact on the field tourism sector is enormous. I fully agree that the project meets the requirements of this challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project team received funds for their proposal in fund 8. In fund 9, they also sent to Catalyst project two other proposals and one intended proposal for Fund 10.

The proposed plan will be implemented from September 2022 to February 2023 and consists of two tasks and six work milestones. The budget required to perform these two tasks is $28.750. A budget breakdown was presented to the community to understand the $28750 is appropriate for this proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The metrics to track the progress of this project are simple. It is the number of hotels and Traveller ID bookings after the proposal is made successfully. In addition, information such as publishing the final booking process, publishing a video of the process working with fake data, etc., will be shared with the Cadanor community through community websites and/or month reports. In the tourism sector, decentralized technology is still relatively new. Therefore, it is understandable to encounter resistance from significant partners.

It gives the traveller to save and control their personal information (data) when they book the hotel. At the same time, it gives the hotels management have the experiences about their customers. The travellers can control their identity while they book, check-in/out and payment for the hotel. In addition, they do not need to re-enter same identity twice while they book another hotel at the other time. The customers know to whom information could be shared. Hotel on the other hand, obtain the information of the customers and able to find behaviour of the customer, at the same time, hotel could offer information hospitality services to the customers according to customer behaviour. This is good project to approve. Furthermore, it is continuing project that proposer proposed in F8 and they would like to integrate with current project (traveller ID). In addition, they plan to propose for continuing this project which plan to develop property management system in F10 later. Overall, the objective of the proposer is to build infrastructure that be able to connect traveller ID to all various booking sources and up to the Hotel management system.

The authors also provide us with KPIs, by which we have more quantitative information, data that directly point to whether success was achieved or not.
