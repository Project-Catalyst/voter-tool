I am impressed with what you have shown, the meticulous and intuitive image refinement makes anyone passing by stop to take a look at the project and your doing it.\nTalking about this proposal in-depth, I have a few comments for you: A good game scenario and throughout the development process, the content, events as well as the development of the PvP team game model are very attractive in my opinion.\nWith the discoveries in the game levels, special items, and valuable NFTs created by you, I am also looking forward to participating in this game you are working on. Most of the previous Cardano games I've known often lack rich content, unattractive gameplay, and only land purchases, coordinates, or NFTs that have no operational value in the game.\nYou guys are excelling and doing something new for this Cardano gaming ecosystem, something that many Cardano holders expect as well as the gaming community wants.\nIn this proposal, the game scenarios have been divided according to each season, map, and version to be able to perfect the content in the most methodical way, as a mobile game player I understand this way of doing it is completely reasonable. With 6 Phases in IRONSKY is a game with great content, it needs a certain development period and the life cycle of the game will certainly be long term, creating peace of mind for players as well as those who invest in this game.\nI agree on how to solve the problem of the proposal, how to put risky situations that may come to the project as well as how you guys handle it when you have problems in the future.\nNothing is without risk but everything in this game you guys are controlling them well. I see in the future that this will be the proposal that brings certain success in the Cardano ecosystem, as the shining star that we all desire. You guys are doing well, keep it up, we really need Cardano blockchain games to be played on mobile devices.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The IRONSKY is a proposal that has been very successful in the funds before Fund 8. The way you organize your game development team is very good even though you are working on other projects at the same time, the important thing I see is clarity in the resources you allocate in the project. Each small team with specific skills for their task is listed on a to-do list and the tasks to be completed. The way to break down the work in the project development roadmap, the tasks, and the time is very logical. Besides, you have very high-quality personnel and many years of experience in software development as well as mobile game development that you are still pursuing. I see that in your Peafone Game Studio you've been working on trending titles like Live on Planet for many years and puzzle games. This proves that you have certain success in your career as well as in your game-making field. This IronSky game really makes us excited, I believe you complete it like the products that you have done successfully before. I will not go into many details about each member of the team because you have written very carefully, what I want to say to the people who voted for the project: This group of engineers built their own team, and the members from large technology corporations such as (IBM japan, Fortinet, Mobage, Nikkie ..), they are fully capable of implementing this project in the best way. Another thing I observe is the budget statement in this proposal, the proposer not only lists the amounts but also attaches the team working on the budget, it makes the funder\u2019s project really feel secure, see what they spend that budget on and which team does and receives that spending? The answers are satisfying in what this proposal is written. I just quote a little here to demonstrate what I have reviewed:\n\n\u201cGraphics Design:\n    \u2022    Tasks: (Design UX/UI of IronSky Game mobile, both smartphones and tablets, collaborate with frontend team to complete graphical interfaces for IronSky Game mobile applications)\n    \u2022    Cost: ~ 180h x ($55/h) = 9,900\nQA & Testing App:\n    \u2022    Tasks: (Test game on mobile launching, App Game mobile functions testing, unit test, security testing, combined with Dev teams to fix bugs and perfect the product)\n    \u2022    Cost: ~ 140 x ($40/h) = 5,600\u201d\nSummary for this section: You guys are good experienced engineers, given a clear project development roadmap, and reasonable budget estimates, I fully support the IronSky game on Cardano.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability of this proposal is concerned with project management as well as project progress tracking. The proposed team presents completely, they are information technology experts and use SCRUM workflow, which I think is a good option for product development teams. The proposed team defines project roles, clearly delineating tasks, reports, and weekly meetings. I've seen their work videos put together poorly, it's a very active team working on this project:\nMeeting\nhttps://youtu.be/8M4hgi2MXss\nWorking\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkU_EaZOFVc&amp;t=85s\nTracking\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxT1S97c55A\n\n\nRegarding the project tracking KPIs, they are also quantifiable and easy for the community to track:\n    \u2022    The number of game versions released on apple store and google play.\u2028\n    \u2022    The number of game downloads on mobile devices.\u2028\n    \u2022    The number of people playing games regularly daily, weekly and monthly.\u2028\n    \u2022    The number of tokens to be issued.\u2028\n    \u2022    The number of NFTs generated.\u2028\n    \u2022    The number of members in our gaming community.\nThe information given is not ambiguous but very transparent for everyone to see. Especially, the proposed team has given success figures before, in Fund 8 they have the highest position in the Game-on-Chained challenge. Very excellent achievements are: up to ~95% voted YES for IRONSKY GAME and attracted 1152 ADA wallets to vote on this proposal. Those are very impressive numbers and indeed your proposal is written very professionally and seriously. \nThe successful scenarios of the project such as attracting thousands of gamers, attracting investors, and enriching the dApp ecosystem on Cardano are entirely possible. Above all, you appreciate the cooperation in your proposal for the purpose of increasing the membership in Cardano, increasing the holders and users of the ADA cryptocurrency, and increasing the development and communication partners, I totally agree with your ideas and support you to continue to develop this project, especially blockchain game applications in the mobile environment.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2779", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2066, "q0": "This proposal is about games, and we are probably no stranger to the name IRONSKY NFT GAME, the reason I say this is because Fund7&8 has attracted a lot of attention in the community. And in this fund 9, the proposal continues to return with the expansion of game development on both operating systems and gaming platforms, in addition to PC. This is a game project that I find quite interesting. The size of the game is very attractive, a space game with specially designed spaceships with unique NFTs attached to the items. Game Player Experience different stages of the game with 6 consecutive scenarios (Aurora, Luna, Solar, Stars, Galaxy, Universe)\nYou guys surprised me with the depth of this game, which is definitely what I would expect from a game on the Cardano ecosystem. Especially NFTS, items, and rewards make your game more attractive to players. The proposal directly impacts ADA holders as well as existing gamers looking to migrate to the Cardano ecosystem in search of new experience opportunities.\nWith the 3 mechanics, you are designing like play to earn, play for free, and play to earn Goto Travel, I am sure to get more players to join your game. I like \" playing to earn the \"Travel mechanic, it makes me want to play and accumulate points so I can exchange them for travel somewhere that I can use to pay, you guys have set up The game mechanics are very well designed smart, and creative.\nIn general, the proposal meets the criteria in the challenge set, attracts players, benefits the community, and is very interesting, creates liquidity for Ada ... for all of that, I completely Fully support you to further develop the next stage of this game.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Starting with the roadmap is a very detailed roadmap both in terms of time and specific activities. The proposal provides us with a roadmap covering 4 quarters, starting in Q3 2022, the proponent has a very clear vision for his product development. I found this game development roadmap to make perfect sense, we knew exactly what work the team needed to do, ensuring tasks were completed within established timelines. Next is the budget, the total requirement to implement this proposal is $88,880 which is extremely detailed and fully explained. The costs such as System Design, App Backend Dev, Blockchain Developers, Graphic Designers, App Frontend Dev... are all calculated. We know the cost for each job including how many hours performed, as well as the hourly rate of each job. This makes investors feel secure about the money they invest in your game.\nAnd finally about the project team, in my opinion, this is a strong and skilled team to develop this project. We know all the information of each member about their name, the field of activity, and experience related to blockchain as well as have all the members' links. We must know the role of each member of the project, which leads to the conclusion that the team also has the technical expertise to carry out this project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In fund 7 and fund 8 this IRONSKY game project was ranked top 1 in the poll showing its attraction to the community. In this fund 9, the next steps are also clearly stated. The proposed team has come up with several KPIs to track the project's progress:\n-Number of game versions released on Apple Store and Google Play.\n-The number of mobile game downloads.\n-The number of people playing the game regularly daily, weekly, and monthly.\n-The number of tokens to be issued.\n-Number of NFTs generated.\n-Number of members in our game community.\n-Number of ADA wallets registered in the game.\n-Number of people participating in the Airdrop.\n-Number of ADA wallets joining ISPO to receive $ISKY tokens.\nProponents provide detailed tracking of a project's progress and milestones and make it easy for investors to track their work. This proposal is to adopt popular tools for their exchange and project management such as Clickup, and Microsoft Project Management. More specifically, the authors mentioned the Scrum process that was run during the development of their project. I know that the Scrum process is an advanced process for software development teams that requires constant teamwork such as discussions, presentations, exercises, testing, review meetings, and product deployments products....so it is very suitable for a dynamic project like this\nAnd finally, the success of the project is well defined, and the implementation of the game token is very balanced and complete. And will release at each stage of the game's development. Tokens will be issued according to the project implementation time. From 1 month to the next 62 months.

This fun game would definitely attract more gamers, players, investors, partners to Cardano community, as a result,  gaming communities would be more interested in the Cardano blockchain. I appreciated that the proposer describe clearly about the game that I could visualize about it and find it enjoyable. This game will have its own story about a boy exploring the galaxy with his spaceships, and has 6 phrases in total (Aurona, Luna, Solar, Stars, Galaxy, Universe). Each phrase is different explained in a detail way that I think, the quality of this game is very high which differentiate it with other NFT games in market. The proposer shares key metrics (KPIs) to achieve after this funding round, I think,  shows they are very passionate and serious about building this game.

Moreover, the proposer provides their targeted goals for the next 3-6 months, 6-12 months and 12-24 months that shows their long-term vision and seriousness in this project. For the budget part, with the given link for more details,  their main tasks and description of tasks within the scope of this proposal and details of using capital is given clearly: I know how many hours would be needed for carrying out each task, the hourly rate for each type of job, the total required project expense that I think, it is reasonable. It would be more perfect if the proposer could add information on who will be in charge of each task? and explain a little bit about how the team could manage their time for this proposal as they are executing many other project in this fund. As far as I'm concerned, this is a very ambitious proposal, which need a big team for implementing it. I am impressed that they have many years of experience in game making and deep technology knowledge. In fact, they are multidisciplinary team of more than 10 professionals with a vast skillset from tech, UX/UI, product design, marketing, business, and community leading. Their team is devided into different departments for better operation and support which shows their professionalism.

A very exciting challenge and like many great projects submitted in this category, IRON SKY is one of those interesting projects. This is a proposal to build an NFT game on the Cardano blockchain. The story of the game is the exploration of space, along with the simulated space wars through the built spaceships. It is attractive by many changing contexts and designed items in the game. According to this game\u2019s developers, special NFT-attached items are rewarded to players who successfully complete missions in the game. To develop a wide audience to participate in this game, the developers created 3 gameplay mechanics such as Play to Free (which helps players explore and learn the basic gameplay to continue their journey in the game). game space) Play to Earns (Allows players to delve into cosmic levels and versions, maps, and higher levels in search of valuable special NFTs). Play to Travel (Allows to expand the ecosystem of IRON SKY, impact on players' lives, and allow redemption through real-life travel activities of gamers).\nRegarding the image of the game, it is very suitable for space games, has role-playing parts, has space and space, and the characters are very well designed. I have seen their demo game as well as Some pictures on the website www.ironsky.info. Through this, I get the opinion that the project development team has come up with a good solution for developing a game of the quality they want, which will make a positive and great impact on the applications of the Cardano Ecosystem.\nThe proposal to contribute to the blockchain gaming community attracts gamers to the Cardano platform to experience such exciting games. Some of the risks mentioned in the proposal such as (cryptocurrency market decline, Cardano technology, and human resource fluctuations ..) the proposed team all have reasonable solutions, they have experienced themselves, these fund7 and fund 8 this is very good. In addition, KPIs are defined as, quoted \u201cDevelop versions of the game IRON SKY running on iOS and Android. Players can download the game from the Apple Store or Google Play. Release tokens for the game's ecosystem, for advertising, partners, or airdrop for the Cardano community. Increase the number of ADA participating in the game and the number of wallets registered for the game.\u201d The development team raised the problem and explained the proposed solutions. I believe this is an amazing game for players and investors in the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I continue to review the development team of this project in the section Feasibility, they are experts in the field of content development on the internet platform, and they focus on developing mobile games and mobile applications for users. Perhaps these are the core experiences for them to form this IRON SKY proposal. Members have many years of working with the skills and roles required for today's project, such as programmers, systems engineers, graphic designers, and experience working on the Cardano blockchain. Here are some of the development team members and their specific work.\n\u201cPhuongNguyen\u201d Designer, Artist, Graphics, 3D builder Experience: 3D module build, UI/UX design App Mobile, Game Artist Contact Telegram: https://t.me/hlxb353 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/giangquynhn.\nDev_Team ThangLe, ThiPung Inbox: (thanglq01 n.b.hoa, phuongvanthi1206) in Skype Dev team engaged for a long time in more than 20 mobile game projects with members who are Full-stack developers for a large-scale system.

Leader of ADABoys Lab team (as an image of MLAB in the future). \"\nI assume these are engineers with good experience working on the technologies, tools, and modern programming languages in use today. Therefore, the implementation parts of this proposal are possible. The project has a total required budget of $88880 with specific costs such as frontend web programming, how much the backend, graphic design, server costs, blockchain programming costs, product testing, and also the cost of risk management are mentioned with a clear list for the teams that perform that task. This is a budget of no more than $ 100K for a big game on mobile, which is very suitable and saves the community budget of the Catalyst fund.\nThe roadmap of the project is planned in detail by the development team with timelines that are:\nUI/UX design for mobile gameplay. Design and build a system of mobile game clients. Integrate and load NFTs game items into Gameplay (in Q3/2022).\nTest mobile game versions of IRONSKY on Android and iOS.\nRelease the MVP version of IRONSKY on Smartphone and Tablet devices (in Q4/2022).\nRelease the full version to Apple Store and Google Play (in Q1/2023).\nThe to-do items are very sequential and logical with defined timelines. This is a completely successful route to the todo list proposed by the development team, I agree with the points in this Feasibility part of the proposal. This will be the project that contributes to the success of the NFT Games on Cardano blockchain.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The next part I am reviewing is the audit section of the proposal. I didn't know about the Japanese Ho-Len-So process until I saw as this proposal. I learned more about that process and the Project Development Team explained it well in their attachment (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wC8HddWmFjvSg0jmqpHYnE-umvZBY4Q4jnwI9qUM0oU/edit#gid=178850880) ). Thereby Ho-Len-So is a dynamic workflow, it is a continuous workflow and unites small teams in large projects. The proponent cleverly combined the SCRUM and Ho-Len-So processes for the development of IRON SKY, which helps them to keep track of the project's progress, the progress of the small tasks as well as the reports generated. given daily weekly as mentioned.\nIn addition, they\u2019re game communities on youtube, telegram, discord, and GitHub channels ... help the catalyst community to track the progress and events of the project.\nThe proposal also promotes cooperation with partners in the media, business, and communities in the catalyst, especially as Airdrop game token programs or ISPO (benefit sharing for ADA holders in different countries). the pool they collaborate on for the game IRON SKY) \u2026 those campaigns are all focused on benefiting our Cardano community. The proponent has taken great care of the community and designed good campaigns that harmonize the interests of the parties involved in their project. The success of the proposal is to create an attractive big game in the Cardano dApp ecosystem, attracting thousands of gamers and investors to join and hold ADA coins.\nThis is the very amazing future we all look forward to, I will definitely look forward to your IRON SKY experience.
