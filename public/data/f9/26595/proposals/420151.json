This creates a large supply and fast inflation for the tokens, with little to no incentives to hold the tokens.\nWithout a strong new influx of users willing to buy a token with no real use-case, the value of the tokens will surely plummet leading to worthless rewards.\n\nThe project seems to rely on ponzinomics to maintain the token value, which is not sustainable without a real income stream.\n\nAs such, I believe that despite being built with good intentions, the project cannot succeed without rethinking the financial aspect and finding a reliable income stream.\n\nAnd if additional revenue streams are planned to cover the rewards, I would recommend to describe them in the proposal and whitepaper to show how sustainable the model is.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The stated detailed plan does not describe any of the development work that will be undertaken during the 3 project phases.\n\nInstead, it focuses on NFT minting, Initial Token Offerings, tokens public sale, and airdrops, which add little value to the project and mostly rely on hype to create demand.\n\nThe proposal should provide additional details on the development of the rewards scheme that incentivizes zero emissions, and must describe a clear way to generating income in order to sustain the value of the rewards that are distributed.\n\nThe Phase 2 section does include the trial of the rewards scheme, but the development of smart contract and infrastructure required is unfortunately not described in the plan.\n\nA high-level budget breakdown is given, but without additional details, there is no way to judge whether the required amount is justified.\n\nFinally, the team lacks experience in blockchain development, as shown by the resume of the current team member and the open vacancy for a Lead Developer. This brings an additional risk as the Dapps development could suffer significant delay if a strong blockchain development team cannot be found and paid with the allotted budget.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The described KPIs listed in the proposal focus strongly on the growth of the community, NFT sale and token value, which is only one aspect of the project.\n\nSince a large portion of the requested funds are allocated to the Dapps & website development, additional milestones and KPIs targetting the development of the infrastructure and Dapps should be added to help judge the progress of the project.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2534", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "I accept that we didn't include certain details e.g. revenue generation, as we'd still to fully finalise elements of the business model. This will actually be done primarily through people making a net zero pledge and offsetting their carbon footprint through us. Through the money derived from carbon offsetting, some of that will go towards planting trees and then the rest will fund the rewards systems described in the proposal. \n\nHowever, that being said, I believe the scoring is extremely low and unfair. I must vehemently refute any suggestion that this is a ponzi scheme. There are also long term use-cases for the tokens that we're working towards, in terms of token redemption and use with partners, however this element of the business model is largely dependent on working with existing partners building partner relations - as we are currently not yet issuing rewards and this was to fund the working website/dapp, these details were not expanded upon. It was also explained that the outcome from funding would be a working Alpha-stage dapp integrated on our site, which detailed that users will be able to create and link accounts and receive rewards. Specific detail wasn't given for smart contract elements/infrastructure, agreed, however that all falls under the 'Dev' umbrella that's been highlighted already, which means we will be working with devs to achieve our desired outcome - and we know exactly how to go about that. With regards to the team, we are also developing ourselves and our skillsets to also help develop smart contracts, e.g. as stated I'm part of the Marlowe Pioneers Cohort.\n\nWhilst I feel 3* for Impact/Alignment feels a tad low, I believe the 1* for Feasibility is extremely low and unjustified, and the auditability also seems too low at just 2*.

The way the project looks at the problem is well defined , lacks the economic incentive and impetus to push people and companies towards a Net Zero future , even though the world is not on track to achieve it . climate change target. problem solutions are clearly defined by the team . Zero Citizen will reward users of services and products that contribute to reducing emissions and combating climate change , minting Zero Citizen NFT for use in construction community and support the mining and exchange of OCZN tokens. The solution offered solves the challenge, the lack of a bridge between people's real-world interactions and the crypto-world, creating a dapp that provides an ecosystem to reward interactions in The real world contributes to the Net Zero economy, realizing that Cardano is one of the most eco-friendly blockchains available. it is therefore proposed to scale future development as well as the Cardano ecosystem.

How to buy equipment? I appreciate the budget. Talking about the team, we can see that the project owner has given the team members, mentioned the work related experience as well as the assignment of tasks in the proposal. accompanied by a link to each person's personal information for the community to verify the above information.

The ability to check this process would be further improved if a weekly schedule with dates could be possible . happen  . that way the community can document more proposals as well as track the project. talk about the success of the project, see the results easily, as a reward provider for Net Zero's products and services, the ability to positively impact the environment, contribute towards a Net future.
