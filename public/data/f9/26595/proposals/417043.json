The smartphone market in the world is growing strongly and the number of users is increasing. Providing DeFi access from mobile devices is important to users. Especially where the population does not have access to traditional banking services to maintain their financial health (such as in some countries in Africa).\nThe proposed solution will solve this problem. By building a DeFi connector for mobile wallets (iOS & Android) to address the lack of mobile access to DeFi services for Thrift and other Cardano projects. (Thrift is a user-friendly financial smart mobile wallet to drive Cardano adoption through savings and open decentralized finance. This project was funded by Catalyst in Fund 8.) The author has described the solution in detail and made a reasonable argument. Africa will be the key to the adoption of the solution, it will open the way for Thrift and more Cardano projects to widespread adoption.\nFrom the above, it is shown that this proposal met the \"Dapps, Products & Integrations\" challenge.\nThe author has mentioned 3 main risks that can be encountered when implementing the project. Every risk has a suitable solution. It also meets the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of ending poverty in all its forms everywhere, promoting sustainable economic growth, and reducing inequality within and between countries.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap of the project is clear, has a specific timeline and detailed plan. The content of the work is presented by the author on a monthly basis, the project is implemented in 6 months. Thrift Wallet is still in the process of completing basic functions and needs to share the funding of this proposal to continue (the current status of Thrift Wallet can be checked via the Trello board the author has provided the link for). ).\nThe proposed budget represents 1.51% of the total Challenge budget. This amount has been allocated to expenses. However, I find that it is not detailed and there is no explanation for this calculation. My contribution is that the author should explain in detail those costs to make it easier for viewers to understand, such as the cloud cost is 12 months but the roadmap The project was implemented in 6 months. The remaining costs are calculated as a package or monthly or hourly (if by month or hour, what is the average cost of 1 month or 1 hour, how much is the total number of months or hours performed)\nThe author has provided full information about the members implementing the project. They are all people with a wide range of abilities and experiences that are relevant to the goals of the proposal. They already have a number of projects that have been funded by Catalyst in previous Funds. In addition to this proposal, they have a number of other proposals also submitted in Fund 9.

There are 4 measurement indexes mentioned (Number of DeFi services integrated, number of dApps used, number of users using and increased cooperation facilitated by this implementation). The monitoring of the progress and development of the project will be publicly reported every two weeks to Catalyst organizers and the rest of the community through the project's social media channels and through the Trello table.\nThe success of the project is clearly defined over time and has specific KPIs.

The spending is also carefully allocated accordingly, however, there is a need for more clarity here. What is the team\u2019s definition of \u201cUX/UI: $4500\u201d or \u201ctraining: $900\u201d? I think the team can work more on the required steps/resources for each aspect to ensure the reasonability and practicality of the financial plan. \nThe information of team members has been included in the proposal.

This goal is perfectly consistent with the challenge objectives. The problem is stated properly, and the answer addresses it appropriately. In my perspective, such a project would have a positive influence on the Cardano environment, and if correctly implemented, this solution could easily scale up. In order to evaluate the solution, the proposers provided some metrics concerning its impact. This contributes to greater voter trust. One question I do have is in regard to some possible risks mentioned by the proposer. Although the author of this proposal highlighted the team risk, technical risks, and adoption and market risks, there is no mention of their concerns about service compliance in African countries. I'm also not confident what methods the proposer intends to use to overcome the aforementioned threats. If the proposer could provide more specific information, voters would be able to better understand the impacts of this idea.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Concerning the competency of the core team, the essential verification of both skill and experience of the core team is provided in detail. The team possesses a diverse set of talents that will all be needed.The proposers also outlined partnerships with an expert Haskell/Plutus lab, This gives me confidence that they have set the framework for the project to thrive. Their search for Haskell and Plutus developers, a Mobile Engineer, DevOps Engineers, and Community Managers is reasonable, but need more additional info such as including the experience required for each role or other standards the team is looking for in a member? Given the amount of time that would be out into the project, the proposal's budget is acceptable. The required funds are divided into identifiable components, with the majority going toward the salaries of mobile engineers in 5 months. However, there is still room for advancement. Perhaps the team should provide a monthly rate, name the specialists handling the work, and how many people are required for the role, indicating how the $36,000 will be spent would be beneficial, improving clarity over implementation details. Another consideration is that, given that marketing is included in the budget projections, I would have liked to have a more detailed explanation of how and when the project intends to market during the development period. On the plus side, the proposer goes into great detail and makes a dedicated effort to explain the technical aspects of his plan. Additionally, the proposers offered a defined timeline for the project, which shows that the project will run from Aug 2022 to Jan 2023. I myself find the milestones are achievable.

Success metrics are reasonable and outlined and fall within the challenge\u2019s requirements. The team promises to post a two-week update to Catalyst organizers and the rest of the community through their social media channels and through their public Trello board.

The author should have a footnote of technical words so that people without technical knowledge can understand its meaning.

The author should clearly define the following outstanding issues: Who will use this product? Why should they use this product? What are the benefits of this product?\nThe way content is presented according to these topics will stand out and be easier to understand for readers.\nIf possible, the author can add numbers from local articles, to demonstrate that the opportunity for application is very potential. For example, how many smartphone users in Africa, how many Africans can't get a loan from a bank? These numbers help me and the voters see more clearly the potential of this market. Meaning the opportunity for the application will be huge if it is completed.\nRegarding the risks listed by the author, I just need to add one more suggestion. It is a risk that ADA slippage could lead to the project running short of funds to complete the proposal. Therefore, the author should add 5-10% of the total amount requested in case ADA slips.\nThis is a very professional team, the content of the proposal is very complete, so I will give them 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I rarely see a monthly or quarterly blueprint in other proposals. But in this proposal, the author and the team wrote in great detail about the monthly implementation plan. I would like to add, in the tasks that the team will perform during the month, there should be more names of the member who will perform that task. This helps me and the voters fully assess whether team members have the experience and skills to complete those tasks.\nIn the cost description, I see two expenses that I don't quite understand.\n- Translation $ 1800: What languages \u200b\u200bdoes this translation translate into, and how much is expected.\n- Licenses: $1200: Why is this cost needed? What benefits does this license provide?\nRegarding the profile information of the members on Linkedin, I find them to be very talented and experienced members of Cardano programming.
