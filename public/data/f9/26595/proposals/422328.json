Here we are seeking to develop dApps, integrations and products that add value to the Cardano ecosystem, with added value being observed through some metrics such as: Cardano community engagement (adding new active members or making current members more involved with our purpose); increase the number of NFTs minted on our blockchain; increase the number of Ada and smart contracts; the number of cardano digital wallets (like Yoroi, for example) and etc. This idea, in a way, can generate these increases and also the better engagement of our community, but from what I understand a company would be founded, a platform, a specific dApp would not be created. Maybe it is, but it's not so clear. For this reason, I believe that the idea could fit more perfectly into the challenge of DAOs, as in this challenge we intend to form groups that, gathered around a common cause that concerns our blockchain, can also bring benefits to Cardano. And that's what would happen here: the idea is to promote a company (which from what I understand already exists), called Pillarwheel Studios. This company is created to help those who work remotely, helping to develop products and services, which would be built on top of our blockchain. The proponent attaches a website, but it gives an error when we try to access it, unfortunately, which does not allow us to get to know this group in a more practical way. The proponent argues the need for such a company since Arkansas (USA) media/game developers and producers need a collective initiative that brings them together and benefits them. It is said that there is no other group of this type in this state, as for example there is in the state of Texas. One problem that I identified here was the lack of detail about what is already done and what would be built by this group. For example, in the excerpt: \u201cPillarWheel Studios was built out of the need to organize developers in northwest Arkansas into a centralized LLC, in principle, which also incorporates decentralized autonomous organizational tools centered on the Cardano blockchain for its internal organization of consultants and developers\u201d. What would these tools be? How do they contribute to the work of these professionals? There is a lack of clarity about what is already being done in the company. In \u201cThe Cardano blockchain is our choice of blockchain integrations for many reasons - some being that our missions have similarities. We will use Cardano as our blockchain of choice for our products, and this proposal will help build the necessary infrastructure to develop these products and services\u201d: which products and services are we talking about? On the risk side, the proponent states that it is very difficult to found a successful Startup, and states that \u201csometimes, the strategy would be strong, but the infrastructure would be weak. The company name \"Pillarwheel\" came from the study of what can go right and which variables contributed to the success of the startups I was involved in. have action plans, partnerships and the ability to follow through on these strategies\u201d. Once again, it would be positive for him to exemplify what action plans, partnerships and strategies are. That said, I think the proposal has potential, but the impact is not perfect due to the absence of some important information, and in my view it would also be a proposal more focused on the \u201cCardano <3 DAOS\u201d challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This topic is average, we have some basic information, but unfortunately it is not very suitable. The roadmap is not precise, first the proponent states that some activities have already been done (\"we have already started to form the L.L.C. in Arkansas, USA, and are forming partnerships with state resources for startups, in addition to DAO and other resources in the non-centralized space , with Blockery.io and other organizations to assist in our decentralized infrastructure\u201d). But it would be important for him to better detail this information: what has been built so far, with whom have partnerships been established? What is the decentralized structure they have been creating like? Just as we don't have enough details about what has already passed, we also don't understand exactly what will come. In October 2022, the goal is to build an MVP and demo the main product. It is mentioned that a demo of the game Above So Below would be done, but not much is explained about this project. As much as they have provided a link to the game's proposal, it would be important for them to make a small summary of what the game is and also how it uses Cardano's technologies. The proposer states that the game will be developed in a group if the proposal is funded, but does not give further details on this. How would the project become reality? Which professionals would be involved? If the proposal is not funded, how will he handle it all on his own? From October to December some things would need to be delivered: \u201chaving the LLC formed, the LLC agent secured and then starting more aggressive efforts to welcome investors (using these funds from this proposal as a means of obtaining and solidifying partnerships and investors individuals)\u201d. But, as in the case of the game, it is not detailed how these products would be developed, what efforts would be made to get investors, what the \u201cLLC\u201d would be, etc. In general, the script does not allow us to have a solid understanding of what will come, precisely because of the lack of detail about what would be done. The costs are also not well explained. We know that the total amount is 16,100 dollars, and it is divided into some parts, but not one of them is properly broken down. Why does a year of cloud hosting cost $11,600? What legal services would be needed to establish these activities, and how would marketing be produced? What would the publicity campaign be? I think that maybe in the state in which the company would be founded, people would not be so familiar with blockchain technology, which generates the need for a solid and accurate marketing campaign. And finally, even if it is a group/company, the only person presented in the team part is the bidder. What we do know about him is that he works in the technology field at a university in Arkansas, that he is involved with cardano as a veteran proposal evaluator and that he has studied blockchain for a few years. But it is not clear if he already has a project developed with our technologies. More people would need to be introduced, for example the team that would develop the game, other people relevant to the company and so on. The topic gives us background information, and not much confidence is given about the applicability of this project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability of the proposal is also quite average. I say this because, first of all, we don't have a very detailed script and we don't have a good idea of \u200b\u200bwhat would happen, how and when. From that point on, it becomes difficult to carry out adequate monitoring. The proponent suggests monitoring the process based on some metrics, but they are quite abstract. For example, generating income: how many people are we looking to employ? In what way do we expect them to work, what salary claim is considered here? How many projects, in addition to the game that is mentioned in the script, are thought to be put into practice? The definition of generating deliverables is very generic too, this can say about many things, we would need to know which deliveries we are expecting, in what way and for when. Get Partnerships: Who are we looking to do this with, and what kind of partnership are we looking to set up? It would be beneficial if the proponent cites some names, even from groups relevant to our community (eg Cardano4Climate, Gimbalabs, Wada and etc - well-established groups known for their projects funded on Catalyst). It is said that videos would be posted on youtube, but we do not know 1) what content should be posted; 2) how often; 3) how the target audience would be reached. Generally speaking, it takes a lot more detail to audit progress, we need to know clearly what would have to be done, in what way, and by what timeframe. Ideally, the proponent should share with the Cardano community monthly reports that say about what was done that month, who worked on what projects and what partial results would have to be obtained (he could even be guided by the KPIs mentioned here in the scope of the proposal). The success scenario is also defined in an abstract way, in the following excerpt: \u201claunch it from a series of plans, to concrete and measurable actions with KPIs showing success, or at least paths to it. Articles in at least local publications detailing our launch and then interested investors who will help us get a greater amount of funding from our efforts contact them for these opportunities, or investors contacting us.\u201d What would be the concrete plans and actions? What content of articles and local publications do they intend to release? How will they engage and engage local stakeholders? How can the actions of this company be observed in practice and how can we draw a direct relationship between them and the objectives of the challenge? For these reasons, I think that again there is a lack of detail and more clarity on what could be monitored as a success scenario. My suggestion is that the proponent be more exact in relation to the generated products and can present them in some direct and verifiable way to the community, through some presentation in Townhall, for example.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2440, "q0": "We realized that the general idea of the project is to raise funds so that a tool aimed at building decentralized applications is established. With this, other ideas could be developed using technologies related to Cardano. In fact, in this context, we have that the project fits the goals established by the challenge. However, it seems that the budget being requested would be insufficient for the project to reach the intended external interest, even working only as an initial push, because we did not find enough innovation in the idea to make it clearly differentiated. This jeopardizes the potential impact of the proposal on Cardano's ecosystem.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "In line with the concerns raised above, the project feasibility plan is not providing a great deal of detail on how the planned activities would bring engagement and interest from outside investors. In general we can see that the activities assigned in the project timeline are related to the production of the game. But when we looked for the team responsible for the development of this product, we found only Steven. Although his experiences are relevant to the development of the project and his curriculum is available, we know that for a game to be successful and attract a large number of players, it needs to have good storytelling and original gameplay. Although we have examples of games developed by a single person and that gained relevant notoriety, it seems important that in this case more people already made up the team so that different knowledge of the world could be applied in development. It would be interesting, for example, if professionals specialized in marketing were on the team. On the budget breakdown, we see that the largest allocation of capital (approximately 70%) is focused on hosting resources in the cloud. However, we did not find a clear explanation of why this is a fundamental action for development.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Regarding the ways described for the project's evolution to be monitored and also in relation to the perception of success, we found very vague ideas. It would be nice if the cited concepts were more grounded, in this regard, parameters could have been cited indicative of the gradual progress of the game's development. For example, the methodology used could have been cited (something like Agile method) or the duration of production sprints. It would also be interesting to indicate some tool for the community to follow the evolution of the project.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4125, "q0": "Problem Identification: The concept of a cloud-based DAO as a global scalability tool is being simplified in its relevancy to encompass the sparsely populated Arkansas area, as it is relevant to competing in other small cities in Texas.  I'm not 100% sure I understand the impact of the problem/solution fit as presented. \n\nValue-add: The goal seems to be to facilitate remote workers access to compete in certain markets, using a DAO and legal entity to facilitate legal/operational framework for entrepreneurs.\n\nAlignment with challenge: I believe there are 2 more closely aligned challenges than the one selected for this proposal, 1) DAOs <3 Cardano, and 2) Legal & Financial Integrations - since the project aims to establish a DAO for the purposes of centralizing remote work and facilitation of new products and services around this framework.\n\nScalability: Scalable, but not broad in its ambitions, this project aims to define its relevant market within a small subset of rural America.\n\nSustainability Plan: \n\nJustification:  While the proposal has some merits in its benefit for the community, my neutral position is based on the belief that this proposal is not optimally located within the most relevant challenge, and falls short of scalability ambitions that could maximize impact to the community.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Team Skill Relevance:  I generally support the entrepreneurial mindset, ambition, and capability.  However in this case, the proposal aims to deliver a legal/regulatory solution, and the proposal author is an IT personnel / CTO, having no known legal experience.\n\nTeam Appropriateness: The proposal author has indicated they will work alone, with the assistance of 3rd party contract support.\n\nBudget Outline/Reasonableness: I'm not sure I agree with the budget appropriateness.   For example, the proposal states that LLC formation will require use of funds $2,750.  Online resources indicate this can be done for $50 in 2-3 business days with an online application.  However, I'm not knowledgable on the legal complexity of establishing a DAO, so unsure if the additional cost is somehow related to that, but the proposal is not clear in this direction.  The bulk of the funds (around 70%) after that are used as a cloud hosting budget.\n\nAdditional Funding Plan: Unclear, as the proposal states \"yes\" they will seek future funding, but it is not clarified if the author means for this proposal or others.  There seems to be a placeholder left in this section where the author intended to provide a link to a past proposal on Catalyst, but the placeholder has no link to view.\n\nImplementation Plan:  The implementation plan is very basic, and also contains a reference to another proposal which is not provided (another missing placeholder).  The second part of the implementation plan includes only establishment of a legal entity, which the proposal states it will outsource, although it maybe possible to do online and save cost.\n\nResource Plan: The main comment that the author repeats regarding resources is that he plans to keep the needs minimal so he can under promise and over delivery.  The main problem is it's not completely clear all of what will be delivered, or how detailed of a plan exists to deliver on those minimal promises.\n\nRisk Mitigation: The author states that persistence and conservative use of funds will be the best ways to overcome failures which are common in the startup industry.\n\nJustification: I don't agree or disagree with this proposal, perhaps there is more in depth knowledge that the author knows about the operational problem in his geography or the intricacies of the proposed DAO solution that, if I had more information, could help to evaluate better.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Clear Roadmap/Milestones: The roadmap and milestones are not clearly defined, but the proposal to deliver a DAO for legal simplicity is relatively simple.\n\nDefined Metrics/KPIs: The Metrics/KPIs for this proposal are not well defined, and push this responsibility to the next phase after DAO setup.\n\nMeasurable Problem/Solution Impact: In my opinion, there is little ability for the community to evaluate a problem/solution fit based on the information provided regarding the Arkansas and Texas geographies or operational challenges that exist in these markets.\n\nPublic Update Channels: PillarWheel does have public channels listed, a website with various links all leading to the same homepage.\n\nJustification: I think the proposal author has presented a problem/solution fit that they are very familiar with in their industry/geography, but offers not enough information to evaluate by the community in terms of impact.

Also a large portion of this budget is to be spent on a year of cloud hosting for web resources. This funding does not make sense in light of this proposal which is primarily seeking to form an LLC. I believe that this team could have done a much better job of organizing their information and presenting a clear proposal seeking to accomplish a single goal.
