While fractionalized NFT's are an interesting use case, the proposal does not explain how this will impact Cardano, or to what extent. Being a freely available open source project means anyone can use this Code. If this is deployed without correcting the issues found in the audit, they may be a risk of users loosing their funds, so it is important to complete this proposal.

In this case, they are requesting funds in order to implement the changes required by an audit which was performed on an NFT project of theirs, that was again built with Catalyst funding (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/384625-48088). The benefit to the community in solving these issues according to the proposer is that this fractionalized NFT project is open source and parts of it can be used by any person or team who wants to start their own project. We can think of it as a template which has already built functionalities which can be used by other people, such as an upgradeable treasury, a voting dApp etc.\nAs risks, the proposer identifies regular development concerns like delays or inappropriate budgeting and also the fact that even if the project passes the audit after the initial problems are fixed, that is not a guarantee that no bugs at all remain. It\u2019s good that these were identified, but the proposer should also have mentioned how they plan to mitigate these risks.\nNevertheless, I agree that working on tools and templates which can help more people start building on Cardano (NFT projects in this case) does effectively address the Dapps, Products & Integrations challenge.

We are also not provided with the details of the person who will be working on this audit, except that they will be a Plutus developer, most likely an employee of dcSpark. To be honest, there is a severe lack of information in this section, which is only remediated by the fact that dcSpark has a good reputation and has been building products in the Cardano ecosystem for a long time now. Still, a new team would not be able to get funding in my opinion without providing details about their members, about their detailed plan for the project, about the budget and how it will be used (detailed time + task estimations) etc. 15000 USD is not a big ask for what seems to be the benefit here, but again, we are relying more on speculation than transparent information. I agree that the proposal is likely to be implemented successfully due to dcSpark being the company behind it, but please consider bringing up your proposals to the Catalyst standard as outlined by the proposer guide (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oE_cnP0gksdAanXV4w5DYaDNp_tbYEvyHhTUG4HYZ3Q/edit#).

For this, we would need to at least know a few examples of the issues that were found and then a few key progress indicators (for example \u201cinforming the community when a pull request with a fix for X issue has been created and having at least one of these every two weeks in Q3 etc\u201d). Auditability requires detailed planning with hard numbers which later have to be met. Otherwise, the community simply has to trust you when you say that you\u2019re making progress or have completed the proposal.

This makes sense, but I wish there was more info given about what Fracada actually is.  This would help voters decide if they believe funding for these improvements is even worth it. They do provide a link to the github where the Fracada code is located, but I think giving a brief summary of what it does in the proposal would still be good.  I think providing some stats about how many people use the Fracada code would also help the community understand the impact that these improvements would have.

I think some more info about them would be good, but perhaps they haven\u2019t decided which developer will be working on it yet.  Besides that, the main problem I have with this proposal is the lack of a detailed plan and budget breakdown.  I can understand the budget breakdown not being very detailed because it seems like the funding is only going towards the compensation of the developer who works on this proposal, and there\u2019s not much to break down about that.  They could have included the hours they estimate this proposal to take though, just for more clarity behind how the amount was decided on.\n\nThe detailed plan section of the proposal could definitely use more details because currently it only states that they plan to address the concerns of the audit in Q3 of this year.  Surely some more details could\u2019ve been added about what steps they plan to take to address the concerns, even if they don\u2019t want to reveal what concerns the audit had yet.  The steps could even be as simple as \u201cResearch, develop, and testing,\u201d and then provide general estimates about how long they plan each step to take.\n\nBased on the reliability and the experience of the dcSpark team, I do genuinely believe this proposal would be implemented successfully.

From the link to the source code they provide on Github.\nI finally understood that this is a public protocol and source code.
