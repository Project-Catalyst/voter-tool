I think the section starts itself off with a disadvantage by not thoroughly articulating a problem in the problem statement, as voters won\u2019t be inclined to vote positively for a $100k proposal that doesn\u2019t NEED to be approved. There\u2019s lots of data in the space about how much value is stolen in crypto assets each year, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some specificity on NFTs in that area. I think it would be prudent to identify other quantifiable data like how much volume Cardano sees for NFTs, how much Cardano NFTs are collectively worth, and (most importantly) how much value is regularly facilitated on this platform so that voters can get a sense of what is being protected. These metrics would more confidently establish a sense of need for what is trying to be protected. The given problem statement also isn\u2019t exactly true, as there is an NFT lending platform called \u201cLending Pond\u201d that launched their platform before this one. It\u2019s a minor mistake but it might be possible that voters could be turned off by a perceived unawareness of the industry that this proposal intends to operate in. While the proposal is not about the logistical background operations of the FluidToken platform, it may be prudent to iterate some of those mechanics to give voters a sense of what FluidToken does and what unique/innovative ideas are brought to the table through this platform. This way, they can decide if they believe it to be worth auditing, based on where the platform is right now. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "With only 3 points in each of these portions of the feasibility section, there is not enough information to assure voters that there is the experience, capability, planning and efficiency in spending to evaluate a reasonable feasibility, so I rank this section a 1. Between the 3 core team members, only 1 of the given team members might have the experience necessary to determine some sense of security but it sounds like the core dev team is not the ones performing the audit. Therefore, voters are not actually given any relevant information about the people that are actually carrying out the intended actions of the proposal. If voters are evaluating the possibility of successfully accomplishing this proposal by the provable capaiblity/experience of the development team, they are not finding the information needed in this portion of the proposal. If voters are looking to defer feasibility to the actionable steps listed in the roadmap, they aren\u2019t given much more information in the outlined roadmap as far as the steps/methods of the security audit, involved parties, specificity in timeframe, testing, or allocated time to react/impliment the given feedback. The budget is also very short on details about how the funds are being spent because it doesn\u2019t breakdown the spending for each category of labor. However, since the budget is only allocated for labor, we can do our own breakdown to find that the $90k divided evently across the 400 allocated hours will come out to $225/hr (with an additional $10k added for potential unforeseen additional costs). Given that a full-time yearly salary for a security auditor is around $66k-$80k and professional security audits can cust up to $60k for a single job (at the corporate level), it\u2019s rather safe to say that the requested budget is being inefficiently spent. Wherever this project is outsourcing their audit to, the group/agency needs to be changed if there is a legitimate intention of seeing voter approval because this is not an appropriate use of Catalyst funds. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "To it\u2019s credit, a simple proposal like this is difficult thoroughly define measurable KPIs but there still isn\u2019t enough substance here to drive me to rank anything higher than a 1. There is room to figure out KPIs for the amount of bugs found, the reactivity to feedback, the establishment of some objective security audit rating (there are many standard types), and other post-proposal benefits like the number of exploits prevented. There aren\u2019t any given KPI categories or targetable metrics provided anywhere in this portion of the proposal, so voters aren\u2019t given any indication that there is a measurement of success that has any link to potential impacts. Without substance on this part of the proposal, voters are not capable of knowing that this team has a targetable vision of success that translates to impact magnitude.

Generally, it is a very healthy sign that a project has survived the first phase of building and can focus on providing a secure solution.\nThe proposal aligns with the \u201cDapp\u2026\u201d challenge setting and it is impactful, all things considered.

The only unfortunate aspect of the proposal in terms of feasibility is the rather spare budget and plan section. Some information can be derived as an ambitious reader but this should be outlined explicitly in the proposal. The following aspects should be overlooked and refined: Budget with man hours coupled to tasks in the detailed plan. A detailed plan with major and minor milestones.\nThe Overall score will be a weak 4 points, rounded its 4 points.

As it stands today, neither is really existing in the proposal and at least one of the alternatives should be implemented in the proposal. The easiest way of solving this is to provide a more detailed plan with explicit milestones that are used for progress tracking.\nFurthermore, community updates will be provided but it is unclear where and how this will be performed. A suggestion is to explicitly list where you will provide these updates (your website/blog/discord). The authors are suggested to look at other previously funded proposals to gain inspiration in how they could structure their auditability section since it is quite lackluster in its current format.

FluidToken is Cardano's first NFT-DeFi bridge that allows users to lend and borrow using NFTs. In collaboration with Canonical LLC, the audit is needed for lending and borrowing protocol to avoid the possible exploits in addition to the lag release of open source of code. Although I can see some benefits of the FluidTokens audit to be performed and shared with the community on its lag version for other lending-borrowing protocols, the immediate impact from this proposal is limited during this market downturn where the confidence of investors on DeFi protocol is at its low. To promote the sustainable growth for Cardano adoption, fluidtokens team should come up with the better way than performing audits on smart contracts as the main issue for DeFi right now is the over use of leverage and lack of liquidity. It is not the security issue (smart contract audit) but more on the business model of lending-borrowing protocol that needs to be improved to revive DeFi to fuel the growth of Cardano again.  ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project timeline is 3 months from September until November (audit smart contract, final code review and opensource of the code). The proposal also lists the number of hours for audit purpose (400 hours in total) and the cost of engineering and plutus developer is $90000 ie. the rate per hour from these estimates is $225/hour which is quite high compared to other projects. However, this could be due to the complexity of smart contracts in lending/borrowing protocol. The team could have elaborated what is the extra cost $10,000 they mention in the proposal. The team is comprised of 3 professionals with their embedded linkedin profile. Please consider adding their responsibillities in this project for the next proposal. As the team prepares to come back to Catalyst for future proposals on case there are any complex smart contracts they are going to release. I would recommend them to provide more budget breakdown and the specific features of smart contract they plan to audit as the community needs to know where the fund will go towards and not to confuse as to which smart contract they plan to have the audits done. The FluidToken protocol already had their token sale and could have used the sale proceed to cover the audit cost as the alternative finance option.

The team has explained quite clear on their problem statement that the auditing of smart contract is important to protect the community. It also explains quite clear the solution of having the third party audit done on their smart contracts.

Especially in the early stages of development on the Cardano blockchain. There are a lot of new projects being built and we need to make sure that security is one of the most important parts. This proposal is addressing the challenge of putting security first and requesting funds for a security audit to help their project be safer. This will add an extra layer of security to their project and protect the users' funds. As I believe that security is very important to Cardano. In the future, this will help Cardano to be the most scalable and secure blockchain in the ecosystem.

The proposal gives a brief, but detailed roadmap that give specific dates on when they plan to finish the security audit. There is also a detailed budget breakdown that states that all the requested funds would go to the security audit team. The team says that they will keep the community up to date through their social media channels so that they can be transparent with their progress.

The team at fluidtokens appears that they are aware of this principle. When a team can be completely open about the progress, they are able to create a loyal community that will follow a project because of the trust they have built. The second principle is accountability. This is extremely important because it will allow the community to hold the team accountable for the work and reaching the specific dates of completion that were mentioned in the proposal. When there is this excitement and trust built within a certain community, there will be a positive form of accountability that promotes hard work and will likely lead to the success of the proposal. For these reasons, I give this section 4 out of 5 stars. I believe the proposal can include more information on how they will develop this form of trust with the community.
