According to the author, there is currently a lack of effective participatory democratic methods in many countries whereby citizens can debate and influence government and parliamentary decisions, leading to oppression, corruption, corruption, and exploitation. The solution is to provide a web3 platform (Voxiberate) inspired by citizen assemblies that empower and encourage citizens to facilitate large-scale democratic discussions and reach a consensus on potentially polarizing issues. Voxiberate can be envisioned as a decentralized application on Cardano that enhances participatory democracy across countries, regions, and cities. It also supports agile corporate governance whereby all stakeholders, including employees, contractors, customers, suppliers, local communities, and others, collaborate on collective decision-making and sourcing ideas from the community. Propose shows a legitimate problem and then provides an idea of \u200b\u200ba valid solution. If this proposal is successfully implemented, it will make our world a better place where everyone can be heard. Voxiberate will be extremely useful to current and future Cardano projects because it allows for scaling and ensures the trust of DAO communities as well as countries, regions, cities, and communities general society more widely adopted than web3 and Cardano\nTo carry out a project that always has potential risks and challenges, this project has identified 2 risks namely, Identifying the appropriate Cardano integrations and Ensuring that \"the voice of the customer\" \"Product Development Guide. That's also what came to mind when I read this proposal. And fortunately, the team came up with very convincing solutions to those risks. Therefore, I am very confident about this group and this project will be successfully implemented if it receives funding.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is highly appreciated by us. I quite like the way the author presents the roadmap, it is very specific and detailed. The proposal provides a 3-month roadmap, we know very well what tasks will be performed each month, who will be in charge of those tasks, and what the results should be after each month. All in all, we had a very solid view of what was to come and understood the entire project process during the 3 months of the proposal team.\nNext is the budget, $50,000 was requested, which I think fits perfectly with the proposal. Because in the roadmap, the author has presented what needs to be done as well as which activities will be undertaken by which members. So in the budget section, we have a very clear view. We know their salary (hourly) as well as their time of dedication so I feel the required budget is perfectly reasonable.\nFinally about the team, behind this project are 5 members who have been assigned roles and tasks very clearly. In addition, information about each member's experience, skills, the field of activity as well as LinkedIn link profile is also updated in detail. So we can further study these people in different aspects. Therefore, we have a very detailed picture of the team working on this project and are confident that they are qualified to carry out the project. In the end, what I want to say is that the feasibility of the project is amazing, it can be said that this is the best presentation that I have evaluated so far.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Not surprisingly, the project's progress check is also very well presented. The main indicators of the project are set every month:\n-January: Selection criteria for integrations: level of technology maturity; acceptability; user base; sociopolitical nature of the projects\n-February: Software testing criteria: integrations work properly and reliably\nMarch: Percentage of members participating in Voxiberation, the quality of citizens' comments; consensus vs popularity...\nIt can be seen that the above indicators are closely related to the project's roadmap. Project auditability is also very transparent. The author will report on the above metrics at the end of each month with a Monthly Progress Report. This report will be published on their Twitter channel, the Catalyst Telegram channels, and the Catalyst Discord Channel.\nThe author gives 4 important successes, and it is completely tied to the problem that was initially identified:\n1. Digitalize the participatory democracy experience\n2. Beat apathy. (Increasing the number of citizens involved in managing their communities)\n3. Enhance people's trust in government by allowing their voices to be heard\n4.

This project offers a solution aligned with the needs of the challenge through its desire to set up a platform to empower and incentivize citizens, to facilitate exchanges and reach collective consensus to respond to problems. This could enhance the iteret for Cardano, placing it as a pioneer in collective organization and thus attracting a wider audience, sensitive to governance issues. This added value is well aware and explained in different ways by the team.

The plan is to use DID/Wallets to provide secure and anonymous citizen participation while at the same providing for open and fair deliberations. If this project was fully implemented everywhere that it could be, even in Cardano governance and Project Catalyst, we could see a dramatic improvement in the number of participants. The concept of citizen assemblies is well-documented and has shown great promise for making democracy more equitable and efficient. By building this dApp on Cardano, assemblies could be used far more frequently due to lower overhead and less effort finding qualified participants, and an easier entry path for citizens. \n\nThe proposal lays out a process for not only creating a dApp to facilitate conversations< They also plan to build it in a such a way that can be used other projects, DAO\u2019s, and dApps. This gives this proposal long-term impact on the entire Cardano chain. There is currently no effective deliberation layer within Cardano. To be able to discuss issues of varying complexity with a group of fellow stakeholders in an anonymous but transparent way would be ground-breaking. Then they plan on adding in an incentive process to attract a larger group of people to participate in conversations. Overall, this proposal would be ideal to see fully funded in Fund 9.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I have no reason to doubt this team is capable of completing this. However, there is a lot of work to complete in just three months. I am certain that as long as there are no roadblocks it will be done. I am just not certain all the goals are achievable in the timeframe if there are any hurdles. \n\nThe team member's experience is detailed and they are qualified to accomplish this. I have no doubt that if this is their full time job for the next three months they should be able to accomplish everything on time. They have very clear goals, and specific assignments for each team member. Based on their skills, each team member should be able to achieve the tasks. Additionally, they already have a working AI, and demo available. This will not be built from the ground up, which means there is a higher likelihood this will be completed on time. \n\nThe only concern I have is that they are planning on evaluating existing integrations, which might delay their ability to move forward on this. Maybe the ideal integration is not fully completed, but would be ready in a few months. I know they are capable of working around such things, but their time frame looks really tight with a long list of tasks to complete, so if there were delays in integrating other projects or frameworks, it might bump them back. The ranking of four is not a negative assessment of the team or their overall project, but more of my own sense of what is possible in three months, and it feels like this proposal is right on the edge. Having said that, if this takes longer, I would still want to see this completed in whatever time frame it takes, and would consider it successful.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is one of the most clear and auditable I have seen. The team is topnotch, they have clear goals, well-defined objectives, and a project that will produce an end-product. This also has real-world use cases. I can see this project succeeding to help cities and local municipalities to engage their citizens on a wide-range of topics, and I can see Cardano and Voxiberate at the center of a rapidly growing market segment. \n\nThis project has clear targets in terms of timeline. They are measurable and auditable. The team is present and active on Twitter and in the Catalyst community. They are transparent about their progress and are already public about their progress on the demo and existing AI. I have every reason to believe they will communicate and respond to audit questions and that they will on their own make public their progress over the next three months. Additionally, they are clearly within the sustainability goals of Project Catalyst and are measuring their own metrics for success, including increasing citizen participation, beating apathy, enhancing trust, and growing civic consciousness.

This proposal helps to improve the corruption of those in power in the state management system. However, in the proposal you mentioned Voxiberate is the \"deliberation layer\" on web3. You should explain more carefully because it is quite confusing.

The development of Blockchain so that citizens can debate and influence the decisions of the government and parliament is very convenient and suitable for the current Covid-19 epidemic situation because people cannot communicate with each other when suffering from covid 19.

Today, people do want to have a say in public policies. When it comes to the development of spaces in urban areas, for example, people are increasingly advocating greener cities. In Barcelona, citizens have pushed for the democratization of public spaces through the creation of \"superblocks\", which carve out large car-free areas. They are supporting the implementation of this urban policy through platforms for citizen participation, such as Decidim Barcelona. This kind of local and communal engagement is key to participative democracy, which does not stop at the local level. Systemic issues that affect everyone\u2019s lives, such as climate change, have urged people to push for their voices to be heard on a global scale as well.

They have a set of Key Deliverables for each month, which makes it much easier to visualize how the project will progress and expect positive results.

As for the problem statement, there is a need for organizations to set up Citizen Assemblies quickly, efficiently, and at low-cost and for citizens to have high-quality deliberations.\u00a0\nThe team\u2019s goal is closely aligned with Cardano's objective. Voxiberate, a decentralized app, will be the solution as well as deliverable. It will be built to enhance participatory democracy and at the same time drive wider adoption of Cardano. By utilizing the funds, the team aims to further develop Voxiberate, for setting up and facilitating citizen assemblies on web3.
