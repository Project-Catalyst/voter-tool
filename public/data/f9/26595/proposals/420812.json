I created an NFT project using AI-generated images in Cardano. Therefore I have a fair experience in this field. People would like to morph their images and post them on social media. Creating a CNFT out of these images in a single click in the value addition of the proposal is likely to have a reasonable marker. The are many other tools on the internet which does these in a few steps. Therefore I feel it's very difficult to estimate the alignment of the proposal to the overall goals of the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer had 20 plus years in software development and has delivered three Catalyst projects successfully in the stipulated time. The website for the proposal https://tachiku.com/ is functional along with API interface for developers and state-of-the-art documentation. The critical technical issues like running AI engine online behind web service all seem to be integrated and only maintaining and dispatching of NFT will not be a major risk for achieving the stated aim. Therefore there is a very high chance the proposal will be delivered successfully. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is for $95,350 out of which $85,400 for developers for 52, 21 and 49 Days. The proposal is also discounting 40% pay for a developer. The proposal earmarks $700 for a day for the development team. This is slightly on the higher side of the spectrum of what the Catalyst proposal earmarks. The proposal has a very detailed delivery plan and a clear road map with a good analysis of the tasks involved. The schedule is highly feasible with the earmarked resources. However, approximately 96K USD for an AI-based NFT project at the face of it looks to be a huge investment considering the quantum of value-added to the Cardano ecosystem.

I see that you have played with AI image generation too, I would be very interested to discuss more with you if you accept. I have recently setup a discord channel, you are welcome to join : https://discord.gg/EEr4cDZjfB\n\nI take your view on the budget for an \"AI-based NFT project\", but I hope you have considered that a good part of the budget is for building an AI infra which I will have to outsource and which will result in a solution where future \"AI engines\" could be plugged-in with minimal effort. Also, I am reaching a stage for this project where it will need some marketing effort. I had initially set a marketing budget of over $30K which I have then re-assessed to less than $9,000 because I did not want to go beyond $100K of funding request, and I could not lower much more the dev funding part. So somehow I share your view, and I tried to contain the cost as much as possible.\n\nThank you again for your review and support, and I hope that we will be able to exchange more in the future, as I am really interested in your experience with AI and views on where to take it next."}, {"id": 5954, "q0": "This project was funded in Fund-7 in the AI/SingularityNET challenge setting where it was a perfect fit, making use of artificial intelligence to help users creating a unique avatar by uploading their picture and then having it morphed into a \"theme\" like zombie, reggae, robot etc. This is quite experimental as it does not immediately create a strong use apart from novelty, but could develop into something very entertaining and potentially compatible with metaverse avatars in the future. For its limited scope as a Proof of Concept, the project is close to completion and the proposer thinks it has (over)achieved and delivered on its promise. I agree. However, the question is now whether the community likes to fund this project with four times the POC amount to move to the next stage as a DApp on its own right, without the experimental and AI - supporting \"protection\" of a dedicated challenge category. With other words: does it stack up compared to more practical projects that immediately roll out DeFi, identity or even gaming applications to humans that will then interact more with Cardano as a result. After reading the detailed proposal, watching the provided Youtube footage, and trying out the TaChiKu tool myself, my answer is: Yes. This project ticks a lot of boxes, it has the track record and integration into the community of a previously funded proposal, does other developers and humanity at large a service by researching relatively novel AI concepts and applying them to metaverse- and NFT-related blockchain use cases, and has the potential to entertain users and bring their friends and family to use Cardano as a result. This in my opinion is a very good fit with the challenge setting.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The successful delivery of the Fund-7 proposal on time increase the likelihood that this proposal will be implemented successfully. Bringing the project from the proof of concept stage to the next level will be challenging. I have tried the tool and would hope for an order of magnitude improvement in the quality (it is currently not very flattering to my Asian face, to say the least), and Catalyst funds for marketing need to be used wisely and purposefully to have an impact in a crowded space where it essentially competes with all kinds of \"cartoonification\" tools and the like that could theoretically be minted as NFTs and used as avatars. The core aspect and USP of this project is clearly the open theme, where users would hope in the future to morph into all sorts of popular character classes, like aliens from certain movie franchises etc. AI is not trivial and developing it further might be swamped by other scaling, marketing and front-end refinement tasks. Only 15-20% of the budget are allocated to improving the capability of the AI.\nApart from this concern, the background information provided and business plan are very detailed. I consider positively the fact that the proposer is collaborating with another funded proposer and plans to increase the team working on this.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The key performance indicators appear very well calibrated. The budget is broken down almost to the dollar and the timeline is provided almost to the day. This is Clarity and Auditability at its best.\nIt may be a good idea to move some of the AI development to open source or create a Discord/Telegram to share its findings with the community. The more people in Catalyst and Cardano start working on this, the faster and stronger it may evolve, while also serving as a channel to provide feedback about the progress of the proposal.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2761", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Hi - thank you very much for your detailed review, the time you spent on understanding the project, and trying it out. I appreciate very much.\n\nRegarding your comment re \"quality of AI\", the current choice I have taken is to NOT spend much time on updating / improving AIs, but instead to integrate successful existing open source AIs into TaChiKu. At the moment, I have left it to a fairly generic and \"simple\" AI morphing engine, considering that this was \"good enough\" for a Proof of Concept integration, and that later more evolved AI integration will \"simply\" be a case of \"plugging a better AI\". So the goal of \"AI dockerization\" and full encapsulation is really a top priority to get there. Once there... we will plug all the best AIs out there, as there are so many, fully developed and ready-to-use, in the open source AI community.\n\nI agree with the suggestion of a Discord group. In fact, I have just opened a discord server here : https://discord.gg/EEr4cDZjfB  ; You are welcome to join, and I would really appreciate your input.\n\nThank you again for your comments, they are very valuable to me.
