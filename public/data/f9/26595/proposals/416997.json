The idea is to create a tool that would make keywords like Cardano, for example, have their information displayed on screen when the user drags the mouse over it. This would be done with the aim of making it more practical to consult the values \u200b\u200bof cryptocurrencies, for example, without people having to consult external websites such as Coinmarketcap or Coingecko, as the proponent claims. In my view, this project is not so valuable for Cardano because the focus is not just to benefit our blockchain, the proponent claims that the main cryptocurrencies would be included in the widget's functioning, as well as other terms from the cryptographic world (it would be interesting to understand which ones), the which makes me think that maybe it would be a much more interesting project for users in general than Cardano in particular. In this challenge, we are looking to finance projects that help our blockchain in its expansion and broad growth process; projects that can create interesting new products and integrations, or that improve existing ones; that increase the number of active members in our community, outstanding Ada, CNFTs and etc. The project in question, in my opinion, would not attract new members to our community, in fact it would improve the experience of all those who read news related to the cryptographic world, but it would not in any way demonstrate Cardano's differentials in relation to other blockchains. For the proposal to be more interesting, it would be necessary that this initiative, somehow, collaborate with the benefit of our ecosystem, if somehow, through these facilities, news readers were interested in learning more about Cardano and Catalyst, if get more involved with any of the various technologies available in our ecosystem and so on. Maybe if the asking price for the project were a little more affordable, it would be something worth funding to improve the navigability experience of our community members' websites (if it was created by the community and for the community), however, it's asking for 47 thousand dollars for the development of the tool, so I believe that this amount can perhaps be invested more accurately in projects that are more focused on Cardano, as I mentioned earlier. The idea is not bad, by any means, but it is also not something that meets what the challenge seeks, with specificity.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Regarding the script, the activities described by the proponent raised some doubts. What interface would be created (month 1)? Since it would be a tool that from what I understand would be a kind of extension, used in the internet browser, what platform would they talk about? Would the tool have some web application, a kind of website? We even managed to understand what would be done and when, as the detailing of the months is adequate, the problem I really identified here was in relation to understanding what was suggested in the impact and what would be being developed in the activities schedule. Some confusion has been generated. In the same way that these doubts were raised for the script, the part of the division of expenses is also a little confusing because we do not know how the work routines of the professionals involved would be, we do not know how many hours the front and back developers work. end just as the designer would dedicate to the project, so it is not possible for us to calculate the value of the hour of work and understand if what is being charged would in fact be fair. I would like to know more details about the marketing services - how this campaign would be done - and also what would be the mentioned maintenance services. I notice that the expenses requested here are similar to the two other proposals of the same bidder in this challenge, and in the 3 cases my comments were similar, as I believe that the information that was passed is more of a basic nature and needs a little more depth. Finally speaking about the team, this is the best part of the feasibility, they are described in great detail who are the members involved. The proponent already has experience with Cardano (he is the founder of the Cardano Feed website), and also says he is a blockchain enthusiast and already has experience with several very relevant technologies for the development of projects surrounding Catalyst, such as \u201ce-commerce B2B and B2C, marketplace, digital marketing, UX/user experience, navigation tests, interface, information architecture, big data, data-driven, data science, webmetrics, BI (Business Intelligence), open innovation, crowdsourcing\u201d and so on. The other team members also make very good presentations about themselves, Felipe from the software engineering area and Lucas working in the marketing side. I was in doubt about the role that Gino would play in the project, maybe he will help in the dissemination, preparing the texts to be released. What was missing was to present who would be the designer, as he is a fundamental professional for the project and is not included in this team. Therefore, I believe that we have positive points here, but also a lot of aspects to be improved.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "We don't have many means to audit the proposal development process based on the information that is passed, unfortunately. To measure progress, the proponent only suggests looking at the numbers of script impressions and also listed coins; how could we monitor the tasks to be developed behind these partial results? As I suggested for Ot\u00e1vio's other proposals, I think it would be important that they take the content provided in the roadmap and make it accessible to our community members as these activities are being developed in practice. For this to be even more adequate, it would be interesting for them to carry out a more in-depth detailing of each of the parts, so that we would know very precisely what would happen and how (and when). For example, in the first month, let's say the developers work part-time on this project - that way it would be more accurate for us to control whether what was agreed was being promised, for example. Ideally, the team leader would hold a monthly meeting with the rest of the professionals involved and collect the information, which could be passed on in the form of newsletters to the Cardano community. Regarding the success scenario, the auditability of the final results, as in the other proposals, the focus here is enough for the success of the tool itself (Number of triggers and visualization of the overlay widget / Number of integrated content / CTR: Widget impression to click ratio). It would be important for us to understand what was thought for the technology would have been achieved - in general, if the navigability and the level of user satisfaction would have improved from this initiative. But it is also essential for us to understand whether the project would have had a positive impact on Cardano, whether the objectives of the challenge were met, directly or indirectly. This could be done if users, after installing the tool in their web browsers, show some kind of interest in Cardano and its technologies, somehow this tool aroused curiosity so that they know better about our ecosystem and get involved in our activities, whether with Catalyst projects, using Dapps, buying and delegating Ada\u2026? How could this research be understood and passed on to the Cardano community? Therefore, I conclude that, based on what has been said, I do not believe that such an adequate monitoring of the project would be carried out, and that several adjustments and deepenings are necessary for this to be carried out in a satisfactory manner.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "The assessor shows that he did not fully understand the proposal presented, informing browser extension and the like.

The question I find myself wrestling with is if the potential benefits of this proposal is worth the asked $48k, which is what this impacts section is supposed to be for. I think this section of the proposal would greatly benefit from some hypothetical examples that paints the picture for how this would benefit the Cardano ecosystem in a way that is worth more than what other proposals have to offer. If there is any research about price information translating to asset purchasing, this would be the perfect time to input that information. While there\u2019s plenty of information here to tell me what this team plans on doing, there isn\u2019t enough substance to tell me what the positive impact would be.

This team is a very self-sufficient unit that has everything they need to do what CardanoFeed intends to do. The roadmap is a clear symptom of that, as it lays out a very expedient delivery with clear step-by-step actionable points. Where this section loses some points from me is the shortage of key evaluative detail in the budget section. This is important for a proposal requesting funds that is above the average cost of Catalyst fund requests. While the budget does provide allocations towards various categories needed to accomplish the building of this widget, it omits information about hourly rates and hours allocated to each position/task. Without this information, voters have no way of measuring efficiency in spending to evaluate if Catalyst funds are spent well here OR if they could be better spent (with potentially greater impacts) in other proposals. If you assume full-time hours, the labor for this budget is extremely cheap. However, all of these core team members are actively working on a pre-established company that has its own separate daily responsibilities and tasks.

If there were more articulated impacts in this proposal, this section would give me a clearer view of the magnitude of those impacts and how effectively those benefits can be reaped. I might suggest that the given metrics are a little underwhelming for 100,000/1,000,000 monthly views, it seems like the platform does not intend on expecting platform growth after a 5 month timeframe. I would suggest establishing milestones across different timeframes of the future of this project, so that voters can see a clear progression from point A to point B. This provides voters with a perception that the proposers have an acute sense of expected performance AND it shows a more sustained impact scenario.
