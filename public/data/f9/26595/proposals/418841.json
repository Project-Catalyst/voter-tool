Eternl is a light wallet widely known in Cardano community, and to support continuously growing Cardano user base, the next version of Eternl will be focusing on overhauling the user experience for new users while also providing experienced (professional) user with advanced features. Providing information to further support the problem statement would be great to show that the project would give a real impact to the product (e.g., survey for Eternl users about the user experience; testimony from a known figure in Eternl community).\nFrom the concept itself, I believe that the project would bring a great improvement, as Eternl v2 will support multi-platform and enables interaction with various Cardano blockchain services in the future.

Each task in the list can be added with their development timeline (e.g. UI Redesign: August 2022 - September 2022), and multi-platform plan can be added with codebase used for each platform development.\n\nThe proposal also lacks of budget breakdown, which is also important to give voters details regarding fund allocation in the project. Providing salary rate and expected total work hours for the duration of the project would give a better vision for budgeting.

An upgrade to this wallet will be beneficial to the community because it would affect so many daily users. The idea of the proposal is to create new/upgraded features that would allow for new users to join their wallet as well. This could help lead to the majority of users utilizing this wallet which would have a global impact on their product. This would be highly beneficial to the entire Cardano ecosystem because it will create a better wallet for so many users.

It includes all of the features that will be implemented into their wallet and states how these changes will benefit new wallet users. The budget breakdown is simple, yet concise. It states that the requested funds will be distributed amongst their 4 developers there.

It is lead by a great team that has been successful in the past and has one of the ecosystems largest wallets. When assessing the potential success of a proposal, there are 2 things that can be very important to gauging this process. The first principle is transparency. In order to be successful, the community needs to be aware of this proposal and understand what utility it could bring to users on the blockchain. Being open and transparent as a project allows for trust to be built within the community and leads to community members who become invested in the project. This then leads to the second principle which is accountability. When there are loyal community members, they are likely to hold the team accountable to their specific goals and timeframes that have been listed in this proposal. It is great when there is a positive community because the form of accountability is always positive. They want access to the product as soon as possible and so that leads them to maintain conversation with the team. I believe that this will be easy for the Eternl team because they already have such a large community and a lot of daily users as stated in the proposal. The team just needs to make sure that they ensure that the community is aware of this proposal and the upgrades that would be associated with it. It is likely going to animate the community and lead to a larger impact if funded. For these reasons, I give this section of the proposal 5 stars.

Budget breakdown information is also still missing, which is critical because it will outline how the amount will be spent. It should be sufficient to list the simple projected work hours and remuneration for the upcoming six months, e.g., iOS developer $50/hour for 288 hours of labor, outlining the responsibilities of each of the four key developers, etc. Given that this is a product, a conductible plan with a roadmap is essential because it will demonstrate that the team members not only understand what they're doing but also how long it took to complete it (by outlining each month's aim and objectives).

Plus, many NFT projects now are promoting to use Nami or Eternl wallet, which I think its good to have a user-centric approach design. As funny as it sounds, but I suggest looking at the Terra Station wallet dashboard design - simple, easy to use as a new user, and uses colors to differentiate links and navigations.
