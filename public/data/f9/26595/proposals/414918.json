They outline a number of problems with the existing NFT game market and then go onto state how they intend to resolve them which include making it free to play, high quality and NFTs where there value is influenced by playing rather than just rarity. The solution that is described does not add any depth as to why there game is more fun or novel than existing games out there in a similar genre. Just for the fact it uses NFTs does mean people will want to play this game. After playing the demo briefly there was not anything that gave me this information on what the key parts would be that attract people to this game. This is important as the NFTs and use cases won't have any real meaning unless people want to play the game. For the risks they mention the complexity of the project as it is large in scope, the risks of the market situation and that they have other competing projects that could be funded. Not committing to doing one project well is a risk for a game due to the complexities and attention to detail needed, the team have stated they would onboard other freelancers to support them if multiple projects got funded. Overall based on the information provided I do not have confidence that this project has novel features or functionality that will attract gamers to this application, in future proposals the team could be more explicit on what makes this game novel or enjoyable to the end user based on their understanding of the market or from testimonials if they are further along in this project.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "In terms of feasibility the project is broken down into quarter periods of development. Some of the initial quarters has already passed with a number of tasks that are already completed. The team is currently working on Q2 tasks involving marketplace development and game portal development. They are looking to release an MVP in the third quarter of this year. They also add in strategic phases to give high level tasks they want to achieve in each 6 month period. This helps to add further clarity on exact intentions for delivery. The budget is broken down into the different functional areas such as client and backend development, art, documentation, QA and management with the figures seeming reasonable. The team breakdown provides the names and backgrounds of some of the team members involved. No professional links are provided to verify their background. On the website some team information is provided but the links do not work for checking their backgrounds. Their website has a demo application which is playable amongst other relevant information about the application. The website helps to provide evidence that they can feasibly execute this game. Overall it appears fairly likely this project is feasible with the teams focus, more information on the teams background could have helped increase this confidence. There are risks on the teams capacity to execute this proposal depending on what is funded. Higher confidence could be provided if the team are more precise in knowing what they want to focus their time on rather than proposing many projects that all require high time investment.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Tracking the progress of this proposal will mean sharing a detailed estimation to the community, documentation of game development such as tokenomics and gameplay documentation, an executive schedule on current progress and a marketing schedule. They also mention they will publish work on their blog which they link to. These details in aggregate will give sufficient information to the community. It would have been good to have a Github repository if anything was going to be open source. In terms of successful outcomes the team highlight the execution of the proposal and onboarding new staff to speed up development. Over the long term they mention they look to attract 3 million users. How did the team arrive at this value? The 6 month outcomes of 50k users and 100k joining social media accounts appears reasonable. It could have been useful to be more specific on what kind of interactions with the game they would see as a success. For instance if a player has done this many missions or quests or has played for this amount of time as this would create a more useful statistic on what an actual user for this game is rather than someone who may have just started the game briefly and left. Overall it looks likely the community will be able to audit the progress of the proposal. The proposals quality on the game details could have been improved which would have been useful to then define more specific auditable objectives on what would be considered a successful outcome in terms of player usage and engagement.

It's about creating a new NFT game; the proponents (the unicorn studio group) raise some problems with games of this style today. According to them, current NFT games have very low graphics quality; are unstable as \u201cthere is only one revenue stream from users who buy NFTs or tokens. If users sell NFTs/tokens, project values \u200b\u200bwill become Zero soon\u201d; they state how expensive and inaccessible these games are, since buying NFTs is usually quite expensive; also comment on the problem that games are based on the greed of the players, when they have the power to decide on the price of NFTs, \u201cso there are low level NFTs, but the price is tens of times higher than the level NFTs superior in the market. This leads to inflation and makes it harder for later players to access the game, and makes the market a worthless pile of junk.\u201d All these problems would be solved by the game Dragon Warrior, which would be about survival, collecting cards and building decks (to defeat enemies). The proponents argue well what would be the differentials of the game and how it would meet the problems mentioned above, solving them. It would be a free game for beginners, with high quality graphics (including virtual reality and etc), and one strategy that I found very interesting is that players could not choose the value of NFTs. As the proponents explain, \u201cIf players want their NFTs to become more valuable, they need to spend time, spend effort in the game to upgrade their NFTs. When the level of NFTs is high enough and players want to profit from it, they can exchange for others.\u201d In other words, the game is very well thought out to solve the current problems of the NFT ecosystem, and it certainly meets the objectives of the challenge well, since here we are seeking to finance projects that create dApps, products and integrations (games are included) that contribute to expansion and the best Cardano establishment on the market. This would be achieved here, as all digital tokens would be minted on our network, from what I understand; new active members could also be attracted to the Cardano community, who would come engaged by the game, and not by the blockchain technology itself - although I believe that they would be people who would already have a knowledge, even if basic, of Cardano's technologies, since the game would deal with the universe of NFTs. The problem I identified here would be a matter of gameplay. How would a match in this game be? Neither by the description of the proposal, or by the attached links, the youtube trailer that is available, this issue is very clear. I would like to know how the activities of the game would be, in practice. It would be important for us to understand the user experience, so that we would be more certain about the impacts that the game would have. In fact, the site is very beautiful, the characters created so far have a very sophisticated design, but unfortunately it is not possible to understand how the matches would be, which would be very important. Talking about the risks, I believe they can be divided into two parts: the difficulties of the team itself and the challenges of the downturn in the cryptocurrency market. As for the challenges of the team itself, from what I understand the workload (which is extensive) would be solved from the moment a larger team was hired, and so more people would work on the studio's projects. But there is no proposed solution to the situation that cryptocurrencies are down and this may drive the public away from NFT games; it would be important to have a sense of how to mitigate this as well. Speaking, finally, of the topics that in my view would be better served, present in the summary of the challenge, in my view they would be \u201ccreation or improvement of different Dapps, products and integrations that add value to the Cardano community and the wider ecosystem\u201d and also \u201chigher quality of existing products and integrations through suggested improvements that are supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community\u201d (in this case there are already many NFT games but this one would be better developed, so it is said.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "First, we know about several activities that relate to the project and that have already been completed, such as concept art, 2D and 3D concept, character design, NFT project, website design and many others. Then we have two explanations about what is being done/still needs to be done, such as: \u201cT2-2022: Develop Marketplace (Doing) + Front-end Development (Doing)\u201d; and in the other part it is explained through phases: \u201cphase 1 (6 months): Marketplace launch and MVP: release market to sell NFTs for in-game move-to-earn activity, game launch and season start Country I (USA), attract players to join the game\u201d and so on. In my view, the establishment of two versions of the script makes our understanding a little confusing. Which of these versions should we base ourselves on? I found that the second version, which works with the levels, is easier to see, so I will comment on it. In fact, the ideal would be for the activities to be divided into a single timeline and for this to be based on months. That way we would know more precisely what would happen and when. The activities could also be better detailed. For example in phase 1, players would be attracted. How would this be done? What would the marketing campaign be? In phase 2: the game would be expanded, new planets would be created - how would that be done? It seems to me that the development of the project would be worked a lot at this stage, so it would be important to understand how this development would be done, what would be the work routine of the professionals involved here and so on. Although more activities are mentioned in version 1 of the script, they are not well explained either. Generally speaking, proponents allow us to understand what would be done, but not so specifically how and when. So, for this part of the script to be more adequate, in my view it needs to be reworked a little better. The bidders attach a link to a website which according to them gives us a more detailed view of the roadmap, but I couldn't find that more detail. Talking about the costs now, the expenses are also not exemplified in the most correct way possible. It would be necessary for us to have a better detailing of the parts. For example, why would client implementation cost $15,000? What exactly would that be? Which document (or documents) would cost $5,000? How many quality tests would be done and why is $3,000 set aside for that part? I believe that each of the expenses could have been better explained. It would be important for us to know, for example, the hourly rate charged by each professional involved here - be it a developer, publicist, designer, etc. Speaking of the team's presentation, some issues should be resolved here. The first fact is that no one has experience with Cardano per se, and it would be very important that we had at least someone who was more knowledgeable about our blockchain technologies, to ensure that things were done properly. In fact, only Andy seems to be involved with blockchain in general, which is a little worrisome. The information that team members provide about themselves is rich and necessary, but I wish they had attached their linkedin profiles, so that we could get to know them more precisely and that the past information could be verified. So, we have some good points here, in general we know the basic information needed, but overall the feasibility still has a lot to improve.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Proponents state that \u201cfor more information in the future, please check our website, we will publish our works regularly in our blog section\u201d. How often would these publications be made? What exactly would the content be covered? Would they make monthly posts that would update us on all the important parts of the project, how did they follow up? They state that there will be an \u201cexecutive timeline \u2013 these roadmaps will be updated regularly based on our actual situation. It helps the community know where we are in our planned plan.\u201d Again it would be important for us to understand how often (eg once a month) this information would be made available to our community. However, looking at what is provided to us, it seems to me that the team will update us both on the positive results and on the processes; since the executive schedule seems to me to focus on the activities themselves, that is, the work routine of professionals, and we have numerous KPIs that would serve as partial results, such as: \u201cnumber of active users in the game, number of NFTs made and sold, total number of followers on social channels and number of brands that cooperate with us\u201d. So for this part of the proposal to be ideal, in my opinion it would be necessary for us to have a more exact detail of 1) how often updates would be provided to the Cardano community; 2) what would actually be updated - although we have an idea, this information is not so concrete. As for the final results, we have an understanding of what the game's success would look like in a 6-month period and also in the long term, but proponents would need to pay better attention to how to measure the benefits for Cardano (their goals are very focused on for the game itself); and finally how it could come to our knowledge. Would there be any presentation to understand if the objectives of the challenge were achieved? How would players have become active members of our community? In my view, it is necessary to better establish this bridge between game > Cardano ecosystem > Cardano community. Therefore, my opinion is that we do have some ways of auditing the proposal, but some improvements could be made to make this clearer and more secure.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2785, "q0": "Revolving around the limitations of NFT games and the decline of the year, the team proposed to commit to a Metaverse platform to solve the problem that the old nft game failed to do.\nThe team provides a Dragon Warriors game platform, allowing the community to join for free, and experience a much higher quality of technology than previous nft games, and how to control the price of NFTS in the game to avoid inflation and difficult to access for newbies because the price is too high for the value of that NFTS.

While the proposals provides some bullet points about the mechanics of the proposed TCG game, this section of the proposal is missing some steps that articulate the greater impact of the given proposal. The groundwork for producing that articulation could be by providing some market analysis about traditional TCG card games, how many TCGs are building on Cardano, and how successful NFT TCGs have been on other chains. This will help give voters a sense of uniqueness, adoption potential, and alignment with Cardano Catalysts mission to pursue innovation. This missing foundation leads the proposal to only provide actionable steps (which is more roadmap territory) when asked to describe the proposed solution. In my opinion, this section is far more effective when it\u2019s geared towards appeal for adoption, innovation, and real-world impacts. Specifically on the point of NFT pricing, there\u2019s a question of enforceability and a deviation away from free-market mechanics such as ownership. My first question when running into this point is how the proposer intends to control pricing in the open circulation of NFT assets. The most obvious solution (in my mind) is to keep these \u201cassets\u201d within a controlled environment that cannot interact with the greater Cardano ecosystem, which loosens the definition of \u201cNFT\u201d and ownership. Those that are more ideologically aligned with decentralization and free-market principles are more likely to see this feature as a liability within the cryptocurrency space, unless it can be further articulated/justified in alignment with these principles.

I lend presumption to the team as they have participated in Catalyst before and have been delivering on previously approved proposals but this information might be important for voters to put on every proposal submitted. The roadmap portion shows planning for both the greater gaming ecosystem being developed by unicorn studio as well as the development of this specific TCG game, so voters are given plenty of substance to evaluate plausibility in actionable steps. Where voters are not given enough substance is in the budget breakdown, in which the allocations are only given amounts for broad categories. From this information, it is impossible to evaluate efficiency in spending because there is no given information on hours allocated for labor, hourly rates, itemized expenses or any further specified breakdown.

Which will take away from Cardano's prominence. \nThey provide some metrics of the success they want to achieve, such as getting 50k players in the game in the first 6 months and 100k users joining the game's social media channels.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3231", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12600, "q0": "The project effectively addresses the challenge. You present very precisely the problem of most Play-to-Earn games today. Most of these games are made hastily and sloppily just to quickly catch up with the Play-to-Earn craze, and then become \"trash\" when the trend ends. So it's usually 2D games, even 2D graphics, but some are made worse than games from the 1990's. Some games are too \"Pay-to-win\", the players they have to spend money to buy new NFTs can play the game then they spend more money to win, I wonder what these games are made for? . Therefore, it only meets the needs of players to make money and cannot exist for a long time and develop.\nGames and gaming communities are indispensable in any Blockchain ecosystem, especially Cardano, where very few game projects are developed, making it difficult to compete with other ecosystems in this field. So I welcome game projects like this.\nThe proposer sent a link that very clearly demonstrates the game mechanics and features. I couldn't ask for anything more. But this is a free to play game, so it takes time to develop, slowly but surely. This will attract gamers and investors, more importantly, the ability to retain gamers to stay longer. I hope that the quality of the graphics or gameplay will make gamers think that they are paying for the entertainment in the game, not that they are paying for the Play-to-Earn feature. You saying that NFT price is not decided by the player but depends on the level, but I think you have to be extremely calm and alert before the NFT or Play-to-Earn trends that may happen in the future , these NFTs can be swept up in a wave then dumped by market-manipulating institutions.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Thank you for providing complete information about the project members and their experiences. That will give the community peace of mind that if funds are given, it will be given to qualified people. And the roadmap that you gave is very detailed with the assigned and completed work, I am quite confident that I have grasped the amount of work that the team undertakes. I have no comment on this part of the proposal, as I consider the information provided to be sufficient to my satisfaction. The required budget is in line with the project scope. I recommend coming back for the next round of funding, i think this is a project that will be difficult on the budget for game development, and I hope you will come back with some of the remarkable success you will achieve.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Thank you for providing all the necessary information so that I can compare them with future project progress updates.
