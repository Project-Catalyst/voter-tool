The platform will make Cardano the first blockchain with NFTs with an innate utility: helping to promote SPO and decentralization of the network while receiving rewards for it. If this proposal is successful, it will benefit the entire Cardano ecosystem by giving people the ability to be incentivized to promote the SPO of their choice using any primary ID. NFT books as tools. In the end, the more successful the SPOs in the ecosystem, and the more decentralization is distributed across multiple channels, the more decentralized Cardano becomes.

In each such activity, we know its execution time. for how long and how much per hour.

It is a real use case for NFTs in what can be considered Web3 affiliate marketing that simultaneously promotes decentralization by giving the chance to smaller pools to shine regardless of their media/marketing ability. This project is definitely an added value and a pioneer in the space for Cardano and amongst other chains too. The beauty of the solution is that it presents a simple solution that results in an impact that is local on the Stake Pool level. But this impact snowballs to affect the whole network through an increase in decentralization and the number of stake pools which automatically creates a stronger ecosystem. On the other hand, the project is as limited as the number of SPOs willing to use it and the projects willing to participate which in my opinion won't be a big problem due to the nature of the Cardano community and willingness to support every idea that promotes decentralization.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From the links provided by the team and according to their past experiences and previous projects, I feel confident to say that the success likelihood of the project is pretty high. \nFor starters, the team is experienced enough to make such a project happen.

The team also presented a detailed plan for development and an infographic to showcase the design specifics of the solution. Furthermore, they gave a monthly breakdown of what can be expected and what will be done. Finally, they mention some risks and how to mitigate them but perhaps that part needed more attention.

The nature of the project being open-source makes the task of auditability whole lot easier. For instance, the community can keep track of the Github commits, the documentation provided, and so on. The budget is broken down in the number of hours needed for every person working on the project which showcases transparency in spending that is appreciated by the community.

It is very unique and has potential to bring a lot of utility to Cardano members. I know that there a lots of people that would love to be an SPO on Cardano but lack to means to successfully mint blocks each epoch. This proposal intends to address this challenge by providing a platform where users can go to delegate their ada to assist that stake pool and receive a portion of the funds as well. The people that are running SPOs should have a lot of education in the space and know how to successfully run a stake pool. I believe that this proposal could improve decentralized activity on Cardano because it will allow for more single pool operators to run a successful stake pool.

The first is, does this project have an engaged community behind the project? If not, how does the team plan to have an engaged community that is aware of this proposal and the value that it can bring to these members. It should be rather easy because it will benefit both community members and SPOs. There needs to be a community or rather, a form of a community that can hold the team accountable for this information.

In return, the SPO gets whatever percentage of the block rewards their delegators represent (in a pool with 10m staked, if the wallets of NFT holders total to 9m, the NFT project receives 90% of each block reward).\n\nThe proposal is for the research and development of the platform to facilitate the onboarding of these relationships (a marketplace for what they are calling alliances) as well as a lightwallet integration that provides transparency for all parties and observers into the alliances.\n\nIn terms of helping small SPOs acquire delegation, which is one of the most significant factors for decentralization of the network, there is a certain elegance here.  NFT projects can market themselves as helping to decentralize Cardano and SPOs can gain stake (the first block of any epoch goes 100% to the SPO)  The NFT project will likely choose to support smaller pools, on the grounds that the delegation they bring to those pools will be a larger percentage of the rewards (though there does need to be an analysis done to see if supporting larger pools is a more ideal target, as they have higher total rewards.  Wherever the the protocol settles, this will need to be tested.  This and other issues reappears under feasibility).\n\nIt is worth noting that this harvesting of the rewards from small SPOs may end up having unintended consequences, for example slowing the growth and development of the node operators themselves.  Early SPO rewards can be the key to setting up better marketing, enhancing service, upgrading hardware and covering fixed costs.  While guaranteeing the rewards from the first blocks protects the smallest pools, there is this tricky moment in the pool's growth where they are able to make more than one block per epoch due to the influence of a big alliance, but suddenly their revenue drops sharply.  They become dependent on the alliance at that point, because if they cancel it they likely drop below one block per epoch, but if they keep it, they are missing out on the most lucrative, pre-saturation period of rewards.  This isn't a healthy dynamic.  However, the marketplace presumably could solve for this by allowing the alliance to be formed with specific agreements in place, such as a scaling rewards percentage that favors the pool beyond just the first block, etc.\n\nBecause the problem being addressed is one of the most critical issues to the sustainability and future security of the Cardano protocol, and because the team has provided a workable solution built around a distributed marketing model, there is definitely the potential for impact here.  Unfortunately, due to gaps in analysis here for game theory and unintended consequences, I feel there is more work to be done on the practical applications of the theory here, and find that I can neither agree nor disagree with the ultimate outcomes that will be achieved here.  3 stars.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "As noted above, there are gaps in the practical application of this idea.  The first is the note about whether sharing the SPO rewards beyond regular delegator rewards actually delivers positive outcomes for SPOs.  More research is needed there.  Additionally, there is a broad issue of how SPOs go about sharing those rewards, which is indicated to be a manual process, enabled by smart contracts in the future, but currently down to trusting the SPOs in the present.  Even without smartcontracts many aspects of this could be automated and governed, and the buildout of the wallet integration for transparency can serve as a temporary support for the outcomes desired (you may be starting to see a thread developing here...I'll point it out in full under auditability).\n\nFurther, there are legal ramifications to be considered, as the construction of these alliance agreements are really contracts, and both parties will need guidance and governance for entering and leaving them (what if an SPO wants to back out of an alliance that has been lucrative for the NFT project once the SPO might be able to make blocks on its own?)  There is also an added issue about whether it is possible for a malicious actor to be the sole holder of an NFT project (which can be disguised with auto wallet creation and distribution) and to basically execute a type of sybil attack where they ally with SPOs within a certain range and effectively dominate their rewards distribution, grabbing both the delegation AND spo rewards, and then undelegating (can't regulate the actual delegated wallets via the alliance so the NFT side of the alliance has an imbalance of power even for honest actors), rebranding and approaching another project.  More risk analysis is definitely needed here.\n\nThese aren't issues with the timeline, milestones or budget, and they aren't even criticisms of the team.  While there are specific issues with these areas, they all are adequate in many respects, and reasonable on most points.  Because of this, there is definitely a basis here for supporting the feasibility of the project.  However due to unacknowledged risks throughout the proposal, I am not able to agree or disagree here.  3 stars.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "And this is where the chickens come home to roost.  The milestones on the roadmap have been provided as reference for the KPIs (note to proposer, it is always a good idea to include the metrics here specifically rather than referring readers elsewhere...auditability is an opportunity to summarize the roadmap and impact in an easily understandable, actionable way).\n\nThe issue here is that what has been drawn up leans heavily into the building of the platform, and integration of tools like the light wallet.  Looking over the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal, it occurs to me that without changing the budget or team, and without even really altering the timeline (but 100% redesigning the metrics) this project could pivot from delivering the fully functional platform, rife with risk and unintended consequences, to instead developing a *proof of concept* that they than ran in a controlled way with interested SPOs.  The legal issues become deliverable milestones rather than risks; the edge cases and opportunism become parameter discoveries instead of adoption blockers.  Framing this project as a proof of concept alters the warp and woof of the entire proposal, turning weaknesses into strengths while allowing the real shine of the proposal, which is its attempt to address sustainable decentralization in an innovative way, to come through as a north star for expressing and pursuing outcomes.\n\nI love the direction and innovation being considered here by the team, but there are real issues that must be sussed out before going too far down the road of building the solution.  My caution here is to \"look before you leap\".  Because of the lack of KPIs and metrics that effectively describe progress towards and realization of the goals described under Impact, I'm afraid I cannot agree that this proposal is ultimately auditable:  2 stars.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "We want to build a platform that provides both Single SPOs and NFT Projects or creators the ability to promote delegation to a particular Pool and share the rewards of the SPO in a fair manner.", "experience": "Our developer is a Mechanical & Mechatronics Engineer that has been an active builder in the Cardano ecosystem.
