The solution to this problem is to exhibit Cardano at the Crypto House of Commons event, which is the first crypto community focused on promoting the growth of the crypto market in Brazil, S\u00e3o Paulo. This event will focus on fostering discussion of cryptocurrencies, tokens, and blockchain to bring society closer to all the constant innovations in the crypto market in Brazil and all over the world. The idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal is perfectly fine and it could introduce the Cardano ecosystem to more people, however, I don't think it fits what we are looking for in the challenge \" Dapps, Products & Integrations \" so it wouldn't be fair to give it a high score for impact. I think this suggestion will be more suitable for the Developer Ecosystem challenge and suitable for \"A sense of community and conversations. Having people around to talk with.\"", "q0r": 3, "q1": "With that said, this is an event proposal, this event will take place in 3 days (November 18-20, 2022) so the implementation plan revolves around organizing and The author has given a timeline of 4 weeks to carry out the preparations. Every week we know exactly what work is going to be done to make sure the event can be as successful as possible, so in terms of development, I am completely satisfied. Next comes the budget, the requested budget is $24,905, and all necessary expenses are listed, so we also have an exact vision of what is needed for the event, however, will be even better if each activity comes with a certain amount. For example, the \"3 Support Staff (3 days)\" expense allowance has been listed, but we need to know what their salaries are like for these 3 days to have a more accurate view of how they are divided. split the requested amount. Finally, about the team, the project team is very well presented, we know the names, training areas, interests, and LinkedIn profiles of the team members, creating a strong safety and reliability in their job. The feasibility of the proposal will completely convince me if they provide some information about the content of the event, for example, what topics will be discussed, and what their advertising campaigns are?", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of the project is very well presented, the community can track the progress of the proposal as a monthly news release on the Cardano Feed, and several KPIs are provided for easy review. easily audited as:\n-Number of Cardano explained live to entrepreneurs: 800 people for the live event\n-Lecture for conference participants: 1,200\n-Twitter followers: 3,000+\n-Participants of the prize: 10\nIn the success of the project, the team identified four successes.

This indeed has much value as can certainly integrate Cardano to other blockchain network and show its potential to those who dont know it yet, specially considering the potential of Brazil, a very populated developing country where hundres of crypto traders are emerging everyday. This also alignes with challenge as it can be intepreted as an integration, that might bring new developers and possibly daps in the future, even if in a indireect way.\nIn regard to the proposal, Proposer does a good job on explaining about the event itself but it could bring more information of what Cardano content exactly will be brought by them to this event. It just mentions that lectures and presentations will be carried out but it would be interesting to know exacly what topics they will talk about and what approach will be adopted. As suggestions, it could be presented real use cases/project already developed, real interactive activities leveraging the Daps/hardwares already developed and so on. \nAll in all, the idea is nice but proposal could ellaborate more on the content itself, both to help assessing its impact and to collect early feedbacks. My rate is therefore 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There's a sensible time-framed plan in place, where the main activities are clearly stated. I liked they included the supporting tasks (such as Buy airline tickets and contract the event).\n\nAs for the budget, I understood the sponsorship plan provided by the event will cover all the mentioned costs, so it wouldnt make sense to break it down.\n\nAs for the team, there are 3 people already committed with a lot of experience in Cardano that actively participate in several Cardano agendas and seem to have experience in such events. A good description is provided wit links to serve as reference.\n\nAll in all, project seems feasible. my rate is 5.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There are good milestones plan and they will be communicate in their channel (Cardano channel), which makes it easier for everyone to track progress. Also, several good kpis are proposed and they all have pre-defined goals, that will help to assess if everything went as expected. I liked they already considered a sort of conversion rate, that will be measure by the number of Wallets donwloaded.\nMy only suggestion here would be to make a proper regular follow up wit attendes later on to check how their experience in Cardano is going and whether they need som guidance to better engage in ecosystem and Catalyst. \nIn a summary, elements provided to audit the project are good and will certainly help to verify success.

I think this is an importan proposal, as a lot of the other proposals mainly in the development ecosystem struggle to market their solutions. This problem will be somewhat fixed if cardano was more commonly known and a lot of efforts have to be put in that direction. I'm happy to see a proposal that tries to rase awareness and point out the facts like 800+ projects registered and much much more building on cardano already and expanding the ecosystem.\nThe proposal will surely add value to the cardano ecosystem just through representing cardano at the house of commons. It's true the project maybe not ideal for this challenge, but considering the other categories, it fits well enough here as well. I also like the targeted event is global considering the many languages that are going to be used / translated to including english, spanish, french and german, which is quite the diversity.\nI really like the idea of a company that deals with bringing companies and people together with 12 years of experience represent cardano, because this is a lot of experience for something really particular and I'm a big proponent of specialized labor.\nOverall this is an impactfull idea and I do hope it gets implemented.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The milestones are given segregated by weeks and week 1 and 2 are a setup weeks that's normal for any conferance for the preparation to be longer or atleast as long as the event itself. Preparing to give a lecture is no small task as I do have some experience in that respect and preparation is really important. One shot, one opportunity and all that. Considering the milestones, they do seem reasonable and well timed so I don't have any complaints there.\nThe budget breakdown could have ben done a lot better and there are two reasons why I say that.\n1. There is a specific price 24905 - that implies some calculations.\n2. There's a really good breakdown of tasks that shows that most likely those tasks were used for the aforementioned calculation.\nConsidering those two arguments, I really think they could have presented their actual calculation used for comming up with that requested budget number. That's a a bit of an issue for me as an assesor because now I can't compare their budget to other proposals and recommended budgets and hourly rates. This is a bit of a hit and miss for me, but keep in mind the budget requested is a really small piece compared to the whole challenge available funds and I do still believe this is an important proposal to have up and running. My suggestion to the proposers would be to be as transparent and possible for their next proposals and show the calculations they made and would recommend breaking down the tasks in hours and then providing their hourly rates. This makes comparing the hourly rate to other proposals more easy therefore enabling easier recomendation by proposers and another thing would be easier estimation of wheather the time aloted for each task is reasonable.\nI was able to check out and verify the listed team members and their skills and credentials so it all checks out and I can say with confidence that these people would be able to deliver what's said in the proposal.\nIn summary this is a feasible proposal, even with the few caveats mentioned. I wish good luck to the proposers.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The metrics for this proposal seem reasonable and I really like the participation in the conferance, because iot shows there will be quite a lot of people and although I haven't heard of this conferance (considering I do live on the other side of the planet) the numbers speak for themselves. I really did find the KPIs to be a bit vague, and I was hoping for some actual numbers instead of just a statement like \"increase the number of attendies\" because that could mean increase by 1 or 1000 and there's a significant difference. On that front I'd advise the proposers to have actual measurable goals. There will be emails and telegram channels so I'm not worried about auditability.\nIn summary the proposal has an importan problem to solve and the offered solution seems like a good place to start - marketing cardano to people.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2463", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4942, "q0": "The campaign brief of this challenge is about creating new dapps, products and services for the community to use and enrich the ecosystem.

For example, it is stated that in the subsidy section, the proposer needs to pay for hiring 3 support staff, meal, transportation and hiring keynote speaker. How much does it cost for this section alone? On your next proposal, provide each cost breakdown for every section of your budget so that it will be easier to assess.
