They have Cardano/Catalyst/Atala Prism qualifications and have successfully completed past Catalyst proposals in FUND 6 to 8. There is therefore complete confidence that the team can bring this proposal to term.\n\nAlthough quite technical, the budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items. Additional funding is not required to implement the proposal, but it is not excluded depending on future needs to maintain interoperability. The budget and the timetable (total of 3 months) seem to be reasonable to achieve the set goals. The proposer provided a detailed roadmap for this proposal as well as a list of actionable tasks to complete.\nThe proposal also clearly explains technical aspects like architecture, language and technologies that are crucial for this implementation.\n\nGiven the experience and plan presented, it is very likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal provided a clear and detailed roadmap with milestones (integration of new SDK, dev, testing, and documentation) and a time horizon for achievement (3 months).

The work done by the RootsID and Roots wallet team is a major part of the pioneering work for this. Connecting AtalaPRISM with real world use cases through wallet integration is important, and the iPhone has 55% market share, even more among certain Tech and VC demographics. This proposal matches the DApp, Products and Integrations challenge perfectly and is a good addition to the Roots portfolio.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal is dependent on the release of a Prism SDK based on JavaScript. We only learn that it will be released \u201csoon\u201d. The 12 weeks implementation phase and budget at $100/hour are well detailed and credible. The team behind RootsID is well known and impressive. In total, the team have 10 proposals in this fund which if all funded could pose some time constraints. It is however less relevant for this iPhone project, as it will most likely happen later in the year when the SDK is released. I like that 20 hours are reserved for testing and documentation, while these could have been budgeted cheaper than the development, it is a strong point to be included.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "It is a little disappointing that the only deliverable is an iPhone version of the Roots wallet. There are no targets for number of downloads, user ranking or how long the Apple audit and implementation overall will take. The Github documentation of this project and high exposure of the team in the community make audit and communication very easy. I recommend that the proposers add some KPIs for quality, quantity and smooth launch. Releasing on Apple is a lot harder than Android in my experience.

The proposer hasn\u2019t considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful adoption.\nThe proposer have just founded other proposals from Project Catalyst and this is a continuation of these previously funded (Catalyst Fund 7 and 8) proposals which produced the Android version of RootsWallet: Open Source Credential Wallet (Fund 7), RootsWallet - Backup/Recovery (Fund 8).", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2245", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 15211, "q0": "Yes, the proposal is definitely in line with what the challenge is looking for, as it will promote the improvement of an existing dApp. In this case, it is the RootsWallet identity card, which is currently only compatible with Android phones. The idea is that those who have an iPhone can also access this SSI from Atala Prism. The project fully aligns with what the challenge seeks, generating a high-value dApp that can generate a very significant profit for Cardano, if more users adopt the technology and start using decentralized identities coined on our blockchain. We know, as proponents report, that in addition to cryptocurrencies, decentralized identities are one of the most relevant parts of the cryptographic world, and it is important that we invest in this. The main objectives of the proposal are then to promote an \u201cadoption and growth of the Self Sovereign Identity technology in Cardano by developing Open Source code and deploying it for free use of other products\u201d.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I can visualize well how the proposal would be put into practice. It is said that what would happen each week, my suggestion would be to include a little more detail in order to make the explanations accessible to all audiences, as it is a very technical proposal. Even so, it is possible to understand how the work of creating the version of the dApp for Iphone would be done. The way the total $24K budget is split is quite simple to understand once we know the value of the parts and how many hours they take (e.g. in: \u201cIntegrate new SDK into code: 20 hours = $2000 Replace the wal-lib functions: 80 hours = $8,000\u201d). And the professionals involved, Rodolfo and Lance, are presented very adequately. We know a lot of details about their careers and they are already funded bidders, which in itself conveys great confidence in the project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Since we have 4 well-defined deliverables (the Apple App Store app, the RootsWallet open source, the documentation that explains iOS-specific RootsWallet functionality), we know very well what needs to be delivered in terms of partial results. The proponents make it clear how the Cardano community will be aware of the updates: they will use the Agile methodology, they will mint on Github data on the tools used and built, they will build progress reports, use Sprints... I believe that the auditability of the progress is close. In the case of success, we know what scenario is expected (\u201cthe RootsWallet app available for Android and iPhone devices with similar, if not identical, functionality and UI/UX\u201d); but how would that be demonstrated to our community? My suggestion is that the proponents carry out a survey to understand the satisfaction of the users and how they are using the dApp, if it has contributed to the strengthening of the SSIs, in fact.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "RootsID will integrate the new Atala Prism Javascript SDK and build an iPhone version of RootsWallet.", "experience": "RootsID is a group of expert developers that are contributing with many Open Source building blocks to the Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem in Cardano, such as RootsWallet, WAL-CLI, and sidetree-cardano.
