Especially those that are very interested in CNFT's. There is a clear challenge and the team understands how to address it. There are other NFT projects, but they all are unique in their own way. I suppose Cardahub sees this approach as one that can help them to attract more people to the Cardano blockchain. We can see a migration from users of other blockchains come to the \"One stop shop for CNFT's on Cardano. I think that this proposal is addressed appropriately and that the challenge is an easy obstacle to overcome for the team at Cardahub. For this reason. I give this section of the proposal 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal gives a great deal of information on the team's experience. It is even mentioned that they are all great friends and work in an environment where they can get things done quickly. There is a very descriptive outline of their roadmap that gives precise details on what they are going to accomplish and the time frame to do so. It appears that they are giving themselves around 3 months to implement all of these improvements. The Cardahub team is growing every day and it appears that they have a growing community that will help them to stay accountable. If the team hasn't already, I would make an announcement about this proposal. This will allow their most loyal followers to read up on what they want to accomplish. Then if they receive funds, the community will hold them accountable to this and the proposal will most likely be implemented successfully. For these reasons, I give this section of the proposal 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal is written very well and there is a lot of information. After reading through their roadmap and the detailed budget breakdown, it helped me to understand how this team plans to carry-out their plans. The information provided is very clear and shows that the team is passionate about this proposal. Likely suggesting that the team will fulfil this proposal if funded. I am led to believe that with the specific information and passion behind this proposal. There is enough provided to sufficiently assume that the team is going to follow-through with this proposal.

The proposal mentioned about what they want to exchange do through the Cardahub shop through the tutorial videos for users in Cardano. Those videos showed the seriousness of the proposers to share detailed function of the products to target users although it is quite technical-oriented. \nKPIs of the project were brainstormed and decribed by the team throughout the proposal. For each action, they already put the expectation and the readiness of the step in advance will be input for the next one. Spotlight of the proposal is that KPIs are clear, detailed and measurable.\nRisks are recognized by the team when new way of contract is quite challenging for developers, especially when they are pioneer as well.

Roadmap seemed to be adjustable to meet the needs of community, however, it is suggested that, the proposal team can add more detail intentions in coming time, or several options so that all people can keep track easily. \nBudget was prepared generally including expenses for staffing in general, technical matter and the some on-site activities. However, only expenses for personnel matter are put. It will be better that others expenses should be considered and included here. \nTeam components is the strongest point of this proposal which includes mostly PhD people with intensive experiences in business development, enginerring or community coordination.

It is suggested to the proposer team to input more information on it. \nEnd picture of the success is clear in this proposal. All members can check whether the project achieve or not. \nThis project seemed to be the starting points of one series that require support from the Cardano.

Conceptually, this is a solution that aligns with Challenge's key metrics of developing useful integrations on Cardano to further drive adoption and engagement on the blockchain. As for the presentation, although there are Tutorial Videos links provided to describe how the main store functions work, it would be a plus if the author could present a summary of the main function buttons here. Although the solution is consistent with Challenge's key metric, the promise of benefits this solution will bring to Cardano is still unclear. The author is getting caught up in proving that he is suitable for the challenge and solution, forgetting to demonstrate why this solution will solve the challenge posed by Cardano. Perhaps you are confused between the concept of how this solution will solve this challenge and how this solution will solve the challenge that the proponent is facing.

Their project fits the challenge very well as writing their own smart contracts instead of using open-source based contracts reduce attack exposure.Cardahub also brings impactful use cases to Cardano by allowing flexibility in minting for NFT projects.

The hourly pay rate is very competitive at $20 per hour for smart contract engineering (the biggest portion of total budget of $33600).The total duration for this project is 3 months. Their roadmap (before Q3) is very detailed although I wish they could have given more detail for their upcoming features in Q3 and onwards. I am following their project closely as I am planning to use their platform. Due to the fact that I know how active they are in managing their community, I would like to give them full score for this section.

The team has not provided much information in this section but only said that the question is very close to feasibility section. It seems that right now the community will have to keep looking out at the comments section in the proposal to keep updated for the new features.

The solutions are direct about providing the hub (the website name says it all - cardahub.io) - a One-stop shop based on Smart Contract (surely after the Alonzo hardfork.) It is also interesting to see the team provide a variety of services in this Cardahub such as NFT Minting/ NFT simple & dual Listing/ Buying. It is also exciting to see the team already developed the Cardahub Yoroi Integration. What I appreciate the most is the thorough research of the team given looking at the competitor landscapes currently existing on the Cardano blockchain with 2 categories of direct and indirect competitors. The risk is counter-effective to the nature of the programming language of Cardano, on the other hand, the Cardahub team also said this will be a niche advantage for them with their rich expertise in the computer science background.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is what makes the audience impressed by this proposal. The Cardahub also stated in the impact session, that this is what makes their proposal stand and their competitive advantage in regards to the challenging programming language such as plustus. The core team of seven Vietnamese based in multiple countries, showed a rich experience with Ph.D. in computer science, informatics, and related fields. Moreover, the team also has strong marketing and community background with one member being the Vietnam Community Manager/ Cardano Ambassador. This will be a crucial complement to the promotion of the hub in the future stages. I would not surprised and highly appreciated that the team will be coming back in many future funds of the Catalyst even if they are not lucky this time. Milestones are broken detailed in phases with the 1.1 is more incubating and teaming up for such 9 months, and already completed. These milestones of the fund 9 budget asks are more for the upcoming features. IT would be a recommendation for the team to share detail more in the 3 months workloads and milestones rather than the past completed parts. The budget is straightforward for 3 key big takes with person*timing and the sum of 33,6000$ for 12 weeks of work in Q3 2022.
