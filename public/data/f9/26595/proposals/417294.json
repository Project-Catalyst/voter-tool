This proposal will enable many people who have become onboarded, to be motivated to learn by incentivizing them by native tokens. the prospect once onboarded also becomes a chance to be an influencer and earn native tokens for bringing more people on board. They also become referrers for all the projects and proposals submitted by their referees. As such they can earn a good return if their referee's project gets funding. By using native tokens people are motivated and incentivized to learn effectively. This system can be used in any educational, or corporate setting, or even NGOs or government institutionst to get people to work more effectively. With the above positive effects, I believe that this project has effectively solved the challenge posed.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Team information has been provided.

This increases the transparency of the above information.\nA detailed roadmap has been provided. You've identified what needs to be done and allotted it to specific timelines, which is essential. Although the budget has been calculated, it is still vague and unclear. I think you need to split the budget further. Here I have a few suggestions that might help you: how many people will be involved in each job? how many working hours? how much is the pay per hour?... . Having a specific budget, will increase the credibility of the project, people will know how the $ 40,500 money is used. Criteria for assessing project progress and success have been provided.

However, they should add what results their project produces and whether it is consistent and in sync with the challenge's KPIs/Key metrics.

The timeline is set over 3 months with a lot of work to do, however, they need to show more what will be achieved at each stage so everyone can see how far the project is going. The team estimates a total budget of $40,500 including operations and contingencies, but they need more detail on the expenses, and I haven't seen how much it costs to pay staff and calculate hourly or monthly salaries.

Next is a picture of the success of the project, they provide criteria to evaluate from reaching all target groups to creating a dynamic fast-growing culture where all are work and are encouraged for their active work.

However, a majority of people in Third World Countries have not been aware of these technological advancements. In accordance with the blockchain spirit, which is the people equity, I do agree with the idea of onboarding the Cardano (and Catalyst) knowledge into Sri Lanka. \nThe proposers clearly described the onboarding procedures as well as the approaching methods in detail. The interesting idea is that recruit early adopters and form a promoter/influencer network. In terms of the risks, the proposers had listed out quite sufficiently and already had the plan to them. However, the most major risk, in my opinion, is that the acceptance of the citizens to Cardano ecosystem does not meet expectations of the proposers. \nThis success of this project can significantly boost the users (from Sri Lanka) into the Cardano ecosystem. From this point of view, the solution is perfectly aligned with the challenge. From my perspective, the project could even be better in a global scale. All citizens in the world have the access to the knowledge regarding to blockchain technology or Cardano ecosystem. \n\"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The provided roadmap and planning were clear, I just could not find the precise project implementation date, though.

Based on this it barely finds a spot into the Campaign settings as it is just tangential with the creation of a Dapp that is to be used in this proposal.\n\nAlso the presented KPIs/metrics look like they are not aligned with the one sin the Campaign mentioned above (is there to increase the quality of an existing product? how?)\n\nBecause the alignment with the actual Campaign settings is not fully met I rate this section with 3 stars.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The requested budget of $40500 is broken into items but is difficult to understand for what the money will be spent.

The proposer states that \"the number of people required to complete this task has been calculated\" but doesn't share the result with the community.\n\nThe presented roadmap will last for 3 months and each month will have milestones to achieve and it presents, to a satisfactory level of details, what is to be done but is unclear by who.\n\nThe proposer is aware of the risks that could threat the implementation of this proposal (5 of them) but it only address the high volatility, translated to FIAT, of the ADA cryptocurrency.

It targets Sri Lanka and not a particular DApp or product. Sri Lanka has a young, dynamic population looking for new ways to bank and govern, and could be a great place for Cardano. Without a proposed proof of concept product or DApp, this looks more like a community effort. The proposal mentions all kinds of demographics, but not any possible directions for the tech implementation.

The five proposers are Sri Lankans with presumably good local knowledge, blockchain knowledge and deep involvement in the Catalyst community. These are all strong points.  Creation of Native Token is under a separate proposal. I find that frustrating. This could have been a lot more feasible if it had narrowed down its goals and focused on a specific idea or direction.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal has a lot of KPIs and possible performance metrics. They are as broad and general as the proposal as a whole. There are no quantitative goals associated with any metric. The team should be easy to contact and is likely to report frequently.

In my view, the explanation of how this theory would be put into practice is somewhat precarious. A few things are mentioned, for example: \u201cWe will reach different market segments and audiences using highly targeted marketing campaigns\u201d. What would these marketing campaigns look like? The proponent explains what the influencer system would look like (\u201cThrough native tokens, each influencer is incentivized to onboard new prospects and they in turn will bring in more new prospects\u201d), but in my view the explanations are a little too short and lacking in detail. Despite being something interesting, there is not so much confidence in the impact, due to the absence of these more detailed explanations.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I think the script is quite adequate. We know very well how the activities would develop, I would like the same number of details to be provided for part of the impact. The proponent breaks the timeline into months and explains at length what would happen in each of them, which I believe is the best way to comment on the script. When it comes to the budget, the explanation falls short, as we know only superficially how the total amount would be divided (\u201ccreation of marketing campaigns for each group 25,000 USD. the creation of Native Token is under a separate proposal + costs creation of marketing plans and project management 12,000 USD + contingency 3500\u201d, etc). Note that the parts themselves are quite expensive, so, in my view, they would need to be better argued. The authors are concerned with providing super long explanations about themselves, we know a lot of information about their professional trajectories, and with so much detail this part is ideal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Progress can be measured through various KPIs: \u201cNumber of new prospects who become influencers, Amount of time for each influencer to learn and then start reaching out to others, Amount of native tokens earned by each influencer\u201d etc. What concerns me is how the proponent will keep us up to date on the activities explained in the roadmap. He explains very well about the task schedule, so we do have material to audit. We just need to know better through which platform we would do this. A lot of information is also passed on about the auditability of success, but the question remains the same: where will all this be presented to our community?
