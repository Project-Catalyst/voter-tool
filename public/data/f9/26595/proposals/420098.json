The intention is to record certain data about the users such as biometric data and store this on the blockchain. It is unclear on exactly the intentions of how they want to achieve this. Biometric data on chain is a high risk solution irregardless of how it is encrypted as the data is public and immutable. This data may be suited to local credentials on a wallet owned by the user and not stored on chain - this may have been the intention of the proposer however this wasn't made clear. Another thing that is not clear is what the initial use case may be for onboarding these users with their initial DID and wallet setup. Onboarding new users can have a positive impact to introduce them to blockchain technology that can help to lead to future usage. However when onboarding users the most effective path will be to have something that has some ongoing utility for them so they have a reason to keep and use the DID and wallet for some use case. The team mention onboarding students in the feasibility sections but don't add any details about this in the impact section and why this is useful to them - currently it appears to be mainly educational for these students just to see and use the tech.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers outline a roadmap breaking down the tasks relevant to the proposal and a number of milestones.

The main reason is that the proposed solution was not clear enough for me to assess its impact. First, most of the dApps on Cardano currently do not require KYC. Thus, having the KYC may not attract more users. Second, the KYC requirements are different in different countries/region, and it is not clear from the proposal which country they plan to collect the KYC for. It is neither clear that the proposer has researched what is required to be compliant to the KYC at their country. In short, even I see the value of the idea in the long run, I do not have enough information from this proposal to assess its impact if this funding round is granted.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I am neutral that the proposal is feasible with the timeline and budget proposed. First, in terms of team experience, I do not see a team member with KYC/AML experience, which is essential for the team to have the information compliant with the local KYC requirements (for example, how could the regulator verify that the biometric data collected by the proposer is compliant to their requirements). Second, the KYC requirements are different for each country, and it is not clear how the team would scale up. The proposer does not provide a comprehensive consideration of risks; I would hope to see at least some risks regarding regulatory challenges. I would suggest the proposer re-scope the proposal. For example, they may ask for funding to do a detailed market analysis and KYC requirement analysis (i.e., conducting a project feasibility study) before asking for the fund to buy equipment for implementation.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I am neutral on the auditability of this project. I agree that the proposal provides sufficient metrics (# of registered users, depth of identification levels), and communication channels (Youtube videos, GitHub repository, website) for the community to keep track of their progress. However, the solution description is not clear to me that it will address the stated problem. I would also suggest the team have a vision for the success of the app (i.e., how the success of this project looks like) rather than just proposing two metrics that they would use to track the progress. Last but not least, it would have been more helpful to have a detailed roadmap to pair with the deliverables proposed and I would suggest an easy GANTT chart to the proposer.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2558", "no_vca": 2, "ne": 0, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6707, "q0": "Heer we have a rather weak proposal from Goma stake pool. Starting with the problem statement, we are told that \u201cKYC is a stumbling block in the crypto space. Many regulators require it without offering it\u201d. Well, that is sadly a feature, and not a bug. Regulators\u2019 job is not to offer tools, but rather to set a clear framework in place and offer a level playing field. But indeed, KYC is a challenging topic, especially for the crypto world. Now, the proposed solution is to onboard users through WADA Hubs through in-person collection of biometric identity and converting the data into DIDs. I somehow feel that we are putting the carriage before the horses here. Of course, having a seamless onboarding experience for new Cardano members is a very desirable feature, but why exactly is the onboarding taking place? Is it with a defined purpose in mind, or is it onboarding just for the sake of onboarding? We are not being told within the proposal. Even the proposer himself recognizes that \u201cmany DApp do not require KYC, but this is likely to be an exception than a norm if crypto is to be adopted in the mainstream\u201d. Of course, KYC requirements will possibly be arriving down the road, but right now the bottlenecks for increased adoption do not represent the lack of KYC tools, but rather the real world use cases to attract users. \n\nI somehow feel that it is either way too early for this proposal, or a more detailed explanation is necessary to understand the need for actual KYC onboarding solutions today.

Of course, as a PA, I could have my own opinion on this issue, but the fact remains that it is not very clear in the description.\n\nThe budget I would divide into two categories to make it easier to understand. The first covers equipping three people with the necessary hardware to collect all the biometric details from onboarded students (Dell laptops, fingerprint scanners, webcams, monthly stipends), while the second part covers some infrastructure items: internet, smart contract design and Atala Prism identification design (these two items could have been detailed further). \n\nWith a decent team, a good budget and somehow clear timeline, five stars are almost appropriate here erring a bit on the optimistic side.

We don\u2019t have targets for what success will mean for the project (other than counting number of onboarded people) while the second item listed, depth of identification levels completed, will probably be difficult to measure or at least it should have been better explained here: for example defining what level 1 is in terms of data collected (let\u2019s say name, address, personal ID number), what level 2 adds on top of this (for instance photo, or fingerprint, etcetera).
