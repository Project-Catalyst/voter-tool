However, some of the milestones seems not to be realizable within the stipulated time proposed for example, developing a feature complete marketplace on ADA chain within 8weeks is not realistic considering the development hassles with haskel (plutus), also other features of the project like DEFI wallet, savings, credit and insurance are all huge milestones which i don't think can be accomplished within the proposed timeline of 8weeks (consider testing for bugs, correction, retesting, audit etc are all rigorous but neccessary steps which doesn't seem realizable within 8weeks). Budget also is reasonable and detailed with proper breakdown although product \"Audit\" is not outlined.\nTeam's information is provided with sufficient and relevant skills that are neccessary for development of such a project.

The marketplace will give access to DeFi and reduce counterfeits. The proposal is comprised of a few main elements: NFT marketplace, DeFi services, DAO tokens. The NFT marketplace will allow unsung art communities to solve the problem of trust, authenticity and provenance of artworks. The DeFi services will include credit, saving, staking, and insurance.  The DAO tokens will function via the marketplace to lend community support for the creative community. The team plans to help onboarding online creatives among unsung region (Africa, South America, MENA) starting in Africa. The team has outlined many marketing strategies e.g. influencer marketing, community marketing, event marketing, content marketing, PR, events etc. The team has mentioned regulatory risk in Nigeria (restrict banks from offering banking services to crypto companies). However, the court has ruled in their favor and the team also mitigates this risk by registering in neutral jurisdiction like the UK. The proposal fits the challenge very well as the art sales in Africa accounted for 1/5 of global art sales market (from their attached video clip). If the communities adopt the marketplace, DeFi service and the DAO solution, it will naturally bring the impact useful cases to Cardano and boost Cardano adoption.   ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project will take 26 weeks in total. The timeline might look very ambitious for the first 8 weeks as they integrate complete marketplace into Cardano. However, this is plausible since they mentioned that they already have their NFT marketplace MVP (based on Ethereum 721 token standard) with smart contract deployed and verified on various blockchains. The part that I would say could be a challenge is on week 9-16 as there are many DeFi wallet features (staking, saving, credit and insurance). The team should also do more detailed budget breakdown as listing them as cost items might not be sufficient (Since fund 9 teams are encouraged to provide the project\u2019s hourly pay rate for transparency). The team lead is Mobolaji Onibudo who is very experienced in project management and implements the first African blockchain projects under the Nigerian stock Exchange. He is supported by his team members who are software engineer, sales and marketing, art curator, creative technicals professionals. Considering the relatively short timeframe for DeFi wallet phase and not so detailed budget breakdown, I would rank the feasibility of this project as 4. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The Niftyrow team views this project success as active participation in future creative funds from DAO, a complete NFT marketplace, increased collabs between digital and physical artists and wide adoption of DAO tokens.
