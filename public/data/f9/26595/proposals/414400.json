You've noticed the issue of non - technical people finding it difficult to participate at the Node operator level. In accordance with the Challenge, the proposal raises the problem. The issue that addresses one of the challenge's questions is to let users gain access to Node Cardano on Testnet or Mainnet at a fair price, allowing the Cardano ecosystem to successfully inspire many new users. The project might lead to increased development in the future. The platform node you build allows anyone to take advantage of the availability of their own storage node solutions for active development and testing on the Cardano blockchain. If your service expands and works well, it will attract new consumers who are not highly tech-savvy. Currently, this amount is relatively large since blockchain is a new technology with few practical applications; your service platform will assist them in running Node Cardano easily. \nUsers may buy a Cardano Node installed automatically, maintain, secure, and update that they can access using a set of secure HTTP and web-socket endpoints, which is proposed to give a way to construct a platform on multiple cloud providers. The proposed solution addresses the issues of removing the burden of storing and managing nodes of Node operators and offering services at a reasonable cost. The proposal makes a reasonable argument. Specifically, the service platform provided by the proposal will aid persons who are not very knowledgeable about technology in not having to learn in detail how to run and upgrade a Cardano Node. \nThe proposal also recognizes the risks of executing the project, identifying cloud providers as a problem since data stored at these services puts nodes at higher risk of concentration. The solution proposed to mitigate this risk is to employ many suppliers from various areas. The second concern mentioned in the proposal is that a lack of uptake leads prices to rise. It is advised that mechanisms for uptake be considered to guarantee that the node is operational continuously.\nThis is a great proposal; you address a problem that many individuals who are not tech-savvy have; your Node service makes it easy for users to run Node Cardano while also assisting the ecosystem in benefiting from additional users joining the network. Your arguments, solutions, and risks are all reasonable. If this service platform is completed and effective, it will have a significant influence on node operators who are unfamiliar with cardano blockchain technology. I completely agree with your idea. My rating is 5.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal indicates the progress of the project tracking process on Github's Kanban board. The project's progress is split by the number of working hours of each section, and the schedule and recommended process are realistic when divided by the number of working hours. The specifics are rather obvious. On the project's github page, the team proposes to update the must-complete parts such as licensing block volumes separately from ASG licenses, beginning work on adding support for external IP, adding support for policies / roles to identify the unauthorized version, and adding the ability to pass in the process of executing the code package. In which the IAM role of the AWS version profile is being taken on as a variable, the ability to build or include SSH keys, and the addition of version licensing through template/ASG launch are all in the works. The most recent update was on April 25, 2022. The funding budget for the project was $59,988.80, approximately 0.76 % of Challenge's. The proposal's budget is divided between technical implementation hours and hardware costs. Includes 400 hours of technical implementation in two stages at a cost of $100 per hour, as well as Linux operating system hardware. The proposal currently lacks additional contingency measures for the concerns indicated in the risk section. This contingency cost is often around 7-10% of the entire project cost to avoid scenarios when the project utilizes the pricing of cloud providers in various locations, causing the cost to climb higher than utilizing the services of a long-term provider. Furthermore, this expense compensates the rising cost of services due to a lack of up take.  \nThe proposed team includes 3 main members in charge who have been allocated responsibilities that are clearly in accordance with their experience. The information provided by the proposing team has been verified on Github. There is no certification or intellectual property associated with the proposed group.\nI agree with the proposal's details on the project's progress and the budget plan, as well as the credentials of the proposed team members. The proposal, however, does not include a payment for the risks of price rises while utilizing cloud providers' services and uptake-related services. This diminishes the proposal's feasibility slightly. I give 4 point for this section.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "All measuring activities for tracking project progress are publicly proposed at the Github Kanban board. The proposal completed a lot of items in addition to the to-do list and ongoing, such as adding SSH key pair resources, s3 data sources to the bootstrap team, prototypes, terrain testing, IAM, ASG, mandatory data sources, and required variables. Each job has a specific progress goal specified by the project. The proposal's information is easily accessible, as it is publicly available on Github. \nThe proposal describes the project's success in phase 1 as users having access to the backend, which provides any number of Cardano Nodes via an open source repository. Cardano Node will be secure and remotely accessible. The proposed project is stated in phase 2 of the successful project as delivering the Cardano node on the Mainnet and giving that user secure access to ogmios and submit-api endpoints. Users are able to access node metrics and data collected remotely. The proposal's success is due to issues that provide secure and up-to-date Node operating services to people who aren't particularly good at the technology. \nThis is your new proposal; the project lacks a test product. Personally, I have more reviews of the project's success measures, which are particular metrics such as the number of nodes the service can provide and the number of users using the service each month.\nI agree with the descriptions of the project's success, progress, and work proposed by the team on github. However, the proposal lacks concrete indicators such as the number of nodes that the service provides and the number of users who participate in the service.

The proposed team can refer to it for more information.\n  +CIP-31 = use input information without spending\n  +CIP-33 = save scipt in output.\nand the hardfork is expected in October 2022. There is also mention of the \"\" Input Endoser\" ( peer-reviewed) handler. This is a data storage and validation handler at small nodes to keep the nodes working continuously while waiting for the big node to close the Block, ensuring that many transaction information can be processed in the same time. time frame. Overall the team's suggestions are great and the above are relevant technical contributions for further reference.\n    The risk proposed by the team is still dependent on large cloud providers and it is easy to centralize nodes, but in my opinion, this is still a weakness of the entire Blockchain industry, not just a group of individuals. or any suggestions. and this has always been the case of the Cardano developer team and other Blockchain development teams who are working to fix it. and with the speed of development of the Blockchain world like this, this will soon be completely overcome. \"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\"The detailed step-by-step process is divided by the group into very specific milestones.

The blockchain P2P protocol allows nodes to communicate within the network and transfer information about transactions and new blocks.\n\nHowever, installing and configuring nodes is quite laborious and time-consuming; this proposal can overcome this hurdle, and the proposer can provide the mentioned service to developers and those who want to run the Cardano nodes. This proposal is aligned with the Challenge statement as it is building a platform that offers valuable services and adds value to the Cardano ecosystem. As far as I know, this type of platform is not available in the Cardano space, but you can find 'node as a service' apps and websites on other blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Chainlink, etc. \n\nThis protocol will positively impact the Cardano space by providing NaaS services to developers and interested parties. As stated by the proposer, It empowers developers to focus on what they specialize in (creating applications) and removes the burden of having to host and operate their node.\n\nI concur with the proposer on the risks faced by the proposal. Those risks are the risk of centralization (as the platform offers nodes running on Clouds) and the risk of a low number of users which will affect the price. The proposer wants to mitigate the first risk by spreading the platform across multiple providers and regions. I think the second risk can be mitigated by marketing and community engagement on social media.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provided brief team details of his team along with their GitHub profile link. The proposer and his team are members of the Cardano's Armada Alliance of single pool operators. They are also running a stakepool' CSCS'.

The proposer also mentioned that they need to hire an outside contractor/consultant for front-end/UI development.\n\nThe project is divided into two milestones. The first milestone will focus on the back-end build, and the second milestone will focus on the user and front-end. Each milestone is allotted 200 hours of duration. Hence 400 hours will be required by the proposer to execute the proposal. The detailed tasks of the proposal are provided under each milestone. \n \nThe proposer asked for $59,988.80, and it is divided into two categories of expenses. First, the engineering cost of 400 hours multiplied by $100 per hour, equal to $40,000, and the other expense is $19,988.80, which is the 12 months cost of AWS.
