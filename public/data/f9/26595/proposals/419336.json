DOON is a decentralized, blockchain-based news platform based on a newly developed reputation system where the trust and credibility of contributors are measured. To measure the credibility of content, they are developing a reputation protocol consisting of 4 core components: 1. Reputation Quantifying Mechanism that calculates reputation score based on a combination of descriptive factors and valuation models 2. Reputation Tokens acting as contribution reward and compensation 3. Pseudonymous & private users by default 4. Open source and community oriented. On a first impression, the main challenge of this idea would be how fair and effective it is possible to make the reputation system, since it serves as the main pillar of the entire premise of the platform. There is also the challenge of making sure users find the use of tokens fair and trustworthy, as well as worth the investment since the platform requires use of tokens to access content. The proposal has a clear-cut idea of how the platform will work and has also addressed these challenges with several answers, for example thorough investigation/testing and community collaboration. Ultimately, by using their open-source and community oriented approach to build this platform that increases trustworthiness and transparency in journalism it can be a great contributor to Cardano and the wider ecosystem. Especially the trustworthiness and reputation protocol developement is a very interesting aspect of the platform and may serve as a valuable technology for other areas in the Cardano ecosystem as well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "One of the strongest points to this proposal is team behind it and their partners.

The rest of the team are all specialists in their areas with great evidence of their capabilities listed in the proposal, and with professional partners such as Metalamp this project appears to have a very solid foundation. Their 6 month plan & timeline is split in 3 areas, reputation protocol, MVP development, and project & community development. Every part of the plan includes well detailed sub-parts and how they are planning to complete each objective. For example, the research team leads Dominik Tilman and Prof. Dr. Wolf Heimeyer intend to use structural equation modeling with 200-500 participants for the identification and validation of the variables of the reputation model. The budget proposed is clearly formulated into its different parts and look sensible based on the teams experience and timeline.

For publicly accessible channel they both have a website that can give the community access to all relevant documents, links, and reports that are published, and a github where it is possible to follow the ongoing technical development. If they wanted to take it a step further they could add some kind of newsfeed/newsletter or online forum, since they mention in the proposal how they want to be involved a lot with the community and that would create more opportunity and interaction for the community to gain insights or provide opinions. For metrics/KPIs they have a detailed list of sensible factors to keep track of and have also provide numbers for what good/very good numbers would look like at certain points on the timeline, meaning there is an easy way of keeping track of how well the project is progressing.

I am excited about seeing this project succeed from a Catalyst perspective, and also from a personally. I can't wait to read news knowing its source and seeing it in an original format that is immutable. It's a transparent changelog of the edits made. This is a great step forward for transparency.

The proposal acknowledges the challenge. They plan to start with scientific research to develop this part. Like many other of the best parts of Cardano, it will start with science. This is ideal. The proposal again lays out a clear and very detailed plan which answers all of my feasibility questions. The team is listed and their experience is very much capable of completing this.

This proposal fits the challenge as it aims to become a community-led decentralized news outlet, in contrast to existing centralized publishing houses (e.g: CNN news). \n\nToday, both readers and writers strive to use platforms like Substack, although it can be challenging for writers to find an audience, and for readers to find good sources of information. The platform that Doon wants to build gives content creators an initiative to report news independently. Think of it as every writer can become an independent publishing house, a brand and earn according to their reputation. The reputation model will help measure the trustworthiness of content, sources, and users while providing the basis for a novel reward model for content creators and contributors - all without a centralized authority.\n\nWhen your name is a brand you care about your work more, which in this case will encourage content creators to provide impartial and accurate information. \n\nWith a proper reputation system as the proposal promises this may actually work. Proposed solution in this Fund is community building and a creation of reputation protocol.

It doesn't state the strategies, the channels or tools they will use i.e, if it will be a Discord server or a Telegram group. \n\nMy other concern is that any member of the team isn't directly related to journalism, even if the proposal doesn't give enough information on that. For instance, Thomas Zuchtriegel who is in the core team is presented as someone who has an experience in the media industry and yet we don\u2019t know his role and whether it can benefit the project. \n\nIn the second phase, after finishing an MVP Doon plans to look for funds outside Catalyst. \nThe team has been part of several funded projects within Catalyst before.

Regarding how they ensure transparent operations, they provide different sources for the documentation which I consider reliable thanks to a brief description of how they will use these tools to communicate with the community. Since this is a 6-month implementation plan, I assume a monthly report they propose can be appropriate.  \nThe success metrics that will be reported are well-presented in three parts which I can easily relate to the ultimate goal. As far as I understand, these metrics will be measured and reported each month which will make it easy to perform audit exercises.\nThe success they are trying to describe is very clear and well-presented with detailed success metrics that look sensible. Success within the time frame of this proposal is defined as two levels (good & very good) and each level contains specific KPIs that are entirely aligned with three metrics which will be measured within the frame of 6 months in the end of the implemented plan. Based on my reading, I\u2019d say that they have potential to complete their deliverable as a functional MVP version of a decentralized news platform which is a completion of phase 1 of DOON within the scope of this proposal. All in all, I agree this project will be auditable in the future. However, if it is possible to add some metrics evaluating the relative impact on Cardano growth or adoption, it would be easier for the community to assess how the success of this proposal is closely aligned with the impact it is seeking.\n\"", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_4113", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "MVP of a truly decentralized news platform based on a newly created reputation model that rewards valuable contributions from content creators and users.", "experience": "Team of experienced entrepreneurs, blockchain- and DAO specialists and media experts.
