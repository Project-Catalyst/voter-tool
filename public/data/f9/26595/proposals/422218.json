There are several hurdles to overcome to get to that point in time, but it can be done, and is being worked on in several projects. One of those projects is Voteaire which is a Daap that is already up and running. This proposal looks at the current problem with blockchain voting, in that wallets, which are used for voting are not mapped to real-world individuals. \n\nThis proposal will increase the quality of the existing Voteaire platform by providing additional utility and use-cases beyond the traditional blockchain ecosystem which is firmly in alignment with the challenge it is located in. This would allow for corporations, and even governments to use the Cardano blockchain to do  voting in due time. This would increase integration of the Cardano blockchain, as well as add utility. Furthermore this proposal would expand the use case of other projects on the Cardano blockchain depending on which identity solution they use, or multitude of identity solutions that they use.\n\nThe voter is looking at whether or not this adds to the ecosystem, can be easily expanded/scaled out to bigger use cases, and would bring integration of the chain to real-world use cases. All these are covered except expandability. It is important that they proposal detail just how easily this proposal can scale or not scale to meet bigger needs in the ecosystem as use case arrive. Other then that area, This proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "First of all, the proposer has taken the time to sit down and determine what all risks may be encountered along the way to successfully implementing this proposal, and has laid out what they can do to mitigate these risks. This is very well done in the proposal. \n\nHowever, taking look at the timeline and milestones, it is less then desirable. First there are not time frames at all in the timeline. The voter wants to see that the proposer has taken the time to figure out what workd exactly needs to be done. This is provided in the proposal. The voter also wants to have a basic idea as to how long each phase will take, and what milestones will help to show they forward movement of that phase so we can see if they project is on track to meet its timeframes. By not providing the amount of time, or the approximate day and month or quarter of completion, to the voter, there has not been enough research done by the team. It is highly recommended that any future proposal that you all submit, should list these timeframes.\n\nThe budget section of this proposal is not very good to be honest. They have listed what all needs to be budgeted, but no amounts per resource. The proposer has provided us with this:\n\nScrum Master\nProject Owner\nDesign / UX Specialist\nSmart Contract Developer\nLead Architect/Lead Developer \nBackend Developer \nFrontend Developer\nWeekly Budget: $9,860\nEstimated number of weeks: 8 weeks\n\nThis does not allow the voter to see where each dollar is going. We are given an overall amount needed per week, and the number of weeks, but there is no way for the voter to understand who or what is getting what amount for what work done. This area of the proposal needs to be improved moving forward giving us a detailed breakdown of where funds are going, to whom, and for what purpose. With the current information given, it is near impossible to determine if the budget is reasonable to achieve the goals of this proposal.\n\nThis proposer has done an excellent job in providing information on the team, their skills, their backgrounds, and their education and successes. Viewing the information on the team shows us that they should have no major issues in implementing this proposal after receiving the funding as they have the skills and knowhow to get the job done and have been involved in other projects that have had success.\n\nI can neither agree nor disagree that that given the experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully, but the budget section of this proposal needs work done to it and I hope, moving forward with any further proposals (as mentioned they may be needing additional funding later) that they would really focus in on the budget section and give us a detailed breakdown of where all funds will be used.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This proposal has listed what the projects team will be using to track standard scrum metrics, however the team has provided no way for people to track the progress of the proposal after it has received funding. There is no break down of a timeline, nor are there any milestones that can be used to gage where the proposal is in it's implementation and progress.\n\nSome ideas for the proposer for future proposals would be to include a youtube channel with videos showcasing achievements along the way, a discord channel to communicate progress, a reddit, town hall meetings, or any number of other avenues to enable people to track the progress. Furthermore there should be information released when the team has researched out the various DID currently available, and who they chose to partner with or work with. \n\nThe proposal should take the timeline in the feasibility section and provide information to the public at each phase or at the end of major milestones of each phase. The voter wants to know that once funding has been received, and the proposal gets under way, that they will easily be able to track the progress of the project. As of the current state of this proposal it is not easily identifiable as to how the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of this proposal. I would like to see more work put forth in future proposals as the request for funding is a very important part of project catalyst, and the cardano ecosystem. We want to fund projects, but those projects need to detail out everything for the voter to make an informed decision as to whether or not to vote to fund the proposal.

Their proposed solution to research and integrate Atala Prism and/or IAMX into the Voteaire platform would allow multiple organizations to easily integrate blockchain voting systems on Cardano. This is directly aligned with the challenge to bring impactful use cases to Cardano ecosystem that help drive more adoption. Many people are now aware of the benefits of blockchain voting, however they lack a simple, low cost, and fast way to set up a voting system on the blockchain. By leveraging already completed work by Atala / IAMX and Voteaire, this proposal can offer a simple solution to many new users. The following metrics from the proposal are clearly aligned with onboarding new users: \n\"Number of end users (voters) using the application\nTotal number of DIDs connected to the application\nTotal number of ballots created using the new functionality\"\nThis proposal has the potential to scale to multiple voting use cases, however I have given 4/5 stars for impact because the overall impact will likely be on smaller projects such as NFT communities or schools/organizations and others who's voting results are important, but likely not as critical as a nation state election. As security and auditability are critical for these larger projects with billions of dollars or lives at stake, it is likely that more experienced and larger teams will be required and they would most likely work directly with the Atala Prism team, as opposed to using the Voteaire software. There are also other potential options that could fill this use case, therefore it's not clear how much market share or use the Voteaire system will be able to secure as they have not included a marketing plan for this proposal.

It is highly likely that this team has the skills to deliver on this proposal. The Budget is reasonable and broken down into a weekly budget of $9,860 for the team of seven professional developers who are already involved. There is a detailed plan that includes 4 major major milestones with subtasks. The proposal does not include details of how the DID credentials will be verified as real individuals, prevent voters from creating multiple profiles, or other attack vectors. However, one would assume these issues will be resolved by Atala Prism/IAMX, and are of less concern for implementing the DIDS into Voteaire, and therefore not the direct responsibility of the proposing team.

Unfortunately they have not included a plan to submit any progress reports to the Catalyst community, or information on how the Catalyst/Cardano community can observe or audit the development progress. There is no mention of Github or open source, so it's not clear if this will be accessible to the community during development. I would recommend the team provide at least 1 or 2 progress reports during the development phase to the Catalyst community that includes the KPI's in the proposal and % competed.

They want to utilize existing DID solutions such as Atala PRISM and IAMX and potentially integrate them into their platform Voteaire. They have a strong experienced team behind them but the main concern is that it seems they haven\u2019t fully completed their initial reseach to be able to provide a full action plan. Due to this, there is a lack of clear metrics and goals in their solution procedure, leaving us unsure about how the actual project will proceed. Atala PRISM and IAMX both provide services that certainly can be useful for this project, and have been part of several other proposals in other funds. Personally \nI would recommend knowing more about what DID solution will be attempted before looking for funding for the entire project. Having experience with teams trying to integrate DID solutions it can be a very complicated process and it would therefore be a much stronger proposal if the details on how this process would look like could be provided in the description since this is a very technical topic.

To strengthen this proposal, I would recommend a more detailed breakdown of the plan that includes a timeline, as well as relevant technical architecture and technologies required for implementation. Since the research, architecture, and integration plan isn\u2019t complete yet, it can also be hard to justify the presented budget since there is no complete breakdown of what money goes to what department, hourly rate etc. The team behind looks professional and have evidence of their skills and experience presented in the team section, on this front there are no issues.

I believe this project idea has good potential and the team seem knowledgable in how to present a reasonable plan and relevant KPI\u2019s, it is just a very early stage to ask for funding for the complete procedure when there aren\u2019t enough details to be put forward to help us understand exactly how this project would be carried out.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2448", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6764, "q0": "The problem defined in this proposal is that blockchain voting isn\u2019t relevant in the real world unless there is a way to map wallets to real people.  They explain the solution to this is to integrate a Decentralized Identity solution into their on-chain voting platform, Voteaire.  I believe this aligns with the challenge well, as it seeks to integrate one of the already existing DID projects known as IAMX or Atala PRISM into their already existing voting platform.  The proposal does a good job at explaining how this integration will allow for additional use cases of their voting platform, perhaps for more corporate and government applications.\n\nI believe the KPIs provided, like number of end users of the application and total number of DIDs connected to application, align well with the KPIs of the challenge because they are good indicators to track if this integration was successful in bringing more users to their platform.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal provides a good amount of information that indicates the team has relevant experience by having built an NFT publishing platform and an on-chain voting platform for Cardano.  There are also linkedin links provided for each team member which is great for transparency. \n\nI really like the section of the proposal where the team acknowledges 3 different risks that could prevent them from being successful, and then provides multiple risk mitigation strategies for each risk.  This shows that the team has put a good amount of thought into what it would take to implement this proposal successfully, and have plans in place to stay on track.\n\nThe plan provided in this proposal does well in describing the steps the team plans to take and certain milestones they plan to reach, but it doesn\u2019t provide any time estimates for each step or milestone.  In the budget breakdown section, they show that the total estimated time is 8 weeks. However, I think showing how that 8 weeks is estimated to be broken up on their timeline would\u2019ve been useful to know when to expect certain milestones to be reached.  It also would help the community know if the proposal is on track or not when tracking its progress.\n\nThe budget breakdown provides a decent explanation for how they calculated the amount for the requested funds, but I would have liked if more details were provided about the calculations.  Currently it states that the allocated funds were approximated using average hourly rates and the amount of time that is expected to be spent on their project by each role on their team.  I think it would have been helpful to show us these time estimations and hourly rates to help determine if the amount of funds requested seems reasonable.  That being said, $9,860 per week split among what appears to be 7 different people over 8 weeks doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable if each member is working full time on this project, but it would help knowing how many hours each team member is expected to work each week.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that members of this team are working on proposals from previous funds as well as seeking funding for some other proposals in fund9.  However, the team is fairly large and has stated that they hire additional contractors when needed, so I believe they can handle working on multiple proposals at once.\n\nI believe this proposal does well in showcasing preparedness and that they are likely to implement this proposal successfully.  The only things missing for me are time estimations in the project\u2019s timeline and a more detailed budget breakdown.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Even though there are no time estimations for when to expect certain milestones to be reached, the proposal does still provide some milestones to look out for when tracking development progress.  The problem is there is no public channel provided for where to expect updates on development.  There also is no statement about whether the team plans to provide updates during development.  I believe a simple solution to this is providing a twitter account or discord that the community can watch for updates on this project.  This would greatly help the community be able to track progress of this proposal.\n\nOne thing this proposal defines very clearly and sufficiently are the KPIs and metrics they plan to track.  A scrum metric is a new term to me, but they seem like useful metrics to track during the development process. \n\nI believe the team has shown they have clear ways of tracking progress for this proposal during development and post development, but I do not believe sufficient information has been provided for the community to track the progress alongside them.
