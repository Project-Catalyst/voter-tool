Right now, NFTs are gaining more and more traction and pull many new users into the crypto space. Thus, the author want to add Cardano as one of NFT marketplace in MENA beside Ethereum & Polygon. This is because, it gives the option to the people to choose NFT marketplace that suit with their own project and work. The proposer aims to integrate the Cardano with their own platform because they believe it would build on peer-reviewed research and developed through evidence-based methods. Furthermore, people or user in MENA is looking another blockchain such as Cardano that could respect with their own language and culture. The proposer sees the Cardano provide space that could add categories and customize for region such as, Calligraphy, Islamic Art and Levant music. It is good idea and I believe it gives contribution to the Cardano eco-system and community. proposer also state the risks that I consider i.e., too many blockchain would lead to confusion of the user and how to promote and market Cardano there? Thus, they give solution by framing our marketplace as a cross-platform NFT experience for the users and also creating written and video tutorials, join in exhibitions and panel talks and posting in social media.

Budget requirements are specific, detailed analysis is clear and transparent. Next, the implementation team part is also quite important for this project.

This is a great idea, but the budget of $111k seems on the excessive side.

The media links they provide increases my confidence that their platform is well known in the region (the last link is not working). The platform also has native language of MENA region. The Nifty Souq fits very well with the challenge as the Dapp challenge focuses on the integration with other existing protocol (Cardano with other chains). Also the team really pays attention to customize their features to serve the region and hence, the project will bring the impactful use cases to Cardano and lead to Cardano adoption within MENA. The team cited the risk of confusion between chains and lack of knowledge in creating an e-wallet. These risks can be mitigated with educating users.

Also some cost items should have more detail on how the team derives these figures e.g. SEO &SEM of $3000, social media marketing of $5000, PR events of $3000 etc.  These are budget issues that I decide to give the team 4 stars for feasibility although the team is very professional.

The targets are very ambitious as these figures are set to be achieved within 3 months after deployment. It would be good if the team has some sort of dashboard to show how many of their targets are achieved (% of completion). This could be the potential site that Cardano community can track project progress (https://niftysouq.com) The metrics for this project are user activity data report (traffic in google analytics), number of website visit, number of users who open new Cardano accounts, number of transactions, number of workshop held etc. The team has good social media presence (twitter, Instagram, discord, facebook) and it should be highly possible for auditing.
