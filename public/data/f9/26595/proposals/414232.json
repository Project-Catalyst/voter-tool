Unfortunately nowadays the scams and losses related to the NFT market are only growing more and more, due to the fact that the market is becoming more popular, which makes room for malicious actors. In other words, it is very necessary that a project that seeks scalable and comprehensive solutions for this sector be carried out, in order to guarantee the legitimacy of NFT projects for all those involved. This can be a big draw for the Cardano ecosystem, as one of the biggest fears people have when getting involved with the crypto world is losing money through the drop in cryptocurrency value or through this type of scam.

The expense part is also not so clear. Although we were told the basics of how the requested money would be used, it still could have been explained better because some parts cost the asking amount.
