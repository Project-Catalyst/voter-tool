Besides, hungry people can eat food without access. Here the proposal is towards getting food from restaurants and delivering it to beneficiaries. Proposals are consistent with the objective of the challenge and are detailed and richly described. The food that is thrown into the garbage causes pollution and subsequently CO2 emissions and air pollution. The solution is to create a system whereby restaurants, corporate divisions... deliver those foods to the beneficiaries. Create an AI-powered, blockchain-based application that can optimize multiple donor locations, can establish transparency, traceability, and auditability using Blockchain . A new NFT marketplace whereby social actors can launch NFTs to generate coins through the sale of unique NFTs or through NFT minting and selling. The proposal relates well to the Cardano blockchain. Cardano not only aims to drive the technological leap forward, but also establish positive impacts in several areas with the planet, such as climate, social security, and the environment. Here, the proposal also clarifies an issue of misconceptions about Blockchain that have a negative impact on the environment, but this has not happened for the ecosystem.

The world's homeless are having nothing to eat. Putting those foods in landfills not only wastes them but also affects and pollutes the environment.
