The blockchain's own encryption provides a high level of security against theft, manipulation or cyber attacks. The idea is to use blockchain to allow patients and doctors to relate directly to each other and close deals, without there being a central entity managing the care service. The problem statement and solution are both clear in their explanation. The manner the proposer addressed both the problem and the relevant proposed solution is quite valuable. I absolutely like the noble idea. According to the proposal, the goals are to provide innovative solutions for patient information and to increase the number of potential users of the Cardano ecosystem. As a result, I agree that this proposal meets the goals of the challenge and adds value to both the healthcare system and the Cardano ecosystem. Also there is certainly room for improvement on the solution presented here. It would be a good idea to include a few extra words outlining the impact for the community as well as mention why and how the Cardano ecosystem will grow if this proposal is implemented successfully.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has already shared their comprehensive budget breakdown with the community. The budget is thoroughly specified and broken down on each cost of the necessary equipment for the data center's operation. Nonetheless, I was left wondering where the compensation allocation for team members was. I see that several responsibilities in the project are mentioned; how are they paid? Similarly, information is lacking in other sections of the plan. There is a brief mention of an implemented plan, but it is not precisely provided in the part of an executed plan, which only offers a vague picture of the activities to be carried out. Unfortunately, the timeline and milestones are completely absent from the plan. The author does not indicate which steps would be required to complete this project, how the sequence of activities that would comprise the whole would happen, or how long each one would last. We have no clue how this project will be developed, thus the author must establish a timeline of activities so that we can comprehend the process rather than simply the result. Furthermore, the team performed a poor job of introducing the team members. They did not specifically specify each team member's experience or expertise or proficiency in the fields required in this proposal. Although all important links and references are provided to validate the project's credibility, it is always preferable to give a clear presentation of the core team. Another point of concern is that the plan mentions specific roles such as two Plutus and Haskell expert programmers, one server configuration specialist, and one transcriber to document the proposal, but does not specify if they have already found the specialists to engage or are still looking. I don\u2019t either understand why such info was placed in the section of an executed plan though? As of the time of this writing, there was no evidence that they had found their developer (correct me if I am wrong). As there is no extra technical information accessible that sheds more light on the viability of this project, I believe a \"whitepaper\" would be very valuable, even if it was brief, to clarify how the technical part would be handled. A more complete description of the cited aspects should increase the viability of the proposal. In order to visualize how this plan might manifest, more background on the project's team members, their salaries, and their roles in this would have been helpful. In summary, I question the feasibility of this proposal and hope to see the proposer make significant improvements.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The problem statement and solution are well-connected and accurate. Unfortunately, that is the only thing I find positive about this idea. Sad to say, this proposal lacks a defined roadmap and timeline for achieving the stated goals. It also lacks relevant KPIs or success criteria that would allow us to exercise project auditability. If there was a script with very detailed phases, we could keep track of whether such activities were taking place, as well as if they were achieved within the time frame specified. However, there is no type of information, thus the Cardano community cannot identify or follow the outcomes. To improve the score, I would advise the proposers to more clearly define how the community may be involved or kept informed of the project's development and success. Additional details on what, when, and how you intend to build a solution will be required when resubmitting. I believe that a wonderful idea like this would be served well if a reasonable amount of effort was put into developing a well-outlined action plan with stepwise success definitions.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2992", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 4464, "q0": "This proposal centers on bringing the benefits of blockchain technology to the doctor-patient relationship and more generally open the university medical market to Cardano.

MedTech apps are being greated for off-chain an on-chain solutions, and how this initiative differentiates is critical to make an assessment of the likely impact. As in its current form the proposal seems to be only about preliminary research, setup and the onboarding of Cardano developers, and there are currently no Plutus practitioners or doctors on the team or in the portfolio of the proposal, I neither agree nor disagree that the impact will be high and the challenge brief of boosting Cardano's user base and available DApps will be supported with high effectiveness.

The proposers have project management know-how and will employ agile techniques, but do not elaborate or provide external links to back up the claims. I would have liked to see a lot more information, even if linking to Spanish external websites or other such sources that I can translate or validate.

The team has extensive experience, and the proposal has sufficient material to prove it.

The budget is clearly specified and broken down into identifiable items, and it is reasonable in order to meet the established goals. I estimate that the cost is reasonable to achieve the set goal , but maybe more funding will be required. The difficulties associated with a successful implementation have been considered.

To improve challenge: better articulate how the success criteria address the challenge and how the metrics can measure progress towards the success criteria. The author should consider the following ideas for future Catalyst cycles: Create a road map showing the steps that must be taken in order for this strategy to be effective.
