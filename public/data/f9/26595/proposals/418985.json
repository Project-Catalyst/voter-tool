This project effectively incentivizes data collection within communities by allowing every datapoint to be \"minted\" as a native asset on Cardano, both committing the data to the chain and collecting it to a protocol level database.  While the token protocol itself is still in iterative, active development, the base protocol is ready to be expanded and deployed elsewhere, and to this end, this proposal seeks to opensource the protocol to allow it to be adopted by usecases everywhere.\n\nIn particular, the team behind OpenLitterMap have created several sister protocols revolving around war detritus in Ukraine, poverty and mental health detritus around drug use in cities, and issues around abandonment of assets in communities (things like homes are described, but local municipalities would be very interested in use cases for dereliction of abandoned boats and vehicles and equipment, which are huge budget burdens for the departments tasked with finding and dealing with them).\n\nThis opensource incentivization could lead to very widescale adoption (the token that is minted relies on donations or grants to be brought into existence and a value tokenomics has been envisioned but not yet developed...the basic formula will be that minting datapoints will be funded by whatever sustainability protocol can be designed, typically sourced from the community the datapoint serves, and incentivization will be connected to the token providing access to a marketplace or community where the data from the token has managed to create value) and would empower users to take the base protocol and run with it in many different directions.  Under this protocol, anything that can be photographed could be a datapoint for a database, so the uses are almost endless.\n\nWhile typically described as an environmental or citizen science protocol, this opensource proposal highlights that at root this is a decentralized data collection protocol which can validate (through photo evidence and tags, both areas that need scalable governance protocols) enormous swaths of otherwise hard to collect and verify context.  The ability to leverage this captured data to build robust accountability platforms, effective target objectives and other database dependent downstream effects, all while relying heavily on blockchain security and consensus creates a massive impact potential for this opensource phase of the Littermap journey.  I believe it deserves a full 5 stars for Impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has been building out the tooling and community for the tooling for some time, having grown the community to hundreds of active members, with its web dashboard showing 100+ new members a month and 13,000+new datapoints in communities around the globe.\n\nThe issues faced by Littercoin from the beginning have been scalability and sustainability, and by spreading the tools to increase adoption, you really hope they have addressed these issues.  For sustainability, they are still reliant on grant and charitable funding, which can increase with adoption, but really needs something more stable underlying it.  The research paper has always had the idea of having \"polluters pay\", but this is a difficult concept to develop since it targets either high level supply chain decisions (which are too complex to establish reasonable standards, even though there is lots of capital at that level) or low level \"citizen polluters\" (who are too difficult to find, and who at any rate may not have any capital).  When applied to the wider concept of general data collection, it becomes almost impossible to correlate this model, especially in the cases of benign data points.  \n\nAnd the scaling issue looks even worse.  In the background is the idea that a machine learning environment is building out a robust, scalable means of validating each littercoin minted but that this is done primarily manually while the machine is learning (and I saw no indications in the proposal that there were other models under consideration, though it does refer to new tokenization models, which could mean either new ways to mine littercoins or new ways to set up tokens other than littercoin).  It would have been good to have more of that process included here, since details around that will determine whether it is just setting the team up to be even more underfunded in the future (which looks like a very real risk to me).\n\nThe roadmap is very limited in details, basically noting they will hire developers, integrate their existing apps and experiment with new ones.  The granularity of the timeline bunches everything up into \"quarters\" when months may have been more appropriate, especially early on (and for the first months of a long timeline like this it is often a good idea to  include weekly breakdowns for as far out as the project manager is comfortable forecasting, typically 3 months).  \n\nLikewise the budget lacks enough granularity to be parsed effectively.  It is limited to telling us 2 developers get 4/5 of the funding, and the project manager receives a 1/5, but there are no breakdowns of milestones or development sprints or any of the other information that would describe a process that was well understood and in hand.\n\nBecause the team has not provided good details of the scope of the development required to opensource the project and they also have not provided sufficient budget information to assess reasonable outlays over the course of the project, I have a hard time agreeing that project is feasible.  However, because they have delivered the first phase of the project successfully, I find that I can neither agree nor disagree that what is described hear will lead to a successful project. 3 stars for Feasibility.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "They provide plenty of good and actionable processes for the community to be able to track the progress of the proposal, including access to their repo, making themselves available in community channels (which they do really well already) and, of course, monthly progress reports, which they feel they will be of \"landmark\" quality (though no details of why that would be are included).\n\nWhere it is less clear is in describing the success and objectives that the proposal has set for itself.  Under impact they describe an opensource project that opens up a whole exploratory world of data collection, but then they suggest that the measure of this in auditability is users in their apps adopting and using other apps *of theirs*.  While this may be a measure of some potential for opensourcing, it may also indicate that such opensourcing has failed, if it  isn't combined with wider scope for seeing how many projects outside the OpenMap ecosystem have been able to effectively adopt their tools and documentation for applying other versions, which is implied, but not addressed directly.\n\nBecause they have included some metrics, I think there is a very solid auditability base here, but it would be good to see more specific metrics and what parts of the timeline and milestones they relate to (which will require building out the timeline and milestones some more).  As well it would be good to not leave the success metrics as implicit factors and to state them more explicitly.  Because of this I am lowering the score just a bit to 4 stars for Auditability.

It fits within the challenge criteria as the proposal plans to build products that decentralize processes and support further innovation.\nBriefly, building on the success of the OpenLitterMap project, that has been in development for 15 years, the proposer would like funding to develop three or more similar applications to help the community. They have identified three specific needs; drug paraphernalia litter reporting, landmine and war debris mapping and derelict housing listing, as their initial target projects. The three ideas have been clearly explained and they are developed following recognition of identified community needs. The proposal adds that there may be many more in the future, but does not go into specific detail or further examples.\nThe impact would be clearly felt by local communities from the implementation of these programs. By delivering solutions at a regional level, they support the SDGs of good health and wellbeing, no poverty and peace, justice and strong institutions. Having experience myself with a citizen science project while working in Tanzania, Snapshot Serengeti (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/snapshot-serengeti/about/research) , the value and ease of data collection and processing once many users have joined the platform plays a pivotal role in the overall success and continuation of the program. As long as connections to local authority, governing agencies and the immediate neighbors are considered, with careful marketing and promotion I see these projects able to deliver a clear impact for the relevant communities. It\u2019s not as clear in the proposal how the programs will benefit Cardano specifically, this explanation could be developed further by the proposer.\nAcknowledging the possible successful impact, yet only for specific smaller communities without explicit reference to Cardano, I give this proposal 4 stars for impact.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is a significant lack of detail provided for the feasibility aspects of this proposal. \nThe only risk listed is \u201cgetting people to use the app\u201d which shows a lack of effort to identify other possible pitfalls, delays and obstructions to the process. For example, some of these apps will collect highly sensitive data, how do you ensure this data is used correctly and doesn\u2019t fall into the wrong hands? Solving this only challenge they list, of increasing the users, could easily be done with marketing and a clearly planned development. However, both of these aspects have been briefly listed without itemization.\nThe timeline listed in the proposal is rather simplistic, listing only one sentence per quarter, without even accompanying dates or KPI added. The first quarter in particular lists \u2018developers hired, first new major releases\u2019 and does not refer to what, when, where or how anything is being released. This lack of detail is worrying and appears as if the proposal was rushed, or simply added as an afterthought to some of the other more detailed proposals the user has put forward.\nSimilarly, the budget listed requires two new staff members, who are not listed and the explicit skill set not described. In addition, the budget for the CTO/CEO is purely a $25,000 \u2018slush\u2019 fund that encompasses management, development, sales, and marketing, among other aspects, with no clear breakdown of these individual items. \nOverall, you can see aspects of feasibility within this proposal, but there are not nearly enough details or explanations to see this as a thoroughly thought through plan. For this reason I am giving this proposal a rating of 3 stars for feasibility.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In regards to auditability, there is information provided and historic references to base this judgment off. \nThe proposal lists, and can be found through their previous Cardano proposal from Fund 4, a decent expenditure tracking sheet through a shared public google spreadsheet. They also acknowledge that more detail needs to be added to this developing document. Additionally, open access to invoicing, spending and monthly reports will add to this existing spreadsheet. They already have a github organized to collate this information. Thus, the financial auditability is fairly strong.\nThe work progress accountability is a little harder to track due to the brief and vague objectives listed in the timeline in the feasibility section. With only one sentence written per quarter and without specific KPIs listed, there is little to track or identify objectives that can be achieved. They do host a weekly community call, and weekly blog post about their progress, however, this would not show the long term detail and plans, rather only the progress to date with the community. \nLastly, the proposers have written a very brief criteria for the proposal\u2019s success: \u2018cross-fertilisation between our apps\u2026 build a network of communities and achieve mass adoption.\u2019 These criteria definitely need further explanation in order to be assessed, who is to decide what \u2018lots of\u2026\u201d equates to and at what point do you consider it \u201cmass adoption.\u201d\nOverall, financially the auditability is solid, however there are some concerns about reporting the auditability of the work completed within the loose timeline, hence, I give this project a 4 star rating for auditability.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3840", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 4109, "q0": "This appears on the surface to be a clever use of blockchain tech that can activate what the author identifies as a high volume of personal data collection devices (i.e. phones) with very limited real world data collection implementation.\n\nWhile the proposal does aim to build a user base on the activity of identifying and mapping garbage (of multiple varieties like plastic, drug-use waste, mines, etc), I think we also have to ask ourselves the hard questions.  Do we really need tech to map garbage, or is there another way we can motivate people to just pick it up?\n\nAs the author presents, that collection of the data could be used as a useful tool to provide government resource planning around user collected data, I agree so far as I understand the accuracy of those inputs, or the real ability that a user may have to mid-guide those resources.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The budget breakdown indicates distribution of funds to 3 efforts, 1) mobile development (40%), 2) web development (40%), and 3) CEO/CTO (20%).

The leadership CEO/CTO role however, accounts for only 20% of the budget at $25k USD, presumably for the same timeline of 1 year at half the cost.\n\nI'm neutral on feasibility, because while the timeline and milestones do present a project with 4 quarters of delivery, the ideas presented there are not well developed, and very short lacking basic details on exactly what kind of work would be needed within that time.\n\nHowever, I'm not opposed to this proposal, because there is progress being made, and the proposer also states that they received first finding in Catalyst 4, approximately 12 months ago, showing that the project leader is operating roughly on 12 month funding cycles.

The origins of the project go as far back as 2008, when it was initially launched. The app is currently complemented by the Littercoin token, which originally launched on Ethereum but now has migrated to Cardano. What is remarkable about the project is the fact that the niche is an excellent candidate for real world adoption: users simply need a phone app to interact with the system, the \u201craw material\u201d, the litter, is ubiquitous and easy to document its presence and therefore the barriers to entry are minimal.  \n\nThe value proposition of the app + token is intriguing, since the combination that can create an immediate connection between the general population (non-crypto adopters) and the crypto space without the need for wallets or opening crypto exchange accounts, through a reward system for tracking and documenting litter across the world simply with the use of a phone app and geo-located photos. If you need a similar example to relate to the use case better - think about the Brave browser, which aims to democratize the advertising sector and rewards users directly for the ads placed on their devices. \n\nThe project initially secured funding in Fund 4. This proposal is now asking for funding in order to collaborate on a number of similar applications that can inspire citizen science.

The rest of the necessary dev positions are actually advertised as available within the proposal. For me this is a slightly worrying situation, and it makes me wonder why hasn\u2019t Sean managed to already attract more seasoned devs close to him. Would it be the lack of ongoing funding, or perhaps is it a culture fit issue, an unconvincing business case for them? We don\u2019t really know but these questions definitely need to be asked. \n\nThe timeline of the entire project is definitely lacking details. We are only informed of four quarters as milestones, with only a few words for each of them - there is not much information available to assess its reasonability or to go into the details of what the project will actually do. All we know is that in Q1 additional devs will be hired, Q2 would see the integration with the local gov\u2019t app, Q3 would replicate another application in a few cities around the world and Q4 would experiment with new tokens within these new integrations, similar to the Littercoin token.  \n\nA bit curious, the budget is split by functions (for each additional person), and not by task, which makes our job a little bit more difficult in terms of making the right connections when assessing the budget\u2019s reasonableness given the proposed timeline.

I think the proposal should have the illustration of the budget for the smaller tasks that the members do so that the alignment between the budget breakdown and the plan built and written before. About details of the people who will work on the project, the proposal has listed some member who are Se\u00e1n Lynch - Founder, CEO, CTO, CFO; Laravel + Vue developer; React Native developer. However, I think the proposer should write more clearly about the roles of the members, their experience, how suitable they are to do the job, and which of their talents will help make the project successful. The proposal will be marked higher if there are details about the technical aspects that are needed to conduct the plan. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability part of the proposal is written reasonably but the information needs adding. About the measurement to track your project's progress, I understand that the team will report monthly about the progress of the proposal completion with a link to each significant github commit or the budget updates on google spreadsheet for every spend. However, there should be clear KPIs like the number of users using the app, \u2026 If the indicators like that are listed, the community will be easy to follow and assess the effectiveness of the project. The picture of success seems vague for me to understand fully. There should be more description on how the project will be when it is successful. What we have here is \u201cLots of cross-fertilisation between our apps, new people starting in 1 project and getting interested in another.\u201d The proposal can give the example about the cross-fertilisation, for example. This will make it easier for the readers to see the success of the proposal more clearly.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_4073", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14949, "q0": "Personally, I like this idea. Building a similar civic-led platform to help facilitate citizen-generated data to mitigate the impact of war and the housing crisis is a great idea. The proposal will build a strong foundation and connection of the project with the people, authorities, local government, and health workers, providing a simple platform to attract interested users and participate in the Littercoin protocol and the Cardano ecosystem. However, I think the team should add a few points to increase the persuasiveness of the project. For example, beside the \"Getting people to use the app\" risk, if there are any other risks, please specify a specific and detailed plan to minimize them. Moreover, I think the benefits achieved after advertising is also a point that needs to be focused on in the proposal.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "\"The plan that the team came up with was unspecific and sketchy. There needs a time-framed timetable for work progress, which will result in the team achieving the goals listed respectively in the detailed plan section of the proposal. In my way of thinking, the proposal fails to give an introduction not only the information of the team member's skills, experience as well as qualifications, but also the reference, evidence or links to testify them.\nIn addition, the team should consider adding a Cardano expert who is also a key position needed to ensure the growth of the Cardano ecosystem. Besides, I wonder if the 25,000USD payed for CTO and CEO is monthly salary or else. It should be more detailed. I think there should be a contingency cost as well as risk management cost in this project for needed cases. \"", "q1r": 2, "q2": "\"The information in the proposal is mentioned to help the community monitor and evaluate the process of completing the proposed proposal through clear and public tools.\nUnfortunately, the proposal does not mention any specific KPIs to demonstrate how this project will be successful based on how detailed the evidence, numbers, and ratios are. I recommend that the team should present precise KPIs to make the proposal stronger, easier for voters to choose fund the project and keep track of its success after advanced. \n\"", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_4114", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Using OpenLitterMap as a guide, we want to build a number of similar open source platforms + tools that can inspire action in citizen science to fix problems like landmines and dereliction", "experience": "15 years developing openlittermap.com\nAlso have dozens of other projects that need to be developed and tokenised following in the footsteps of Littercoin.
