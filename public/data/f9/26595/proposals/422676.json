The lender receives an interest rate from lending out ADA & stable coins while the borrower can use their tokens & NFTs as a collateral via a Pond smart contract. This proposal will benefit the NFT community in the sense that they can access the liquidity without selling their NFTs especially during the crypto market downturn. The pond smart contract is NFT contract specific. The project has a unique impact as the first lending protocol in Cardano mainnet. The team has listed the fork delays that could affect the project delivery and bugs. However, they plan to mitigate those risks by spending part of their funding on auditing their lending pond. As a DeFi protocol user with financial background, I can foresee some other possible risks in liquidity and pricing. As not all available NFT collaterals market value can be easily determined, this makes it difficult for the lender to specify their loan offer. Also the Pond Protocol should specify clearly their legal recourse in case of unfavorable market condition (whether the lenders can still retrieve their loan and what would happen to the collateral of borrowers if the platform freezes). The DeFi protocols have undergone a rough patch market condition and their clients have no legal recourse when such event occurs. This will boost user confidence in using the protocol and also not to encourage using too much leverage in accessing liquidity. Failing to provide such information, the project scaling could be quite difficult during this period.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The pond protocol cites Vasil fork to mark the launch of V2. V2 audit will happen on 15th July and hence, the supporter of this project will have to watch out for this date and observe the Pond protocol. The project has not provided other timeline info and key milestones. Although the requested budget of $40,000 with detailed breakdown look sensible, there is no mention of number of working hours and insights into the relevant tasks like development, server hosting and front end user experience tweaks. The project has been in operation for the last 2 months and a half and process 2 mil volume(60k daily) and loan of ADA 30k. The project team twitter profile have been provided with the 2K+ discord followers. The project has official website, twitter account, gitbook and youtube mentions. It would be beneficial for voters to have timeline in carrying out this project and milestones so that they could determine easier if the project can be carried out successfully. By having close relationship among team members, there is a good synergy of groupwork. Although the Pond protocol is currently in operation and has no shown no major flaws that will create community distrusts, the lack of roadmap and timeline casts some doubt on project deliverables. It is important for the proposer team to clarify the \"purpose\" of this proposal and what they are trying to achieve and whether this is short term or long term plan.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer has clarified in the auditability section that they look for F9 funding to develop new features.

As mentioned in the feasibility section that the timeline and milestones haven't also been mentioned, it will be quite a challenging  task for the community to track project progress. The proposer team could update the community with their preferred channels on project development ie. Github or after townhall presentation.

It is not yet possible to take out a mortgage with digital assets, the solution has given an open direction to the market, building Dapp that allows to take advantage of NFT and the token of peer-to-peer SC loan fulfillment. The solution is in line with F9's challenging settings, developing loans and financing related to Cardano. The real way the solution is offered will make an impact on users, Pond is the NFT lending protocol built on Cardano, Blockchain. Pond facilitates us to borrow an ADA with the mortgage of cryptocurrencies and NFT in the Pond Smart Contract, without the need to sell NFT assets but to obtain the defined capital to do the job. Pond creates transactions and high liquidity, users will get the necessary capital to fulfill life needs and create development for the future. We can see Pond as a bank, a lender with interest rates, borrowers receiving capital and growing their business, which raises the development of society and the country. Pond, too, with the smart contracts created for transactions, the volume of transactions in Cardano increased, the underfunded projects being implemented, Pond really had a good impact on the development of the Cardano ecosystem. The project implementation solution shows that creating Dapp as a bank in Cardano is necessary, which helps the ecosystem to be diverse and have a reality-based development. Pond already has test products, there have been loans made (proof provided by https://lendingpond.app links). There were identified risks when implementing the project, the delay was resolved with version 2 upgraded and updated Vasil-Hard-Fork. The error that affected the distribution of the protocol was resolved by the Lending Pond audit work.
