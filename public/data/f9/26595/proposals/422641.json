Through sponsorship opportunities and community integration more people will be exposed to and engaged in the Cardano ecosystem. This project is heavily focused in Africa, I\u2019m surprised it was not submitted in the Grow Africa, Grow Cardano challenge, however, the budget appears to be higher than that challenge allows.\nThe impact of supplying fresh drinking water and sanitation opportunities to a community, anywhere in the world, can be said to have a massive impact on the health and quality of life of the occupants. The problem identified by the proposal, that I have witnessed from living and traveling overland through Africa for 4 years, is that once a well is dug often the NGO or company step back, congratulate themselves and nothing else happens. Without proper maintenance, community guidance and ongoing support, water wells can become unusable, even dangerous to the community.\nUnder this proposal, to mitigate the instant solution mentality mentioned above, the proposers plan to integrate CH20 tokens tied to the well\u2019s production that the donors 'holders\u2019 of a transparent well would own. Once implemented, donors would have live data relaying the water flow and their contribution as ongoing data as tokens directly into their wallet.\nThe proposal goes on in detail how possible partnerships could be implemented, local artwork turned into NFTs to raise funds and the connection to the individual community. Importantly, they also detail how water quality sensors and flow data recording can report if a water source has become contaminated or the mechanics problematic, enabling local support crews to attend and maintain the well.\nThe proposers describe a list with sufficient risks acknowledged, although, with a proposal of this depth and magnitude I believe they are a little over optimistic. \nIn terms of overall impact, I rate this proposal 5 stars, due to the possible life changing benefits to thousands of people if they succeed and have a reliable fresh source of water.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal contains a timeline with key milestones, a fairly detailed budget breakdown spreadsheet provided as a pdf and a list of proposed staff to recruit. In terms of feasibility, there are a few key details missing in this otherwise detailed proposal.\nMy initial concern is that this proposal continually refers to building wells in Africa - it is a huge continent, which country or countries are going to be targeted? Surely this has been thought of already and should be listed in the proposal. Particular regions are easy to gain government approval to begin projects, while other areas are extremely hazardous and shouldn\u2019t even be traveled to. Through traveling East and South Eastern Africa, I saw many of the \u2018well\u2019 based projects, in operation, deployment or in disarray. Before beginning, the proposers should gather extensive data as to where other projects are filling the market need, and where there is still a desperate need to water solutions. It's hard to assess the feasibility without this key background information.\nA second concern is the lack of information provided about the proposer and the staffing team. The proposer himself (?) identifies as a Mech Engineer with marketing, blockchain and web3 experience. Then lists his father as a civil engineer with a MS in water resources. In addition to this, detail is given for 13 or so positions needed for the project to succeed, without any names allocated to these roles. If the project is to get off the ground in the first 1-3 months as planned, with many KPIs listed, a team needs to already be in place.\nThe timeline provided is ambitious, however, achievable if they manage to hire and retain all the staff as soon as possible, and more importantly gain support from governments and communities on the ground in Africa.\nMany NGOs and organizations have proved you can build wells in Africa. This proposal is aiming to reinvent the wheel (for over $500,000), rather than work with successful partners to improve current solutions and adapt to Cardano blockchain technology. I can see their project with some degree of feasibility, however, there are so many unaccounted for variables that the chance of success within budget and this timeframe is difficult to realize. I give this project 3 stars for feasibility. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In terms of auditability the proposal gives clear KPI timelines and budgets to be accounted against. They have a main measure of success, being the initial well built in summer 2023, and hopefully supplementary wells following that.

They have milestones to track within the proof of concept, technological testing, partnerships with governments phase as well as the community deployment. As stated, once the wells are functioning there will be live data available to assess the quantity and quality of water being supplied.\nIn terms of financial auditability, the pdf spreadsheet has fairly loose amounts and estimates, although they have put detailed estimates into the salaries. Without knowing which countries or areas they have targeted there is a fixed amount of $3,000 - $6,000 for each month, it would be interesting for the proposal to state who is traveling and from where?\nOverall, there is enough information to give fairly accurate auditability checks throughout the duration of the project.

The proposal wants to create a Not Profit that will dig water wells to supply clean water to the impoverished African communities. It will be a network of products such as NFTs, Oracles, and a web-based platform. First, the NFTs will be created reflecting local community traditions & values, then people donating to dig wells to supply clean water will buy these NFTs at a cost equal to digging well charges.\n\nThen well will be dug, and it will be installed with an advanced filtration system, and a hardware oracle will also be installed. With this oracle, all well-related data will be stored on-chain and utilized in the smart contract. This will ensure that the well is kept pumping and water is of good quality; if not, every party involved will be notified by the system with the help of this oracle. Apart from this, one CH20 token will be issued to the NFT holders for every one liter of pumped water. Furthermore, the proposer will create some utilities for these tokens by partnering with various brands and companies, such as raffle entries, access to special events, etc.\n\nThe proposal aligns with the challenge as it integrates Cardano NFTs, Oracles, and Smart contracts. If the proposer can execute this proposal successfully, it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem. \n\nBut the proposer has yet to hire the team and prepare the proof of concept for this new idea he conceptualized recently; I do not understand how the proposer arrived at the requested budget.

This is quite vague for a proposal having a considerable budget. Therefore, the proposer should narrow the timeframe to a monthly or, better, a weekly level.\n\nGiven the above points, I am skeptical about the feasibility of this proposal, and hence I am afraid I have to disagree.

This is also the world's biggest and most complex problem. Organizations and Governments around the world have been trying to make a difference for decades now. But it seems the problem is getting worse and worse despite everyone's best efforts. One of the solutions is to dig a well and use groundwater. Charities have gone the route of building as many wells as possible, and as a result, a quarter of them stop working without their knowledge. Funding is also an indispensable issue to make that work.

But the proponent gave me a bunch of SDGs and KPIs that I don't know what would be your priority, although I know it's fine to list them in detail but you should organize them so I can understand the vision of your project.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3445", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Agree with comment about team! \nThe info published about the team is minimal. I do have recent \"applications\" or people reaching out to help and I hope the community also provides people who align with the vision and mission to join the team and push the project! \n\nAlso for KPIs I would like to add having the developer keep a Github up to date with the software/coding side of things that would also act as a public measure of progress\nThank you!!
