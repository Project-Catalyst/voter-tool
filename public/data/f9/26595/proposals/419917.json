If the challenge is to develop more useful dApps and help people to feel comfortable using Cardano as we drive more adoption then this certainly addresses the challenge of that. \n\nThe proposal has an important paragraph which I will quote a few lines from here that show how it addresses the challenge: \n\n \"Vesting tokens is a powerful instrument to build trust between a project team and their investors or users. The project teams want their users to feel comfortable that they will not immediately dump tokens on them, essentially using them as exit liquidity. To mitigate that risk the dev teams state that certain tokens will be released over time, but if we are relying on the dev teams to do as they promise, it will always leave open the possibility of them not following through and accessing their tokens whenever they wish....\"  For these reasons I gave five stars and I believe it clearly addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The first thing I do when looking into teams and the experience is to see if they have previously provided tools and have had success implementing.  \n\nLooking at the experience of ADAO and their education rich community, I am comfortable that they can deliver a tool like this.  Also, the other communities that they mention they work closely with, are most likely asking for this type of tool and trusting ADAO with the development.  I especially feel more comfy as it looks like they have already started this tool using their own money according to the roadmap.  Speaking of roadmap, there seems to be a clearly laid out one.  \n\nFor these reasons above I strongly believe that this will be implemented. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "When looking at the potential success and measuring the progress of the proposal, there are clear metrics provided to measure such as \"...An initial goal of 4 teams incorporating the tool within 3 months of its release..\" is one of them.  Additionally, there is a pretty detailed timeline and task list of the items to be completed to make the proposal a success.  Lastly I believe there will be monthly Catalyst progress reports in which this will be monitored.  Therefore I believe there is sufficient information to audit the growth of this.

As more and more projects are built on Cardano, the need for a trustless system of fund allocation is needed to prevent any bad actors (sometimes referred to as \"rug pulls\") so that investors and creators alike never fear this type of action or loss taking place. Having many Cardano NFT projects representing themselves as DAOs, there's only one that I am aware of that uses Github as a source of complete transparency with transaction history to it's holders. This solution to that extra effort from a DAO or similar project or community by enabling a seamless trust with public transparency through smart contract interoperability on Cardano Dapps and protocols, would allow for greater adoption from users looking for such a solution not seen on any other blockchain. The impact rationale of token vesting dapp that is open source and free to use is a 4, based on the unforeseen audience of users but with the proper education of such a tool available, a significant rise in impact could take place in the coming years.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Based on the information provided by the proposer it is very likely this solution to the problem will be implemented successfully. The timeline for completion is fair as well as the budget requested of just $33k for front and backend development, testing and integration of the smart contract as well as auditing of implementations. This includes a period of Community Educational workshops to be done by the end of Aug 2022. It should be noted that the timeline is somewhat accelerated as the dates presented are during this assessment period, and social media updates from this proposed solution are already taking place, referenced via Twitter: (https://twitter.com/gcarrharris/status/1544343201598914562?s=20&t=OopHyuiKaQSQE9RGobk24Q) The indication of such a DAO already implementing ADAO multi-sig wallet services to better equip their project moving forward, speaks volumes to the overall success of this proposal. The only concern here is the individual or team not being clearly defined as no social media or professional profiles are easily found via the websites provided or contact information. This is somewhat a non issue, as any progress within the pre or post proposal can be found on Github, link provided (https://github.com/ADAOcommunity) The rationale for Feasibility is a 5 .", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As mentioned above, the roadmap and it's milestones can be seen taking place already in preparation for funding through the Github link provided in order to track the progress being made. The proposer understands the clear risks and challenges involved with successfully solving the problem presented here, but does not foresee any major delays occurring. The definition of success will be clearly transparent to the Catalyst community by the use of these references and the funds will also be allocated in a publicly shared monitoring source done by CatalystAudit.com. The educational twitter spaces planned to be held (4 minimum scheduled TBD) will help ensure that the community is aware of the solution being available. The overall success of the proposal may not be seen immediately but as a first standard of it's kind on Cardano, it could and will eventually build stronger trust between project developers with their communities as well as show others what full decentralization on chain looks like.

Instead of receiving the entire token, the teams will receive the token after a vesting schedule period set by the project founder. However, there are many projects where the token price is always \u201cpump/dump\u201d or even Rug Pulls when the token is released without investors knowing. The reason for this is that the token release is centralized or semi-decentralized, not the decentralized model that blockchain defines and the Cardano network wants.

This is where a proper vesting strategy by the founding team becomes relevant. Thus, vesting is one of the keys to creating a successful tokenomics design. The team preparing this proposal is focused on presenting an alternative to future startups that will allow founders to offer the community a secure vesting schedule based on a previously tested smart contract. BeiSince this tool would be open source and free to use for different projects, it would have a great potential for adoption, as long as the community understands the importance of a feature like this within the Tokenomics of a new project and makes it a minimum requirement for new projects to be considered serious.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From the dates presented in the plan, it appears that the implementation of this project is already in progress, indicating that it is currently in the \"Smart contract auditing and general testing\" and \"Integration development\" phases (not dependent).

I would have liked to see information provided regarding the team or person responsible for the implementation of this particular project as the development hours are at the core of it.

The budget is presented in 9 easily identifiable line items. These line items have an estimate of a range of expected hours for each line item. Unfortunately, there is no breakdown of the hourly cost, according to the type of professional profile needed.

The team presents a good practice, setting up a website where the details of the expenditures of the proposals funded in past cycles are reported. This is great given how little information IOG is providing at the moment. Additionally, 3 key metrics are proposed. The first one would be to monitor the number of development teams using the tool, with an initial goal of 4 teams in the first 3 months after launching the tool, as well as the execution of 4 twitter spaces with the objective of communicating and educating the community in general about the usefulness and necessity of this type of tool, and the last one for supposed commits to GitHub of the corresponding repository or repositories.

The vested tokens are normally allocated by Devs. With this DApp, the process will be automated and auditable with the vesting schedules in token allocation. This could provide the prototype to other projects to use the dApp when doing private sales tokens and build trust between project owners and the investors which surely will drive the interest in adoption of Cardano dApps.
