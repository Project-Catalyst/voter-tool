Take film tourism for example, over half the listings on sites like GetYourGuide do not give anything back to the original IP holders. We need a better solution.", "f6_no_assessments": 7, "f6_rating": 4.238095238095237, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1678, "q0": "Definitely yes. In terms of impact, the project is perfect and extremely relevant, both for content creators (as is mentioned in the case of films and audiovisual productions), and for the Cardano ecosystem. The problem to be solved here is the violation of IP addresses, which in short is an internet protocol address, a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the internet protocol for communication. It turns out that products that circulate online often have their copyrights violated, and this is a very present problem today. Therefore, to mitigate this it is suggested that a platform be created that will propose a negotiation of IP agreements, as the proponent says, \u201cwithout complications to create a place where IP holders and creators can collaborate freely without fear of copyright infringement\u201d. \u201d. Although the proponent argues that there are already some solutions being used to avoid this problem, for example segmenting the activity of those users who post content on some platforms (the example of youtube and twitch is cited); where users are barred if a copyright infringement is identified, this measure is still a palliative measure, as people continue to circulate this content through illegal downloads, for example. And, as the proponent goes on to explain, fighting over this cause is often expensive and complicated, so copyright holders unfortunately overlook misuse of their products. That's why a new solution must be created, and this would all relate to Cardano because \u201cinstead of trying to identify and punish copyright infringement, we want to take an alternative approach: facilitating and rewarding collaboration. We are proposing to develop a market where we will build a hassle-free IP agreement trading system. This will be powered by a series of smart contracts to store the content of the contract and also automate the execution of those contracts.\u201d Here I would like to leave a comment: it would be beneficial if we had a slightly more extensive explanation of how these procedures would be coined on our blockchain. It is said that NFTs would also be utilized, \u201cour first use case will be an NFT-based ticketing platform where event organizers can use our smart legal contract framework to return royalties to original creators. How everything is on the blockchain\u201d; but it is also not so clear how the two technologies would be connected. In general, the objectives of the challenge would be very well achieved as a dApp for the web would be developed that would use Cardano technologies to work, such as NFTs and smart contracts (two sentences that sum it all up very well is \u201ca market which will support event minting with NFT-based tickets or club memberships + a series of smart contracts to assign and compensate original creators/IP holders when used in derivative content in the marketplace). But my suggestion that it be a little more explicit how all this would be coined in Cardano's network. In the case of the specific objectives of the challenge that would be achieved, I believe that would be two of the topics present in the challenge summary: \u201ccreation or improvement of different Dapps, products and integrations that add value to the Cardano community and the wider ecosystem\u201d - in this case, creation. And also \u201cintegrations with other existing services, products and protocols that improve the end-user experience, either giving the user more options or making it easier to use something that benefits the wider ecosystem\u201d - it is said that later the project could partner with other Cardano apps, with its legal framework through APIs and SDKs. A very positive point of the proposal is that the possible risks of the project are very well punctuated and efficient solutions are already suggested, demonstrating preparation to deal with the project successfully. Therefore, I think it is a project of very high impact for our blockchain, even if some doubts still arose while reading this part of the proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The presented script is not ideal, for two reasons. First, the time division is very extensive, let's say we have some phases here: the first would last 6 months, the second 2 months and the third another 2 months. It would have been more appropriate if the activities had been divided into months, so that we could better understand what would be done and when. It would also be beneficial if we had a better detail of the activities presented. Regarding the first phase, MVP development. What would the work routine look like for the development of \u201csmart contracts for encoding and rendering legal agreements\u201d and the \u201cNFT-based ticketing platform (including ticket sales and resale)\u201d? How would you bridge the gap between legal advisors, what issues would be at stake here? Regarding the second phase, it would be necessary to better understand how the first users would be selected, who they would be and how they would do the tests that would be the way to receive feedback to improve what had to be increased. In the part \u201cidentify missing features that might be attractive to future customers\u201d: what kind of features are we talking about? Some examples could have been given. When the dApp was officially launched, how would the marketing take place, how would the tool be disseminated to the target audience and how could they understand the use of the technologies in question? What would the user experience, the platform interface look like? All these points could have been explained a little better, so that we could understand more solidly about the development process of this project. Talking about the use of financing, the asking amount in my view is quite fair for the complexity of the project, but the divisions of expenses are made superficially. We know which parts would make up the whole, but we don't know, for example, why each would have to cost the requested amounts. What would the developer's and project manager's work hour be worth? What is business development, exactly, and why would it cost $8,000? What would the legal parts and marketing of the project look like, what kind of legal agreements would have to be made, what would be the dissemination strategy for this new solution? What would the contingency part be, and why would it cost $5,000? In my view, it is not possible for us to understand with such precision how the requested money would be used. Finally, speaking of the team involved in the project, this is certainly the best part of feasibility. Although, in my view, the full team was not presented (for example, it is expensive that a designer, a lawyer and a publicist would have to work here. Who would they be? precision). But about Ana and Bryan, the information given is very interesting and necessary, we know that she would be the project manager and he would work on the development part (it is fundamental that he is a graduate of the Plutus Pioneers program. It is said that he participated of various hackathons, it would be positive if they had been exemplified). It's also super important how they provide us with their linkedin profiles. Ideally, all agents on this team would have been introduced this way. For the reasons explained here, I believe that yes, it is a viable proposal, but that some details and more information would be necessary for the topic to be ideal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proponent suggests some numerical data that would help us understand if the project was being as successful as expected, being the numbers of registrations on the platform of companies in the creative industry + end users registered to buy tickets on the platform + smart contracts created and exercised on the platform. Indeed, these KPIs are necessary to be monitored, but they do not correspond to everything that is said about proper progress auditability. In addition to these advances and small successes, it is necessary for the Cardano community to accompany the process of building the platform, and this must be done through updates from the team > to our community. It would be necessary for us to know what was done in each passing month, for example, we know that at the beginning the activities would be more in the sense of carrying out the technical development of the solution and establishing legal contracts, as well as creating the UI/UX design; then a test version would be released to collect feedback so that the dApp would be released to the general public. How can all these activities be monitored? How can the actual construction of the dApp be actually tracked accurately? In my view, the simplest way is for the proponent to prepare reports at the end of each month citing what was done, in the daily work part, and what would be the resulting products (the consequences, partial successes). This should be achievable by the members of our community, for example, a profile could be created on a social network (either telegram, discord, twitter or others) that could post these updates periodically, for example. Ultimate success would be considered achieved when \u201ccreative industry companies are willing to lend their IP if we can provide guarantees on how it is used and how they will be compensated / Creators are happy to share the profits with the original IP holders if one exists a frictionless mechanism to do so\u201d, and some numerical metrics are also drawn (how many audiovisual companies would be using the platform, number of smart contracts, tickets sold, etc.); in other words, we have a lot of information about what would be, in practice, the success for this proposal. So the only thing that remains pending is how this can all be studied, measured (through qualitative and quantitative data) and presented to our community. My suggestion is that they make a short video presenting the success, citing the case of some users who are using and enjoying the platform, so that we can understand if the objectives mentioned in the impact part were really achieved.

For voters to be able to appropriately evaluate a proper cost-impact ratio, the given impacts need to be more quantifiable to measure against the requested funds to determine if those more tangible impacts are worth the cost. Quantification could also take place in the problem statement to give voters with a greater sense of urgency for a need of the given solution. I think this proposal does directly address the problem statement in a way that advances upon existing NFT technology for royaly claims and IP rights in blockchain technology, which I think many voters will react favorably for. This proposal does take on a unique risk for the industry of cryptocurrency where more advocates for the free-market and/or libertarians congregate, which is the population most likely to be against the concept of Intellectual Propoerty for its net loss of competition. In this area, I think it could be advantageous for this proposal to address the perceived long-term risk with this population in mind and mitigate that risk with appeal to greater regulatory compliance. More importantly, I would like to see an articulation of how this platform more comprehensively solves for IP rights throughout the entire Cardano ecosystem, rather than just those that choose to use this platform. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "For a small (but capable) core development team and a roadmap that outlines exactly how long this proposal would take to complete, I rank this section a 4. While there does appear to be the right set of experiences to produce the suggested platform, I also think there is a need for a strong dedicated legal expert on a team (rather than just consultants) that is trying to better enforce a legal framework. At this stage of the project, this team is plenty sufficient to continue development as laid out but I expect the team will need to expand at some point. The roadmap is very clean and does exactly what it\u2019s supposed to in laying out what tasks are planned and how long the project will take to complete overall. I think it\u2019s relatively impressive that they\u2019d be able to accomplish building a functional platform of this nature in a 6 month timeframe. Where I don\u2019t feel like I can make a proper evaluation is on the budget end of this section because it only provides broad categories that are allocated funds. It would be easier for voters to make a proper evaluation on budget efficiency if the budget is further broken down into hours of labor, hourly rates, category details and frequency of each expense (by month/week). If this portion of the section could be greater defined, I think this proposal would be able to secure greater voter confidence. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "For perfectly appropriate KPIs and establishing target metrics for the definition of success, I rank this section a 4. I think this section could make that push to top-tier auditability by providing sources for accountability from the public (like Github) and further defining success by extending that definition with milestones across different timeframes in the future of this project. Voters may also respond positively to a beta testing feedback KPI, to demonstrate that this team is prepared to make adjustments as the project progresses. I do find the given framework very helpful in showing voters that they do have a clear definition of success/performance that has a direct link to accessing the potential impacts of this proposal.

This is a new idea, but the question is, is it market-appropriate?\nAs far as I can see, content piracy happens often and there is almost no way to prevent it. If you look at the new thinker's point of view according to the mission of blockchain, BTC, Cardano, everything is provided for free and everyone can use those free resources to create new things.\nI think creative ideas are inherited from old ideas and copying and developing ideas is a process of development. Looking at Cardano too, Cardano is promoting the creative process of developers and expecting them to make those source codes public so that other developers can use and develop into valuable new products. I think, the blockchain era is a place where all content is free and public and should not be limited to content copyright. Because of copyright restrictions, there will still be many ways for copyists to find ways to circumvent the law.\nRegarding the criteria for evaluating whether the proposal meets the requirements of the Challenge, I think yes.\nBut from a user and market perspective in the future, I see this proposal as going against the general trend of the market and against the trend of blockchain.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan presented in the proposal needs to be made more detailed.
