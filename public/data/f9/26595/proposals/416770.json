This is a Cardano lightweight wallet that provides sovereign rights to mint and signs non-fungible tokens (NFTs) 100% on-chain from digital assets. This proposal wants to design and implement a progressive modular extensible wallet as a tool to facilitate new use cases that interact with users and Web3. I find that this proposal is important and the scale of the impact is large. Any blockchain needs a wallet to store and perform the functions of that blockchain. Blockchain technology is growing day by day and expanding wallet facilities is important and necessary to retain and attract users.\nThe proposed solution has been described in detail and specifically by the author. Reasonable reasoning method. By providing videos, examples, and examples, makes it easier for readers to visualize. The utilities are extended such as multi-account; receive payments and check transaction history; display assets being held including NFT and all native tokens; automatically receive the total cost; participate in the staking mechanism and earn rewards authorized through the specific staking pool; add your own endpoint or from any other trusted source; interact with any web3 platform.\nFrom the above, it seems to me that this proposal meets the \"Dapps, Products & Integrations\" challenge.\nThe proponent mentioned 2 risks that may be encountered when implementing this project: technical and teamwork. These risks have all been prepared by the team in advance and have appropriate solutions to minimize them.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A clear roadmap, with specific timelines and detailed plans. The project plan is presented on a monthly basis, with this proposal work to be implemented from September. The previous part of the overall project has been implemented since May 2021 and is detailed in this proposal.\nThe project's budget accounted for 1.1% of the total budget for Challenge. This amount has also been allocated to specific expenses. However, this budget analysis has not been detailed. My opinion is that the author should provide an explanation of the basis of the calculation such as whether these costs are billed as a package or by the month or by the hour (if by month or hour, what is the average cost of 1 month or 1 hour? what is the total number of months or hours worked?).\nThe team has experience working on project C64, a proposal funded by Fund 5. The team as Mobile Wallet Engineer for this Fund 9 \"DeFi Access from Mobile Devices\" project.

Measurement indexes like the number of people discovering projects for which C64 is listed, the number of downloads, the number of new users, the number of Web3 platforms that support the C64 connector, the number of third-party projects integrated into C64, number of transactions with metadata, number of NFTs minted.

The issue comes in line with the installed challenge, the modular wallet is easy to use and has the right features that will have a good impact on the user. We visited the wedsite the author provided (https://C64.app), unexpectedly we can install C64 on the browser in use, We tried to register, but could not log in. The solution is to develop a C64 wallet that gives users new functions such as support for switching between different networks, the first wallet on Cardano allows for casting NFT in the wallet, the ability to choose your reliable endpoint, and allows users to easily add new use cases as add-ons. This solution is in line with the stated challenge, the C64 wallet will have a direct impact on users, it will be easier to create an NFT, the C64 wallet will help developers improve when making a connection to Dapp and testnet support. More interesting than the C64 wallet is used from the browser to facilitate interaction with all Wed3 platforms. The proposal has shown that C64 is an application platform that can continue to expand in the future with the details: Initial token minting, Trading with multiple outputs, Multiple sig accounts, Encryption of any common data, Compatibility with all wallets, for example, Daedalus and Yoroi, Integrating third-party tools such as: Adahandle, and other projects. Integration and support with hardware wallet, Milkomeda Integration, Integration of Identification systems. The solution implemented really has a big impact on the Cardano ecosystem. The identification of risks has been given by the author given the technical and risk issues in the group, with the appropriate arguments we can see that the author has solved the risks presented. We have an opinion on the risks the proposal may be encountered, we have looked at wedsite and found that there are 32 wallet users, the number is not impressive, the risk of the number of users of the C64 wallet may not be as desired. The author needs to have the right solution for communicating and marketing the app to the Cardano community, showing them the conveniences of the C64 wallet and deciding to use it. The second risk that we noticed, the funding for implementation may not be sufficient due to objective factors such as increased ADA reduction, increased cloud rental costs, etc. The author needs to anticipate this and be able to suggest a contingency amount for the risks.\nI rated: 4\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal gives a detailed and specific plan, it is very long and we are reading all the content.

The proposal is a continuation of the previous plan, completing the remaining work to come up with the final finished product. Performing the finishing phase is in line with the given solution, engineering-related tasks, UI/UX construction, Wed3 connectivity, etc. are being completed. We believe the proposal will be successfully implemented after 7 months and the C64 wallet is put on the market. The proposal identifies the number of members made as 3 people, the information is complete and we can see on LinkedIn. There has been an assignment for each member of specific tasks in accordance with their competence. The proposed amount of $86,000 is in line with the challenge set out, the detailed budget implementation plan, specific expenditures for specific tasks such as $3600 cloud costs, $6000 UI/UX construction, and so on.

Each month, we are very clearly listed the tasks that the team will perform. The activities involved are accounted for and we know well what will happen in each subsequent month, i.e., our visualization of the process is pretty solid.\nThe required budget is $86,000, broken down into easily auditable chunks. However, I have a suggestion that the cost of paying engineers should be more detailed. Here, the proposal only provides information that the engineer's salary is $ 56,000, but does not mention details such as how many members will be, whether they will work full-time or part-time, or hourly salary is how much?

It will interact with any web3 platforms to provide relevant information and new utilities.
