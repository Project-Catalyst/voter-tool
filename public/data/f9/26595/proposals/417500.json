This is based on the problem statement that lots of new Cardano users feels lost and confused when starting out their journey with the Cardano Ecosystem. Support will probably always be needed, especially in an area where development is as fast paced as blockchain tech and cryptocurrencies. In my experience as a PA since Fund 6, there are a lot of projects that provide support and guidance through their own platform and projects (so that in itself is nothing special), but there are very few places that are dedicated to support (especially person-person guidance). Most guides out there are educational material and instructional videos, and the interactivity of this suggested proposal increases the potential value and attractiveness to the Cardano users. The problem statement is clearly presented, as is the solution. \u2028\u2028Having a dedicated place to direct inquiries for support might have a chance in helping other platforms in the ecosystem, should it be considered a good resource and marketed properly. The product itself has a clear purpose, but the effects of that will be determined greatly by quality of the product and outreach. Otherwise it might run the risk of only being used by those who first come in contact with lionmode.io (the official website of the proposer), and if I understand the proposal correctly we would like to have people using the Helpdesk even without knowledge about lionmode.io. \u2028\u2028The use case of the proposal has the potential of spanning across many different areas of this challenge (DeFi, NFT, Hardware, any dApp), so I would personally would like to see some clarifications on what areas the Helpdesk would be focusing on. Unless ANY question related to the whole Cardano ecosystem could be asked. What depth of support could the Helpdesk provide at this stage? Creating a wallet, where to enroll in the Plutus Pioneer Program or creating your own DeFi protocol? (Just examples). \u2028\u2028Due to the reasons stated above, I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposing team consists (at this stage of the process) of one person. The proposer has experience of previously working with the official help desk for Yoroi (wallet) and Milkomeda protocol, two important actors in the Cardano Ecosystem. It would add to the clarity of the proposal to have included links that could verify this information, since no links are provided apart from the official website of the proposers current project. This might seem like a small thing, but without verifiable information of the proposer and his/her/their experiences, there are limited ways for us to measure the credibility and competency of the proposing team. Without supporting evidence, it is just words in a document. We can find gitbook links in some other proposals, but these are related to other projects than this one. Here are links to the other proposals:\n\n- https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/417268\n- https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/417327\n- https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/420320\n\nQuestion to be asked: How does the proposer plan to manage the workload if all of the projects are funded this round? There is a mentioned risk included in the proposal if the traction of the Helpdesk might overwhelm, but this is simply explained by \u2019since it\u2019ll take some time for the product to be established, it will be calm in the beginning\u2019. From my view as a PA and voter, I would have liked to see at least a short paragraph on how the proposer would deal with it (even if it is unlikely). \n\u2028We are given a timeframe of one weeks work from start to implementation, and then a plan to operate the Helpdesk for 3 months (basically until next fund). The project is pretty small in scope so a more detailed roadmap would probably only make things more confusing. The proposer has a plan of returning to apply for funding in order to continue operating and further developing the helpdesk. The proposed budget is minuscule (consisting of 0.027% of the total challenge budget), and the costs are presented simply and seems realistic. If I could make a suggestion, it would be amazing to see an estimation of the work hours related to the responsibilities of the proposal included in the roadmap or budget breakdown (maybe with a calculation of hourly wage included?). The proposer states that he will work a week on constructing the helpdesk at first, does this mean a week of full-time work? \n\nAssessing the feasibility of this proposal is a hard one (personal opinion). The project is very small in scope so it has a good chance of being integrated successfully, very quickly. However, the proposal lacks important verifiable information on for example team and risk management. This leaves me as a voter to \u2019trust\u2019 what the proposer states. As a PA, I need to prioritize the information included in the proposal over that trust (we are doing this for the voters, after all) so I neither agree nor disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As mentioned before, the budget breakdown is simple and showcases what intends to be done, and when. The proposer intends to share updates and development progress through the official website (lionmode.io), and also using social media platforms (twitter, telegram and discord) to spread information and increase outreach. Maybe this is non-useful information but I would have liked to see at least one example of what channels the proposer plans to use, that will let me as a voter follow the project from the start. It will also give insight to what \u2019areas\u2019 of Cardano the proposer is mostly involved with (gaming, DeFi, Swarm, etc).\n\nTransparency is key. The more information that you include in your plan, the less questions will be left for the community to ask. \u2028\u2028In its current form, there are no listed KPIs  other than the implementation of the product. Here I would suggest measuring the success of the project by number of users who utilize the helpdesk each month, maybe also tracking how many platforms the proposer utilizes in their marketing or spread of information. By including a target number for these indicators, we can see if it correlates with what the proposer intends. All in all, I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2504", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 3, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 9670, "q0": "As Cardano needs a thriving ecosystem of different Dapps, products and integrations for the community to use, in irder to increasingly become the better alternatives, It becomes  more interesting and useful for more people to have interaction with the Cardano blockchain that can help further drive more adoption, feedback, growth and even more innovations. I believe that this proposal has identified a problem in the ecosystem which is, users coming from other chains and longtime ADA holders getting started with DeFi on Cardano,plunged into the  encounter of questions and problems in which they lack the  resources or knowledge needed to find solutions on their own. I think this will be very useful to the cardano community especially to new members who are onboarded. Since the proposer seeks to build a community-funded help desk where people of all backgrounds and knowledge levels can ask their questions and describe their problems in their terms and get human support. Nontheless my main concern is,whether there is an already existing platform that serve a similar purpose and how this proposal is different and will add more value to the ecosystem than the former. I think this should have been included for CAs,VCAs and other members  to juxtapose the tenets between this proposal and the previous,unless ofcourse this is the first proposal of its sort. Other than that I think the proposal is aligned in the challenge setting and will also help address future challenges since it will help solve issues that  stemmed form some basic confusion or misunderstanding about Cardano itself.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Even though there are few things that I think needed to be explained, I still believe the proposal is likely to be successfully implemented. This is because the proponent has outlined clearly a relevant experience demonstrations in helping build  the Yoroi help desk as well as the  official help desk for the Milkomeda protocol. He has stated a relevant RPK in the above and I think it will be a springboard for success of this project. Also I think the budget is reasonable to achieve the set goals. A budget of less that $3000 for this project is considerable in that,it is  outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items and has also provided verifiable plan to be considered should additional funding be required. The proposal to me didn't really offered a realistic timetable to complete the work. Though the proponent stated that the set up process  should last less than a week,and thereafter updates will be posted on the lionmode.io website. I think more details should have been given in this respect. On the other hand the proposal provides a sensible and conductible plan for implementation that shows not only what is being done but also how it will be done.The plan describes the resources necessary to implement the proposal such as LIONMODE.io, a service providing localization and content services to companies projects related to Cardano,hosting, email, and Zendesk. However the proposer should have also serve information on the resourses that are available on The cardano platform which will be used to carry out the project if available.The proposer has again considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation which is flooding of too many inquiries while the project  is still in the initial phase and being run by one person as well as a purported solution that, it is highly unlikely, however, it will take time for knowledge of the help desk to spread and for people to start linking to it.At this point, I think the proposal has a likelihood to be successfully implemented.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Here, I should believe that the proposal has a good  description of the targeted problem and a clear understandable solution that addresses the problem. The proponent has also given some information that will be used  to measure the progress and success of the project as it will be  announced on twitter and spread around in various Telegram and Discord chats as well as direct communications to key figures in the Cardano community.

Thus he aims to remedy the situation with this new project: the set up of a Zendesk help desk that can provide human support from an experienced individual who can also direct users to the relevant online resources when needed.\n\nThis project is in line with the Challenge as it will help adoption of dapps and products by providing support to users for inquiries that pertain to Cardano itself. \n\nIn my personal opinion, this is exactly what project catalyst is here for: someone has identified a problem for Cardano community members, and is trying to provide a service needed as a solution.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The presenter has already implemented similar projects in the past and with this proposal he has laid out a clear step by step timeline and budget for this based on experience.

The first phase is the initial set up of the Zendesk and operation until the next round of Catalyst funding (3 months).", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability of the proposal is very simple: it will mainly be the initial set up and opening of the helpdesk online which will happen pretty quickly (within the first week) Once operational, it will be announced on the lionmode.io website. \n\nAs a suggestion, since the presenter has experience with setting up and running other helpdesks in the past, he might want to give a projected number of users for the first few months as an approximate goal/performance indicator for this project.

New users would feel more confident in the choices they make knowing a team of experts has guided them. For example, I know several older people who want to invest in Crypto, but they are just too scared, since the topic of Crypto and its tech are a little out of their comfort zones. Making people feel more confident will allow for greater adoption. \nHowever, I do feel that the proposer needs to provide more details on what level of help they would provide. For example, would you help set up wallets, help the users understand the UTXO model and how to use Cardano Scan to track transactions, make recommendations on what wallets or DEXs to use, provide education on what types of red flags to be aware of in terms of scams or malicious actors, or answer blockchain specific tech specification questions? Please provide greater detail here. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "It is unclear whether the plan presented can be achieved. The proposer does not offer a highly detailed plan.

", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Announcing the zen desk on your website, Twitter, or Discord is not enough. New users need to know that this is a resource available to them. I would recommend finding out how you can advertise the help desk to centralized exchange users. These types of users are usually new to Crypto and afraid to take the Ada off the exchange because they don't want to risk losing their Ada. As a matter of fact, this would be one sure way to increase the adoption of Cardano, by bringing Ada from the CEX to the personal wallet, and then educating them on how to stake with single pool stake pools. If getting advertisement at the CEX level is not feasible, getting adoption from IOG and Cardano Foundation would be huge. I'm sure the Cardano Foundation and IOG would love to know there is a reliable help desk for new users.

However, to constitute a valuable product as the challenge setting states as its direction, this would only have impact if done in a quality and format that represents Cardano's and our community's values, look-and-feel and is conducted reliably. For this, some sample work or frontend mock-up would have been nice to consider (more on this under Feasibility). The budget requested is modest, but as this helpdesk may be seen as the \"official face of Cardano\" adequate quality is of the essence.

The proposer links to an external website that does not provide any \"About us\" profile, and no other references like a LinkedIN profile, facebook, twitter or any other proof.

While I do think there\u2019s a lot of missing elements in this section, I end up landing neutrally with the proposers experience in help desk within the Cardano ecosystem as an offset for positive potential. Plus, this is the cheapest proposal I\u2019ve seen in this round of Catalyst, so I don\u2019t feel a sense of major risk in this proposals approval. On an anecdotal level, I can say that I\u2019ve seen plenty circumstances of people trying to find information on how to navigate the Cardano ecosystem, so people end up resorting to social media to find answers. I personally have regular phone calls, video chats, and direct messages with people that need help understanding cryptocurrency in general. So, I\u2019m convinced of the legitimacy of the problem statement but it\u2019s not thoroughly proven in this proposal.

In this case, I make an exception because of the mention of Zendesk.

Only someone with high level call center experience would understand the need for this kind of software, so I believe that the professional experience is legitimate. I do have some concern with this proposal being a one man operation for a MASSIVE ecosystem that is intent on becoming more massive but I expect that operations can expand if demand gets too high.
