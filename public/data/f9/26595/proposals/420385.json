The idea behind this is to create a tool that can provide potential value of an NFT asset based off of rarity, price floor, and supply. The community currently doesn't have a feature that helps a user determine the real value of an NFT. The proposed idea includes this NFT machine learning evaluation because it will help their NFT lending/borrowing protocol to have more accurate information for their community. This has potential to create a lot of value on the Cardano. I look forward to seeing how this idea could benefit the ecosystem. There just needs to be enough demand for an idea like this and a community that is aware of the idea. I would suggest reaching out to the community members of Lending Pond to get their insights on how they would like to see this implemented. For these reasons, I give this section of the proposal 4 out of 5 stars.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "When looking into the team behind the project, I had to go to their website before I was able to find any information about them. There should be information included in the proposal or at least refer to the website to find details on the team members. This is important because it will allow proposers to see that there is a dedicated team behind the project. The proposal includes a roadmap that is very simple and straight to the point. The important part is that it includes specific details in regards to when they plan to accomplish certain things. They plan to start at the beginning of August and implement the proposed idea in September. There could be more specifics in this section. But the information is technically sufficient. There is also a budget breakdown that shows exactly where the team plans to allocate the requested funds. The requested funds match what the budget breakdown suggests. These are all important because it allows the team to be held accountable in the respected areas. I have to give this section 3 out of 5 stars because there can be more information included in the plan and should include the teams experience in the proposal. There should also be more information supporting their specific dates of completion. The plan should have more vigor and determination. It should be informative and also convincing.

There should be more specific dates included and as stated above, there should be inclusion of experience and accomplishments from the team. However, the project idea to bring a tool that supports NFT valuation could be extremely important. It can help users or even companies to determine value of certain CNFT assets. Something that should be implemented into this proposal is a statement on the current community or supporters of this idea. I would suggest that Lending Pond should reach out to their community and inform their community of this proposal. They can receive more insights and opinions. This would help audit the potential success of this proposal and would increase the amount of accountability that takes place. It is extremely important for the proposers to be held accountable. We are in a decentralized space and anyone could take the funds and go. We need to make sure that the information provided is sufficient to determine the likeliness of this proposal being implemented successfully. For these reasons, I suggest this information to be considered carefully and implemented. I give this section of the proposal 3 out of 5 stars. There is a good product behind this proposal.

From there easily make buying and selling decisions, loans or mortgages. Help drive the number of transactions on Cardano.\nRegarding pricing tools and data sources, in my opinion, relying solely on lendingpond data sources will be incomplete and very easy to go wrong or can be easily manipulated by a group of bad people.\nIt is another risk that I would like to further suggest to the author, price data needs to be obtained from multiple sources and price averaging will be more reasonable. This helps to minimize price manipulation.\nAnother risk is that the information fed to machine learning is wrong. This leads to machine learning that will analyze the prices of skewed NFTs in the future. Therefore, it is important to ensure the accuracy of the information.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The author's plan is quite simple and I see a problem of execution time. The author only needed 1 month to complete a machine learning program. That is unusual because a machine learning program created would be very complex and take a long time to develop. I don't think one month is enough to develop a good quality machine learning.\nNext, it takes a lot of time for humans to feed the machine learning data and teach it. It's not something that can be done in a month.\nI think the author needs to clarify more about the technology and solutions for developing machine learning programs. This helps me and the voters clearly understand the feasibility of your proposed implementation plan is really feasible with a short time of only 1 month or not. Or is this a proposal to take Catalyst's money and disappear.\nThe cost description is also not really clear about the work to be performed and the cost for it.\nInformation about members is completely anonymous and no other source of information has assessed team members as qualified to complete this proposal.

This will make it impossible for me and the voters to keep track of what results the proposal has done and how it affects Carano and whether it actually addresses the requirements of the Challenge.\nOverall, this is a proposal that has a lot of problems with implementation time, unclear cost descriptions, unclear KPIs, no public channels for implementation results. Especially with the short implementation period of only 1 month, this proposal will fundraiser 50% of the amount from Catalyst in the first disbursement.

It is easy to see that they can deliver applications, but some provable experience with machine learning would further increase the feasibility from the community\u2019s perspective. \nThe detailed plan is more or less a draft with no real details revealed to the reader. This could be refined to showcase what work goes into each phase and what the expected outcome should be. The same could be said about the budget, no hours are provided for each phase. It is not known if 1 or many developers will work in parallel, therefore it's hard to say if the hourly wage is reasonable or not. This could be improved by listing estimated work hours + the hourly wage. \nOverall, the project is probably feasible to an extent, but the proposal does not reflect this unfortunately.

A good beginning in terms of KPIs and measurables are outlined but it is recommended to determine more hard KPIs that can be measured and evaluated at the end of the project and during its development. It is mentioned that the goal is to integrate with 4 of Cardano's biggest apps, a suggestion is to list a set of 8-10 candidates which you intend to integrate with. This would make your ambition more clear and easen the auditing process for the community. Furthermore, a public channel (blog/website/discord channel) should be provided explicitly, where you push your regular updates to the community.\nOverall, the auditability is not great in the proposal in its current state and could be refined with the tips given above.

This would be made available as an API to other NFT platforms not just Lending Pond, so I see this as a potentially high impact addition to the Cardano NFT ecosystem and a great application of the challenge setting. Relying only on broker- or peer-provided valuations is costly and not in the spirit of decentralization, and could be used to \"game\" less-knowledgeable users to either overpay for NFTs or sell too cheap. The proposal directly relates to market places, lending and borrowing against NFTs, and can have wider use in the area of collecting unique items of value tokenized as unique non-fungible proof of ownership, potentially benefiting other DApps as well. Machine learning requires a lot of data to produce meaningful results, so to start this development early with an MVP on an exiting platform like Lending Pond where some data points are already available is a good idea and even if initially results are not very exact this seems like a worthwhile undertaking to get the process started.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind this proposal have over 4000 followers on Twitter and 2000+ on Discord, a working DApp and SundaeSwap among their partners, which lends credibility to their proposal. I have no doubt that the tool described in the proposal to value NFTs using machine learning can be integrated into the existing Lending Pond platform with ease and the team have the track record and skills to make this happen. \n\nWhat I am missing from this proposal and what would have improved the presentation of the idea to request funding a lot in my opinion is a more detailed description of machine learning and valuation - how this works, and what level of output/valuation quality the community can expect in the beginning (not very high I assume) and then over time as the algorithm learns and has access to more data (ballpark correct for NFT valuation would be a huge achievement and quite tricky I imagine).\n\nIt would have been nice to get more details about the proposed vector machine and how the very short 10 day research period can produce meaningful quality of the evaluation. Knowing that your CNFT is worth x ADA or USD would be fairly pointless if this value is not trusted enough by other users of the evaluation tool to pay anywhere near this value, or if there is a high risk that your super-rare CNFT might be substantially undervalued by the tool and you sell it way below market.\n\nIt would also have been nice to see a more detailed itemization of the $10000 for development costs and salaries, and how the $8000 broker salaries will be determined (hourly rate, per NFT assessed, who are these brokers etc.).", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This proposal can be implemented over a bit more than a month, with an October releasegiven as the latest. Therefore, it is likely that half of the funding will only be released after a successful close-out.
