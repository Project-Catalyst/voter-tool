It provides many additional features for both novice and power users of the Cardano blockchain \u2013 and through that mission helps decentralize access to ADA. The proposers are essentially asking for support to fund Eternl's operating costs for 6 months \u2013 which amounts to $15000/month to pay for all current servers for six months, allowing everyone access to the multi-platform wallet. As Etrnl is one of the key DApp enabled wallets that is used extensively (me included) by the Cardano community, clearly this proposal belongs smack-bang in the heart of the challenge. Etrnl is not only a wallet, but also serves as a wallet that can be used (with its DApp connector) for linking to decentralized exchanges (Dexes), with NFT minting platforms and other emerging platforms. There is clearly need for facilitating the survival and expansion of this great wallet, especially as the bear market is on us.

The team behind Etrnl includes developers of community stake pools [TITAN] TITANstaking and [AHL] AHLNET and they have the required competencies to continue with the project. I would have wished that the budget included more details on the spending as the lump sum of $15,000/month can certainly be quantified in more detail and the community can get a better idea of what Catalyst is paying for exactly. Why? Well, financial transparency always helps to build further trust and disclosing more info about the structure of financial costs would help promote the culture of transparency with treasury funds. Apart from that, full support. The team does not specify there plan for implementation as this is a project that has proven its chops with the successful operation of ccvault/Etrnl\u2026 Every voter can download the Etrnl browser extension and immediately utilize the wallet and see how well it performs.
