First is the budget, $350,000 is requested, which is quite a large amount, so we need a very detailed explanation to know what is the need for such amount. Here the required budget for 6 months of operation and is divided into categories such as design, construction, promotion. In each category, we understand what the money will be spent on. However, it can still be explained in more depth. For example: \"2 Frontend developers - $100k, Communications Intelligence Engineer - 15k\" we need to be explained the salary of each specialist, how long will they work? hourly salary of each person, what does project management cost include?\nNext is the roadmap, the proponent gives 2 timelines:\n\"2022 Q3-Q4: Launch of a website integrating existing DEX and NFT Markets\n2022 Q4-2023Q1: Expanded integration with project launch in Q3 and Q4\"\nThe main activities are listed. However, I think the proponent needs to announce what will happen each month, what activities will be developed, and in what order? How long will each action take to develop, who will do what? Anyway, I think the description of this process is very superficial and flawed, I suggest that the proponent, first of all, divide this period into months and plan the implementation in each activity. Actually for a project that requires a high budget like this, the more detail, the better, the more description of the activities, the better we will be able to understand the development process of the project. this project.\nFinally, about the team, all we know is that the team of 3 members Peyton Winget, Ben Darvill, and Kyle Wood is very briefly described in terms of current experience and expertise, not presented fully. enough about myself, I would like to know more about their background, how can we measure their experience and relationship with the technologies involved in the Cardano ecosystem?

The first benefit, it will make it easier for people to visualize what you are going to do. The second benefit, it helps the project develop in the right direction, the original goal.\nYou have calculated the budget, however, it does not seem to be really detailed. You asked for a budget of $350000, which is a large amount. That's why you need to clarify the budget further, show people how this money is used. I have a few suggestions that might help you: you can calculate a budget based on the number of people involved in each job, the number of hours worked, the hourly wage, and so on. For example: 2 developers will work 8 hours a day, $50 each hour, continuously for 6 months,...\nI also commend you for providing the project progress and success metrics (KPIs).
