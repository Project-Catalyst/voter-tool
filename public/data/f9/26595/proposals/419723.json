This might have a significant impact on how people consume articles about Cardano in today's age of digital journalism. It's fascinating to even consider the possibility of 24-hour TV offering continuous information, news, and updates regarding Cardano. The necessity for a platform with access to that information is now more crucial than ever because of the rising need for immediate and updated information. This solution does a fantastic job of capturing the requirements of the challenge, such as expanding the outreach and increasing Cardano adoption. Additionally, the author has strategies in place to reduce any hazards that were discovered during the preliminary background investigation. Influencers, YouTubers, and content portals seem to have taken care of the marketing components and will undoubtedly reach many consumers right away.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer presents a concrete proposal for how the team intends to accomplish its objectives for the community. The proposal includes a monthly plan as well as the short-term objectives that the proposer hopes to accomplish along the road. The team is brilliantly introduced, and the variety of individuals who make up the group have undoubtedly worked in the industry before. The team is also aware of the potential challenges they may encounter and briefly mentions potential methods to solve them. The campaign brief's ranges are appropriate and the proposed amount of 49k falls within them. The idea is more realistic and transparent thanks to the budget breakdown of the same. The existence of the Cardanofeed website as an ancillary to support the youtube channel gives more credibility to the proposal and adds to the overall weightage. The expertise of the team and the impact the product could have are clearly on the positive side for the community and the world in general.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "To strengthen the great concept and the accompanying strategy that truly astounded me. The team's plan to solve challenges is taken into account when defining the KPIs. All of the indicators are in line with the campaign's needs and are undoubtedly appropriate to track their advancement. The community can have confidence in the team because they have participated in past rounds with a number of proposals and have had some of their initiatives financed successfully. Results like the number of views, subscriptions, and website visits are unmistakable signs that the plan was successful and accepted. Coming from a team who has worked alongside Cardano Feed, there lies very little doubt regarding the feasibility of successful implementation and hence the audit of the progress should be unchallenging and productive. And also with metrics to monitor the proposal post-release being specified by the author himself, it should also follow a similar trend. Hence, I score full marks for this intriguing idea that comes with such explicit detailing in every section.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2704", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5898, "q0": "Currently, the demand for information search is increasing, especially in companies and businesses, requiring a suitable, fast and effective method of information transmission.

This proves your team is fully capable to carry out this project. Links to LinkedIn profiles are also provided, adding transparency to the above information.\nDetailed roadmap (4 months) has been provided. The to-do list is quite exhaustive. Having a detailed roadmap makes budgeting so much easier. You have calculated a budget for each very specific job (based on the number of months worked and the salary for each month). However, it would be even better to break down your budget further (e.g. calculation based on hours worked, hourly rate, etc.). This will contribute to transparency for the budget, adding more confidence to everyone in this project. Indicators to evaluate the progress and success of the project are also provided specifically. This will be the yardstick, making it easier for everyone to track the project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "After reviewing all the information you provide (suggestions, videos,...). I feel that the information provided is quite complete, completely enough to judge the success or failure of the project. I also appreciate that you have identified the risks, challenges and ways to mitigate it. Besides, I think the public launch of the online channel through running ads on social networking platforms such as facebook, telegram,... will also contribute to minimizing the risks and challenges encountered.\nThis is a project with a very good idea, besides the information provided is relatively clear. I believe this project will be done successfully. If so, it will bring great value to the community, making it possible for everyone to gain knowledge about cardano and blockchain.

These however will provide tools and resources for projects to provide realtime information, news and personalized contents solely about Cardano and it's ecosystem. These will eventually create a hub for all things cardano (Learning, exposure and overall, help folks stay in loop of all happenings in the ecosystem).", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team is presented in detail with expertise relevant to the proposed idea, team is also behind one of the largest Cardano news explorer (Cardanofeed), the timelines and roadmap presented in these proposal is properly structured with a clear implementation plan which seems realistic. However, the proposer mentioned that the TV setup will be \"Video only no audio\" and that i think is a setback for the solution. Visuals without sound will not effectively convey the message unless the project is targeted for only people already familiar with cryptocurrency. The team need to reconsider that decision. Also if the TV is realtime and needs data connectivity, that also is a limitation to reaching some remote minorities and entrants. I hope to see the team balance the solution to also be accessed without internet connection (Maybe a collaboration with regular national TV channels to have a daily episode for Cardano). Otherwise, i think the team is capable of executing the idea.\nThe budget is fair and reasonable with a satisfactory breakdown of expenditure.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Currently,  we are presented with a great news outlet (Cardanofeed.com) by the team and they plan to continue updating progress through the platform.
