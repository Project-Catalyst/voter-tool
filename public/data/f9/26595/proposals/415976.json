There is no clear, safe, and easy way to share this knowledge, resulting in a lack of efficient collaboration.", "f6_no_assessments": 5, "f6_rating": 4.6, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1640, "q0": "Yes, definitely the proposal is extremely relevant for Cardano. Due to lack of adequate knowledge sharing (proponents claim there is a problem where people are commonly encouraged to gather information from public/general documentation, but are not encouraged to contribute to this mass of knowledge accessible to all. So to solve this, a dApp would be created, fully focused on collaboration between parties, being \u201ca decentralized search and resolution network for Cardano. A seeker-solver network is a collaborative system where problems are presented and solutions are exchanged in exchange That is, the participants would determine the value of the knowledge they exchange, providing solutions to problems, the platform would then be focused on sharing knowledge, receiving rewards and promoting solutions to pre-existing problems. This network has a name : \u201ca seeker-solver network is a collaborative system where problems are presented and solutions are exchanged in value exchange\u201d. As our community is growing more and more, many proposals are funded and knowledge that could be valuable for mutual success among them is not shared, so this solution would increase the rate of innovation and accessibility for participants in the Cardano ecosystem, as the proposers claim. , accelerating the adoption of our technologies due to user integration. In my view, the topics that would be directly addressed in the challenge would be: \u201cIncrease the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products + Increased quality of existing products & integrations through suggested improvements that is supported by customer feedback or usage increased by the community\u201d. Despite the dApp being a new technology, like it or not, we would be dealing with things that already exist (knowledge that would already be generated, but not shared). It's positive how well the proponents put us on their experience (they say they've already been contacted by IOG to solve an internal documentation problem, and that's where a company was born). They have experience in knowing that this is not an entirely unique problem for IOG, and that a blockchain-enabled ecosystem would prevent problems that are already happening from happening again, as explained in the excerpt \u201cIn traditional ecosystems, the tragedy of the commons is frequent. The tragedy of the commons refers to an economic phenomenon where individuals are encouraged to extract value from shared resources, as an index of knowledge, but are not encouraged to contribute to the shared resource\u201d. For these reasons, I think that the proposal deserves maximum marks in terms of impact, in addition to all the possible risks are well thought out and previously mitigated.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The script is a little confusing, we have a few milestones, but we don't really know how long each one would last (we only know that the first one would last 9 months). Several achievements are cited such as: \u201cSecure funding, Contract with development team for blockchain infrastructure, Complete UI concept/design, Proof of concept completed, Coded backend, Launch demo to Cardano community, Web development /software/app (probably web)\u201d and so on. But it is not so clear what the activities behind these partial results would be - in addition to knowing what would be generated, we would need to understand how it would be generated. So I suggest that there is a reformulation here, that we know what would happen in each of the months (building a more solid timeline is important), and that these achievements are related to activities, with work routines that make them possible. Moving on to the next topic of analysis, which is the use of funding, the $94,000 is split into a few parts, such as the Full Strack developer salary ($24,000 - what would be the hourly rate? Also contract audit intelligent, it is not explained why this would cost 20 thousand dollars; I think it is very positive how the proponents attach the average salary of the professionals involved, for example in the excerpts \u201cMarketing Leader - Dylan Benedetto = $8,333.33 (35.75% of typical US marketing leader annual salary of $93,251) + startup CEO - Teagan Pennock = $8,333.33 (16.27% of typical startup CEO annual salary of $204,898).\u201d This gives us a sense of fairness about the prices charged. I think it would be important for us to know the value of their working hours and also the explanation of more specific expenses such as the audit issue, but in general our understanding of the budget use is solid. And finally about the team, this pa rte is very good, we know in great detail who are the professionals involved (for example about Matt Skrlac: \u201cMatt is a Senior at UW seeking a dual specialization in Economics and Finance with a specialization in Blockchain. He spent 4 years as a US Army Combat Leader before starting his college education. He helped lead the formation of a Veteran Non-Profit. His experience includes: Team Leadership, Resource Allocation, Logistics, etc etc). We also have people here who are experts in Cardano's blockchain technologies, for these reasons I think the team presentation part is the best part of this topic. The proposal is viable, only the script could be more adequate.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of the project is good. We know that progress would be measured based on milestones, consultants work deadlines, MVP (Minimum Viable Product) release, etc. It is also said that user feedback will be the main metric of success, and that \u201cwe will conduct user feedback surveys at regular intervals during testing and after implementation to ensure the best user experience for the majority of the community. We plan to publicly publish the survey results on a quarterly basis.\u201d In addition to the results of these surveys, which in my view correspond to the monitoring of partial results, it would be appropriate if the work routines could be better monitored, for this it would be necessary for us to know more about the activities behind the successes mentioned in the script. It is necessary that the proponents go further in this regard, in providing us with means of auditing what the professionals would be doing in their daily work in relation to the project - it is necessary to establish some communicative bridge with the Cardano community, in order to understand these achievements , these advances, even if sensitive (I think it would be more appropriate for such information to be released at the end of each month, and not quarterly). Proponents go on to explain how they would track partial results: \u201cWe also plan to track unique user interactions with the Indico system. We will gather information about the number of unique user wallets and relevant interaction data to determine a number. This will be a useful number for evaluating system integration and usage statistics to determine new features\u201d; therefore, our focus of improvement here would really be in terms of activities/work routines. Success can be measured based on a few deliverables: \u201cSuccessful deployment of smart contracts on Cardano Mainnet + Launch of a fully functional web application (dApp) + Successful audit of all smart contracts in the system + Successful deployment secure API + Full functionality in the user experience, from the web 2 interface to the basic contracts, without failures in the transactions\u201d and etc. We are very knowledgeable of what a successful project would look like, the overview explained is detailed, broad and deep - nothing superficial and abstract. With that, the only thing that really remains pending is: through which communication channel will all this information be passed on? I would like to suggest that the proponents carry out a general study, including all this data, and provide it for our knowledge through discord, or telegram, youtube, townhall presentation, onine tools like notion, miroboard, google docs and etc. It is necessary that all this is easily palpable by the Cardano community. With that, the topic is adequate, needing some improvements here and there.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Thank you for taking the time to give us this excellent feedback. The impact and alignment comments match perfectly with our intent. We see the lack of proper knowledge sharing as a detriment to many organizations. Unlocking the full knowledge of the many great people building out this ecosystem is critical to its success in our opinion. \r\n\r\nThe team understands the concern around more specifically defining the feasibility and breaking down the timeline more thoroughly. We\u2019ll release more in-depth milestones with specific dates as we determine our capacity to build. Our work routines and progress posting for the public will also become available in the coming months. Thank you for your specific feedback in this section. We will be utilizing the suggested structuring and reformulation with month by month breakdowns in each of the categories you listed (timeline, milestones, activities related to the milestones, and work routines which align with each activity). \r\n\r\nAuditability is key to building trust with the community and having a clear communication method outlined is a needed addition to this proposal. I appreciate you pointing out this need. We have a youtube channel we will utilize for product specific updates. We are in the process of setting up a public google drive for our research we\u2019ve conducted. In addition, we\u2019ll be setting up a discord and telegram to push out announcements and progress updates. All of these information sources will be publicly available throughout the process and as proponents of blockchain we strongly believe in the need for transparency. "}, {"id": 8118, "q0": "The phrase \"knowledge brokerage\" helped me come to with this proposal. The name partly helped me visualize the idea of \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bthe proposal. \"Brokerage\" is no longer a strange thing in the traditional economy, it is considered an act of mediating between parties to meet, contact, and negotiate to establish specific relationships and benefits. However, it is completely centralized and controlled by an intermediary (called a broker or brokerage center). In this proposal, brokerage activities are carried out through a decentralized Dapp built on the Cardano ecosystem. The broker object here is \"knowledge.\" Knowledge of Cardano and blockchain technology is very broad and numerous. Sharing knowledge with those who really need it is extremely important, both parties benefit and increase effective collaboration. From those things, I see that this is a great proposal, meeting the requirements of the challenge, large scale of impact and very important for the Cardano ecosystem in particular and Blockchain technology in general. The success of the project will help attract more programmers, engineers, academics, etc. to monetize their experiences and abstract ideas. Attract more developers to the Cardano ecosystem because what they need is available. This effective collaboration will create a good effect on the sustainable development of Cardano.\nBesides, the team has also anticipated the risks that may be encountered during the project implementation. These are the risks of initial cost, critical community acceptance, user data & IP security, and other unforeseen risks. They also have the right solution to mitigate these risks. I appreciate the impact presentation of the team.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project roadmap is clearly presented. The plan is very detailed.

The author has provided a copy of the budget with very specific calculations and detailed. The budget is broken down into small amounts with an explanation and basis for that calculation. I find this budget allocation reasonable.\nThe information about the project team impressed me. They are students (first year, final year, college graduate) of the University of Wyoming but very active, with great will and vision. Information about group members has also been presented relatively fully (experience, capacity). They have a close relationship with the Blockchain & Digital Innovation Center, director Steve Lupien and have a current relationship with IOG. The project's advisors are all qualified and experienced people in the blockchain field. I found that the team perfectly suited the goals of the proposal.

Therefore, this system will only be useful when community members interact with it. \nIn my opinion, the way to measure the progress of the project is transparent and effective. They gave measurement indicators. Those indicators are: meet the timelines and ensure project feasibility. The minimum viable product will be measured against specific predefined features. They care a lot about the amount of user feedback and the number of community contributions to improve the system. They care a lot about user feedback and community contributions to improve the system. Publishing the results of the quarterly user survey increases the transparency of the project and increases interaction with the community. The author has also provided the project's communication channels for the community to follow such as websites, twitter, youtube.\nThe success of the project is described in great detail. This includes the completion of a viable product and a continuously growing user base on the Cardano network. It will then develop further, adding new features.

The rise of decentralized infrastructure is providing new kinds of scalable and widely applicable tools for free markets to take over many of these tasks. \n\nThis proposal aims to take advantage of that and build a system where several types of knowledge workers are incentivized to participate and benefit. Immutability of the contributions creates an option kind of situation where, any new information about the impact of this action, changes the value for the contributor too. In addition, when new tools to utilize the information about the created value become available, the contributors benefit even more. With the right incentives there is always a supply of solutions wherever the progress can be made. \n\nI think that the most powerful implications of this project is that it does not only improve the knowledge sharing and collaboration within companies but enables dynamic communities to self organize problem solving freely without having to incorporate the process. It means that more people can participate, more different types of endeavors, apps and services can be started and more activity on these decentralized platforms. The proposal is extremely well aligned with the Challenge.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap provides details for the basic deliverables with the main tasks and time estimates.

They have capabilities needed to work on this project and to find the right people and help when needed. Currently there is not exact verifiable information about the implementers of the technical blockchain components. \n\nThe adoption of a platform of this type is highly dependent on the final user experience. A lot of testing and feedback would be important already in the development phase to keep the progress in the right direction. Since the project has started from the real problem and a need for a solution, engagement and feedback should be available. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap describes clear milestones which can be used as target steps on the progress.
