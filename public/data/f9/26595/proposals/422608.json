Another problem highlighted by the proposal is that centralized retailers such as Amazon report only sales data and revenue to publishers / authors making the distribution process of a book not transparent and difficult to verify. Finally, readers are not allowed the opportunity to resell or exchange purchased digital books, which however happens with paper books, which are exchanged in second-hand markets without generating income for the artist, who sees his intellectual property resold without having a profit.\nThe proposal therefore aims to create a makteplace for NFTs and eBooks and audiobooks where readers/indepedent authors/publishers can buy/sell/publish unique digital book assets, which they truly own. This will allow authors and publishers to receive perpetual percentages from resale in secondary markets as well as greater security and digital rights management. Readers will truly own what they buy and will be able to earn BOOK tokens by consuming the contents of the books. The verified reading and the historical record of consumption could also radically change the eudcative system.\nThe proposal responds perfectly to the objectives of the challenge, in fact it aims to build a decentralized application that is configured as an excellent alternative to traditional centralized digital book retailers (e.g. Amazon kindle). The gain for the Cardano network is evident, eBook revenue is expected to reach $ 13.62 billion in 2022, with a total of 1.1232 billion readers by 2027 (https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital -media / epublishing / ebooks / worldwide) without considering the potential value of the secondary market.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team, whose Linkedin references are provided, has a confirmed and rooted experience in the sector, they have already created and sold an ebook platform (Bookshout) by collaborating with important companies such as Google, Microsoft, WSJ etc.\nThe proponent provides banking (Silicon Valley Bank), legal (Morrison Foerster), accounting and tax (Deloitte) references. All high-level references.\nThe proponent provides the link to his own medium article in which he explains the basic technical aspects such as architecture and the technologies used.\nThe MVP (minimum functional product) has already been created. The BookToken team used blockchain infrastructure along with smart contracts and decentralized storage to create unique, decentralized and even fully encrypted (DEA) digital book assets, all stored on the blockchain without the need for centralized databases. This will allow the true ownership of books and digital media without publicly displaying the contents of the NFT on the blockchain itself. (This video can help you understand better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14Bh8hjVLIg&feature=emb_logo).\nThen the owner of the NFT will be able to read the book with the browser-based anonymous open EReader without the need to log in once their wallet is connected.\nThe development stages of the platform and reader functions will follow (possibility of transferring book between wallets, exchange of basic books, release of the book and mobile app) which are described in detail and with precise timing.\nConsuming the contents of the books will also give the opportunity to earn $ BOOK tokens, which can be exchanged or used to purchase books.\nThe proposer shows awareness of any risks that could jeopardize the success of the proposal, for this he employs several law firms to help navigate editorial contracts, NFT transactional legality in the United States and abroad, and tax law for a secondary market that has never been existed.\nThe team is not engaged in any other proposals in this fund nor in previous funds which gives them the opportunity to focus 100% on the realization of the proposal and reportedly have 8 publishers ready and thousands of titles ready to go to sell NFT books .\nConsidering the above, I consider it extremely likely that the proposal will be successfully implemented", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer provides clear and sufficient information to check the progress of the proposal.

The proposal may specify more about the types of tokens that will be used to highlight their reward and boost the financial incentive. Furthermore, will cryptocurrencies such as ADA be used for transactions and royalties? The idea of true ownership of ebooks makes them tradeable among other readers. The readers could sell their NFT books, as with any other NFT products. The ultimate goal of the project is to create autonomous key management dApp and help readers to become fully decentralized. This decentralization of ebooks and reading culture is inventive and helps to expand the blockchain ecosystem. Book reading and transaction will take place on Cardano, which has a direct impact on this blockchain. People who are interested in this project will join the Cardano community to read books, which brings more publicity to this community. The proposal comes with illustrations that help people understand more clearly the concept of DEA - decentralized encrypted asset, in this case - books. The proposer does mention the possible resistance from authors, readers, publishers to blockchain technology.

All of this comes to show how impactful blockchain technology is when properly integrated into an existing market (in this case - books).

The team members are of experience relating to publishing, knowledge of NFT Blockchain technology and software engineering. Also included in the team is a legal law firm head partner.\n\nThe proposers think that they would be able to sustain the operation from the profits they get unless they underestimate the unit cost and are required to push up the marketing effort. \n\nI am not sure how much effort the budget item of USD 9000 \"Contract Business Development /Publishers Relations\" is  spent on marketing the Book NFT to the users consumer market.

Readers can buy and sell their ebooks and earn $BOOK token as they read, while authors and publishers can get a % of the secondary sale in perpetuity.

If successfully, this platform could onboard hundreds of millions of readers, publishers and billions of dollards in digital assets, as a result, promotes the development of NFT on Cardano, unlocking the utility of Cardano blockchain that fits well with the Challenge setting. It is inevitable trend in the future to apply blockchain technology into ebook industry. In my opinion, this team soon catch up with the trend of Cardano blockchain, with quality team and rich experience in the ebook industry, I believe, will create a very prestigious project.

Finally, for the budget part, it is detailed enough for each required amount of cost. I know the number of hours for each item, the hourly rate, and total required expenses that I think it is reasonable.

I think, this will create a direct communication bridge between the team, information, and the community auditors. In addition, the team will make a report and shared it at EOM, discussing the following KPIs: the number of weekly commits, sales, NFT minted, total website traffic, average purchase value of ebook and audiobook, the number of secondary sales, the % of sales in secondary markets, the number of wallets, publishers contracts, authors,....In my opinion, these quantitative analysis help community to have a clearer look of the project progress.
