Cardano's native asset design allows for novel approaches to supply chain transparency in which every material, stage and process can be represented on-chain. Proposed solution is extremely detailed, composable and highly scalable, it will answer for the questions: \u201cWhat? Why? How?\u201d. First, \u201cwhat?\u201d, it will research, design and build a tokenised garment supply chain implementation on Cardano; develop standards and document the tools and methods used for accelerating adoption of Cardano in supply chains by other businesses; and demonstrate this implementation IRL by creating a limited edition of 500 shirts for the Cardano community. Second, \u201cwhy?\u201d, because the Cardano blockchain provides the tools and infrastructure for them to imagine new systems, processes and products, launching this MVP will demonstrate how to implement a supply chain on Cardano helping to accelerate adoption; and human and natural resources are exploited in the production of most clothing on the market, by using the blockchain to bring radical transparency to their supply chain, they aim to inspire and empower other brands to do the same, increasing the awareness and demand for ethically produced clothing. And \u201chow?\u201d, to achieve the outputs: first iteration of a fully tokenised supply chain on Cardano, documentation of implementation to allow further expansion and iteration by other businesses and industries leading to accelerated adoption of Cardano, and 500 \u201cblockchain backed\u201d shirts with fully tokenised and traceable supply chain and verifiable authenticity; they have developed a 4 stage implementation plan: research, develop, partner and create; sell, sustain and spread the word. The outcomes of the project are: a real world demonstration of the technical superiority of Cardano's native asset design for mapping supply chains, able to be adopted across industries driving rapid adoption of Cardano; a new paradigm of traceability, transparency and accountability for sourcing in the fashion industry, making this approach as widespread as possible helping to lessen the damage aspects of fashion; and sale of the collection of 500 shirts providing funds for Origin Thread to continue to operate and innovate on Cardano.\nThe proposal aligns with the challenge and brings impactful use cases to Cardano ecosystem that help driving more adoption: creating and developing a transparent supply chain solution could help pave the way for wide spread adoption of Cardano in many industries; and by documenting and sharing their approach and their standards, they will equip other businesses with the tools needed to implement this approach. For integration, if large scale consumer businesses begin to tokenise physical products and implement supply chain transparency using Cardano, there will be the potential to onboard every consumer of those products to Cardano driving massive and widespread adoption. It will be perfect if the Key metrics of the proposal is written clearlier and easier to understand, however it doesn\u2019t affect to the result.\nThrough the proposal, the author exposes quite sufficiently the risks the project can face, even the unexpected: change in ADA price, challenges in scope creep, challenges with permission to use Cardano logo, change in raw material prices, challenges in production timelines, mistakes in production and delays, low consumer demand, and expect the unexpected. The team give the ways which mitigate these risks and will have a contingency fund to help cover the cost of any unexpected event.\n\"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\"The proposal provided an detailed plan with a practical timeline and the illustrated pictures, examples, designs,\u2026. Supply chains are composed of four elements: materials/components, processes, suppliers and locations; and each of these elements can be represented, shared and traced on-chain. How each element will be represented: materials - fungible tokens, products - fungible or non-fungible tokens, suppliers \u2013 NFTs, processes - burn \u201cinput\u201d token and mint \u201coutput\u201d token which reference burn and mint TX of input tokens asset ID of suppliers, locations - wallet addresses, movement - tokens transferred between addresses, logistics information and supplier included in tx comments. However, the plan should gives the more specific milestones to complete the given tasks and show clearly the gained results. \nAccording to the detailed plan, the proposal also makes a clear budget breakdown for each payment item, that is very reasonable with the given plan. The proposer showed clearly and specific the payment items: project management, token development, product and documentation creation, production of 500 shirts, additional development, social media management, film making and content creation, T-shirt pattern cutting, grading and sample creation, product photography, server hosting and software. And there is also a standby budget for the inccur expenses in proposal. I think the author should add the bullet points in front of each item and smaller ones so that the readers can follow the budget breakdown easilier.  \nFor the people who will implement the proposed project, the author  offers fairly sufficient information of their positions, skills, experiences and referent links. Excepting for the available members, they are also finding freelance developers to help share the load of the development work.\nWith such a detailed plan, a clear budget breakdown, and a diversed and experiental team, we can see the potential of the project as well as values it will bring to the community. The project after completion will provide Origin Thread the required funds to self sustain as a business of which many tools and processes may be looked to research and develop bringing value to others in the community, and they can return Catalyst to speed up development and innovation.\n\"", "q1r": 4, "q2": "\"The project\u2019s progress will be shared monthly on the Origin Thread website and twitter to allow the community to follow and audit.

These informations will be recorded on-chain and shared in their final documentation, however, for clearlier, the proposer should offer the specific milestones for completing targets of the project.\nThe project\u2019s success based on criteria that is suitable for the detailed plan: successful development and implementation of a tokenised garment supply chain on Cardano; full documentation creating allowing other businesses or individuals to follow the same methodology and tokenise their own supply chain; owners of the limited edition 500 shirts having a garment that looks and feels great and that they\u2019re proud to wear, and that as a IRL example of Cardano\u2019s design superiority will be a huge plus for adoption; Origin Thread supply chain tokenisation processes set up for future clothing releases; and revenue from sales funds continuing development on Cardano.

This proposal brings up an intriguing problem. According to the team, individuals in the developing world and our environment are paying the genuine cost because some factories in the fashion business utilize harmful sourcing techniques. This is incredibly intriguing to me since, in this situation, the community has been built with a strong organization, and the goal of this proposal is to explain the entire blockchain universe from a philosophical position. This proposal's purpose and metrics are in line with the requirements of the competition. I don't see any missing components among the elements specified in the proposal.

The roadmap is really thorough and provides clarity on what will be done within a quarter, and it appears to be reasonable in comparison to what is planned. There is an extensive description of the specific tools and technology that will be used to ensure the project's success. The plan's technical components are explained simply and explicitly, which is an important step that many other ideas skip. The proposer evaluated concerns, similar solutions, and potential challenges. The budget appears to be adequate. The budget requested, while detailed and very specific, is somewhat conservative; I anticipate that some costs will be higher than what is outlined in the proposal; I remain confident that the project will be completed regardless, but it would have been better to request a proper amount that does not raise concerns on that front. The proposer has all the skills necessary to bring the project to its conclusion. There is a clear scientific approach taken. The proposer has a LinkedIn account that speaks volumes. And, of course, they've worked on similar projects before. So the credentials check out with flying colors.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In terms of auditability, the team outperformed themselves. They did a good job of detailing the many phases, which ranged from the short term (3 to 6 months) to the long term (1 year). Each with a synopsis of what would happen. The team went above and beyond by alerting the community of what is to come in the near future. Furthermore, the team outlines in clearly what performance measurements they expect to have, which I believe is vital, especially for the first six months because these will have a tangible impact. The open-source nature of the platform also contributes to its audibility.

There is so much uniqueness in this proposal that I am very excited about. First, the presented data shows a quantifiable need for this proposal to fight for  humanitarian efforts, environmental concerns, and transformation of business beyond just the fashion industry. There are many proposals that COULD provide this framing to explain impacts with quantifiable research but only end up talking about the logistics of what they plan to build. A lot of proposals sometimes end up building up problem statements to such a degree that they couldn\u2019t possibly produce a solution that would effectively address the problem but I think this one does an impressive job in establishing severely urgent problems with effective solutions. Next, I don\u2019t see many clothing based Catalyst proposals or physical product based proposals for that matter. I think there\u2019s a lot of awareness/adoption potential for the Cardano ecosystem with successful physical product projects that are well connected with the Cardano ecosystem. With these elements of uniqueness, I think this proposal is very well aligned with Catalysts mission to pursue the highest levels of community innovation. In this alignment, I would like to see a little bit more framing of this proposal in information sharing and pioneering the supply chain space. I think this proposal makes a MUCH bigger impact as a project with supply chain expertise that can help others develop, as opposed to a small clothing line that has built their own supply chain process for their own exclusive use.  I also think this proposal does a fantastic job of thoroughly evaluating itself with an acknowledgement of the main risks that come along with the intents of this proposal. This portion is often neglected by most proposals but I think that it shows voters that the proposers are well aware of potential challenges/risks. Therefore, this project is well-prepared to handle changes, is expecting to be adaptable, and shows resilience in \u201cstress testing\u201d the ideas behind the proposal. I think this section of the proposal is phenomenally well done and receives an overwhelmingly positive reaction from me.

I\u2019m surprisingly impressed with the diverse levels of high-grade talent that is listed on this core development team. There\u2019s a lot of experience in the fashion industry that has obvious direct application but this team also has experience from a film maker and social media manager that can help expand the reach of this project to greater audiences. They may not have a dedicated developer yet but it looks like they\u2019ve got prospects that are being considered before the actual development of a platform begins, so I don\u2019t dock any points for that. This section wins big points from me for the simplified logistical outline of the supply chain process with graphics to go along with it. I think this will get a big win from voters because they are much more likely to respond positively to something they understand. The roadmap looks very clean and simple that includes information about markeing/outreach, product development, community building, and platform development. I\u2019m very enthusiastic about the prospect of having a functioning supply chain process (MVP) in a 6+ month timeframe. Lastly, the budget is perfectly reasonable. I think expensive in some areas (like freelance development and contingency) but is rather inexpensive in almost all other areas. I\u2019m eagerly anticipating information on what the shirt prices are going to be because I fully expect confident feasibility is demonstrated here. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I am simultaneously impressed and disappointed with this section of the proposal because it\u2019s well organized and thoroughly defined for performance/success but this section is missing some things that I typically expect to see from these proposals. I rank this section a 4 because I think it\u2019s a positive framework but is missing some specific elements that would give voters a lot more clarity on this project. I appreciate that this section measures both platform completion and post-proposal operation performance because I think voters need to be shown that a proposal is measuring success in areas that have a direct link to the potential impacts. For example, a completed supply chain infrastructure is a major accomplishment but it doesn\u2019t actually make an impact on the world if purchases of those products are slim to none. Where I think this section could use some improvements is further specificity on quantification with target metrics. In a way, this quantification is limited to the sale of the first initial 500 tshirts but I think it would leave a very positive impression with voters if there were more projections on future performance metrics at different points in the future of this project.

For the scope of this proposal, they only experimented with 500 shirts, but the idea and implementation could be scaled up to a larger scale or even to other industries where improved traceability and accountability are needed. The proposal effectively addresses the challenge by presenting a real use case for the Cardano ecosystem, demonstrating the value that businesses can achieve through this use case. In addition to implementing a traceable supply chain, the proposer also creates a document describing how they have implemented this supply chain allowing other businesses to follow the same methodology and tokenize their own supply chain. Consumers care about the origin of their products, especially for food, fashion, and FMCG as more than 70% of consumers want to know how their clothes are made (according to a survey of 5000 people by Fashion Revolution in 2020).

The budget they gave to carry out the project is also very clear and specific, broken down into identifiable items. Their timeline is also detailed and realistic, divided into 4 phases lasting for 6 months.

This proposer uses Cardano's native asset design to develop a proposal that is perfectly aligned with the goals of challenge F9. In this section, I have a question: if the team is unable to request permission to use the Cadarno logo, what logo will they use instead, and why? Concerning the difficulty \"material, production,\" the proposer has a strategy to mitigate it, and I believe it is sufficient. I suggest listing some of the suppliers with whom the team is considering partnering, and perhaps planning a schedule in the production timeline ahead of time if possible.

Every month, specific tasks are planned. However, the proposer simply specified which tasks will be completed each month, so I propose that the roadmap be organized such that anybody can see which tasks will be completed first and last. In addition, including the number of staff or some of the key personnel accountable for each work or period is a good idea. The proposal must provide a feasible timeline not only for what they will do, but also for how it will be completed. Please divide the four stages of implementation developed by the team into this timetable as well. A bonus point is further information and illustrations allow the community to get a first glimpse at mvp, which is something that other proposals rarely provide. The budget is very precise; it is broken down into smaller categories, and each bullet point explicitly states what much is used for what purpose.

Manufacturers do not know where their products are processed; users do not know the origin of products, and workers work in a bad environment. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to build a supply chain transparency in Cardano. In this supply chain, materials will be fungible tokens, while products can be fungible tokens or non-fungible tokens. And suppliers will be minted into non-fungible tokens.

First, to provide a way of boosting the value of the Cardano community and ecosystem using a new or improved Dapp, product or integration. Second, to provide a way to give a user a better experience by providing more options or increasing the ease of use via an integration with an existing product, service, or protocol. This proposal does all that and more - it could become the prototype against which later crypto projects involving supply chains will be measured. \n\nThis project takes on a very serious and important problem - a way to reliably document every step within a supply chain for the purpose of allowing the customer to make informed and ethical buying decisions. When it is no longer possible to hide the use of child labor, supply sources dirtied by war or crime, or environmental cost, customers can apply economic pressure, forcing businesses to be more honest and fair - whether they are manufacturers or retailers. If this practice becomes the norm, it will improve the world in so many ways. The exploitation of labor, the profits of corrupt or uncaring businesses, and harm to the environment would all decrease. With access to the history and production process on the blockchain, an informed customer can avoid a problematic product and buy from the company that offers a better solution. \n\nFor simplicity\u2019s sake, the proposal team limits their attempt to bring full transparency to supply chains to just one use case, the garment industry. However, success here will provide an example for others to follow in many other industries. As many people will be interested in the production transparency and authenticity of the things they buy, the adoption of \u201ctokenizing\u201d the supply chain in just this one industry would greatly spread the adoption and use of the Cardano blockchain - just consider how many people need clothing.  Further, giving consumers a way to learn about the hidden costs of a given product would provide them with the option of choosing the best products in an informed manner. Together, these ways of increasing adoption and consumer options meet the goals of the challenge. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is to be commended on both an amazing idea and on their carefully crafted plan. There appears to be little doubt that they will succeed - their endeavor artfully harnesses the power of Cardano blockchain technology and applies it to serve a public good, disrupting what is often a costly and unethical industry. The proposal\u2019s clear and detailed explanation of how the various elements of a supply chain can be represented, shared and traced on a blockchain is essential to providing confidence in the project\u2019s approach to the problem. Further, it provides a reasonable timeline for a real world a proof of concept exercise - showing how well-suited Cardano\u2019s design is to map supply chains by doing so with the production of 500 t-shirts. \n\nImpressively, the project lead has committed to earning as little as necessary in the proposed budget - the better to provide more money towards the success of the project. His  budget carefully details all the aspects necessary to carry out the proof of concept work, and wisely provides for unforeseen contingencies. \n\nThe experience of the team is extensive and highly applicable to the project\u2019s tasks and goals. The project lead has already personally met with suppliers of the various components required to make a shirt - cotton thread, dye, patterns, cut, and assembly. Further, he has created a film of an earlier production process of 60 shirts using these sources. He has also created a company (Origin Thread), its website, and an NFT series. He wishes to use his company to demonstrate that it is possible to produce an ethically-made garment with a fully-transparent, blockchain-based supply chain. Finally, he has assembled a distinguished team of professionals - from a manufacturer of cotton cloth, a pattern cutter, a dyer, and a film maker, to help create his new line of shirts and to document the process.
