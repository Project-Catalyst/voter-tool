They list some of these actions being registering, calculating or offsetting carbon or plastic, creating or completing sustainability, planting trees, generating renewable energy, participating in carbon sequestration, developing apps for the platform, participating in the DAO, performing leadership and marketing services. The team do not make it clear on how they will verify and audit the completion of these tasks such as planting trees, carbon sequestration or offsetting carbon. If anyone can submit this information online then this could be easy to make up. If the user gets any financial value or reputation based value from this system then the entire model relies on being able to effectively verify that the information people have about their contributions is accurate. The team mention bugs as a potential risk but do not mention the difficulty in auditing people actually making these contributions and also do not refer to the incentive mechanisms required for this type of model to function. If there is no value accrued to the user for performing these actions then making any impact will be difficult to impossible. If they do receive some value then the cost of verification and auditing contribution is vital for the economic viability of this suggested product. Overall there is a severe lack of details on how this platform will function and how it will be sustainable over the long term.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The roadmap for this proposal includes hiring into a number of positions listed on the proposal and also they provide a monthly timeline for the delivery of the digital wallet features before they are marketed at the end. A cost break down is provided outlining these roles with the hours included an the rate they will be paid. All of the hours included are exactly the same which further reduces confidence that the proposing team have thought about the exact requirements for this proposal in any depth. They could have added more depth to how the wallet and carbon offsetting related tasks amongst others would be tracked and the effort that would go into each. In regards to the team they mention John Williams, two UX people and a scrum master that they already know / work with and the remainder would be outsourced. No evidence is provided towards the background of the team such as professional links or previously developed technical projects that would be relevant to this. Overall it looks unlikely that the team can execute this proposal due to the lack of plan provided and evidence that supports that the team will have what is required to execute this proposal.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The team mention for their progress they will have weekly progress meetings. They mention metrics as TBD and have not provided details. The team could have added details on where they will publish these meetings and communicate with the community. They also have no mentioned if anything would be open source or what aspects we could find on a Github repository or similar. For success the team outlines that success is the delivery of the proposal deliverables. This outcome lacks any depth on exactly what they are trying to achieve and why. For instance they could have mentioned that the most important tasks that they want people to perform in the platform as to plant trees or something similar and the reasons why and then highlight what sensible values would be for this. Overall the clarity of this proposal is low and requires more thought on why users will interact with this platform and why it is sustainable as am model. With that clarity the proposers would then be able to make more specific and actionable objectives that help to demonstrate how they will achieve those deliverables and prove this model will work from measuring the outcome from those objectives.

The platform will be designed to allow purchasing and trading carbon offsets through the platform native token Gia and exchange these tokens for Ada. This proposal if delivered successfully will have a significant positive impact on Cardano and could drive a large volume of traffic to exchange carbon credits, carbon offsets, and allow users to reduce their carbon footprint by exchanging the platform tokens with Ada. The proposal will be able to scale to multiple use cases around calculating carbon footprint and reducing individual and businesses carbon footprint. There is a clear need for a carbon offset platform like this one, and because of the potential impact to bring people to Cardano I have rated this 5 out of 5 for Impact. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has provided some background information and the name of the principal architect John M. Williams. After searching linkedIn I was able to find John's profile and confirm that he is an experienced software architect that has worked for the U.S. government. https://www.linkedin.com/in/johninva/#experience \nIt is not clear to me who the rest of the team will be, so we will have to rely on trusting John to hire and manage the team as he suggested through upwork and networking within the Cardano Community. The budget is a large ask considering the level of detail provided in the proposal, however the scope of the project will likely require this large amount of $430,000. I have rated this 3 of 5 stars for Feasibility and removed 2 stars for the following reasons: 1) The website for the project is incomplete, and contains filler text, what appears to be stock images, and it is not easy to verify the companies actual # of employees, customers, or users. This makes it challenging to do simple background check on the proposing team or the company as no direct linkedin links or other references were provided in the proposal. The template style filler text on the website makes me question if the testimonials provided are real, or if they are just stock placeholders for the website while under construction. Additionally the proposal states \u201cThe Earthonomy is very unique in that we are the only social media-based carbon offsetting platform on the Internet.\u201d However, when I checked the projects social media presence, they have less than 10 followers across twitter, Facebook, and Reddit combined, and 18 followers on instagram. This lack of social traction is concerning, and does not give me confidence that they can generate significant traffic or acquire a large number of users to the platform when launched. However, this may simply be due to the early stage of this venture, and the principal/proposer John. M Williams does have over 10,000 followers on LinkedIn. \n2) The plan does not include information about how the carbon offsets will be calculated, and more importantly how they will be verified on the ground. As someone with a background in Sustainable Energy, I'm aware that Carbon accounting is not as simple as calculating some numbers, and building out the software, the challenge is with how the data is obtained, and how to insure the data is not corrupted to provide unrealistic results that would benefit those trading the carbon offsets. There is a financial incentive to \"game\" the system and \"produce\" carbon offsets without actually offsetting the carbon that is claimed. The security, integrity and transparent verification of the system is important to build trust in the platform, and it is not clear what if any international standards or verification processes will be implemented for this project. The proposal focuses only on the technical aspect of building the platform, but does not provide enough detail on how the system will actually work on the ground, and how the data will be collected, reported, and verified. This missing information is critical to evaluating the feasibility of the proposal. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability section of this proposal is unfortunately not sufficient for a higher rating. The statement \"We intend to conduct weekly progress meetings, with metrics TBD.\" does not provide what specific progress will be reported, what the quantifiable metrics or KPIs will be, or how/where they will be communicated. There are no specific targets or estimates provided to determine if the team has been successful or not.\nIf success is defined as \"Core features implemented in production and operating at expected levels, by December 31, 2022\" it would be good to have further details of the core features, and what is meant by \"expected levels\". I would suggest the proposer include more detailed metrics with quantifiable targets with specific and realistic dates set, such as: Tons of CO2 sequestered, # of individuals registered on the platform, # of businesses registered on the platform, # of non-profits using the platform, # of geographical countries using the platform. # of trees planted buy Jan 1, 2023 etc. Additionally it would be helpful to know what exactly will be reported in the weekly progress reports, and what key deliverables should be expected, and when, throughout the development process.

The members can hold, send and receive ADA & Earthonomy's internal Cardano-based native token 'GAIA' through this wallet. This integration will also have smart contract features to let the members earn the GAIA token by performing various actions such as registering, calculating carbon footprints, offsetting carbon footprints, planting trees, etc. This is a good idea and, if executed successfully, will positively impact the environment. It aligns with the challenge statement as it involves the development of a digital product and its integration with a website. It can also add value if it can gain traction and onboard many users. But I am skeptical about its success because it will be difficult to onboard users who want to give up their comfort for the environment's sake. Some of us are more enthusiastic about saving the environment, and others will want to forego as little as possible for the environment's good.\n\nOn the other hand, the only revenue source I can see for the platform is the subscription fees. As mentioned above, I doubt the project's success even if you keep this platform for free. Then with subscription, I think the proposer will find it even more difficult to onboard users for his platform. On the other hand, I believe there is a chance of success in the case of companies and factories, as the government and regulatory bodies require them to offset their carbon footprint. But this also depends on the quality of the platform's services.\n\nThe proposer sees only one potential risk in the project, which is a 'bug' in the protocol, and he gave the possible solution for that risk. But I think the main risk will be a failure to onboard many users and sustain the platform in the long run without sufficient income sources. However, the proposer does allocate a budget toward marketing efforts. Still, we must wait and see how successful this marketing will be.\n\nGiven the above points, I cannot agree or disagree with the impact criteria of this proposal.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer provides brief details about the principal architect of the project and incomplete information about the other team members. Also, he mentioned that he would outsource some of the work through Upwork and Cardano community. Unfortunately, we cannot independently verify the team's capabilities as no LinkedIn profiles are shared. But they do have a functional website.\n\nThe proposer does not share the detailed plan; he shares only the brief plan describing the milestones and the months within which they are supposed to be completed. It is not plausible for a project with this big budget. On the other hand, the stated timeframe is reasonable, ranging from Oct-Dec 2022 for the developmental work and the subsequent three months for the marketing.\n\nThe requested budget of $430,000 is significant and not reasonable. For reference, if we see some similar projects in Catalyst, such as 'Nami Wallet' developed the final product in less than $100k. Moreover, the budget is not segregated into identifiable tasks but based on employees' salaries.\n\nBecause of the above reasons, I am skeptical about the project's execution and do not agree with the feasibility criteria.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposer said that they would conduct weekly progress meetings. These meetings' reports can be used for auditing/tracking the project's success by the auditors or the interested members of the community. Regardless, the proposer does not mention whether the meeting results will be accessible to auditors. Apart from this, I was expecting from the proposer that they will provide regular updates on the GitHub or Scrum board in Jira as the project is developmental and the proposer will utilize Scrum.\n\nAs mentioned above, the proposer does not share a detailed plan but only brief milestones to be achieved in three months, i.e., Oct, Nov & Dec-2022. A more detailed plan would have been helpful for tracking the progress. Anyways, the timeframe is reasonable, but if the proposer could have further elaborated the plan and distributed it on a weekly basis, then it would have been ideal.\n\nAs stated above, the requested budget is not reasonable and is not divided into identifiable tasks. Therefore, it is difficult to audit the proposal from a budget perspective. \n\nThe proposer does not provide any metrics to track the proposal's success or to track the progress of the proposal.

However, from a practical standpoint, it is unlikely that a privately developed solution can bring a dysfunctional market back to functioning levels, and no matter how  brilliant the solution and the implementation will be, the fact will remain that the ecosystem will simply not be right for such a solution to flourish, let alone one that increases the complexity level by proposing a blockchain solution. \n\nConsidering the unlikely chances of building a successful market based solution for the carbon market, I shall deem three stars sufficient for this proposal\u2019s potential impact.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Many red flags here. The team is questionable at best, and remember they are asking for 430k USD, so a rather high figure. First, we only know the main proposer\u2019s name, John, with a short bio, but no other social media profile to validate this. The same goes for the website - there is a linkedin button under his photo but it leads nowhere. There is a secondary person mentioned (Certified Scrum Master in the proposal, but likely CEO and founder on the website). So things don\u2019t match very well. We are offered some more details on additional team members in Ukraine and India, but again, no other means to verify this information. \n\nThe budget is not informative at all. The proposal includes simple numbers of hours for each position (13 in total), with hourly rates between 50 and 100. For ALL positions the estimated number of hours is 500 - nice coincidence, right? Coming back to the 13 positions - and only two persons on the team, maybe four - what about the difference? No concrete hiring plans. \n\nThe timeline? A super quick implementation from October until March next year, without any real details on tasks, sub-tasks and necessary hours or activities to complete. \n\nPutting all these pieces of information together, I find the proposal questionable at best, and think that two stars are appropriate.

This is essentially done by creating a Cardaon wallet for the platform.\n\nAlong with this the platform also proposes to develop a token specific to the site, which will be issued as a reward for the contribution of the individual to the reduction of carbon foot-print or alternatively offsetting it.\n\nFurther implementation involves including government bodies/non profit orgnisations or local non-profit organisations to assess the carbon foot print and penalise or reward based on the assesment.\n\nThe whole project is a great idea. Growing carbon foot print will result in the govt entities showing reluctance towards acceptance of the blockchain. There also have been cases on the other platforms where-in they have had to ban/permit miners based on their geographical location.

The concept is in line with one of Cardano's most important missions, which is to enable an environmentally sustainable blockchain solution that is also scalable and capable of solving real-world problems. I believe the concept is well-conceived, with already operational websites and an app for calculating carbon footprints. Furthermore, it makes use of all known aspects of the blockchain, such as open-secured participation, storing certifications attached to the identities of the parties involved, and internal wallets and smart-contracts to enable seamless transacting related to the sustainable goals. With the goal of improving the system by implementing a wallet for native ADA token, I see a significant improvement in the system as well as an increase in the utility of the product, which could potentially attract more users to Cardano - from individuals to large corporations that could benefit from assistet Certification for carbon offsetting published on the blockchain.
