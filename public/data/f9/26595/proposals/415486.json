It is also an innovative idea, in my view, as it seeks to define the solution to a real problem through the adoption of the NFT ecosystem, in the field of the use of images, and I have not seen any proposal that suggests this (that images of ordinary people on social networks to be monetized). For sure, the idea will be a great gateway for new members to our community, since people will not need to be specifically interested in blockchain to be part of the project, but rather want to profit from content they already post on social networks. , something I don't see why people would refuse. Speaking more deeply about the problem, the proponent raises the issue that \u201ccontent creators are looking for authentic, creative, real-time images that can be found on social media, but social media content is not accessible, there is no easy way to buy it\u201d. According to the proponent, the photography market is saturated, two large companies dominate it and the images that are currently being circulated are clich\u00e9s and not at all innovative. In addition, it is a giant market, according to a survey that the proponent brought, today it moves about 4.1 billion dollars and could reach 6.4 billion in a few years. It is also undeniable how many people use images on the internet, as he cited as an example: \u201cnews agencies and publishers, marketing professionals and advertising agencies, video publishers, film and TV production companies, web developers, youtubers and bloggers, social media influencers\u201d and etc. Nowadays, the internet is becoming an increasingly common and consolidated way of working, so in my view this market also tends to grow. So the idea of \u200b\u200bmonetizing social media content from ordinary people (in the sense of not working directly with it, not being photographers or working in photo agencies) is very interesting. If these images saw NFTs on the Cardano blockchain, surely the number of active tokens minted on our network would grow exponentially. An excerpt that argues this idea very well is \u201cCountless snapshots of sporting, cultural, political and news events are shared daily on social media, and media outlets and editors would love to get their hands on them. Furthermore, social media users are wonderful brand ambassadors \u2013 countless images of products and brands (cars, food, fashion, drinks, etc.) But all these authentic, creative, real-time images are not easily accessible and there is no easy way to find and buy social media content.\u201d In other words, we have what it takes to develop this technology: quality images and the possibility of working with NFTs, in order to boost the growth of the Cardano ecosystem, popularizing it as it seeks the challenge. It is very clear what the benefits of the project would be for each type of audience: for content creators who need the images, there would be an increase in the diversity of images available, in addition to being more authentic; for those who will produce the images, this can represent a new source of income, including passive income, as they could trade an image and each time it was used they would profit. My only doubt was in relation to how these people, the creators of the images, would understand how to use the technologies. The proponent states that they could agree to negotiate all the images posted (what that process would be like), or just mention the project in an @, but it is not so clear how this bridge would be established. It is also said that \u201ccustomers have the option to acquire sole ownership of an image through a smart contract on the blockchain\u201d: how would they learn to do this? Aside from these doubts, I believe that the project is very well aligned with the challenge, addressing exactly the topics cited by the proponent: \u201cEstablish cardano as a valid alternative over the current centralized providers of stock images + Provide a new case of use for the cardano blockchain, and with it: Integrate new users into the ecosystem + Add value to businesses and provide an alternative for businesses that have no choice but to rely on providers like Getty Images or Shutterstock.\u201d", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The topic is pretty average as all we know is basic information. The proposal roadmap is unfortunately not adequate, due to the lack of detail and more extensive explanations about what would be done in each month of the practical development of this proposal. The first 30 days are called \u201cFull Project Discovery\u201d, which would include things like \u201cToken NFT, Contract Market, Smart Contracts, Billing Backend Services\u201d. However, it is not easy for us to understand what would actually be done here, in what way these subjects would be developed, what would the work behind it be like? Perhaps the month will be dedicated to the development of the platform itself, which will handle NFT tokens, smart contracts, backend billing services, etc? Unfortunately, these explanations are a little abstract, as they are not well connected to each other, there was a lack of explanations for us to really understand how the work of the professionals involved in that first month would be. The second month will focus on \u201cContributor Recruitment \u2013 \u200b\u200bwe will handpick 1,000 active influencers (starting with 5,000 followers each) who will contribute at least 2 images each to our platform\u201d. Okay, how would these influencers be selected? How would they be introduced to the project, how to make this project simple to understand for those who do not know what an NFT or blockchain is, Cardano's differential in relation to other ecosystems, etc? The third month would be focused on promoting the project to potential buyers, such as the marketing and branding industry, content creators, bloggers, etc. How would this publicity be done? In addition to the dissemination to the target audience, how will the common user be introduced to the idea? In general, it is not possible to have a solid view of what would be done, it would be necessary for much more explanation and detail to be provided for this part of the proposal to be adequate. The division of costs could also be better explained, it is said that for the first part, for the complete discovery of the project, 8 thousand dollars would be used, but how would this be divided between the various parts mentioned? Why would the marketing and promotion campaign for potential creators cost 10 thousand dollars, what would be the strategies here and what would justify this amount? Why would the ready-to-use platform cost another 8 thousand dollars, this would be divided into the salary of the professionals involved, such as developers, programmers, designers, etc? Unfortunately, this part also lacks more extensive and detailed information. The last part of the feasibility topic also leaves something to be desired because we are only properly introduced to two team members - Amit Saragosi and Nir Livni. It would be necessary to mention the professionals of the WarmDevs Team who will work here: what each one would do, what their resumes, previous experiences, etc. A very important point is to understand how everyone is involved with Cardano, how would this relationship be traced? How can we ensure that they have the experience and preparation to deal with our blockchain, in the case of developers and so on? For these reasons, unfortunately the topic leaves something to be desired as a whole, needing general improvements.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As well as the topic of feasibility, this one needs some improvements, both in terms of monitoring progress and the success of the final results. We don't have many ways to follow the development of the platform because 1) our roadmap is not detailed, we don't have much information about what would be done each month, so it is not so simple to know what would be done and when; 2) the proponent does not say that he will constantly monitor the tasks, so that we know what is being built little by little, what the work routine of the professionals involved would be like, etc. It would be necessary for us to have these understandings about the progress of processes, tasks, work routines, what was behind the partial results that the proponent cites: \u201cnumber of registered employees, quantity and quality of images added to our platform, quantity of registered buyers, their satisfaction with the project and project revenues\u201d and also the development milestones \u201cPlatform UI design screens + MVP version of the marketplace + Registered users 3 months after MVP launch - >1000\u201d . There is also the question of how these milestones and this monitoring of the project's progress will be informed to the Cardano community, what would be the means of communication used as a bridge between this team and us? I then suggest that the proponent define where he will make the performances available (for example, some online platform such as MiroBoard, Notion, Google Docs and etc; or some social media such as the project's Instragram, Telegram and Discord channels, etc). Then my suggestion is that he prepare a written report (or a video as well) where he informs the updates both in relation to the development process itself - the work activities of the team's professionals - and the partial results that would be gradually being conquered. The success of the proposal is defined with the launch of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), which would match the Social Images platform, which would allow a new business model in relation to images, providing a growing market for photographers, media creators, agencies that need images, in order to \u201cprovide a service to media companies and an income opportunity for media creators, will enrich the world of images with creative, authentic, real-time images \u2013 made by real people in real situations\u201d . It is certainly necessary for us to understand whether these objectives were achieved, but, even more, it is necessary to understand that if the KPIs of the challenge would have also been achieved, if the project would have actually attracted new people to become active members of the Cardano community, such as these people would be learning about blockchain technologies, getting involved in other projects, looking to use our technologies in their lives, acquiring Ada, using dApps and so on. In my view, it is also necessary to have this understanding of how the project would directly affect the Cardano ecosystem. For these reasons, I believe that some important topics should be included here, although we already have pertinent information.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 8, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 4176, "q0": "The \"Social Images: Stock Photos as CNFT\" proposal addresses the Dapps, Products & Integration challenge by building the first and only marketplace for social media content. The stock images are often 'staged' and outdated unlike 'in-the-moment' images on social media. With this media marketplace, creators and content providers can trade on the blockchain as NFTs. As a social media content creator myself, I understand the merit of having a \"dedicated platform to generate revenue from my own social media content. However, this doesn't stop me from doing it 'my own way' instead of this proposed CNFT platform. I tried minting NFT out of my photo and launched it on the opensea.io This raises  some doubt on the impact of this proposal, however, I believe if the platform gains traction and have active users, this might not be a concern. The impact of this proposal to Cardano would be very much dependent on the market adoption of this idea and whether they see the necessity of using the platform. The team has specified the risk (one of which is blockage in accessing the content from the well known Meta company platforms (facebook and instagram). I also would like to add that social media users might have to pick between platforms as surely the media buyers wouldn't want to pay for images that are widely available to the public and not an exclusive content. Then the social media users might go for platform that they generate more revenue and have more user base.  Currently media agencies are in touch with their influencers and pay them to generate fresh unique content per campaign. Once the campaign is finished, the rights to the asset belongs to the campaign owner. I can see that the team project (CNFT) could help the social media influencers to still own the rights and take some cut if it's reproduced in other campaigns (quite rare for cross campaigns recycled content). It's important that the team would fine tune business model idea (taken into account all examples I raised so far as the active social media users) and legal loopholes before implementation.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project duration is 90 days from 1) full product discovery, 2) recruiting contributors and 3) campaign for potential buyers with ready to use NFT platform. I would suggest the team to do 'market research' as soon as the team can and include in the stage 1 as it is important to check if the demand for their platform is there so that the team knows if their idea needs some tweaking. The majority of budget ($20,000) will go towards 1) recruiting the first 1000 social media influencer and pay them $10 each for their 2 images on the platform($10,000) 2) pilot campaign to potential buyers(another $10,000). The budget should rather be spent more on the technical side ie. smart contracts & backend service as I think the team would have to audit their smart contracts before launching into use. Also if the platform will generate revenue later for social media influencers, they would have signed up without having to pay them upfront just to have their images on the platform. For the campaign for buyers, it is important part and the team needs to elaborate what is their USP (unique selling point) to attract those buyers? Also how does the team come up with $8000 for the NFT platform. It'd be nice for voters to see the breakdown. The team has provided the Linkedin profile of team members and are experienced professional in TV & media. The project has good feasibility but need a brush up on their budget and action plans.

The team should mention which channel the community can oversee the progress ie. social media channels (blog, facebook, instagram etc.)  The team understand that there is a demand from content creators to look for authentic, creative and real time stock images that could be satisfied with CNFT platform.

Monetization of social media content, owned by the creators and can be traded as NFTs on the Cardano blockchain. The fundamental idea is incredibly pertinent and fantastic, and if realized and properly developed, it might be a game-changer for the Cardano Ecosystem as well as for businesses that are heavily relied on providers like Getty Images or Shutterstock. I appreciate that the team devotes a section to clearly describing the technical approach and how it functions.

We are served with a short overview of what it takes to achieve the stated goal and then the team behind this will go into detail, separating the total duration of the project in 3 phases, each with 30 days. Based on the evidence of the team's abilities, the proposed timeline and milestones are appropriate for the amount of events in each phase to be accomplished. They are also clearly described. One thing I love about the project is the proposers have included a specific number of targeted influencers to contribute to the platform, further increasing the proposal's transparency. We don\u2019t have to guess anything like when this will happen, how many people contribute their images or how many images to be contributed by each person for the implementation of the platform. As for the requested fund, the proposal asks for an amount of $36,000. That seems like a decent amount taking into account the scope of what the proposal wants to accomplish. It should be enough to maintain and scale the project for the next 90 days. I would have preferred to see a little more specificity in the financial breakdown to make the idea a bit more realistic. Some components in the budget plan should be broken down into identifiable items. I would like to have a more detailed description of how and when the project expects to advertise their platform during the development of this project since, for instance, $10,000 for a pilot campaign is confusing and imprecise and given that marketing is included in this component.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This project is being worked on by a highly motivated and skilled team.

However, I believe that adding some KPIs to the roadmap would be beneficial in order to further boost the proposal's transparency. How many contributed images, for instance, is the project anticipating having after 60 and 90 days? It is also challenging to determine when the team expects to achieve the success metrics specified. How the team assesses the satisfaction of the registered buyers is another concern I have. I would expect detailed info on this success metric so as to enlighten the success definition. Also, I suggest a channel where the community or users of the platforms can monitor and interact with the proposers would further increase the level of auditability of the project as a whole. However, it is encouraging that a thorough description of potential risks and development-related obstacles has been presented.
