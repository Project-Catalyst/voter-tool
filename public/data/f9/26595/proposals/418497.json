In the description of the solution the proposers provide images and reference to existing Ethereum services that provide the feature set that this proposal are looking to replicate for Cardano. The overall purpose is to give traders quick access to important data such as the floor price, transaction volume and history and then also graphs to make this easy to interpret. The proposal provides some statistics on the adoption of Ethereum focussed alternatives which helps to provide evidence there is a demand for applications like this. The risks provided are reasonable and mention the current market conditions, rate of NFT adoption, funding from catalyst and performance issues. It would have been great to have more specific risks on the implementation of the app based on the experience of the team and statements that provide more clarity on any key differences between Ethereum and Cardano that may be an issue. As an example, is data from oracles needed that are not present or is the data already all fully accessible? The proposal focuses on giving examples of what could be developed but it would have bene beneficial to state with more certainty of the exact feature sets that will be delivered in the first version so the impact can be more easily assessed. The feasibility section does help to shed more light on some of the exact features the proposers intend to deliver such as rarity processing, sales volume graph, mint volume graph, floor resistance graph and latest listing graph as some example modules. Overall there is evidence that an application such as this could create impact for the ecosystem due to the adoption in similar ecosystems, in future proposals the team could be more specific on exactly what they intend to build and the potential impact of these features to make it clearer to assessors and voters.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "For the execution plan five phases are presented. The first phase the team have already completed by deciding on the infrastructure to use for the application. The second phase of development & hiring with a list of some modules to be developed.

For phase 3 further development modules are mentioned such as a rarity sniper, floor sweep and whale tracking tools. Phase 4 introduces a subscription model. The progress plan seems reasonable and in a fair order.

Two core members are listed in the team. One professional link is provided but this link returns a 404. No other links are provided as evidence towards any progress nor any evidence that the proposers can execute this proposal.

To improve this section the proposers could have provided more evidence they know which features are important for traders to make money and what type of metrics they will exactly track to prove whether they are meeting this objective.

Being involved in the CNFT space, I do agree that with the multitudes of projects being constantly released, there is a need for a CNFT analytics platform with the right user interface and analytics tools to assist investors and traders in their decision-making. As we are still in our infancy stages in Cardano NFTs, new platforms that can improve the user experience within CNFTs will not only drive growth but also attract more users. Investors and traders alike will have greater confidence in allocating their funds to CNFT projects because of the better-informed decisions this proposed project aims to provide. The proposer has provided information on the future challenges of the project, although ineffectually describes how they will solve them.

It would have been more beneficial for the proposer to leave out the risks of \u2018crypto winter\u2019 and \u2018no funding from Catalyst\u2019 as these mentioned risks are relatively general and are most likely the risks of most proposals in this Catalyst challenge. The project\u2019s risk of \u2018performance issues on app\u2019 was a suitable inclusion in the proposal as it was specifically significant to their project characteristics. The proposals other mentioned risk of \u2018NFT adoption\u2019 would have been improved if the proposer pivoted this risk to be more particular \u2013 an example could be \u2018low user adoption\u2019 and then explore how they would address this with aspects of their marketing strategy that would attract users onto their platform.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer offers a descriptive background of the team.

Traders do use a lot of dashboards , graphical and data analyticis and not having one that encompasses CNFT may be hindering its growth. Having said that, proposal addresses the solution by creating this tool for Cardano, inspired by others from other blockchain that work well. It also fits well in the challenge as it created a product that will be built to increase Cardano (NFTs) adoption. It is directly connected to the 1st challenge kpi.\n\nAs for the proposal itself, it is very nicely articulated, brining data to prove his point on problem statement and explaining well the solution, with examples (screenshots from existing tool for other blockchain) that illustrate what he's talking about.

It's also imporant to highlight that the 1st part of the project was already one and the next one is already the MVP, which may accelerate the delivery of value to the community.\n\nBudget breakdown is very detailed and transparent. It also matches project scope and timeline.

This could be turned into SMART kpis such as number of users in general, number of visits, time spent on the platform, numbers of users who pays for premium, feedback properly measured (maybe using a NPS), etc.\nIn case proposer adopts an agile framkework, it would also be good to have some sprint reports and product backlog available in the github.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2461", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 1, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4190, "q0": "\"Visio: Cardano NFT Analytics\" proposal addresses this Dapps, Products & Integration challenge by building an NFT analytics platform as currently there is a lack of NFT interface platform in the CNFT space.

The Visio platform provides the real-time listing data with rarity and instant buy, Floor resistance and listing data. It's undeniable that NFTs are the gateway to crypto adoption. Hence, this proposal fits the challenge very well as the NFT analytics platform will expand the NFT trading activity and drive Cardano adoption. However, I would like to suggest the team to reconsider branding of the tools as 'Visio' is a diagram software by Microsofts. When I first read the title of the proposal, I got the impression that this proposal is related of using visio software (as a Visio user myself, it's a flowchart & diagram tool and it might give the wrong impression to others).

It suggests that Cardano does not have proper high-speed analytics platforms for the NFT userbase. A tool like this will help Cardano NFT holders to look into the analytics of different NFT projects and make better investment decisions. The proposed solution to this idea is to create an NFT analytics platform. This will include different tools within the platform to help different types of NFT holders in the Cardano community and to hopefully provide analytic tools that can help each individual.

The Hoskinson quote shows that there is a definite need for a proper NFT ecosystem on Cardano. The NFT space in general is still very young. Being able to establish proper tools and applications that can aid in a user's NFT experience is important for a crypto ecosystem. Other chains (like Ethereum) are far and away more advanced when it comes to the amount of tools and features that exist for their NFT ecosystem. Cardano must begin development of these types of applications if they want to grab a piece of that $25B market share. \n\nWith that being said, I believe your proposal here needs some help. I like the idea and the reason to push for this ide but in the solution section I would like to see more specific details on what Visio will look like. Where will the data be pulled from? What APIs will be used to aggregate said data? There are statements about developing a platform that is akin to Icytools.io, but there is no explanation of you will accomplish this within the Cardano blockchain. I understand that in your timeline you make mention to the front-end and back-end code that will be used for the application which is great!

It appears every detail has been accounted for. This proposal accounts for both the building of the application and the marketing of it.
