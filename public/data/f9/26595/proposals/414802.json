As this will be the beginning for other projects to refer to and improve to suit the conditions in Africa.\nThey also list risks, but the biggest risk is how to work with all stakeholders when building the system, they don't mentioned it.

The criteria are relatively clear, but they have not provided a way to report to the community. I think they shoudl provide  weekly report as well as give Github of this project (they are giving Github of another training project).", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2945", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9483, "q0": "I rank this section a 4 because it is an honest effort to thoroughly encourage adoption in a area that is centrally important to Cardano. Admittedly, I do a little work for the proposal to quantify the impacts for myself, which I think the proposer should be doing if another round is needed. While it could be argued that this proposal serves limited impacts by exclusively serving Cameroon (at least for now), this region is the 16th highest population in Africa with about 26 million inhabitants. Cameroon also has one of the highest literacy rates in Africa, so there\u2019s a lot of potential for advancements in education about cryptocurrency. It also has a very central location in Africa, adgacent to Nigeria. So, there\u2019s a lot of potential for the advancement of Cardano on a global stage, if this proposal can successfully drive adoption. With what I\u2019m given in this proposal, I do feel like I\u2019m missing a few features that are essential for making this idea work. First, the indication of a DEX means that a XAF stablecoin will need to be created if this project is to operate entirely on blockchain (which is information that is minimally explained in this proposal). There isn\u2019t a whole lot of information given about the mechanics of the bridge portion of the proposal, where users can sell their XAF stables for XAF currency. Second, this type of DEX would require the use of an oracle, which this proposal does not indicate how it intends to implement that. I end up voting positively because the impact section displays real potential but I do think there needs to be more information provided about the logistical plans in the background and the security of adoption potential. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "For impressive capability demonstrated thorough experience, reputable partnership and a simply laid out plan, I rank this section a 4. I dismiss some of my concern that there is no blockchain development on this team because the collective experience on the team in software development and Haskell will probably enable easier adaptation. I also assume there\u2019s been some link to Plutus Pioneers but this information is not disclosed so I do not lend credit to that. I\u2019m rather enthusiastic about the secured partnership with a regional actor that has an established reputability in finance. The issue with this roadmap is that it does not provide a timeline for which this proposal is expected to reach completion. This will be important for voters to be able to evaluate the proposers capability to deliver in a reasonable timeframe AND that there is a sense of preplanned labor. The budget also doesn\u2019t match the requested funds, so there is a question of how much is being approved here, which can make the difference between an average priced proposal to a below average priced proposal (in this case). There is a $6k difference between the requested funds and the given budget. Furthermore, the budget also doesn\u2019t really demonstrate spending efficiency because it doesn\u2019t breakdown the proposal into hours of labor needed for each task. I\u2019m still inclined to vote positively because I think the strength in fundamentals points to reliable feasibility, which outweighs some of the little missing details. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "For minimally functional progress tracking mechanisms, I rank this section a 3. This section is an opportunity for the proposal to quantify the impacts of THIS proposal, not just the potential impacts of how many people COULD be affected. While the proposal does give 4 appropriate KPIs that will measure success of the project, it does not give voters a sense of what the proposal is aiming at for these metrics. It also doesn\u2019t really track usage (which is an essential element of success) by attempting to measure how many transaction take place with these services or how much ADA volume is facilitated by this service. I think these metrics need to be laid out and objectively defined by what the proposers want to see in terms of usage, so that there is a link to the potential impacts that could come out of this proposal. This will provide voters with a sense of worth, when evaluating the cost-benefits ratio. I can\u2019t actually do extra work for the proposers (nor can voters), so we need to be told what the team is doing to track, define, and enforce success.

As we know, most countries in Central Africa use CFA franc. However, there is no exchange currently supporting to convert between FCFA and Ada. A bridge Dex will allow more users in Central Africa (especially Cameroon) can get close to Cardano system. The team will integrate Cardano with the mobile money world.

The proposer well demonstrates Cameroon's potential environment where mobile money has grown dramatically through case studies explaining the features and popularity of these services there. By contrast, cryptocurrencies are still suffering from some prejudice due to fraud by utilizing local communities' ignorance. Since then, Wada Cameroon Hub DITC has logically proposed a plan to build a bridge between the mobile money industry and the Cardano blockchain to take full advantage of its strengths. It is an ambitious and risky strategy as the new paradigm and the adoption curve will be steep. That project is practical and brings direct benefits, surpassing existing forms to attract users when operating on the criteria of providing local communities serviceable and usable interfaces to interact with their finances. Also, that bridge answers the concerns of conversion between ADA and local currencies, and the applicability of ADA. DEX has demonstrated simplicity and flexibility to facilitate the integration of the Cardano, the mobile money industry, and the FCFA. Moreover, the proposal provided an overview of the four component categories (digital token, liquidity pool, partners micro-finance institutions, and mobile money operator) and their activities and functions to facilitate the best condition for the project to become feasible in Cameroon. In addition, I highly appreciate their strategy in ensuring its growth through \u201cinitially selling digital tokens to microfinance institutions and call box operators kiosks\u201d. However, I believe it would be better if the proposal could connect the system features to Cardano to show its alignment and contribute to the ecosystem in the missing aspects. Besides, although the integration platform of Cardano and the mobile money world in Cameroon has been stated in detail, I recommend the proposal mention some KPIs/metrics (number of total users, number of interactions to bridge DEX in some vital phases). Regarded the challenge destination, the proposal provided its risks logically and matched the problem statement when mentioning the suspicious attitude to cryptocurrencies and liquidity pool scarcity. I consider the solutions (a strong marketing campaign to raise awareness of blockchain and fraud, securing a partnership with a few microfinance institutions in the launch phase, and their one after) to solve the problem from the root impeding the future success of the project.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I appreciate the proposal connecting a detailed plan to the problems raised in the IMPACT section. However, while the proposal well suggests solutions based on the available support and operational strategy, it would have been better if the proposer could add a detailed timeline and milestones of the achievement. Furthermore, those should be associated with the mission of each team member to increase the assurance of community sponsorship. Moreover, I wonder why the proposal mentioned identified 5 phases to complete our project, but it only met three ones? In the HR section, the multilingual staff (4 people) with quite strong experience (+3 years) in multi-field (software programming, education, and project coordination) will be able to create great success in Cameroon and expand the project to larger areas in the future. Besides, even though the provided budget breakdown has been relatively complete, there are still some holes that the proposal needs to enhance to increase its logic. First, I wonder why the cost for the Platform design & Implementation category is $12K which is not equal to the component cost in total ($2k+$2K+$12K+$1K+$1K=$18K). In addition, it will be better if the proposal can illustrate the expenses for each section (ex: project coordination cost will be used to pay Megan and organize some meetings and events in 2023). Second, I state that the proposal still does not mention the member in charge of the Marketing & Advertisement category and the activities to be carried out. Otherwise, if the experienced team members in coordinating events and education can undertake, I suppose the proposal should mention directly and in more detail. Finally, although the staff structure is relatively complete to start, the team still does not have an expert in the blockchain field playing a pivotal role in connecting mobile money industries to Cardano. In conclusion, budget breakdown and HR destination should be presented and well-aligned to a detailed plan.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "First, the proposal already provides good criteria to track the project (such as the number of microfinance institutions, mobile money call box operators, design and architecture documents, and commits count). I suggest adding KPIs/metrics and exact numbers to measure its development (ex: in phase 3, there will be 1000 people accessing the service of DEX). Besides, how long/when to achieve these criteria and how the community can monitor their project are also good questions that the proposal can consider. Overall, the proposal provided a general description of the future success, but I think they could have described it in more detail and impact to attract the best funding.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_4110", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Auditability: I disagree that KPI have to be quantitative as the guideline specificaly ask not to use numbers to describe what succes will look like for us: On the submission form it reads: \"The metrics you measure do not necessarily have to be KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), which are numerical performance indicators - you can also measure qualitative things, such as the opinions of your users.\n\n\n\n"}], "solution": "Build a bridge DEX to facilitate the conversion between FCFA to ADA leveraging the opportunities offered by mobile money agencies.", "experience": "Wada Cameroon Hub DITC developer team, local mobile money call box operators, Wada marketing team"}
