The integration with Cardano blockchain is the requirement of those wanting to pre-purchase the game to first purchase FT\u2019s, or stake in Gaia for same FT\u2019s to buy the game.  Later the goal is to have the option of using ADA to purchase the game.  It is not specified, but presumably every physical card has a corresponding fungible token owners gain use Cardano to access, meeting the challenge requirements for physical products \u201cPhysical products - Number of products tokenised as a native asset\u201d.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I agree the proposed plans and budget seem feasible to deliver.\nNote that the website https://frostloregames.com/roadmap provided for the game is inactive as of the time I write this review, so the roadmap and card gallery mentioned are not visible.  However some of the cards are visible on NFT marketplaces.\n\nGiven the simplicity of blockchain aspects of this proposal - merely minting FT\u2019s to correspond with the number and picture of the physical cards, the technical hurdle is small and should be easily achievable by the team experience provided.\n\nThe team have the artwork aspect of the game under control as evidenced by existing cards for sale on NFT marketplaces.\n\nThe budget and timeline appear sufficient to complete the proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I agree the proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\nThe proposal gives a timeline of dates for artwork completion and printing of the physical cards which can both be evidenced readily along with receipts.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2942", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you so much for taking the time to read our proposal and give feedback! Our website was down for a short period of time and unfortunately it looks like that was when you were doing your assessment. The issue was remedied within a day of notice, so if you have the time and would like to have another look it is back up :)"}, {"id": 9740, "q0": "The proposal is quite unique and takes a different approach at the gaming and NFTs that are currently integrating with Cardano. One of the benefits of integrating NFTs with a physical card game is that it can help onboard new users to the blockchain. This is because the card game can provide a real world use case for blockchain technology, which can help new users understand how the technology works. In addition, integrating NFTs with a physical card game can also add a real world use case for blockchain technology, which can help to increase its adoption. If the proposal is implemented successfully, they have an opportunity to onboard a whole community into the blockchain space. The community of people who are into physical card games is large and growing, and utilizing cardano has the opportunity to innovate the space which in turn would likely bring in new projects and developers wanting to duplicate their success.  \n\nOn the other hand, if the integration is not done well, it could result in a loss of users and a decrease in adoption. This is because if the card game is not fun or is not easy to use, people will not want to play it. In addition, if the card game is not integrated well with the blockchain, it could result in users not understanding how to use the blockchain or how to access their NFTs. Therefore, it is important that the integration is done well in order to maximize the benefits.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal is unique and innovative. These are good attributes for any proposal, but can add certain problems for the team to successfully implement their idea. For one since there is not another project on cardano that is currently doing what the proposal laid out means there is no definitive roadmap for them to follow. This means they will need to create key infrastructure to be successful. This will mean having to create platforms the will leverage cardanos smart contract and NFT infrastructure, and it is not clear that the proposer has the experience is assembling the right team to accomplish this. I believe they will need to bring in at least one experienced developer and one person who has experience in marketing and working with supply chains, maybe a veteran Amazon seller, to have a much better chance of success. Otherwise with such a small budget, they could burn through that money very fast if things are not executed very smoothly. The proposal is going to be underfunded, and their timeframe needs to take into account the scope of the project. They would benefit from breaking the proposal into a few more funding rounds, unless they are getting funding from a source not disclosed in the proposal.\nWith these things kept in mind, the proposal is well laid out, and the idea is explained quite well to the voter. They do list quite a few issues they foreseen may come into play, and like with anything worth doing there are risks. They do a good job at addressing most of these issues. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal lists a webpage that links to a roadmap for the community to follow. It would have been nice to see the information directly in the proposal itself, especially since the roadmap isn't very detailed and would not have taken much time to include in the proposal itself. However the proposer claims they were successfully voted for in previous funding rounds but the funds ran out before their proposal could receive funding. The team has completed some work on the proposal since those funding rounds, and it would then appear the community was happy with their style of accountability. They also commit to updating the community auditors with important information that would defiantly help track progress of the proposal. This is a very innovative and exciting proposal and in my opinion its a shame the proposal received the votes yet was still unable to get funded. The proposal would be much further along, and I believe the team has the experience now to understand what the community expects from them.

Also the team budget should be well-prepared for the hike in shipping cost. The team estimated budget of $52,500 would definitely need some buffer for order fulfillment. The timeline of this project looks feasible. The founder (Brian Lee) and co-founder (Lisa Lee) are passionate gamers making this a passion project. They are very much involved within Cardano ecosystem and run GAIA stake pool (part of Climate Neutral Cardano Group) so it's natural that they would make a donation to these great causes.
