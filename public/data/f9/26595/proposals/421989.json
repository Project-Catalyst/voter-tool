For the record, the quality of this proposal is not reflective of the perceived level of sophistication found on the DigiRack website, so I would advise voters to give that a look. Still, this proposal is filled with general one-liners that introduce different ideas about this NFT marketplace without actually explaining the impact or the mechanics behind this project. Starting with the problem statement, the laid out issues that this proposal aims to solve are either not an issue related to NFTs OR is an issue that already has a solution in the status quo. Starting with the identified lack of \u201csufficient liquidity making it difficult for users to sell their NFTs\u201d that is not an issue for the NFT industry because the buying/selling mechanics of NFTs is driven by market demand NOT by supplied liquidity for swapping/trading assets (like DEXs, lending/borrowing, and other DeFi mechanisms). To this proposals credit, the website does indicate a NFT loan feature on this platform but the proposal doesn\u2019t make the link between these two things by explaining the background mechanics. The only explained feature that is related to liquidity is the proposed \u201cliquidity insurance\u201d for projects that utilize their launchpad which requires those projects to lock a portion of their mint sales for an undisclosed purpose and amount of time (which may very well end up being a liability to the launchpads succes). It\u2019s not clear what liquidity is being insured or what it\u2019s being insured against, so I\u2019m not so sure that this is a worthwhile feature OR that the term \u201cliquidity\u201d is being used/meant correctly. As far as the other issue of fake/copycat NFTs, the proposed solution of collection verification is already a widely adopted feature in Cardano NFTs and is not unique to this proposal. Aside from lack of articulated impacts, there is also a lack of quantifiable magnitude that gives voters a sense of how big the potential impacts could be and why those impacts are worth $39.5k. This proposal aims to enter a highly competitive market that is well saturated with a lot of existing NFT marketplaces that are struggling to find success, as well as a plethora of NFT marketplaces that are building to enter this oversaturated field. There\u2019s a lot of explanation that needs to be added to this proposal but I think this proposal could benefit from a reframing of the problem statement to something like \u201cthere is not currently an \u2018all-in-one\u2019 NFT marketplace that services all NFT services on Cardano.\u201d ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I rank this section a 2 for unclear demonstrative experience and unjustified spending. The point on unjustified spending is NOT because the allocated budget is unreasonable but because this proposal does not give a clear indication on why this proposal needs a \u201csmart contract developer\u201d or a \u201cmobile UI.\u201d If there are open-source NFT purchasing smart contracts (which there is), there would not be a need for a smart contract developer to spend 180 hours developing one unless there is something unique that is intended to be developed. This could easily be the case, but the proposal just doesn\u2019t disclose what that uniqueness is for voters to be able to understand the need for this expense. For the Mobile UI development, the proposal doesn\u2019t mention anything in regards to a mobile app and the website only has a graphic with the marketplace displayed on a mobile device, so there isn\u2019t any available rhetoric for voters to understand this need either. The hourly rates are very confusing as it indicates $55/hr (which translates to $107k/yr - already well above industry standard) but at the end of the budget it indicates $150/hr. The former calculation appears to add up more accurately but the spending overall is not justified without the task/feature rationale. The very small core development team may be of concer to voters as well because the sole developer on the team only has about 2 years of developer experience, plus the CEO doesn\u2019t provide a LinkedIn profile. This section of the proposal is also missing a roadmap, which does not show voters any evidence of planned actionable steps. Overall, this section is not ready for voter evaluation. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There\u2019s a level of vagueness in this auditiibility section that doesn\u2019t leave voters with a clear sense of measurable KPIs and objective definitions of success that leads me to rank this section a 2. I REALLY appreciate the attempt to set milestone goals for different timeframes in the life of the project because this is a feature missing from most Catalyst proposals. I just think they need more alignment with each other and further development on other KPIs. The most confusing part about what\u2019s here is the different metrics that are presented at each timeframe. This milestone layout works much better if the KPIs are aligned to measure the same metrics at each timeframe and the different target numbers that are being aimed at each juncture. This gives voters a sense of intended progress in thoroughly advancing specific aspects of this proposal. I also think there\u2019s more room to add additional KPIs such as ADA volume traded on the platform, the amount of transitions traded throught the marketplace, the number of NFT projects that sign up for the launchpad, website traffic and other post-proposal based metrics. I think this section is a great start with more development needed on content.

As the solution, the proposer states that owners can bundle their NFTs, will have an option to offers (for ADA or NFTs), and fake NFTs will be scanned by digital AI for verification. Further, there is also mention of a DigiRack token, DigiRack Launchpad, and some feature called \u201cNFT Liquidity insurance\u201d. As a user or NFT marketplaces, I must say that all features are already implemented\u2026e.g., verification of collections (which should prevent from fake NFTs), offers (receive or send), and bundles are also available. From this perspective, I am afraid that this proposal is another NFT marketplace, and actually is not really standing out comparing to the existing marketplaces. The only difference is the \u201cinsurance\u201d feature, which is not having a clear description. For some reason, a project launching on the DigiRack launchpad will lock a portion of their raised amount for liquidity insurance \u2013 but for what purpose? What will happen with this ADA? Is it to prevent them from raising ADA and fleeing? Or how it actually benefits traders? This part is not very clear, and example could have been used. Based on all the information above, plus the fact that I am not really confident that a new marketplace would gain such a traction (there is nothing to suggest it would), when there are already multiple strong competitors, I am afraid that the impact will not be so high. On the other hand, the demo provided is really in a good quality, and visually appealing, ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The roadmap is completely missing in the proposal, and we can only see the total hours spend on the backend 500 hours and 300 hours frontend without any milestones or a time schedule. So we do not know whether it is a project planned for a month of simultaneous works, two or three months, or more. On their website is a roadmap, but without additional information, we can not actually match the hours with the milestones on the roadmap. Next, there is a negotiated hourly rate (which is unclear with who it was negotiated, since slightly below in the proposal is mentioned that new people will be hired). The total budget is 39 500 USD, which is divided to four big items \u2013 Smart contract development, Front end, Back end, Mobile UI (so now we know that there will be also a mobile app). The proposers state, that the development team hourly rate is 150 dollars per hour, but it is unclear how this figure is made up. Regarding the team, there is a CEO with a twitter link (I found his linked in in their webpage) with history as software dev or mobile dev. Another member of a proposal is actually a company developing NFT marketplaces. I have tried to find more information about this company, but actually there is no proof of previous products, whatsoever, thus it is not really convincing. I was also digging more and I came across a presale of their token, where the minimum buying ada was set to 500, which decreased my confidence even more.  Overall, the proposal appears to be bright and shiny, but there is too many gaps and questions that has not been answered. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "In this section, the proposer state that it will be easy to be tracked and audited by the community, because they will plan to provide updates as the milestones are met. Well, since the roadmap on the webpage is by quartiles, we actually can audit only after 3 months, which is a long time. Regarding the success metrics \u2013 they plan to have hundreds of NFTs traded daily, five thousands of active members and having the traction within the Cardano space. Well, I guess we can track the amount of addresses trading on the marketplace, even the volume of ADA can be a useful metric. Since there is also a launchpad intended, the number of projects launched should be measured as well. I think that generally speaking it can be audited, but the biggest drawback is missing milestones with the expected time schedule. Also for media, the twitter appears to be dead \u2013 last post on May 30th.

By increasing security while also bringing additional utility, they can become a market leader down the road if their solution is impactful enough.
