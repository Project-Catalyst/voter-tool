This proposal intends to make a zero-knowledge (zk) enabled module that is complete with APIs called Know Zero that other developers can use to integrate zk into their services. I like the idea because it allows other developers to integrate zk into their project without having to fully learn the nitty gritty details that are the foundations of zk. This concept is directly in line with the challenge setting because it will allow for the improvement of many DApps and products \u2013 when developers can integrate this module into their product, people\u2019s data will be even more secure and private. I think that this proposal falls under the integrations part of the challenge setting DApps, Products, and Integrations. Zk will most likely play a big role in the future of the internet (web 3.0), so I see this proposal having a big impact for many DApps and products in the future. The proposers already built a similar zk module for healthcare, so they do not anticipate any issues or major roadblocks when implementing this proposal. I did not have any issues with the proposal with regards to impact, so I can give it a rating of 5 for impact. (score given: 5) ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "After reading the proposal, I believe that it can be successfully implemented by the proposers. The proposers listed a very solid roadmap that has all of the tasks they will complete over the next six months if they are funded. The first month involves systems analysis and design. Months 2-4 involve developing the backend and front end components. The 5th month involves testing, release of the alpha, and the development of the SDK. In the 6th month, the proposers plan to release the 1.0 version of the module, integrate it to the website, and release the SDK. I think that all of these tasks seem reasonable to complete in the planned time frame. Roughly three months for the bulk of the development definitely makes sense since that is the most important step to get right. \n\nI also have confidence in the team behind this proposal and believe that they can achieve these milestones because they are a part of Team Hippocrades. Not only have they been finalists in a recent Cardano blockchain challenge, but they also have prior experience building zero-knowledge. The core tech team consists of 10 people, but they also have outside experts, advisors, and consultants who they can call on to provide advice when needed. The three leads for this project (Trista, Joff, and Nad) have many years of experience with coding, web development, systems analysis & design, and zero-knowledge cryptography protocols. Based on the many skills listed in the proposal, I think they are fully capable of making this project happen successfully. \n\nThe proposers also had a well-laid out budget. The pay rates were broken down by the role of the person on the team. For example, the project lead will be paid $1,500 a month for 6 months, leading to a total of $9,000. There were also pay rates listed for the two senior backend devs, the two front end devs, and the systems analyst and designer. The overall budget of $54,000 seems reasonable for the scope of this project since it will involve a lot of time and effort from the team. Since this proposal will last 6 months, I think it makes sense to compensate the team accordingly.\n\nSince I did not have any critiques for feasibility, I can give this proposal a score of 5 for feasibility. (score given: 5)\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "\nBased on the information provided in the proposal, I don't know if there is enough information to audit the success and progress of this project \u2013 my opinion could fall either way, and I\u2019ll explain why. The proposers listed some guiding principles for development, such as stable code, simple code, testable code, team velocity, and knowledge sharing as ways to audit success. While these are decent metrics, I feel that they could have included some other KPIs, such as number of integrations made with the software and number of people making use of the software. These metrics would really show the Cardano community that the proposal was successful in building their zk-module for other devs to use. Having some metrics to show the end use of the project is always a good idea, especially since this proposal is for the Cardano community. The proposers did explain that they will keep the community updated via a GitHub page where they will have all tasks and deliverables that are marked as pending, ongoing, or done, so it should be easy to tell if tasks are being completed on time. I think that the GitHub page is a great idea, however, there was no example or link provided to the GitHub page. I assume it was not created yet, but it would have helped me better rate auditability if I could see what the GitHub page would look like. The final outcome of this proposal, according to the proposers, is to have the product deployed on the website (knowzero.org) and have it available for devs to use. Only then will the proposal be completed.\n\nSince this proposal did not have many end-product related KPIs/metrics of success or a link to a GitHub page as an example, it is hard for me to say whether the proposal will be fully auditable. I would need more information to come to a better conclusion. In the future, I would recommend that the proposers add some more specific KPIs related to the final product and also list even just an example of their GitHub page if it isn\u2019t created yet.

As a result, ZKP technology is successfully opening up a wide range of institutional use cases for previously inaccessible public blockchain networks, encouraging innovation and creating a global economy more effective.\nThe proposed solution has solved this problem, the method of rigorous reasoning. The solution is to build a zero-knowledge module with APIs so that it is easy to build private applications that will generate zk-proofs and be stored in the Cardano blockchain.

The team that developed Nightingale, has a built-in ZK module, some of which have also been funded in Catalyst. I have an opinion that the application of ZK to a blockchain is still new and one of the challenges facing is the absence of uniform standards, systems and languages. ZK protocols are often based on complex mathematical equations. Therefore, they require a large amount of computing power to operate and compute.
