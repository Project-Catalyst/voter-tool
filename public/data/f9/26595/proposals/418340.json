This proposal wants to reduce the complexity the average user can experience when interacting with DeFi and general investments in the crypto ecospace. The proposers have identified an area that is in dire need of improvement, and the proposal is impactful in that regard. \nOne thing that is not entirely clear after reading the proposal is how strong of a coupling the DEX Trackr will have to Cardano. Will this solution be exclusive to Cardano or do you intend to expand this solution to multiple blockchains from the start, or even down the road?\nEither way, the solution aligns very well with the Dapp challenge setting and overall the solution is regarded highly impactful.

The detailed plan is split up in monthly increments which clearly outlines what tasks are to be performed in each increment. The whole project is estimated to consume 6 months of work before launch. Estimates are very hard but the proposers are experienced and the plan is rigorous, so the conclusion is that it is feasible in this regard. Furthermore, the budget is clearly outlined with a monthly wage, this strengthens their claim of the 49,500 USD budget. The rates are very reasonable as well. As a conclusion, the feasibility of this project should be regarded very high given the proposers experience and rigorous plan.

The budget allocation is calculated based on the number of months worked and the amount for each month. However, I think you should split the budget further. For example: clearly define the number of working hours, the number of people involved in the work, the amount per hour, etc. That will make the budget more transparent.

The proposed solution is to build a platform to track and manage Defi portfolios. The app is connected to multiple DEX, token pairs, groups, and productivity farms across the Cardano blockchain. The solution given has a good impact on users and investors, we need such an application. Too much work affects memory, we won't be able to keep track of our private oil payments regularly, the proposal that solved this problem helps us. The proposal to create a simple, easy-to-use platform that can manage all Defi investments when connecting Wed3 wallets (Nami, Flint etc.), is really great, imagine you're sitting down for coffee or doing something while still being able to keep track of your assets investing. This will bring the best returns to users and investors. The proposed solution is in line with the development of the Cardano ecosystem, investors participate in using the application, they are assured of the investment and ADA transactions will increase on DEX. Increasing the number of users is also an opportunity to introduce Cardano to them, which helps investors get ready for the best solutions that are to invest in ADA and join the Cardano ecosystem. The author argues that there will be no difficulty when implementing, we see there have been positives in marketing to attract users when doing the first month for free, the application is widely introduced. The marketing has minimized the risk of not reaching the desired number of users using the app. We have an opinion on some risks such as: The security of the application when we connect the wallet to the application, to minimize this the author needs to build a good security system of the application. The second is the risk of the application being able to provide delayed information to users due to network latency, we need to calculate the latency between connections using the methods \"End to End\" or \"Peer to peer\" to have a method to minimize this risk. We look forward to the author having an effective method of minimizing the two risks we present.\nI rated: 4\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan fully implements the content of the work to be solved, there are specific timelines completed.

Visual design is that UI/UX construction research is also conducted. Front-end and back-end programming is done in the 5th month. The content of the plan is logical with the implementation solution of the proposal. We also see that communication and marketing to users helps the application get more users when completed. As stated above, we have not yet seen the plan to build security for wed, and the plan to develop an internet connection, we look forward to the author adding this part.
