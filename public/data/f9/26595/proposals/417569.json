While CIP-30 exists, implementing an easy to use layer on top of this with React would be useful to other dev teams.", "f6_no_assessments": 6, "f6_rating": 4.388888888888889, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 6676, "q0": "NewM will be a decentralized music ecosystem, a marketplace where artists can monetize and take control of their work. The team behind the project has great development plans and they are betting big on Catalyst funding, since this is one of their five Fund 9 proposals funding the core of the project, for a total of 480k USD, and an additional proposal seeking funding for an open source project that will indirectly benefit NewM. \n\nThis proposal seeks funding for developing an open source wallet connector in order to make it easier for any dapp to connect with existing wallets (eternl, yoroi, nami, typhon, etc.). In technical terms the team proposes to add a React layer on top of CIP-30. As a reminder, this challenge is all about supporting the creation of new decentralized applications and integrations between them, so there is a very good connection between the proposal and the challenge since we have the perfect example of an integration feature here. Let\u2019s go through the project in a bit more detail. \n\nFor a better understanding of the subject it\u2019s necessary first of all to put things into a wider context - and that is to understand the great potential of the music royalties market. More than a decade ago the industry was suffering due to extensive piracy, but in the last years the industry has begun to grow again, due mainly to online streaming and its advantages compared to the old distribution channels: convenience, personalization, accessibility. Therefore the music industry is generating constant revenue every year, and there is even a school of thought that considers the royalties associated with it to be an asset class of its own. Barron\u2019s estimates that US annual royalty revenues to be over 40 billion USD, while the proposers estimate the overall market for at over 1 trillion USD (a bit optimistic let\u2019s say). The main idea being that the music royalties market has a great potential to tap into, and gaining even a small market share from the overall pie is going to be a very lucrative business in the long run. \n\nThere is also a very good scalability potential behind the project, since after the development phase, the marginal cost of servicing an additional artist, an additional NFT or an additional smart contract are negligible in comparison to the high margins ubiquitous among the industry. \n\nWhy is this building the wallet connector? Because having an open source off-the-shelf solution for connecting a dapp to non-custodial wallets can be seen as a staple functionality for the Cardano ecosystem, with so much potential to make the life easier for any future dapp in need of this functionality.  \nIn conclusion, NewM has excellent development prospects, can be a tremendous asset for the Cardano community in the long run, and this proposal is very well aligned with the challenge since the entire dapp ecosystem can benefit from this feature if developed.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A first excellent point relevant for the proposal\u2019s feasibility is that the proposal is complemented by a white paper in which the concept and business model are presented in great detail, and the writers go to great lengths to ensure that no details are left out. There are extensive descriptions of the functionalities of the marketplace, the utilities of the token they wish to launch as well as how the DAO accompanying the marketplace will function. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about the team. Ryan, the CEO, has a very deep understanding of the music industry, can articulate extremely well the value proposition that NewM can bring and he is also in charge of developing partnerships. Florian, the finance guy, was instrumental at the beginning, since he was the one that shaped the business model. Andrew, the CTO and security guy, has a long track record of delivering open source tools to the Cardano community, amongst other the development of a Cardano node CLI tool (command line interface). Including advisors, they have onboarded in excess of 30 members, very diverse in their backgrounds and a fairly geographically distributed team. All of them are presented on their website with links to their profiles (and what music they listen to, of course). So there\u2019s a solid team behind the project. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about funding sources and financial viability. Right now the team self-funds the development of NewM, and they are securing additional funding through their own stakepool. A strength of NewM\u2019s business model (once it launches) is that it will not be reliant on just one stream for revenues - from the beginning the marketplace will focus on two separate sources of revenue: a streaming component trying to give established streaming companies a run for their money and a marketplace component focused on fractionalizing and distributing intellectual property rights as NFTs. In the whitepaper we are also offered a breakdown of their token distribution, which will begin modestly in 2022 and will continue until 2027. In conclusion, in addition to Catalyst, NewM will have various revenue streams, another excellent indication of the project\u2019s good feasibility prospects. \n\nThe roadmap is split into three milestones: (1) Implement CIP-30 as a React component, (2) perform an internal audit of the code and (3) document and open source the functionality. This is as far as the details of the project take us - however I can\u2019t really fault it much since the scope of the project is very straightforward and it will be a while label solution in the end, available for the entire ecosystem. But the minimum of information that could have been added to the milestones is perhaps the time necessary for each of them - since right now this is not clear. Judging from their other proposals, I can only assume that a milestone is equivalent to a month, thus implying a three months project, but this is only my assumption. \n\nThe budget is lightly sketched, and we are only informed the development will necessitate 80 hours of work charged at 250 USD/h. Again, given the straightforward scope of the project it can be understandable that the budget details end here. \n\nThe roadmap and the budget are definitely lacking the necessary pieces of information required for an excellent proposal, but judging the overall context (open source solution proposed, limited scope, modest budget, great team, great project) I am indulgently offering five stars for feasibility. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team is in the right spot to ensure full auditability of the project. They have already set-up community engagement tools (Discord, Telegram, Twitter, etcetera) and are frequently present on podcasts (Learn Cardano for instance). The founders are making themselves available within these channels and are actively engaging in discussions with the community when being queried regarding the details of the project (I have firsthand experience on this). We have therefore good reasons to believe that the Cardano community will be in a good position to interact with the team, as they are connected to the ecosystem in more than one way. \n\nTheir development of the wallet integration solution will be open source. We are also informed that the team pledges to keep an open library of GitHub Commits as well as offering bi-weekly performance indicator updates and weekly progress summary via twitter. \n\nThe only minor caveat I can think of is that, from a security standpoint, it would have been beneficial if the project included in its scope a third party review of the code on top of the internal quality control. But besides this point, we have excellent auditability prospects for the project.

However, it is also necessary to calculate the number of errors and processing time. Proposal to apply for $20,000 but the costs for each item were not explained.

With the ability to build on top of CIP-30, the team has a framework to build on. The fact there is already infrastructure in place gives the proposal a much greater chance of success. There is little that would hinder the success of this proposal and this is also something the proposer understands. The team has an extensive background and this is very important for the longevity of a project like this. One thing the proposal could have improved on is adding more information to the proposal itself. I believe many voters will not take the time to watch videos and visit other websites so it is important to make the information in the proposal itself as detailed as possible.

This could be a bit more detailed by breaking down the milestones in a more detailed manner. The proposal will be working on things that the end user will ultimately be able to interact with, so if the community gets involved with the project it will be a great way to track the progress of the proposal. They will be adding usability features to a component that most people interacting with the cardano blockchain will use and that is wallets. So this fact alone will be a good measure of progress.

This would create a standard wallet connector that would then make it more straightforward to connect with existing wallets in the market and thus, will reduce frictions amongst the Cardano ecosystem.

I can imagine that the described React layer makes it even easier for developers, but the team itself says \"CIP-30 has been implemented several times by many dApps out there\". The severity of the problem that is being addressed here is therefore limited. So, does the project have a positive impact? It could well be, but whether it is particularly significant is open to question: There are some instructions on how to connect wallets. What is being done here is technically relatively trivial.\nIn total, only 80 working hours are estimated for the project. This is certainly sufficient and depends on which wallets are to be connected. Specifically, \"eternl, gero yoroi, nami, and typhon wallet\" are mentioned here. However, the proposal also wants to address additional wallets that will be supported as soon as they become available.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Since the project is only about 2 weeks of work, it was decided not to define an exact schedule. Instead, there are 3 milestones. After the completion of the project, the team reserves the right to write applications again for later funding rounds and to integrate further wallets. The team is seemingly technically well positioned, and the references indicate that an implementation is quite realistic.\nHowever, I have a problem with the assumed hourly rate of 250USD/h. I understand that developers in different regions have different costs, but I think this amount is absurdly high for a project that is supported by the community. Especially since this is a relatively simple implementation. What is being proposed here is anything but complicated. 20,000 USD for 2 weeks of work by a frontend developer is, in my opinion, hardly in line with Catalyst's goals. Things might be different if there was a bit more detail about why such an expensive professional is needed. Instead, the proposers themselves say \"This project has very low risk.
