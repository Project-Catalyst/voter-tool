The issuance of NFTs provide content creators with the ability to create their own marketplace and sell their product directly to their target audience. Affiliations with sporting industry professional allude to endless possibilities of marketing rare sports moments into blockchain collectibles. This project significantly addresses an unmet need of the content creation community, and has high potential to be a vehicle for innovation and adoption, aligning perfectly with this challenge setting.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team promises undeniable success and it is hard to argue otherwise. At an asking price of only 25k, the combination of feasibility and value are truly remarkable. A series of short, but extremely well produced videos demonstrate a fully operational pay wall with a beautiful interface. A link can be found here. \n\nHaving successfully completed past funded Catalyst projects and awarded funding on three prior occasions, the development team are seasoned and capable. Deqree, Rarety.io and Cardsec are listed accomplishments and the team also features a lead Plutus developer from Gimbalabs. With these credentials and detailed roadmap in hand, successful implementation is all but assured.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Extremely clear and easily attainable metrics highlight the KPIs created to facilitate the evaluation of progress and success of this project. Numbers of projects, transactions, attached wallets and volume of Ada transacted are elements of a well designed tracking system facilitating ease of audit. Adherence to the timeline indicated on a detailed roadmap provides an additional measure of progress. Lastly, Discord viewership and membership data provide nearly every measurable data point across a matrix of accountability specified in this proposal.

Ultimately, adoption \u2013 transition from innovator and early adopter to early majority and late majority phases \u2013 depends on the provision of utility to end users.  People will be drawn to the blockchain that enables them to DO things safely with the least friction. IMPACT: This proposal fits within the challenge problem.\nProposal Clarity & Fit (5): The proposers seek to build a pay-walled NFT marketplace on the existing Rarity.io, a multi-sig NFT launchpad.. The platform includes a tool for creators to upload content and distribute it in the form of tradeable NFTs.  The platform accepts NFTs in a variety of media (e.g. images, video).  Buyers can then access NFTs through the paywall. Users interact through a web interface and directly linking a browser based Cardano wallet. Additionally, the platform will support subscription models, allowing for serial distribution models.  This proposal fits within the challenge.   \nCardano Impact (5): This project is consistent with the general vision of functional blockchains with applications that DO things. In present centralized systems, content platforms like YouTube or Patreon enable creators to build profitable businesses. While this implementation does not feature advertising revenue, it still enables monetization of content distribution by creators.  The attraction of content creators to applications like this will raise the profile of Cardano.  \nScalability (5): The team addresses scaling as the final phase in development. The plan includes API development and exploring both Djed integration and potential e-Commerce partnerships.  \nThe challenge presents the following KPIs: 1) increasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases, 2) Increase the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products, and 3) increased quality of existing products & integrations through suggested improvements that is supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community. A project would be successful under the challenge if it satisfies at least one of the conditions.  \nKPI Alignment (5): The KPIs are appropriate, quantifiable and consistent with the challenge.  \nAverage Impact Score (5). \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Experience Required and Fit of Team (5): While experience requirements are not specified, the team has experience in developing on Cardano.  They have previously been funded on Catalyst (3 projects/components).  Their prior projects include Degree, Rarity.io, and Cardsec. The team is specified by name with roles identified. One of the team members is a Plutus developer with GimbaLabs. The team also includes a marketing specialist.  \nImplementation Plan & Budget (5):  The timeline projects development across a 3-month horizon, with completion projected for October 2022.  The budget is reasonable. The project is sufficiently narrow that the both the time horizon and budget are reasonable to ensure completion. Milestones are presented with an order of execution.  \nTechnically Sound (5): The project is communicated with examples of use cases, and videos and text describing user interactions.\nRisk Awareness & Mitigation (4): The proposers identify a risk associated with new users who do not have existing wallets.  The proposers will mitigate by integrating an alternative payment method based on existing Web 2.0 systems.  \nAverage Feasibility Score (5). \n\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Roadmap, Milestones and Time Horizon (5): These elements are present.

They have used Github for prior projects but there is no mention in the proposal for use on this project.  The team does not mention periodic reporting.

While a paywall won't necessarily stop all instances of piracy, it should prove as a useful test case for the impact of such a system. Since NFTs are such a large part of the user-facing L1 experience, it's fair to say this proposal meets the standards laid out in the challenge, and is appropriately categorized.\n\nThe proposal does a good job of laying out what the team will be building through the use of videos, text, and illustrations, which should make it easy for non-technical voters to wrap their heads around. I'd like to see a little more information about how NFT-minter might be able to tweak and customize their paywall, since users are likely to have pretty diverse needs. \n\nI like that the proposal addresses potential issues with onboarding and user experience.

They are also targeting the film and music industry. An initiative like this can onboard new users via not just the athletes and artists, but their fans as well.

Since the proposer has timelines showing the months, he could have linked it to the budget. Instead of itemized budget items, they are grouped together and no unit costs are visible. The proposer should seek assistance from someone in an accounting background or someone with relevant experience in preparing the budget. The proposer can also look at successful proposals in previous funds to get an idea of what more or less makes up a good budget. \n\nAccording to the proposer, there are no risks that will prevent them from delivering the project successfully.

Addressing the challenge of targeting the non-crypto crowd by integrating conventional payment methods using on and off ramp crypto payment providers, is good. However, i dont think that should be the concern as of yet. Roadmap of progress is sufficient, but i think UI/UX testing should be done every month, a continous process. A key point to note, because this is essentially a NFT minting platform on the cardano blockchain, there are not many unique aspects of the project. What is to stop someone from choosing to list on Opensea, magic eden or some exchange marketplace. This platform has to have an enticing aspect such as low gas. Which wasn\u2019t really talked about in the deck.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There are already NFT minting platforms on cardano. Something unique to this particular project would be the accessibility for creators to earn from NFTs instead of a centralized provider such as youtuber which was quoted in the deck. The network of creators has to be extensive enough for this project to be profitable. Some things that were not talked about would be the business model. This paywall system, would still take a cut of the transaction fees and NFT minting fees etc right? How much would those amount to? Also, i get that you have direct access to powerful actors. But maybe listing an existing partnership or partnership to be would really help with accessing the success of this project. Looking at the advisors, one area that you guys would be targeting is likely sports famous personalities which quite afew are already in the NFT game. Having a wider spectrum of advisors would be great. In fields of music and art, would definitely value add to your vast number of connections.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Having a linktree would be great to get all your links together in one place for easy auditing/viewing purposes. I\u2019m doubting that community outreach and technical support would only cost $2000. For the famous personalities that you are onboarding, depending on their tier of popularity, it might cost quite abit. I would lump that under marketing which definitely amounts to more than $2k. However, $2k is a good start. The metrics to track the project\u2019s success looks realistic and accurate. More social media channels of the project can be added. Like i mentioned, the linktree. Telegram is a good way to advice people of your progress and its easily accessible from any mobile device. Something that would be a good direction to focus the project is to identify a niche for it. I mentioned bringing in more advisors of different fields but its good to start of with a niche in an area first which i would think is sports. It would be a hub for sports fan. Branching out from there would be a story not for now. That being said, i like that the UI is very clean and simple to use.
