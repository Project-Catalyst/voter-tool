The details here are very helpful in understanding the basis of the platform and it gives voters a thorough understand of what the final product might look like. The missing piece would be the sense of magnitude that this section provides with quantified impacts that appeal to adoption/retention of the Cardano ecosystem (ideally) or advancement of blockchain for humanitarian aims. To its credit, their website looks very polished and this proposal does mention that testing has been done under a web 2.0 model, so it\u2019s safe to assume that there is some foundation (in terms of adoption) that can be brought into the Cardano ecosystem. I think it would give voters greater tangibility to have numbers provided to them about how many people use this platform now, how many people find mentors through things like LinkedIn (problem statement can be quantified too), or other relevant data/research points about the status quo. Other than that, I think this proposal demonstrates real potential.

Many Cardano community members will be plenty excited to acknowledge that there is a healthy balance of female leadership on this team and (most importantly) an extraordinary roster of talent that is well equipped to take on this endeavor. My favorite part of this section is the roadmap that identifies different stages of the project with the various Catalyst funds (past, present & future) plugged in to the greater roadmap for this project. I expect voters to respond well to this disclosure, as there\u2019s no guessing about intentions to submit for additional Catalyst funding at different timeframes AND it provides some information about interactions with reputable partnerships. While it\u2019s clearly worked out for them thus far (and I expect the same results for this proposal), I would like to see a little more rationale on the budget. While the labor comes out to be surprisingly low (if we\u2019re assuming full-time hours), the budget doesn\u2019t thoroughly offer voters the ability to evaluate efficiency in spending by breaking down the hours allocated to each role. This is a very minor criticism but still may help future proposals secure greater voter confidence. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For only citing completion/redesign as a target for success, I rank this section a 4. I extend a little generosity on this section because the auditability for this project (as its fragmented across various proposals) is rather complex with different auditibility standards for each proposal. My usual criteria for putting central weight on platform usage isn\u2019t exactly fair for this proposal, since it handles a portion of the project that has nothing to do with usage. Plus, other cited Catalyst proposals include KPIs that target those metrics. In this case, I think the success metrics are perfectly appropriate for what this proposal aims to accomplish and the transparency helps me to see that there are no issues on this point of evaluation.

In addition, tracking the progress, I find it not suitable for this 3-month figure when the proponent started work from June 2022 and lasted until October 2022. Proponents should consider establishing a budget based on a table, detailing the items, multiplying workers by the required hours of work, and the expected time of completion.\nThe proposal also provided a very specific project completion schedule, with a roadmap lasting from June to October 2022 and outlined the next roadmap in FUnd 10 and FUnd 11 showing that the proposal has been finalized.\nResources to implement the proposal in addition to the amount of 36,500 USD proposed in Fund9, the team will use the tools AI mentor matching software and to produce a white paper modeling a Mentorship Incentivization DA set up from the previous Fund to complete.\nThe risks of the proposal have also been clearly mentioned, Risk of not delivering and Risk of not reaching the desired outcome, these are the risks that are most likely to happen and they also provided reasonable risk reduction options.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Proposal provided a specific and achievable Roadmap.
