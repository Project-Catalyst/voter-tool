I\u2019ll do my best to describe the situation, and leave it up to the voters to decide. From my understanding, this proposal is asking to be funded retroactively after having deployed the highly anticipated Cardano stablecoin (Djed) on the Milkomeda testate. They deployed it for the reason of preparing the community for it, and letting them educate themselves using Djed safely on the testnet to mitigate risks when it is released on the mainnet. \u2028And from what I understand, part of these funds will go to funding integrating Djed with the EVM blockchains, so not all of it is retroactive. \u2028\u2028These types of testing-periods of big inclusions to the Cardano ecosystem (like Died has the potential of being) is invaluable. That the community themselves can try things and learn how it works in a safe environment before proper implementation. The testing is not only made by developers, but does also invite the community (which in my opinion as PA is commendable). Milkomeda is one of the largest contributors to the Cardano ecosystem since a long time back, and if this would\u2019ve been a new project asking to be funded retroactively, the lesser amount of history and credibility would lean me towards thinking differently. But considering the proposer has such a positive track record working on the Cardano blockchain, I would (to my surprise as well) argue that it fits the challenge. No risks are needed to be presented, because the project is already completed. These improvements will significantly increase the experience of using Cardano, and the team has already shown that they intend to further develop the concept.\u2028\u2028What I would have liked to see is a detailed report or analysis of the findings from the development team and the community after experimenting with Djed on the testnet. \u2028\u2028I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team intends to develop and deploy an EVM-version of Djed on the Milkomeda testnet, with a web interface included (as stated in the proposal). I believe including a detailed plan for how this development works would benefit the proposal highly, even if the process is same as the earlier Djed-implementation. Milestones connected to a timeframe, etc. We know that development is planned for Q2, but will it end before Q3? \u2028\u2028The same goes for the budget breakdown. The proposer mentions that all funds were used for either core development or web interface development. Questions that I have liked to have answered: How many were working on what responsibility area? Did the developers work full time, or did they just have set amount of hours each day? What would the hourly wage be? \u2028\u2028There is not much information provided on exactly what team members that will be working with this. There is R&D lead mentioned for the previous project, but the proposer is another person, which is quite confusing. At the moment we don\u2019t know how many people that will be working on this, or have worked on this. And who they are. It is hard to say its impossible that this proposal won\u2019t be completed since its already done, but the quality level of the product should also be reflected in the proposal. Even if it is completed, just the inclusion of an analysis/report of the development would suffice, in my opinion as a PA. \n\nFurthermore, if we don\u2019t know any exact details on the team, it is hard to assess the future development. This information would be valuable since the proposer has around 14 other proposals submitted to this Fund. Just a paragraph making that clearer would benefit the proposal highly. \u2028Due to the reasons listed above, I neither agree nor disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. The product is already there, but there is a lot more information needed in the proposal to make it valid.

Are they relevant?), has the number of testnet-users been tracked, what was their experience? \u2028\u2028There is a case to made that none of this information is needed, although I would say that a report related to the Auditability of developing the project is more important than usual, in this case. Providing PAs and more importantly voters with transparent information is imperative, even though we have confirmation that the project was a success. If this is the right or wrong approach, I\u2019ll leave that decision up to you. \u2028\u2028I neither agree nor disagree that the proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2504", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2689, "q0": "This is a simple proposal for retroactive funding by dcSpark, the company that has deployed Djed on the testnet version of Milkomeda.\nThere is not much to say here in my opinion, the deploy was successful, as the proposer pointed out and Djed can be tested by anyone here: https://djed-testnet.milkomeda.com/. \nNo risks have been identified due to this project already being completed.\nMilkomeda is an important part of Cardano and work like this done by the dcSpark team deserves to be funded in my opinion, so that we see more of it in the future.

Having Djed in Cardano's Mainet represents, without a doubt, one of the most anticipated milestones of the ecosystem in recent months. As is public knowledge, COTI has in its hands the implementation of Djed which is currently in its testnet, and that according to its last report of July 29th (https://bit.ly/3QakJiJ) the implementation in its mainnet is totally tied to the release of Vasil. As an alternative, Milkomeda is presenting to the community on their testnet so that it can be tested in a non-UTXO environment.
