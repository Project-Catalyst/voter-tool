This proposal is part of an ambitious plan that has potential to have a truly transformative impact on Cardano use and adoption, as well as having a positive impact on millions of people in emerging markets. This proposal is for a proof of concept only, however we must consider the final product when considering the potential impact of funding this early stage proof of concept. By creating income share agreements and tokenizing them on the cardano blockchain, this could potentially impact millions to billions of people. The teams involved with this proposal, seedstars, proofspace, cardashift, chancen all have significantly large reach, with large teams of experienced professionals working on real world solutions for emerging markets. This is the type of project that is required for Cardano to reach mainstream awareness and exponential growth. The KPIs are directly related to the challenge question, for example # of new cardano wallets created for ISA, # of Atala DID credentials created, # of users interacting with Cardano through this platform, etc. This project is also an excellent opportunity for Cardano to be a leader in the space with respect to decentralized identity, and self regulation. Emerging markets present many challenges and opportunities to build new financial models that can better address the needs of the people. By experimenting in various countries with different regulations, on chain ISA agreements can be created as an example for the rest of the world to follow. https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/what-is-an-income-share-agreement/", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I have rated this 5 stars for feasibility because of the professional teams involved, and their detailed plans provided.

Funding will be required from multiple catalyst proposals, as well as potentially launching a successful ICO for the project. The team has clearly discussed several risks associated with this proposal and provided mitigation strategies. While there is risk of failure, this is exactly the type of use case Cardano was designed for, and this is the type of project catalyst was designed to be able to fund. It is worth the risk to provide this professional team these treasury funds to deliver on their vision for Income Share Agreements and use of Decentralized Identity in emerging markets. The team has provided a detailed plan with actionable tasks and a realistic timeframe. The budget is reasonable given the scope of this project and the work required to be completed. The proposal has outlined that this proposals budget is just one part of a larger plan that will require additional funding, some of which will com from a second fund 9 Catalyst proposal,  ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/418255 ) and a future ICO.

It also meets Fund9's strategic goals (i.e., prepare a group of people able to make contributions to the ecosystems, and build real-world solutions based on the Cardano blockchain). The proposer presents a metric that only 8% of the youth population in Africa could assess high-quality private education system, thus this project (with this proposal being the initial part) has a large impact by increasing the percentage of the population who can access better tertiary education. The proposer includes in their plan the consideration to scale this solution to other emerging markets. This proposal is the next stage after their other proposal (preliminary use-case testing) they will leverage the other one's findings to design a Proof of Concept of the tokenized income share agreements and prepare to scale it through an ICO.

The team (including lead submitters and co-submitters) consists of groups that have demonstrated their experience in relevant fields (education, training, startup incubation, digital identity, blockchain research) as well as their activeness in the Cardano ecosystem: Seedstars, ProofSpace, Smart Chain, Chance International.  The lead submitter - Seedstart itself, has a long track record of being able to scale its operations across countries (enabled entrepreneurs across 75 emerging markets, supported 37k+ entrepreneurs, delivered training for 2k+, and invested in 75 companies). The specific key deliverables of this proposal are (1) preparation for ICO; (2) Onboarding ISA providers, education providers, and ISA recipients; (3) creation of workflows, and management dashboards; (4) system integrations; and (5) tokenization of 15 ISAs. The team has done preparation work that includes the initial workflow and a detailed work plan. The work plan comprises planned activities to be carried out, their deliverables, their methodologies and tools, the team in charge, the hours required, the planned start time, and the duration of such activity. It is one of the best, most comprehensive work plans I have seen so far on Catalyst. Similar to the other proposal about preliminary use-case testing, I see some coordination and project management risks here, as there are four different organizations involved in this project and this stage requires even more collaboration and interdependencies than the first stage. Hopefully, the detailed work plan should mitigate that risk. In terms of budget, the team states an hourly rate of $200 per hour for all the roles.  $200/hour is a high rate. To put things in perspective, the fee to hire freelance consultants in the U.S. ranges from $50 to $150 per hour, with the upper price band corresponding to consultants with more than 20 years of experience. I would hope to see more details regarding the experience level and other requirements (location, degree, how difficult it is to hire such a position) of each role in order to have more information to assess the hourly rate.

In addition, the community may track the project by granular deliverables from the workplace, implementation of the five strategy pillars (novelty, viable application, new users, adoption increase, interconnectivity of existing solutions), and quantifiable metrics for each of those five pillars (e.g., the proportion of ISA repayments on track or at risk, # of new Cardano wallets). Please note that the specific metrics of the five pillars for this proposal are different from the metrics for the same five pillars under their preliminary use-case testing proposal. The team also makes clear its communication method for the projects such as via websites of contributors, social media platforms, Cardano Community Townhalls, and videos.

All offer exceptional value propositions and are perhaps amongst the top 1% in terms of quality in this round. Let\u2019s dive in. \n\nBeginning with the problem statement, we find out that the tertiary education systems in emerging markets do not provide adequate access to jobs and only cater to those with the existing financial means to finance the lengthy process - only 8% of the youth population in Africa. The value proposition is to unlock access to higher education through income sharing agreements in which students agree to finance it through pre-determined payments after graduation, based on a percentage of their income. The link with the Cardano ecosystem is that Seedstars intends to build these agreements on-chain and to tokenize them. \n\nA prerequisite of launching this proposal, Seedstars will have to finalize their first logical proposal in order to research into the use cases and identify the best possible implementation solutions. Once that part is done, they can proceed to implementing this proposal: to launch a proof of concept and to prepare for scaling it up in order to fast track the adoption of the income sharing agreements within their target emerging countries. \n\nThere is a unique blend of circumstances that makes this proposal (and the one before it) absolutely extraordinary in terms of impact: \n\n- a partnership between five strong and mature organizations, including Cardano native ones, is bound to offer excellent visibility to the project and access to additional sources of funding, competence, networking effects and the change of onboarding the best possible team\n- the use case is exceptional as well, since it is a blend of acting within the emerging markets, the youth population and it\u2019s a real life use case\n- there seems to be a slow and steady philosophy behind the project and the team, very much in sync with Cardano\u2019s ethos and its way of doing business, research and anything in between. \n\nOf course, five stars for potential impact. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Let\u2019s find out more about this joint venture. Seedstars is an organization with more than 80 members focused on influencing people's lives in emerging markets through technology and entrepreneurship. They are the lead proposers, and they have partnered with four other organizations for this project. ProofSpace is an identity network focused on issuing and verifying decentralized identity credentials with no-code tools. Cardashift is a (Cardano native) launchpad that raises funds for startups that are solving social and environmental issues. Smart Chain implements distributed ledger solutions. Last but not least, Chancen International provides financing for young people in Africa to access tertiary education. Of course, all of the teams have an excellent presentation of their core teams and as a second step you have their websites on which you can spend hours and hours while reading about their ongoing projects and past successes. \n\nTheir work plan is one of the most extensive from this financing round - it\u2019s only normal, otherwise it would be impossible to coordinate between five medium sized organizations. \n\nAs far as I could tell the activities for this proposal would extend until at least 2023, and it has very concise actions and responsible partners for each of them. There are good indications that all partners have devoted time and resources into writing this proposal, and they will continue to do so in the future, having already accounted for the necessary time / human resources needed for it. The main activities will involve the ICO and its preparation, vetting and onboarding the providers of the sharing agreement and the education partners, possibly the creation of charitable stakepools, developer work to support the reporting for each student (or talent as they call it) and finally tokenizing and deploying 15 agreements. \n\nThe proposers are doing an excellent job at recognizing and planning for certain risks, and the entire exercise showcases that we are dealing with mature organizations that have extensive experience in running similar projects, so it\u2019s unlikely to encounter significant unforeseen conditions down the road.\n\nThe budget is presented in a separate sheet, and is very easy to understand. Around 100k USD would be allocated to Seedstars, and another 100k USD would go to Proofspace. The rest of the budget is split between sundry items and a little bit more (30k) for reporting between partners. The hourly rate charged is 200 USD, perhaps slightly on the high end considering the project will most likely include some junior or mid level analyst hours which should perhaps be charged at a lower rate. But voters are definitely the ones who should judge the value for money so no points deducted for this reason. \n\nThis is a beautiful proposal, too bad it\u2019s not timely too. And it isn\u2019t, since it heavily depends on the finalization of the initial research stage, since they are not the type of projects that can be run in parallel. Indications that this proposal was a bit more \u201crushed\u201d than the first one is also the fact that there is a \u201cTBD\u201d within it - a clear sign that more proofreading was necessary, if not even more planning. Also, the scope of this proposal might change significantly after digesting the findings from the first phase. Considering all this, I can only offer three stars since I believe that funding for this proposal should be requested when a clear picture emerges from stage 1 of their plan. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Given the research focus of this proposal, the team manages to come up with a comprehensive framework for understanding how to track the project as well as how to measure its success and put it in the right perspective. They aim to have good website sections in place for each of the project\u2019s partners as well as to measure social media contributions. The project should also be finalized with clear deliverables in terms of an ICO, whitepaper, and deployment of 15 sharing agreements. \n\nThey also include very relevant repayment targets (similar to how banks would probably account for default rates) for repayments: 53% on track, 34% at risk, 13% off-track and a default rate of 20%. I will not be judging these numbers but I can spot an inconsistency: these income sharing agreements should be long term contracts, with repayments starting after finalizing studies (which should take a few good years). Is it not too early to put a figure on repayment rates without knowing yet what kind of model will be used in practice? \n\nWe have here a very strong joint venture of enterprises that are undoubtedly used to frequently reporting to their stakeholders and to offer transparency for their work, so there is no doubt that together they will be able to do a good job in ensuring full auditability for this project if implemented. However, there are many missing pieces in how this project will be rolled out, which are impossible to define before finalizing the research phase. In this respect and building on the default rates inconsistency from above, I think only four stars are appropriate at this stage.
