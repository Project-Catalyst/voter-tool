We like to uplink our shared Distributed Ledger Microfinance platform to the formal banking system.", "f6_no_assessments": 6, "f6_rating": 4.277777777777778, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1716, "q0": "Yes, however I do have some observations to make about how this project would be built and how it would impact the people of Laos in practice. In theory, the proposal meets the requirements of the challenge, as it would create a platform (it is not clear whether it would be a dApp for mobile or computer - I believe it would be for mobile devices); this platform would make use of decentralized identities to favor the monetary donation to the needy population of Loas, and with that it would use Cardano technologies, since the information about the identity of each person would be minted in our blockchain. It is not very clear whether the donations would be made in Ada, but probably yes, because the proponent comments that it would be necessary to teach the local population how to create digital wallets. Talking in more detail about the proposed solution, the project aims to address the lack of a formal identification system in Laos, a very south-east Asian country. There is a large portion of the population there that lives in a situation of vulnerability, according to the proponent, in a state of poverty and in a rural context. To help this population in need, payments are made through a recently created financial system, in which some banks have been digitized and started to provide services to these remote regions of the country, where people are marginalized. According to the proponent, the digital platform created is pretty solid: \u201c7 village banks have been digitized with industry-standard central banking software and have currently enrolled 212,285 people in 842 rural villages. This digitized village banking system is essential to strengthen the rural banking system to provide services to remote regions of Laos and provides a solid digital platform and, more importantly, a rural social network established to embody a uniform identification system.\u201d The idea here is to use an identification system coined on the Cardano blockchain; I wonder if they would integrate with the decentralized identities of Atala Prism, which is a project already underway in our ecosystem, or would they start another type of identification from scratch (from what I understand, it would be the second option). The aim of carrying out this project is to promote \u201cgreater transparency and auditability of the system would increase confidence that funds are being allocated and distributed properly. A strong identification system is a beneficial component for scaling digital banking solutions to other provinces and districts and even for utilizing international remittances from migrant workers who send money back to their families.\u201d The vulnerability situation of each rural worker and families in need could also be safely analyzed, so that the fairest amount to be donated can be calculated. I think the idea is super valid, with the transparency that blockchain can even increase the number of NGOs/donors, since there would be more transparency and trust in the whole process. However, there are some risks that must be considered. As the proponent himself points out, it will be difficult work to guide the local population about the creation and use of digital wallets and the basics of the cryptographic world. Most of these people may not know what blockchain is, so how could we teach about it affordably and effectively? We also need to consider the lack of technological accessibility in Laos, as not everyone has access to a quality smartphone or internet. These two problems are mentioned but we don't have a clear solution for them, which is a negative point. In summary, I think the idea is valid, but some clarifications are still necessary for the impact to be better assured.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The feasibility of the proposal is average. The only topic that is more suitable, in my view, is the team presentation, yet I am concerned that none of the members have experience with Cardano. Speaking first of the script, more carefully, I believe that the development of the project is mentioned very superficially. We don't have detailed activities about what would happen each month, all we know is what would happen by default. For example in month 1, familiarization with the Cardano ecosystem would be done. Who would get acquainted? The project team? Banks already operating in the country? In the case of banks, would it be necessary for the proponent to explain how blockchain technology would be presented to these companies, how would they come to have an understanding and trust in our ecosystem so that our technologies are merged with their activities? It would be necessary to clarify how this presentation would be made, let's say, how companies that already operate locally would understand the advantages of working with blockchain and would accept to implement these solutions. From the second month onwards, the timeline is explained in a set of months (for example, months 2 and 3 are commented together; months 6, 7, 8 and 9 are also commented, and so on). It would be essential that the activities were better detailed, so that we could clearly and accurately understand what was being done. For example, in 4 months the activities would be about integrating the banks and testing. Like this? Who would work here, doing what? What technological processes would be involved? How would this be put into practice? Unfortunately, it is not possible to understand well how the construction of the project would be in practice, as we lack many explanations. The part of the costs is also explained very superficially, the project is expensive, it would be an investment of 85 thousand dollars; this total amount is divided and some parts that should have been individually commented. For example, the $23,000 set aside for simplified mobile wallet development and testing: how many professionals would work here, what would their monthly salary be, would they work full-time on this project? Why would familiarization with Cardano cost 6 thousand dollars, what would be done with that money? Maybe it's the payment for team members to take the time to study our blockchain and how it works, but that's not clear. It is not explained how the marketing would be done, we do not know how the publicity campaign would be - which is extremely critical to the success of the project, as the local public is not familiar with blockchain. It would be necessary for us to understand why this part of the marketing, plus the training of instructors, would cost 9 thousand dollars. Finally, talking about the team, it is positive how some members are presented in great detail, we know the curriculum about some, which their linkedin profiles have done before. But some comments must be made here. First, ideally, all team members would be presented with the same amount of information (little is known about Sonesak Sehavong). Some people who would work on the project will still be hired, it would be better if they were already defined, because then we would have knowledge about everyone on the team and trust them with more tranquility. We don't know if the people who will join this team later on are well qualified. Finally, it would be necessary for at least 1 member of this team to be already experienced with Cardano, Tim is the one who understands the most about blockchain, apparently, but even so it is not clear if he already has any relationship with the ecosystem, this would be very important . So, although we have some information, a number of things should be improved on this topic.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The ways in which the proponent suggests that we track progress are great, but I have a few comments and suggestions. It is said that progress will be measured by the milestones reached in each phase, but it's not clear what the specific milestones are as we don't know many details about the phases. For this to be better resolved, it would be necessary for us to know exactly what would happen each month: who would do what and how. A better detailing of the script would be necessary for this follow-up to be adequate. It is said that weekly meetings would be held, I believe between team members, but would we in the Cardano community have access to the information discussed each week? In my view, it is not so necessary that a weekly follow-up be done, but monthly. In other words, we need to understand the progress made in each month and the partial results achieved in that period of time. It is necessary that we always stay up to date on the progress of metrics such as \u201cthe number of individuals who have been trained and educated, the number of IDs converted, new IDs registered, new Cardano wallets registered, number of transactions with the banking and remittance systems and, finally, the amount of value transacted in the Cardano system\u201d. It would also be positive for the proponent to explain how contact with the local population would be made, how information would be collected and how we would be able to establish this bridge, since they do not have that much access to the media, from what is said. And finally about the final results, the objective can be summarized as the integration of the blockchain system and Cardano identities in the village's banking system, it is intended that the current system is connected with our technologies, so that people can benefit while transfers become more transparent and traceable - which can attract institutions such as UNICEF, ILO, the World Food Program and the World Bank. It is also expected that the project will inspire other similar initiatives, other projects that use Cardano's technologies to carry out socially impacting actions in neighboring countries. In other words, we know very well what to expect, but not 1) how this can be proven in practice 2) how we can access this information, this analysis of the picture. Proponents would need to do some work to collect (verifiable) data demonstrating the coveted success scenario. How banks would be using blockchain technologies, how people learned to use digital wallets, which charities were attracted from the project, etc. This all needs to be proven and demonstrated to our community - through some participation in Townhall, for example. For these reasons I believe that the auditability is good, but not perfect.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Thank you for the good review. Yes, we can share the weekly or monthly progress reports. I think monthly makes most sense. The Cardano community is very welcome to join and provide feedback. We are strong believers of \"swarm intelligence\" - the more people are involved in a coordinated way, the smarter the outcome will be.  "}, {"id": 4172, "q0": "The challenge seeks to drive adoption by growing an ecosystem of Dapps, products, [services] and integrations.  Ultimately, adoption \u2013 transition from innovator and early adopter to early majority and late majority phases \u2013 depends on the provision of utility to end users.  People will be drawn to the blockchain that enables them to DO things safely with the least friction. IMPACT: This proposal fits within the challenge problem.\n\nOne of the major visions of Cardano is captured by the slogan \"banking the unbanked.\" This project is proposed by LTS, a Laotian based FinTech company.  This project proposes to build a payment platform, integrating \"Cardano ID\" and rural digital banks serving Laotian villages. Consequently, the project's mission is clearly within the vision often expressed by the community and presents a positive contribution to Cardano.  However, it also seems to be duplicating many capabilities being developed by other entities on Cardano.  Consequently, this could be redundant or wasteful to the community.  It would be useful to know why integrating with those systems produces a less optimal solution than building from scratch.  \n\nThe targeted population is 212,285 people across 842 rural village in Laos. The proposers discuss the recent development and success of new \"digital banks\" serving this same population.  The proposers indicate the banks use standard software. While the project is focused on Laos, the proposers do indicate the potential for scaling to other nations throughout Southeast Asia.  IMPACT: The project is on mission, but I have concerns about its generalizability beyond Laos.  When banking software are described as standard, are they conforming to regional or global standards?  This matters for understanding the potential for the project to be scaled to larger populations downstream of its initial deployment. One issue raised in the proposal is the absence of identification, and references is made to \"Cardano ID.\"  Presumably, this is a reference to the Atala PRISM DID (digital identification) development sponsored by IOG; this should be more explicit. Given its promotion by prominent Cardano community members, I would rate the impact higher for a project integrating with Atala than one adopting an independent option.  The proposal constrains its benefits to Cardano to awareness should this project be successful.  \n\nThe challenge presents the following KPIs: 1) increasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases, 2) Increase the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products, and 3) increased quality of existing products & integrations through suggested improvements that is supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community. A project would be successful under the challenge if it satisfies at least one of the conditions.  This project would develop an a new payment rail and integration with DID.  Given the latitude afforded by the challenge, this project would meet the challenge success conditions.  Project KPIs are reasonable.  ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The LTS team consists of three officers - two with heavy banking background and one described with a portfolio of \"Infrastructure, Network and Contracting,\" although it is not clear whether this is involves information technology, logistics, or process engineering.  LTS also has a development team (leader plus 4 developers) and intends to hire 3 additional persons for the project.  The team seems to have sufficient experience with both banking and technology.  However, the proposal is silent to the development team's experience with blockchains or DID. The presence of developers with experience with Plutus Pioneers, Atala PRISM Pioneers Program or a parallel offering (e.g. GimbaLabs) would be reassuring.  \n\nThe proposal lacks detail on how the target population will interact with Cardano, the payment system or the DID. The proposal mentions difficulties with communications infrastructure. Consequently, one cannot assume interaction through software applications on mobile devices. This seams a potentially significant barrier to success. \n\nThe proposal lacks detail on the payment rails it intends to develop.  Will the application be developed from the ground up or will it integrate one of the payment systems (e.g. COTI) being developed on Cardano?  Does the project intend to create its own wallet or integrate an existing wallet project (e.g. RootsWallet).    \n\nThe proposal projects an implementation of approximately 1 year with \"go live\" in month 12. The timeline is in composed of 6 phases of varying length (1, 2 or 3 months).  The budget is likewise projected on monthly increments.  Details are at the month-level.  Month 1 is orientation and acquaintance with the Cardano ecosystem.  \n\nThe team identifies two primary risks: 1) user attitudes about money and technology and 2) spotty mobile voice and data coverage.  The team proposes an education campaign to mitigate the first risk, and seems to rely on either a synchronization tool to allow offline interaction or downstream improvements in the network.    ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team does not seam to have experience with Cardano or Catalyst.  Consequently, it will need to learn reporting requirements should it get funded.  Likewise, the team does not seam to use common transparency tools like Github.  THe proposal is agnostic to reporting or communications with the Catalyst or Cardano communities.
