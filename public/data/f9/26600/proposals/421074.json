This proposal has appeared in Fund 8, has not been funded, and continues to be submitted by the authors at Fund 9. However, the content of the idea and the impact of the solution in the new proposal is almost unchanged compared to the old proposal at Fund 8. The content of the solution according to the group argues is \u201cthe first Cardano-based initiative in Uganda\u201d. To address the question of the challenge, the authors pursue the solution, building Cardano Research Clubs at major Ugandan Universities. The target audience is university and college students (focusing on final year students). The form of activities of these clubs is conference events, meeting face-to-face every month on the campus of the University. According to the team's argument, this is the ideal audience to choose Cardano as a platform for learning, researching and developing blockchain-based projects. Personally, I have always been interested in the story of popularizing Cardano education in Africa. Why? Africa in general and Uganda in particular, there is huge potential for large-scale adoption of our Cardano ecosystem. According to a survey by Chainalysis, in 2021 Africa ranks third in the \u201cTop 20 Global Crypto Adoption Index\u201d (https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/crypto-adoption-africa) -surged-1200-avoided-banks-exchanges-chainalysis-2021-9). I personally did a little research and found the potential to popularize Cardano among university students in Uganda is huge. In Uganda, there are more than 30 universities including public universities, and private universities, not counting other degree-granting institutions. The number of current students is more than 110000 people and the annual number of graduates is 30000 people. In particular, Makerere University in Kampala (one of the universities proposed by the authors) is ranked 1 in the top 5 universities in Africa with a concentration of about 30% - 40% of the total number of students. students in Ugandan universities. Uganda has a comparative advantage in East Africa due to its good curriculum, low tuition fees compared to the region, and English as the primary language of instruction. This has attracted a large number of students from East Africa to move to Uganda to study, including Tanzania, Burundi, South Sudan, and Congo. What does this mean? If the authors' proposal is approved by the community, our Cardano ecosystem will reach young, tech-savvy people not only limited to Uganda in particular but also in East Africa in general. From there, the proposal can help spread the research and application of Cardano in the East African community faster. Regarding the risk of preventing success, in my opinion, the team needs to consider the risk that the market's price fluctuations may affect the budget (because the capital is allocated in ADA). I rate 3 points for this proposed impact, deducted -2 point because the team did not update more information when submitting it at Fund 9.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The project implementation progress and budget are also kept unchanged by the author as in the previous funding round. Specifically, all activities will take place in 6 months, including 2 phases: Phase 1 (first 3 months) to establish research clubs in 6 Universities in Uganda. Phase 2 (last 3 months), meeting once a month with the participation of representatives of clubs. The 6th month will be the Cardano Hackathon in Kampala. Honestly, I was personally looking forward to a more detailed and innovative blueprint than what the team showed in the previous funding round. For example, regarding the promotion plan for the establishment of Cardano clubs, it is necessary to calculate the number of participating members. Will these clubs operate independently or jointly under the management of the project development team? I would also like to know more about the activities to link clubs, and share information and materials? I also suggest that the authors should clarify more about the picture of Universities in Uganda and what is the reason for the priority group choosing this list. The information related to the event topic has not been mentioned by the group. I propose the following: each month will select a discussion topic, and conduct a Q&A based on questions of interest to the community. In addition, I would also like the authors to clarify more on how scheduling monthly meetings will happen. Detailed information about the meeting schedule should be shared on the website, or on social networks: Twitter, Youtube... so that the community can follow and support the event. The budget items of this proposal are also unchanged from the previous Fund. The team still lacks an explanation of the attached unit price and quantity. For example, for meetings in the area: the cost of renting a place of $200 needs to clarify how many square meters the hall has, and how many people can accommodate. Similarly, the $600 refreshment cost to serve how many people are expected to attend the event? I also recommend that the authors dedicate a portion of their budget to reward Cardano with knowledge-challenging minigames at each meetup event. If not, the authors should add to the proposal to engage students at each event. Regarding the team, no link is provided so that the community can verify the skills and experience of the proponent. Therefore, I made 2 deductions: - 1 point for lack of reference link to team profile, -1 point for lack of detailed unit price budget. My rating is 3.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The only bright point of the new proposal is that the team has added KPIs to measure success compared to the old proposal. Specifically: there will be at least 4 Cardano Clubs established in 4 schools (out of a total of 6 schools selected), there will be 4 groups submitting proposals on Catalyst, and 500 Twitter followers of the clubs. In addition, I also suggested that the team add more KPI metrics related to the initiative product category. This section covers the number of software and computer science students that will be working on their final year projects on Cardano. So, what is the expected number of these innovative products? Overall, I appreciate the team's effort when it comes to adding new proposal renewal success metrics.

The proposal intends to bring on-board the creativity and will of the software engineers from the major Ugandan universities.\n\nThe success stated aligns with this challenge since it will bring more users to ADA community and, besides that, will start an environmental change in the Ugandan community, fomenting innovation and creating opportunities to students.\n\nMoreover, if it\u2019s implemented successfully, the scalability of this proposal might be outsourced because the students could manage the hubs inside their universities. Here in Brazil we have the JEC (Junior Enterprise Concept) which are actual enterprises, controlled by the students, which works inside of universities. Therefore, this blockchain solution might become a JEC focused in using blockchain to solve industry/community problems. \n\nUnfortunately, there is no further explanation about the proposal\u2019s sustainability besides the catalyst funds. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "To evaluate the feasibility, we can focus on the following points:\n1 \u2013 roadmap: The presented roadmap is quite general, informing the time (3 months) to finish a task. Therefore, in order to make the proposal easier to follow, the tasks should be subdivided into smaller ones and, preferentially, indicating how long each one of this would take.\n\n2 \u2013 methodology: It does not contain the information about how the proposed tasks will be accomplished. To exemplify, it was stated that in the first 3 months it\u2019ll be done 6 events in the major public universities. However, it\u2019s improbable that it may be accomplish without a previous university\u2019s dean authorization. That being said, it\u2019s lacking a further explanation on the methodology behind the tasks.\n\n3 \u2013 budget:  General budget, needing further explanation. Exemplifying: was asked USD 900 to hackathon advertisement, however which tools will be used to spend this amount?  Allocated a budget to transport costs but how many people, to where, etc? Therefore, the proposal would gain in transparence if these detailing were added.\n\n4 \u2013 self-funding/scalability: The proposal itself needs funding to continue promoting hackathons and maintain its operation as a whole. Moreover, to grow to other universities or schools, will be the need of financial resources. However, were not provided a plan to do it. An interesting mechanism to adopt is to incentivize the students to open a JEC (Junior Enterprise Concept) in the universities to start using ADA blockchain as a solution to some problems. It might scale to other universities without the need of involvement of the proposer itself.\n\n5 \u2013 team: The team has all the knowledge it needs to start running this proposal (and was provided links proving their knowledge).\n\n6 \u2013 risk management: There were pointed some risks and mitigation actions, however there is a major risk which is no being allowed to enter in the universities. Therefore, the mitigation action is to allocate more budget in marketing in order to call the students to attend to the meetings online or in other physical places.\n\nThat being said, to have a successful implementation, there is a need to add more details in some points. \n\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "To allow the audit of a proposal, we need to focus on:\n1 \u2013 roadmap and milestones: Since the whole roadmap is general, there is not milestones to follow and to know what to expect in a defined time. Therefore, it makes hard to know what to expect and when to expect.\n\n2 \u2013 own channel: It was provided a link to this project, which is good in order to follow its development. \n\n3 \u2013 Metrics and KPI: it was not provided the metrics and KPIs, however it was provided the success view. It would be good to measure the # student attendance, # universities joining, # final projects using blockchain, # students onboarding on catalyst (easily during this proposal). More than that, could be also added a survey to know if the students are continuing with their university hub of study.\n\nTherefore, there are methods to audit, however it lacks some information.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2298", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 3, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4146, "q0": "Establishing clubs in the universities to ensure that Cardano is the open-source ecosystem being used by Ugandan students to develop Blockchain projects is a promising project as far as impact is concerned. \n\nThe proposed solution in this proposal clearly identifies the problem of education and onboarding in the 'challenge setting'. The detailed description of the problem allows me to accept that the proposing team understands the problem clearly and thus knows how to tackle it effectively.\n\nThis proposal align with the 'challenge setting' but I am failing to understand why the proposal team could not justify why they think their proposal aligns with the Grow Africa, Grow Cardano challenge setting. I say this because there's a complete repetition of content from the \"Please describe your solution\" section instead of taking the time to tell the community exactly why their proposal aligns with the challenge setting under the \"Please describe how your proposed solution will address the challenge that you have submitted it in.\".

From the links provided for team members, I can attest to the teams' experience as the quoted experience of team members in the proposal is reflected on their various profiles through the links provided. Also, the team already has a nice functional website which indicates that they have been doing this already. I took 3 minutes to watch the YouTube video attached to the proposal but unfortunately, I couldn't really grasp the understanding due to how the speaker was expressing his delivery. I do not know exactly what the problem might have been. Maybe, the accents were too deep for me to clearly hear what he was saying. \n\nThe budget of the proposer looks convincing. Simple research on google indicates that a trip from Kiwatule to Mbarara covers about 341km and is worth 118 USD. Per my research, if the team should start their trip from Kiwatule where Kyambogo University is located to the other regions, then a budget of 200 USD is feasible. For the rest of the budget, it is reasonable to help achieve the set deliverables.\n\nFor the project timeline, it is clear that duration of six months would be needed for implementation. Out of the six months, the proposer does well to communicate to the community exactly what would be done in the first 3 months and the last 3 months. With this initiative, the community can track the progress of the project with regard to activities. Unfortunately, the team is unable to tell the community how they can track the project's progress.

Educating Ugandans to establish a blockchain hub is likely to graduate into a whole community that will be capable of ensuring the wide-scaling of Cardano in that region.\n\nAs the auditability of the proposal answers some of the questions associated with the auditability criteria, I am not 100% sure that this proposal can be audited successfully.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2518", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 1, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4213, "q0": "The \"Cardano for Ugandan Universities\" proposal addresses the challenge Grow Africa, Grow Cardano by building Cardano study clubs in the major Ugandan Universities to onboard learning devs on Cardano.

The community can track the progress of this proposal once a lot of people have been absorbed into it and its yielding results.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3057", "no_vca": 2, "ne": 1, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11806, "q0": "In my opinion, the Cardano For Ugandan Universities proposal is a good and promising proposal, completely in line with the goal of the challenge with the desire to replicate, develop and apply Cardano on a large scale in 2022 and the future not far from Africa in general and Uganda in particular.\nI find the proposed solution is also very different, highly practical compared to other proposals with the same challenge when choosing a student audience to approach, deploy and spread this project. The building of Cardano Research Clubs at major Ugandan Universities to integrate and develop learning on Cardano as a platform for blockchain-based projects.\nFrom my own research, I agree with the problem that the authors emphasized in their proposal, Uganda is still slow in blockchain-related innovation. Cardano was not yet known and brought to life by the people of Uganda. As I said above, it's smart for the team to recommend targeting local developers as well as people still studying in colleges and universities. This is mostly a young workforce, they have wisdom, knowledge, are eager to learn, explore new things, access to new technology quickly. For this reason, if I were to score the proposal, I would give it 4 points, as the proposal has met most of the measures of the challenge presented.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project's progress has given specific month-to-month timelines, however I see this progress if the project team adds more detail to numerically measure the information the estimated outcome will be achieved of each event by month will help the project have a more detailed view.\nI found the project budget to be $18000 which is 3.6% of the total project budget, which is a perfectly reasonable amount for this project in Uganda. However, this amount does not really explain the cost items in detail so I find it unclear.\nRegarding the feasibility of the project, I see that the authors have made two very important points that the project will have to solve, which are the measurement indicators, the achieved results of the project as well as the difficulties the challenge that the project team will have to overcome.\nRegarding the difficulties and challenges of the project, I see that the project team has raised the foreseeable difficulties when implementing this project, in my opinion when setting out the difficulties and challenges, the project team The project should always provide methods to overcome and overcome these challenges and difficulties. When solving these 2 big problems, I firmly believe that this will be a very potential project.\nAccording to my research, the project team consists of a team of young members, they are all knowledgeable and enthusiastic people who have been involved in the blockchain market for many years. They are people working at prestigious units, their voices have a certain influence on the majority, openly and transparently about their identities, positions they are holding as well as the units they are working for. They have their own youtube channel to verify their activities. Therefore, they are fully capable of implementing this proposal.\nI will give the proposal feasibility 3 points reason -2 points about the planning and budget are not detailed.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Regarding the project's audit, the team makes plans and breaks down the items for each event by month, the division to manage the budget is completely reasonable. However, in my personal opinion, I think this part of the budget needs to be more detailed. For example, because the project team already has a roadmap, a monthly project implementation plan, the budget should also be divided into details for monthly events, which events need to be allocated more, which events need to be allocated less budget. Especially after each event, it is necessary to re-evaluate the effectiveness between the use of the budget and the results achieved in order to have a plan to adjust the budget source appropriately.\nThe project's measurement KPIs have also been provided by the author group with specific information as well as indicators to evaluate the success of the project, that is, at least 4 Cardano University Clubs will be established in 4 months Uganda's major public university, at least 4 groups will pitch their ideas on Cardano and 500 local social followers on twitter will be realized. These indicators for me are detailed, complete and completely achievable by the author team.\nI know this proposal has been included from fund 8 but has not been funded, in this fund 9, the authors have adjusted, revised and supplemented in more detail for the project, more suitable to the conditions and situation reality in Uganda with specific project success metrics. I will give 4 points for the transparency of the project and hope this will be a project to help deploy Blockchain applications in agricultural production in particular and promote the development of the Ugandan economy in particular shared.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3281", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12844, "q0": "Good project to embark on, having taught about your country to help improve their technology and blockchain as a whole. Even though I agree that this proposal will be impactful, I think with such a challenge in the country, it will require constant workshops and seminars for the local people and the university students. Training and workshop must be organized every week for a better understanding of how Blockchain and Cardano will impact their lives in the country. The more workshops and seminars are the more students and the local people get interested and are willing to cooperate.
