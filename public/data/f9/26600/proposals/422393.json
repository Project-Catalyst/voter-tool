It is believed that in Africa, many healthcare providers do not have a proper system of keeping medical records. For this reason productivity and efficiency is low despite the fact that African has is beginning to have a high number of growing healthcare workers and facilities. There is a challenge in this problem which needs to be solved and the solution to this is the Hippocrades App. The proposers talks of this app which will help solve problems in our our healthcare centers. The project seeks to raise awareness and seek to provide onboard tutorials  and guidlines in the African. There are a lot of challenges in our healthcare facilities which this project seeks to address. This app Hippocrades seeks to provide ready made healthcare modules and solutions like electronic medical records, billing, registration, material management and many more. The app also provides a comprehensive list of healthcare APIs that developers can use not only to add features but also to allow interoperability with other systems. Already, the proposers have already with this healthcare app started giving solutions to doctors and facilities. Fortunately, its is also part of the catalyst funding. This the proposers believe will help the Cardano Community. This will bring value to the Cardano/Catalyst ecosystem because it is already part of the catalyst funding and this has built a decentralized healthcare infrastructure for Cardano. Even the proposers have been selected in the first batch of the  Ariob Incubator / Iceaddis program in Africa which is also supported by Cardano. This means some of the members in the Cardano community are aware of this and therefore many more will join and enjoy the benefits it comes with. The KPIs in the proposal matches the one in the challenge which makes it also relevant because the app provides an amazing set of smart contract in the black chain that allows users to manage and audit their medical records and more. This is also very administrative . This is where it betters operation with data driven business decisions. This project will address future challenges because it has all aspect of departments on it. It tackles Laboratory records, retrieve results when needed, pharmacy, dental and even patient portals. In fact it is Everybody's \"go-to app\" for all things health. This will be very beneficial to the Cardano ecosystem and Africa as a whole.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Hippocrades is a decentralized healthcare infrastructure.\nAnd since the proposer has already started with this, they have the experience and skills to set up this projects. The proposer provided 3 relevant links which elaborated more on what the Hippocrades app can do to the project Healthcare providers onboarding. The links throws more light on how the app works and this is very relevant. The links provides more understanding on how the app works. With a fund of USD 18000, the core team members that will be working on this project are 10 and per their credentials given, they look very qualified in their field areas. The proposal is targeting 3 countries ( Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda) The proposal is looking at using 4 months to embark on this this project. The proposal has clearly outlined their budget and how it will be utilized.\nMonth 1 \nTeam selection\nOnboarding to Hippocrades platform\nBrainstorming\nPlanning and setting timeline of activities\nDistribution of work\nMonths 2 - 3\nImprove onboarding of Hippocrades.com\nStart of content creation\nShare to website and groups as materials get done\nSocial Media posting (Facebook and Linkedin)\nMonth 4 is assessment of how far the project is going.\nThere is also clarity of how the budget would be used:\nContent / Technical Writer (1)\n$1.5T @ 3months\n$4.5T\nGraphic / Video Artist (2)\n$1T @ 3 months\n$6T\nProject Lead\n$500 @ 4 months (spread)\n$2T\nResearch, Meetings, Logistics\n$500/mo @ 3\n$1.5T\nAds Boosting\n$2T/mo @ 2\n$ 4T\nTotal $18,000\nLooking at how the project has already been in existence for the past 5 years and part of the Catalyst funding, it still has some needed task to complete therefore there is the likelihood to request for additional funding.\nHippocrades is health infrastructure and platform that other developers can use to build more healthcare apps. Main language used for this app is English but the way the app looks, other developers can use it and perhaps to translate into other languages to benefit the community. The proposers have identified some areas they can use to track the success of this project. There are modules that the proposers will use. The proposers talk of timeline that will be set to task each project to tack the progress of it. There will also be a weekly meetings to track the progress of it. When all these are done, it will mitigate the risk associated to it. This is also an app for all ages.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers will use the Github even for non technical task to track the progress of this project. Proposers will use this same roadmap to track the achievement of this project. KPIs used for this proposal makes sense. The proposers will use more of the links and the website they have provided to post information, materials , tutorials and other and other vital information would be posted on these websites and links to provide more understanding on this app. The KPIs used makes sense and can also help track the success of the project in a way because the app is independent and other developers can also used and add more aspect to it. This is a project that the community can track it's progress because once it will be used by a medical facility and even has a patient portal, Pharmacy, lab and diagnostic aspect, members in the community can track it progress.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3057", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 3, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1088, "q0": "The team behind this proposal have built a decentralised healthcare infrastructure on the Cardano blockchain. Now that it\u2019s approaching its final stages of development, improvements and bug fixes the time has come to start marketing it to health care providers, while also offering onboarding guides and tutorials when needed.\nThe platform they have built is very impressive, and as such, raising awareness of the improvements and capabilities it can offer not just to patients but to doctors, pharmacies and medical facilities, is a reasonable task.\nI appreciate how in the beginning, the team has also considered lowering the number of targeted countries to three - Ethiopia, Uganda and Kenya, to ensure the success of the marketing campaign.\nConsidering the information provided throughout the proposal, but also through the links and especially through the demo link, I consider the proposal to be highly impactful and well within the described statements of the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The provided plan is described in detail.

As someone who has worked with creatives in this field, I can state that the amounts asked look reasonable and realistic. Although the team members for this proposal have not yet been hired, the proposers have provided us with the exact vacant jobs and some details about their current members. Overall, considering the amount of work that has been done so far, the working MVP and the fact that the team has been selected as part of the Ariob Incubator, developed in collaboration with IOG, I see no reason not to trust their skills, knowledge and dedication to the project. \nAs such, I will rate the feasibility section a 5/5, as I have sufficient trust that the proposers are capable of implementing the project successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I appreciate the team\u2019s dedication even in this case, the tracking of the proposal\u2019s progress.

The proposal has also indicate how this health providers can take the opportunity on cardano ecosystems to carry out millions of transactions on the Cardona ecosystems. The proposer identified that millions of health facilities do not have the electronic medical records system in place, i believe when this proposal is funded will raise awareness creation of health care solutions available on the CARDANO ecosystems.
