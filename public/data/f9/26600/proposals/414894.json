Deep ancestral Africa has an alternative!", "f6_no_assessments": 5, "f6_rating": 4.466666666666667, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1046, "q0": "The proposal aims to create a token, named Kodia, based on a system rooted in African culture, that will function on a different paradigm than the ones created so far. The token is based on the idea that there should be a web of trust, the co-creators of the coin, who will be vouching for every next person joining, until the web of trust grows, and others will be able to vouch for the new entries. Additionally, the system will have a Universal Dividend, which is a monthly allocation of equal dividends for each coin holder. The dividend will be calculated based on the total percentage of the coin in circulation divided by the total number of users. \nThis experiment will first start locally in Cameroon, where one of the co-proposers, DIT Cameroon is now located. \nFrom all the documents attached and the studies that have been carried out, my suggestion would be to try this new approach and see what results it will obtain. From my point of view, it is definitely a new tokenomics model, that should be tried out in a local environment and observed how it unfolds. Especially considering the fact that the financial system in Cameroon is not in very good shape, from the reports I have read, people are usually not incentivised to participate in financial systems and the entire banking system has been very close to insolvency.\n  As such, I find the proposal to be very much in line with the challenge metrics and could have a very high potential impact, not just on the Cardano community, but on smaller communities throughout Africa, as well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I highly appreciate the fact that the timeline for this proposal is a long-term one. The first two phases will each take up to 6 months to implement, namely, the \u201cConsolidation and Refinement\u201d of the tokenomics system in collaboration with local historians and writers and \u201cDesign and Architecture\u201d  where the team will be collaborating with its stakeholders on solving the smaller issues that have been identified by then. And lastly, the third phase, \u201cImplementation, Deployment and Marketing\u201d will last for 12 months, which I find to be reasonable considering the task at hand.\nThe budget is split into larger divisions with a dedicated amount required. Perhaps, in this case, the fact that the team hasn\u2019t provided an hourly rate and an approximation of hours needed to implement is better, since the project is spread over such a long period of time, that having fixed tasks entrusted to each person on the team is simpler to implement and calculate. Since I know DIT Cameroon and am familiar with their work, I know they are taking their job very serious, and as such I don\u2019t have any doubt, that this budget drafting is the most appropriate in this specific case. Since I mentioned the team, I can also affirm that knowing part of the team and reading the descriptions and LinkedIn profiles of the ones I don\u2019t, I am confident in their knowledge and dedication, not just to the Cardano Community but to the African one, as well.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I find the auditability section to be as remarkably well written as the rest of the proposal. The project\u2019s progress is very well described per each phase, with clear documentation and metrics provided. \nThe statements from the success definition are well-grounded in a historic context and offer a prime example of a successfully implemented vision. The current state of instability, both economic and societal in several African countries has been caused by colonialism and the remains of it are what still cause the problems these societies face. Solving even one of them would lead to a very positive effect on its citizens.\nAs such, I find myself agreeing with both the project\u2019s progress and vision of success, and I consider them both to be auditable.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 2, "ng": 11, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2706, "q0": "Interesting proposal that looks squarely at its African cultural context to derive its approach, which is very much in line with the ethos of this Challenge. By actually using the token which it creates as a means to question the scarcity/rarity paradigm so prevalent in Europe and the US, and to thereby create a new \"take\" on decentralising finance which is informed by and approriate for Cameroon, the proposal will have a dual impact: it works simply as a proposal, in terms of the token and the project itself, and it also works in terms of its cultural approach - foregrounding African thinking, and centring African culture and history, to shape an African project. The proposal's clear grasp of the effects of marginalisation, and its understanding of the risk of being perceived as scammers, also ensures it will be impactful. The proposal offers a multi-faceted approach and addresses both the Grow Africa challenge, and the strategic goals of Cardano, in a really interesting and powerful way. (The decolonising element of the \"relative theory of money\" team being based in France is a particularly nice little extra in terms of impact, too).", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I like the fact that this team have allowed enough time to think and to integrate their ideas. They are working with a mix of complex philosophical ideas and engagement \"on the ground\", so it's important to the proposal's feasibility that they are not trying to rush this, and their timeline allows them to connect things, and look at both the \"big picture\" and the details of the local context. Their budget looks mostly very appropriate, and it's clearly broken down; and their team clearly have the necessary skills to deliver, and the input from the Relative Money Theory team which gives the theoretical and cultural/philosophical underpinning to the proposal.The only slight issue I see is that given the importance of marketing the proposal so that people understand and adopt it, I'd like to see a little more for marketing in the budget. Obviously the team might not have time or bandwidth to allow \"marketing\" to stretch too much into \"education\" - there's probably a whole separate proposal in that, really - but I think it's inevitable that there will be an element of educating and informing, rather than just marketing, and this might need a bit more resources than what is planned. It's a minor point, though, so not really enough to deduct a point for.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Very solidly auditable, with a nice and well-thought-out mix of quantitative and qualiataive metrics that will enable the community not only to see what has been done,but alos to get a sense of what effect it is having. I also like the way that the 3 (very different) phases of the proposal are each going to be auditable in different ways and using different metrics appropriate to the work that's being done. The \"what does success look like\" section is incredibly ambitious; but I see that as a very good thing, that the proposal has a sense of itself and its wider aims.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2343", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11349, "q0": "The problem the proponent makes is that most tokens use a production and distribution model based on a scarcity model typical of the Western context.

They cite, in extensive explanations, what these problems would be and how the creation of a new token will support projects in the locality of Cameroon, circumventing the aforementioned problems and increasing the adoption of Cardano's technologies on the African continent. They comment on how the African communities are organized and how the token would be designed to promote the connection and strengthening of the initiatives of different groups, thus allowing greater accessibility of the inhabitants of the country in question to our blockchain technologies. In other words, the proposal will benefit Africa and Cardano at the same time, thus meeting the objectives of the challenge. Although it is a complex idea, it is explained at length, so there is a lot of confidence in the impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the script, I think that in terms of detail, this part of the proposal is very good, but speaking of temporality, I would like more specifications. The phases have a very long duration, for example 6 months. What would happen to each of them? It is possible to have a partial view of the development process, due to the absence of more details on the time schedule issue. The $30,000 requested in the financing is even well divided, but some parts could be more detailed here. For example, why would marketing cost $2,000? How would this publicity campaign be carried out? Finally, in terms of the team, this part is very good, I would say the best part of the topic. We have several details and also the linkedin profiles of the professionals involved, which conveys a lot of confidence.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditability is average, we know some information that would be monitored, but we don't know how it would be studied and how this information would be passed on to our community. Even if the proponents say what is expected for each phase, it would be necessary for them to make it clear how this information would reach all members of the Cardano community. Would it be via telegram, gitbook, miroboard, after townhall...? The same is true for final success, as with measuring progress, the final results are quoted (they could be more detailed) but we don't know in what way this scenario would be provable and palpable for us.

Instead, it proposes to take the relative theory of money and apply it to the reality in Cameroon. The basic concept is something like this: you make an initial investment, get certified by five existing members in a web of trust and just by living and breathing your existence creates new money into the system. This gets spread around the community in a way that the members' share of this \u201cuniversal dividend\u201d balances the wealth gaps and keeps purchasing power the same, even if the total number units of money in the system increases.\n\nIt is a system that probably works best in a local environment where people can meet one another. In fact, they must meet to get certified. This poses some limits for scalability but the team still has big ambitions: \u201cThis project is at the core of liberating Cameroon and later west and central Africa in general from French financial colonization through the CFA.\u201d Ousting a fiat-currency is no small feat. The team is dedicated to this fairly long-term proposal where just the MVP in Cameroon is planned to take 24 months. Should it prove a success, they can reach out to Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, as well as in Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I went through the video materials (https://youtu.be/kmuzCWNFLtg) and read the proposal thoroughly. It\u2019s based on solid theory and could definitely work as one of the solutions for a much fairer society. The team seems solid and capable of making this happen. However, \u201cthis\u201d is a bit undefined. Most of the proposal focuses on describing the issues with the \u201ctraditional money\u201d (including most of crypto) whereas the plan itself and budget remain vague and generic. Even the title is not really explained. What is Mbongo? How about Nzimbu?\n\nThe ask is \u201conly\u201d $30,000 for a duration of 24 months. What exactly is that money going to be used for remains a bit of a mystery, however. Time-wise the plan provides broad strokes. First six months are spent on refinement and localization. Second six months are for design and problem solving, resulting in writing a whitepaper. The remaining 12 months are reserved for implementation, deployment and marketing.\n\nTo increase the feasibility of the plan, it would make sense to collaborate and exchange ideas with communities that have been around for a while (e.g. https://duniter.org/) and who have similar ambitions. It is mentioned that the \u2018team behind the relative theory of money\u2019 is eager to work with them, but there are no specifics mentioned what this collaboration will entail and how close-knit the cooperation would be.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The leading indicators (number of documents, trips made or advertisements) are rather unimpressive.
