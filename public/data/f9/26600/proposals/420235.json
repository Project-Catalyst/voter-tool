However, the young population lacks interest and knowledge about Blockchain and related cryptocurrencies, and has misconceptions about Blockchain. solution that provides web-based, standardized and easy-to-understand video lessons about Blockchain and the Cardano ecosystem accessible to all young people. The course content will cover many areas: Blockchain, Cardano, NFT, Dapp, Dao\u2026 At the same time, the incentive program will be divided into 2 types: education-based incentives and referral-based incentives. .

First about the route. The research team said that the project implementation lasts in phase 1. And the project implementation will be carried out in 3 phases. We are told that the project will start phase 1 after being funded. But why only phase 1. While the team has provided information that the project will be implemented in three phases. The team can explain in more detail: Once Phases 2 and 3 are done, how to plan all the work that needs to be done, or suggest another project to do phase 2 and 3? We know what will be done in phase 1 with a period of 1 to 2 months. and jobs are analyzed by week. The team explains phase 1 will take 1 to 2 months. That's 4 to 8 weeks. However, the team only provides job information for 1, 2 and 3 week periods. In this regard, the team can provide more detailed information and timetables. Example: The project will be implemented when it is funded. The jobs are arranged by week, i.e. which week of the month (1 to 2 months). A clear detailed roadmap will increase the probability of the proposal's success. Next is the budget. Proposal asks for $4,450. This is not a very high amount and has been clearly explained. We know how the budget will be allocated, what work needs to be done in the project. In my opinion, the proposal will need more budget to ensure the sustainability of the project (when the detailed roadmap of works). Finally, about the team of team members. The team introduced us to each team member and a short presentation about each of them and attached some links so that we can understand more about their background, past and present work. their. we know the group has 3 members, their identity, ability and experience. In general, the overall plan is feasible but not high, the roadmap can be improved in more detail. I will take 1 point in this section.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team paid great attention to this part of the proposal. The team provides a lot of metrics so we can measure the progress of the project. The team will deliver and report on their main social media channels and online pages. One positive thing is that they will provide reporting for Cardano social media channels (WhatsApp, Telegram and Youtube). about the end product is the success of the project, what we expect is success in this project.

First we need to be honest when it comes to getting involved with the crypto world, people are often afraid of losing their money \u2013 be it traditional currencies or cryptos; Blockchain is poorly understood and lack of public interest, generated precisely by fear of financial loss, is a problem that urgently needs to be resolved. So the proposal suggests that modules be created with classes that deal with basic issues about blockchain (it is positive that these topics are already mentioned); by attending classes and completing blocks, say, submitting assessments, students would receive a reward of about 15 adas per block (at least I understood it that way). That is, there would be an economic incentive that will certainly enhance the involvement of the target audience. The proposal serves well the objective of both popularizing Cardano in Africa and benefiting its local inhabitants, as introducing them to the cryptographic environment can generate positive fruits and opportunities.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The script is great!

The idea is not new, but the proposal is different about setting up a Learn to Earn website that publishes videos to teach students Blockchain knowledge, has a good incentive program, and attracts members. If this proposal is successfully implemented, the number of young people in Ghana, Africa who know Cardano Blockchain will increase and create a community of PA, VPA, dRep, Vote, and young developers for Cardano. The Impact Proposal corresponds to the Challenge requirement. One point that is very appreciated is that the proposal poses a problem and offers a very logical solution, it seems that the proponent did a lot of research before writing this idea. The proponent also thinks about the short-term and long-term goals of this project, as well as risks and solutions to reduce risks when implementing this project. The risk presented is the user creating multiple accounts and execution budgets. The option to reduce risk is KYC and calling for more funding from other capital sources.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The implementation plan is divided into 3 phases, and in Fund 9, the proponent wants to receive funding to implement phase 1. Phase 1 mainly researches content, prepares processes and documents, and designs the web. Therefore, the budget in phase 1 is only USD 4450, equivalent to 0.89% of the total Challenge budget, which is not a large amount compared to the work in phase 1. The proponent is very cautious in planning and implementing the project. There is a concern that with such a budget, will it be enough to implement the works in phase 1? For example, web design costs only 1500 USD for both interface and hosting. The cost of forming a partnership is also only 500 USD. \nAbout the development team, there are three members: teacher, developer and financier, and marketer. Members have enough experience to implement this idea. Contact information and Linkedin are also provided.

Is learn-to-earn a sufficient stimulant to bring students into learning and staying, or will only the financial remuneration attract them and as soon as the workshops are over, they will sell their rewards and leave?\nFor the most part, however, I find the scope of the proposal well thought out and absolutely in line with the challenge of Grow Africa, Grow Cardano. From the description of the workshop themes to the reward mechanism, I find the proposal to have a potentially positive impact on the Cardano Ecosystem, and as such I will score it a 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project will be lasting for a year and is separated into 3 distinct phases, the scope of this proposal being the first phase that will last for approximately 2 months and will deal with the research part of the project that will help determine the direction of the entire endeavour.\nThe main tasks of this first phase are the drafting of legal documents in coordination with legal experts, research of the content, website design and formation of possible partnerships. I find the last task of \u201cPartnership formation\u201d to be too short of a period, considering the task at hand, and as such, I would have assigned a longer period of 2-3 weeks, taking into consideration all kinds of unforeseen events and long replies when dealing with other people.\nOtherwise, the plan looks detailed and makes sense.\nIn regards to the budget and the team, I find that the information provided is also well articulated and I see no lack of detail that would raise a question.\nAs such, I find that the team and budget are well defined, and the plan for the most part is also well thought out, except for the last task, which could turn out to require more time than anticipated, but I do not see it impacting the implementation of the proposal too much.\nIn conclusion, I will rate this section a 5.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The plan and scope of this proposal is developing the first phase of the project that is focused mostly on research, as the team has described it numerous times \u201cThis first phase is mainly research-based\u201d. The budget is structured around research only, as well, but the auditability measures for tracking the progress of the proposal contain metrics that are related to a possible future phase of the project (the other two phases have not been described at all) when students are already on-boarded on the platform and start learning. But there is no budget set aside for this entire task, there are no incentives calculated, the team is not being paid for this part of the project, and the plan does not describe this intention at all, as such, I find the metrics and success definition provided to be completely irrelevant to the scope of this proposal. For the entire project as a whole, it would have made sense, but since this proposal is dealing with the research phase only, the metrics should be dealing with this part as well. For example, where could the community verify if the legal documentation is drafted, the website is being worked on or that partnerships are being done etc.?\nUnfortunately, the auditability section does not cover the scope of this proposal, in conclusion, I will rate it a 2 and hope the team will resubmit the proposal in a future fund with the correct Auditability section.

In a nutshell, they will incentivize people to learn these blockchain lessons. I think that it can work but I have some concerns. My first concern is that the incentive might not be high enough to attract people. $1,5 doesn\u2019t sound like a great motivation, even in Africa. My second problem is that I cannot see how this can be sustainable. I mean where does the money come from? How are you going to keep funding this if there is no monetization scheme in place? Enough questions that are not clearly answered in this proposal.

I think that the proponents should explain how they can survive with this amount. Regarding the team, there are 3 people who have provided links to their linkedin profiles (one link returns not found).

The attempt to arouse interest through workshops, meetups and town hall meetings gained no traction. This is an alternative approach to address the problem. \n\nThe means of achieving this is to create a website with video accessible to anyone using a hand phone and with an internet.
