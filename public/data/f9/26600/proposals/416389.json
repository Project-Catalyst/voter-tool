For example, this proposal specifically targets creating the experience of visiting a palace in Ancient Egypt, around 4500 years ago. The proposing team has proposed in a previous fund, for a larger proposal that didn\u2019t get funded, and now they are reapplying with a smaller scope, just to build the MVP of the project. This MVP would still not integrate blockchain features, but their goal is to, after successfully launching the MVP, receiving feedback from alpha testers, and improving it, integrate the blockchain/metaverse features, such as minting KemiLand digital assets, issuing visit tickets, governance features and features of the mechanics of the game, such as physics and communications. The goal is to create a fun and interesting experience that the general public would be interested in and would be also interested in acquiring assets and participate more actively in that virtual reality. In my opinion, the proposal is good, but it has some downsides and some risks for the community. The first thing is that this MVP would not have any connection with Cardano, and therefore its impact on the Cardano ecosystem, limited to the execution of this proposal, will be virtually zero. The impact would exist only in the future if the MVP were successful and they are able to get the resources to continue with the project. So, if we limit the impact to the MVP, it would be very low. Regarding challenge alignment, the proposal would be aligned with seeding African projects, even though I didn\u2019t find information in the proposal itself that mentions that this is an African-based project, I believe it is considering its team members. The only risk mentioned in the proposal is the lack of funds to develop the MVP, and their solution to that is self-funding the project. That\u2019s an ok approach, but on the other hand the show that they don\u2019t need Catalyst funds to execute it, and if that\u2019s the case, maybe it would be more appropriate to self-fund the MVP as mentioned, and then ask for Catalyst funds to implement the blockchain features that are going to be added to the project in the future. There are few other risks that I see for this project, like wrong budget estimation, that were not addressed.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal includes a roadmap for the development of the project that is well divided into monthly deliverables. The sequence of deliverables makes sense according to the project\u2019s goal, and the timeline matches the time required for each of the tasks as well. The expected start month, which is July, might not be feasible since at this time the funding will have not been released yet by IOG to proposers, so the whole project planning will probably have to be postponed in at least 1 month, but this is not a big issue. The team has presented a good description of the budget required to complete the project, breaking it down into different tasks and sizing the budget according to the effort required to complete each one of them and the amount of team members working on each task as well. Overall, the roadmap is good and seems to be realistic. The team behind to proposal also seems to have all the relevant skills to execute and successfully deliver the project. The team includes tech experts, interactive architectural visualization professionals, game developers, 3D artists and designers and developers. Half of the team provided their LinkedIn profiles, and they match the background provided in the proposal. Based on the number of team members, the description of tasks and timeline presented, I believe this proposal is very feasible. They also present the concept of Restoration Cycles, which seems to be a way of deciding on how to include new monuments in its metaverse, and the decision would be made through the DAO that they mentioned will be developed in the future when blockchain features are incorporated to the project. Though, they mention that this is still a draft and might change in the future. This piece of information is interesting to know, but as I understood it is not related to the implementation of the current proposal. In this sense, it\u2019s just an extra and doesn\u2019t really influence this proposal\u2019s feasibility. Regarding the risks, as mentioned previously, they haven\u2019t indicated any risks besides not being funded - which is actually not a risk for the Catalyst and Cardano community, because if they get funded, then this is not a risk anymore. I believe they could have included some risks related to the execution itself, as mentioned, like team\u2019s availability - since, based on the timeline, some of them might have to work full time on this project for some time, and they probably have at least another job - and going overbudget. Though, overall, I believe the feasibility of the proposal is very good.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap presented in this proposal is well divided in phases that last one month each, and each one of them has defined milestones that can be verified by the community if the evidence is presented by the team for each of these milestones. The KPIs that were included in the proposal for measuring progress are actually KPIs for the success, with the exception of \u201cProgress of the MVP and its completion\u201d, which is what progress KPIs should be all about. It would have been better to have broken down this bullet point into several deliverables associated with the milestones to make explicit what they are going to deliver in the ongoing reports. The success KPIs, on the other hand, are very appropriate and well defined. They define what is going to be measured and set goals to consider the proposal a success. A consider the numbers realistic and achievable. Overall, the auditability of this proposal is something simple to be done. Unfortunately, it will be difficult for the community to test the MVP due to requirement of VR headsets, but it would be interesting to make it available to whoever has the necessary hardware to test it out.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2110", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 7, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "That's a very high-quality assessment, and thanks for such a deep understanding of KemiLand and its long road map, It's true we won\u2019t incorporate the blockchain at least in the early stages of the project, at this stage of the project we are more focused on delivering a quality output attracting general public and to onboard the 12 ambassadors (Gatekeepers) from the selected countries. \n\nWhile we have confidence in what we are building, there are no numbers that confirm the project potential, there must be on ground activities that prove the failure/success of our business model. Before starting promoting KemiLand assets we must provide proof to KemiLand future citizens of the expected profitability of their investment in KemiLand.  \n\nWe expect to receive feedback from visitors once we roll out the Royal Palace to the gatekeepers, definitely other questions wil be raised on how to confirm authentic feedback?, we will try to figure out how to do this as we have some time before the expected roll-out dates. \n\nI do like the idea of making The Royal Palace available for the community to test, we shall study such options as our intentsion was to provide it only to the selected ambassadors(GateKeepers) and the internal community for testing.  \n\nWe wish to receive Cardano community recognition so we can officially announce that KemiLand is not only powered by Cardano but is also Sponsored by Cardano via its Catalyst.  \n\nOur V0.00001 trailer video can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQoteINgIpU \n"}, {"id": 1647, "q0": "Unfortunately, this proposal does not align with the objectives of the challenge. I say this because it is not a project that will help the citizens of Africa directly; the idea is to create a virtual reality simulation game, where the player will take a 15 to 30 minute trip through a place that simulates a royal Egyptian palace. Despite taking place in Africa, at no point in the proposal is it said how the game will benefit Africans, it is not stated that a certain part of the funds will be destined for Egypt, for example, or that the people who will work on the game are Africans in yes. Furthermore, it is said that the game would not be built on the Cardano blockchain. That the blockchain would enter future versions through \u201cMinting KemiLand Digital Assets (Package, Avatars, Frameworks, Furniture, Wearable, etc) / Issuing Visit Tickets / The basis for governance features (DAO/Voting/Cinting/Stacking ..etc)\n/ Maybe for game multiplayer features like physics (movement) and communication (voice, etc)\u201d. But working with the present, it's not a project that will make a profit for Cardano, either in a financial sense or in the sense of expanding our blockchain. It is unclear why Cardano would become a successful and well-known blockchain in Egypt if the game would be released as a trial version, which would be sent to different people, so that they could help promote the game - it is unknown if the project would work. , if indeed future versions would be created so that Cardano could be part of the construction of the world... Anyway, unfortunately, I don't see how this project can meet the specific objectives of this challenge, such as the expansion of our blockchain across the African continent, the benefit of local population through job opportunities, whether on Catalyst (as bidders, CAs, vCAs, etc.); that is, participating directly in projects, in the case of people in the technology area, studying about the construction of Dapps, Plutus and so on. In order for the project to be more appropriate and its impact to be certain, it would be necessary that 1) Cardano was involved from the beginning of the construction of the game, so that the blockchain could become popular there, in several ways 2) That it was very clear what the direct benefits would be guaranteed to the African population, whether they come from Egypt or not. Therefore, unfortunately, the project does not meet the specific objectives of the challenge, as shown in the challenge summary: \u201cNumber of proposals addressing the fundamental issues preventing Cardano adoption in Africa + Number of proposals offering solutions to infrastructure and education concerns + Number of new Africa -based users onboarded onto Cardano (wallets, platform sign-ups) + Number of new Africa-based Catalyst members (proposers, voters, CAs) + Number of new African projects seeded in 2022\u201d. We do not see here for example Cardano wallets being created, as the proponent himself declares that the game will not initially be built on the Cardano blockchain; it won't be an initiative that will definitely grow our community, attracting new members to it - even if people do become interested in the game and it becomes popular and successful, we still don't know for sure when the technologies of the Cardano would go into action, this was very important to clarify.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The roadmap is presented in two parts: the first, more direct, and a second, which better details some of the processes that will be developed; for example in the first one - \u201cJuly 2022: Complete Royal Palace 3D design, Basic game movements + August 2022: Build user trip scenario + Create Characters + Add palace decoration (furniture, attraction, etc (\u2026)\u201d, as we can see is very straightforward The second explains in a more qualitative way what would be done (\"The project is divided into four phases with each phase consisting of four restoration cycles. The planning is considered to keep development of features in progress. Khufu , Khafre , Menkaure and Sakara are the biggest and heights Pyramids in Giza Plateau. The Khufu Phase(Establishment) Lunching KemiLand and building teams, experience, publicity and relations. Main deliverables of this phase is a beta version from the platform (\u2026)\u201d. are arranged, we were able to understand well how the development process of this game would take place, we know what would happen in each month of the year (although I think it would be interesting if more details were given in this part i of the script, with the respective activities). In general, we managed to understand well what will happen, so I believe that there is not much that needs to be changed, just a refinement in relation to the activities (providing more specificity). The requested budget is divided into some parts, I think it was very positive that in addition to reporting what these phases would be, they are well broken down. For example in the excerpts: \u201c3D Illustration, Quantity:3, Total Hours:250, Hourly rate:$8.00, Total :$6,000.00 + 3D Character, Quantity:1, Total Hours:180, Hourly rate:$6.00, Total :$1,080.00 + Art Director , Quantity:1, Total Hours:150, Hourly rate:$12.00, Total :$1,800.00 + Sound Effect Engineer, Quantity:1, Total Hours:120, Hourly rate:$9.00, Total :$1,080.00\u201d. We know how many people would work on each activity (eg 3D illustration, art direction, sound effects engineering, etc). We also know the hourly value of work, so we understand very well how money would be used. In this regard, there are no criticisms or suggestions to be made, I believe that the information is passed in a very adequate and satisfactory way. Team members are presented relatively briefly; we know their names, their professional roles and we also have their linkedin profiles attached. But it would be positive if more had been explained about each one, that is, if more extensive curricula had been attached. I would like to know more about their professional paths so far, and also better about how they relate to Cardano, or if everyone has some kind of knowledge about our blockchain (super important factor). Therefore, I think the project's viability is average, we have very good and precise parts, such as the budget, but some needed more depth, such as the presentation of the team members; therefore, my grade will be good.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proponent tells us which KPIs would be used to measure progress: \u201cRate of growth of social media followers according to our organic marketing strategy / number of people selected from around the world to be ambassadors for KemiLand / MVP progress and its conclusion / Number of user feedbacks about the MVP\u201d. But how would all this information come to the knowledge of members of the Cardano community? It is critical that a bridge is established, in my opinion, and that information is reported on both the partial results and the work behind it. We know how the work routine of professionals would be, information that is passed on in the budget explanation part. It would be very positive if, at the end of each month, the proponent made a summary of the updates, including: if the activities delegated for the month were fulfilled; if the work routines of the professionals involved were followed as planned; if the partial results expected for the month were achieved, that is, we understand how the advances and the overcoming of difficulties during the stages would be. Regarding the final results, all the topics mentioned are about the game only (\u201cGets more than 12 Ambassadors from around the world / Social media followers exceed 15,000 / More than 100 user comments, 75% of which are positive\u201d). But how could we understand what the benefits of the project would be for Cardano? This is difficult to measure, since the proponent already makes it clear that in fact our blockchain would only be associated with the game in future phases. Unfortunately, I can't think of ways we could measure how the project would be impacting our ecosystem. Maybe the only way would be to have a very solid notion about the success of the game and the chances of it becoming popular, when it's well adopted, the chances of Cardano being evolved and from that moment we can audit what would be necessary in relation to our ecosystem: increased Ada in circulation, but digital wallets like yoroi, typical of Cardano, but CNFTs, more active members of our community, etc. Finally, I suggest that the proponent and his team can get together and think about this way out, after all, if funding is obtained, it is necessary that a return is made to Cardano, that the project works towards popularizing and benefiting our blockchain. Therefore, unfortunately, this topic also has a lot to improve, the suggestions given here could be added to the team's own ideas so that a very thorough and adequate follow-up could be done.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 7, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Egypt is in the early stages of incorporating public blockchain platforms, we think if we introduced Cardano via KemiLand we could bring attention to Cardano in our surroundings.  \n\nOur expectations are that the game will be successful once rollout to the selected countries, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t invest effort and money in building it, But I agree that this doesn\u2019t confirm success or failure to attract the general public or ambassadors(GateKeepers), our only option was to build the MVP and seek feedback, and we are trying our best to minimize the budget required to create somehow attractive output for the general public. That was one of the reasons we avoided incorporating blockchain at this stage. \n\nFor the KPI measuring I agree with what you proposed, we must consider more detailed activities when evaluating the progress. That was handled internally now we should consider options to make it available for the Cardano community as well. \n\nI really appreciate the time and effort in creating this assessment,\n\nOne last remark, our long vision for KemiLand is a platform where we empower humans to collaborate, build, and educate.

The project will use the fund to create the MVP however the ADA community will have no control what you\u2019re going to do next. The proposal might grow and work and use the blockchain afterwards but funding now does not guarantee another funding (and development of blockchain solution to this project).\nb) Africa: Creating a gameplay which simulates the Ancient Egypt does not seem that helps the Africa community. It won\u2019t develop its infrastructure, education, won\u2019t obligate the onboarding of Africans in the ADA community, won\u2019t be an African project etc. More than that, the Egypt tourism represents around 3,5% of its GDP (https://www.worlddata.info/africa/egypt/tourism.php) might decrease because several people might not travel to its location due to the simulation \u2013 and the problem statement actually tackles this as a problem.\nThat being said, I do not think that this project is tackling the challenge.\nIf the project does follow, to the next fund, the idea of implementing the blockchain in this gameplay, it might be very good to the ADA community. The metaverse size value is projected to grow from USD 100.3B 2022 to USD 1.5T in 2029 (https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/metaverse-market-106574), and having a percentage in this market won\u2019t be bad.\nBesides that, the people who will use this service will be the antiquity lovers (which visit museums) and VR/metaverse enthusiast.

However, since the ambition is a simulation, i.e., it must be very accurate with the reality. Therefore, I missed a mention in a historian and an archeologist to be part of the team or just to testify that the development is coherent with reality. That being said, might be interesting plan some investment to consult such professionals since it\u2019s not the field of this team.\nThe plan organization/roadmap seems fair. The budget, as mentioned before, should predict an expense with professionals to validate the simulation (it would add credibility to the project) and also an expense with marketing/disclosure.\nIn order to make the project grow, it depends on the action of some \u2018ambassadors\u2019, which are some selected people around the world (that has no explanation how they will select) which have VR setup or are willing to acquire one, and these people must promote it to the local surroundings and convince others to try it.

We also must consider millions that wish to have such a similar experience and don\u2019t afford the cost of travel. \nThe reason to pick the imaginary royal palace was to avoid deep discussions about the historical aspect of what we are building. Future restorations include restoring existing monuments and definitely the need for a historian and an archeologist will be a must. \nA very valid point about the risk of the ambassador(GateKeeper) role was raised, we don\u2019t have to conduct contact with them, and our business model is much simpler, (But still in a future release of KemiLand) to issue tickets to KemiLand for visitors they must hold one of our GateKeeper avatars which are the only one permitted to issue visiting ticket to KemiLand(I really appreciate sharing any unforeseen conditions where we must create contact with them). They are the one deciding ticket price according to their local market, we only maintain a constant amount for any issued ticket regardless of the price GateKeepr decide.  \nI prefer organic marketing my self, at least in the earlier stages of the project, where we are seeking a close connection with believers on the project. \n"}, {"id": 2410, "q0": "According to what was conveyed in the presentation of the idea, we were able to perceive a certain alignment with the goals of the challenge in which this proposal finds itself. However, for this alignment to actually take place, it would be necessary for Cardano's technologies to be more directly used, and we believe that this use will only actually take place in a future phase of the project, if things go well until then. This makes it difficult to say that the proposal fits perfectly into the goals of this challenge. But in fact, if the project succeeds, we will have a very original way to increase interest in the African continent, as well as in the technologies used by Cardano in this project. This would be a great way to introduce the Cardano ecosystem to people unfamiliar with the blockchain concept and perhaps even unfamiliar with technology in general.

It would be interesting to mention the possibility of the project not achieving sufficient visibility, which would result in the non-existence of future development rounds with features related to Cardano, and it would also be interesting to expose some way to mitigate this risk. Another point that deserves attention is the role of ambassadors, apparently they will have a very important role in the propagation of this product, but we feel that such an important point of the project could have been better developed. Regarding the stages of the project execution plan, we noticed a good logical chain, with actions that gradually become more complex. However, in relation to the budget distribution for these steps to be carried out, we noticed that perhaps the amount being paid per hour of work for different functions is too low, and with a possible readjustment of these values \u200b\u200bwe would have a higher total budget cost.

This is a continuation of previous plans. I read your proposal in Fund 8, impressed with the team members who are all good experts in technology, architecture, design, and graphics. However, I still have a comment for the presentation of the members' identities. That is, there is still a member who has not made his identity public via social networks (I do not see a link linking that member to the social network). My advice is, that the team should soon add in the missing parts to publicize the full identities of those members to increase the feasibility of the proposal and create a certain reputation in the community. I agree with dividing the small budget into team items. This is great for increasing feasibility and ease of auditing. The team has taken steps to follow a certain sequence, clearly like the proposal in Fund 8, I have no opinion on this part. I was just wondering about the resources needed to do it, while the amount of work was huge - it involved the entire history of Egypt requiring sufficient personnel. Along with specialized expertise in the fields that meet the requirements of the job, with the existing staff, you can be sure that the team will implement the proposal smoothly and as committed. ? I want the team to analyze more about the technical aspects of technology, the language used in this proposal because if done so carefully, it will significantly increase the feasibility.

I would like to comment, that to prepare personnel well, the team should carefully develop the steps and work sequence, from which to make a plan early to find the right person for the job requirements.

This represents a very serious attitude towards a proposal concerning the traditional historical and cultural values \u200b\u200bof a very famous country in Africa. The team identified three factors to evaluate the success of the project. That is the number of ambassadors, social media followers, and user feedback. Can you explain to me on what basis you chose these 3 criteria to evaluate the success of the project? What about KPIs? We all know numeric KPIs are used to measure performance, but it's a shame that I don't see the team showing that on this bulletin board. I recommend adding KPIs soon to further improve the auditability of the proposal. In addition, it makes the PA community more confidence in the implementation team.
