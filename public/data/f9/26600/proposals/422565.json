", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The main problem - whic it's mentioned in the risk possiblity part - is finding the right fit canditate for this role. So it's kind of complicated to assess how this ambassador will execute his/her role, given that we know nothing about his/her experience and track record. It'll be good to know at least some candidates, or better know who'll be this person.\nAlso, they don't present a detailed breakdown plan, with the activities that the Cardano NFT Ambassador will execute. It'll be good to know more about this.\nLastly, they've mentioned that for executing the proposal they'll only need a one-time funding. However, they don't explain form where they'll be bringing the money to continue paying this Cardano NFT ambassador once the 6-month period is finished. I'd suggest to clarify if the person in such role would be fired, or would continue being hired as a JPG/CF representative of Cardano in Africa.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I somewhat agree with the information provided to being sufficiently auditable. However, it'll be good to add some KPIs indicators, such as numbers of african artists onboarded, successful projects deployed on cardano from native africans, regions or number of countries onboarded, number of collaborations with local projects within and outside of Cardano's african ecosystem, etc.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2121", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1090, "q0": "Through this proposal, the number 1 marketplace on Cardano in terms of sales volume, JPGStore, is asking for funding for hiring an on-the-ground African ambassador for NFTs. The main task of the ambassador would be to locate artists and creators from the African territories and onboard them to NFTs.\nWhat is unclear though, as there is not much more information provided throughout the proposal, is what other steps JPGStore will take to ensure that the artists and creators will gain exposure and potential success? As an NFT artist on Cardano since last year, I know that half of the work starts after artists mint their NFTs. For example, there is another NFT marketplace on Cardano, developed by EMURGO. The marketplace, called Fibo, has been vetting and onboarding, African artists, on their platform, and has been promoting their art through all their official channels. Yet, I do not see an appeal or even a subject of discussion around this subject throughout the Cardano NFT community. As such, how will JPGStore address this issue? Or will their onboarding stop at the moment the artists will be minting their NFTs?\nWhile I see potential in this proposal, given the lack of details surrounding its primary objective, I cannot accurately assess its impact and suitability in the challenge metrics.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The detailed plan and timeline describe in one single sentence, that the project will revolve around the duties of the ambassador over a period of 6 months. However, what those duties are, has not been explained. For this type of proposals it\u2019s important to have an accurate description of tasks, even if it\u2019s incomplete, to help us, the community, assess the implementation steps. For example, how will the ambassador find and contact the artists? Will he travel to different locations? Will he be searching online? Will he announce in a public (online) place that he\u2019s looking for artists?\nThe budget has not been broken down, is very short and without any details. The description states that the budget of $40000 will be used to pay the salary of the ambassador for 6 months, as the team views that such a person would need to be paid with an annual salary of $80000. I do not know how the team has come up with this amount, while I understand that they want to compensate their ambassador highly, the annual salary on the African continent ranges from $1000 to $25000. Even if the intention is to pay someone well, they could still get at least 2 people hired as ambassadors from the requested amount and that might translate into a much wider reach across the continent. But since there are no other details on this subject either, I cannot properly assess the budget\u2019s feasibility.\nThe ambassador remains to be hired after the proposal is funded, therefore no name or description could have been provided. But, what could have been provided, as I\u2019m sure the team has already thought about this, is what kind of skills does the person need to have in order to be accepted for this task? And how much influence will that person have on the entire endeavour?\nGiven all the missing information in all fields of the feasibility section, I cannot accurately assess the proposal\u2019s implementation.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The onboarded number of artists and creators is definitely one of the most important factors to track for the project\u2019s progress. Perhaps, though, some metrics regarding how many artists have been contacted and how many of those have accepted to join the NFT space would also be an interesting metric, both for the progress of the proposal but, also, as an important data point for the NFT ecosystem.\nWhile the success definition sounds very good, it has unfortunately no palpable accomplishments. For instance, as a continuation of the sentence provided, that mentions having an NFT ecosystem where African artists thrive, a minimum number of artists to have financial success after their onboarding operation is what I mean by palpable. The number doesn\u2019t need to be high, it needs to be realistic, so that is up to the proposers to decide.\nConsidering the data provided, I rate the auditability section a 4.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 2, "ng": 11, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4156, "q0": "Whilst the concept and idea of using an ambassador to lure more people in Africa towards using NFT's on Cardano there are some flaws to the the proposal is presented.

The ambassador will  seek out local artist and creators within African territories and onboarding them to NFTs space. This will boost Cardano NFT adoption in Africa. The ambassador will act as the connecting person between artists and facilitators who bring cultural diversity to Cardano. The risk in this project implementation is finding the right ambassador who possesses the right blend between technical and artistic skill with community building experience to scale this project impact. With the direct experience as ambassador myself, I understand the importance of this role in promoting the protocol. The fair and transparent incentive structure is significant for this role and should be added in this proposal.

It's a one-time proposal and they are unlikely to seek further funding round. The proposal will get its full ranking in the feasibility if they would identify who is the C-level executive that would be interviewing for this role. I find it quite surprising that the person who fill this role normally would enjoy a lot of interaction with the local community and not from the candidate selection in top-down style. The proposer team should reconsider the approach in candidate selection. I believe that it is highly likely that jpg.store would locate the right ambassador to fill this role and for them to achieve their milestones within the required timeframe. They might need to fine-tune the approach and provided the clearer milestones (monthly milestone) for this ambassador role to measure if the ambassador duties are on track to make impact to the community.

Since this is a catalyst funding, the jpg.store could report back regularly the progress of their CNFTs promotion via the ambassadors on their public channel so the community wouldn't lose sight on this proposal success. The selected ambassador could do story telling to share their experience with wider Cardano community audience upon fulfilling their 6 months role.

A Cardano ambassador with extensive knowledge of NFTs and Blockchain technology will be a fantastic solution to this situation.\nThe result will be that the majority of African artists will learn about the NFT marketplace, post their creative works there, and be able to sell and profit from them. Since it's a Cardano marketplace, artists who sign up automatically use the Cardano Blockchain and coin and participate in the Cardano ecosystem (ADA).\nThe ecosystem will see a rise in participation, and creators will be compensated for their work.

Especially CNFT's will utility that can help financially. Their plan is to hire an on-ground ambassador that will go and spread the news of JPG.Store and Cardano NFT's. The idea of this is to spark interest in African people and introduce many to the idea of NFT's and Cardano. Especially for those that have the interest, but don't have the means to do so.

With the motive being to fuel adoptions in Africa as well as driving sustainability that derive the innovations of blockchain, I believe this project is set on achieving this initiative for the Cardano ecosystem growth. For a successful integration, I believe it is very commendable that the project is focusing on the arts and NFT trades.

If Cardano can spearhead this movement, it stands to gain credibility as an African community lead and an ecosystem that drives sustainability in Africa. Not only can artists and blockchain enthusiasts benefit from the long term monetary benefits in the NFT ecosystem, but cardano drive to integrate working ideas can be beneficial to Africans onboarded in other aspects of the blockchain ecosystem.
