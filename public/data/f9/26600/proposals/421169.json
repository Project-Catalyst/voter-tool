Therefore, suggest the idea of \u200b\u200beducating them and bringing them into the Cardano ecosystem? Organize educational events between universities in Ghana. The proposal is good and completely in line with the goal of the challenge. Here, the goal of the proposal is to educate and introduce Ghanaian university students into the Cardano ecosystem, spreading knowledge about Cardano to a wide audience, more specifically Ghanaian university students. I see this as a positive. The proponent, in addition to explaining what needs to be done, provides a lot of detail on what will be done. The proposal introduced, described the project and, most specifically, the Implementation Strategy: The plan was to organize two groups of events, one in person and one online. In addition, the proposed team recognized the main challenges as difficulty in marketing the program to our target audience to allow more people to learn about blockchain technology. Second: the general lack of motivation for students to participate in events can be another challenge.

Phase 2: after 2 weeks of funding (September). Phase 3: Marketing and Advertising - 3 weeks (September to October). Phase 4 (October). Post-event - 1 week. and finally the Second Campus Event \u2013 \u200b\u200bLast Week in November. At the same time, the tasks are arranged and explained in detail. We know what work will be done to complete the project. Along with those jobs are the members who are full of skills, experience and have written presentations about each member. We know their identities, roles and capabilities. However, it would be nice to suggest to provide some specific links so that we can learn more about their background, work history, increase confidence in the team's abilities, for what the team has presented. about them. Finally, the budget. The proposal requires $3,950. This is a pretty low budget for the team's proposal. In my opinion, the team needs more budget so that the proposal can be implemented and completed in a sustainable way. The budgets allocated to each job are explained reasonably and accurately.

These events will also help youths identify and explore opportunities in the cardano blockchain which in the long run will help curb the unemployment rates in Africa especially in Ghana where graduate unemployment is very high.
