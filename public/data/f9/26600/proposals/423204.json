The dApp is a payment system by which a transaction can be passed only upon all members' acceptance of the payment. The proposal may face the corruption at play to stop the dApp development. To mitigate, it suggests using smart contracts and a third payment system where members get notice of intended transactions so that they can sign in to agree upon.\n\nI see the real-world solution being impacted upon the use of Cardano Blockchain, and if successful, it helps to increase the number of alternative usage of the Blockchain and may develop its growth. This is in line with the challenge priorities.  This is a practical use of Cardano built on the needs for solving problems affecting Africa. And with this I see it fit into the campaign.\n\nAlthough I see it has impacts on the ecosystem, I am not sure what's meant by a third party payment system for use to circumvent corruption within the co-operative. I am also not clear about the authorisation of developing this dApp for use in the co-operative.

That coincidentally is similar to the answer in the project's progress section. Nonetheless, as I see it, the success from Cardano perspective, is the number of cooperatives and NGOs onboarded to use of the dApp and the number of cooperative members involved in the use and getting to know Cardano is the ideal result.  \n\nBecause of the above, I disagree that the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2631", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 0, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5108, "q0": "The proposal is a $300,000 request from someone who identifies as an agroforesty specialist to develop a transparent payment Dapp for NGOs and Coops.

There are several instances where the funders and charities have found that their funds are not getting utilized as expected and later they would not try attending any other fundraisers making a lot of deserving initiatives never see the light. Thus a dApp to ensure the smooth functioning of an NGO and systematic dispersal of collected funds would be highly effective. However, the corruption inside the cooperative the author proposes could be an area of concern. But if the author is intending to use a third-party payment app to resolve this issue, then I don't see the need for such huge funds for the development of the app. Hence the author might have to take this into consideration going forward.

A thorough budget breakdown could have been more appropriate. Additionally, there is no other information available regarding the makeup of the team assigned to work on this concept, except for their names. Considering that the proposal is coming from a newcomer who hasn't been a part of any other proposal from the previous or this round, makes it all the more difficult to assume the chances of successful implementation.

There is no way to conclude if the milestones and final goals of the proposal meet the challenge's expectations. Even though a large chunk of the fund is allocated for the dApp creation, there is not enough emphasis on the way the community can track the development process of the same. My suggestion to the author and his/her team would be to go back to the drawing board and break the entire proposal into respectable chunks and raise funds for each of them through multiple rounds as the community might find it easy and profuse in seeing agile development stages as proof for further funds.

I would also like to see information transparency in a proposal submitted with the principle of transparency. The same is true for universities and cooperatives in Uganda. There is not enough information about which cooperatives and universities they are and how they will contribute to the project. \n\nFor the budget requested for the proposal, 200,000 dApp development and 100,000 salary/travel phrases do not seem sufficient for the mentioned transparency.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are almost no details on how this proposal will be audited. It is mentioned here that success in solving the problem of corruption and growing financial justice within cooperatives and NGOs will be measured by progress, but it is not clearly stated how to monitor whether this corruption is resolved or not. Through which channels and what path will we be able to see the success of the solution of this problem? How will we be able to observe the payments made to the members and the increase in resources? No information is available about these.No information is available about these.\n\nA very general statement was made about the success of the project: \u201cSuccess is finding a payment system that is transparent and fair, supports entrepreneurship and increases livelihoods.\u201d There is no information in the project about supporting entrepreneurship mentioned here and the explanation is very inadequate. How many members will the project reach, how many cooperatives will this 'intended' success be achieved? \n\nDetails are very lacking, this could be a viable project if fixed.\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_3781", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14061, "q0": "It is proposed to create an anti-referential dApp in which all users must consent to a transaction made by one member.
