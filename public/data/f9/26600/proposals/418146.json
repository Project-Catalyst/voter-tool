A mobile app is said to be launched to make it easier for Kenyans to buy Ada. A tool called \u201cM-PESA\u201d and a digital wallet of the user's choice would be used. It would be important, in my view, if the proponents had better conceptualized what M-PESA is; after doing some basic research, I discovered that it is \u201ca Vodafone mobile banking service offered in Kenya since March 2007, being the first to operate extensively\u201d. But it would be necessary for this concept to be clarified along with the scope of the proposal, so that all readers understand well what will be done. Overall, the idea is that the app will allow users to use a service they are already familiar with to buy Ada, Dapp will provide the option to enter a digital wallet address and will guide users on how to buy Ada and make transactions on the blockchain. What I commented about in terms of innovation is because there is already Binance's Dapp, which is quite simple and widespread for the cryptographic community to carry out this type of transaction. On the other hand, it is very interesting to combine something that Kenyans have already heard about or even use, with a new technology that can often be predatory (complex in the eyes of those who do not know about blockchain, etc.). Another advantage of Dapp would be that, according to the proponents, in addition to buying our cryptocurrency, Dapp will provide a function that will be a listing of services and products that the user could pay with Ada; which is a very interesting idea to increase Cardano cryptocurrency use cases in the practical life of this target audience. For this part, it would be interesting if the bidders had already presented some partnerships with companies that would accept payment in Ada, so we have a good idea of \u200b\u200bwhat kind of business we are talking about. An excerpt that, in my view, summarizes well what the objective would be with the funding of this project would be \u201cto enroll new users in cryptocurrencies through the Cardano blockchain and make them actively participate in transactions so that they become more accustomed to the idea around the cryptocurrency and at the same time make the Cardano blockchain the dominant player in the Kenyan crypto space.\u201d And with that, it is expected that more and more Kenyans will get to know blockchain technology and make use of the tools available, which would popularize Cardano across Africa, as it seeks the challenge, and foster the growth of our active community. Thus, the objectives of the challenge would be directly addressed: the number of digital wallets would potentially grow with the launch of this project; the number of Ada in circulation as well; and if all goes well, more people will get involved in ecosystem projects, which will generate benefits for both them and Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Speaking of the script, I believe this part of the proposal could be more detailed. Activities are reported in a superficial way. For example, we know that the total project would take 1 year to complete. On the \u201cget user category and adoption factors for success\u201d part \u2013 how would that be done? How would users be attracted to the project? How to make the tool popular with Kenyans, how would marketing and promotions be done? Speaking of developing the UI/UX design, it would be important for proponents to situate us in relation to how flows and mockups would be built; as well as how the coding and development process would be done, how the professionals of this sector would work for the final product to be built in the proper way and in the planned time. In other words, in my view, the script is valid to have an idea of \u200b\u200bhow the project would develop in practice, but at the same time our level of understanding is superficial, we cannot understand the specifics of the project, what the work routines of each would be like. professional involved. Regarding the division of expenses, a situation similar to that of the script occurs: the information is passed on in a basic way, it is possible to understand in general how the money would be used, but we do not have a solid understanding of this. Most of the budget - $16,000 of the $33,000 requested - would go towards the salary of software developers. However, what would your work routines be like? How long would they dedicate themselves to the project? What would the hourly rate be? Speaking in terms of research and training, what research would that be, exactly? Who would be trained and with what goals in mind? How would marketing, events and advertising be done? How would the $3,000 set aside for that part be used? What legal expenses would be required for the establishment of this Dapp? We know what it would cost how much, but not why. And finally talking about the team members, we only have two people already defined (Kelly and Ann). Little information is given about each one, so we don't have a precise idea about their CVs, projects they were involved in previously and, especially, if they have any kind of connection with Cardano (and if so, which one). This can be seen in the excerpt: \u201c\"Kelly M (Software Developer): Overall project management, Design and development of the mobile application, Integration work with M-PESA API + Ann Gatende: Research and advise on market and adoption strategies. Manage efforts in product launch and subsequent user focussed events . Lead role in promotion of business partnerships\". We need to know how this duo has experience with the technologies of our ecosystem, so that we can have more confidence that they are prepared to develop this project. The second developer is yet to be defined, as I understand it; ideally, in my view, all team members would already be defined and properly presented. That said, the feasibility of the project is ok, because we have basic information on all topics, and more detail would be important in general.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Speaking first of all about tracking the development process, the proponents say that some tools will be used, such as Asana or Bitbucket. They will be used to perform general management; it would be important for them to explain exactly how these tools work, as some people (including me) may not be so familiar with them. So for us to understand how this monitoring would be done, such explanations would be necessary. It is also said that Dapp development will be sprint and sprint, where each will have deliverables and feature oriented; in addition, the github repository will be available for internal project members to consult the progress (would external members, ie the Cardano community, also be able to access this material?). I believe that the suggested ways to audit the phases are interesting but not entirely sufficient for an adequate follow-up. It would be important that the progress of activities was also monitored, and for that the level of detail of the roadmap could be intensified. Ideally, some member of the team would be responsible for constantly updating the Cardano community on what had been done, how and when. That is, that updates on the progress of tasks, the work of each professional involved, were provided directly to our community. As the team will work with several online tools and have attached a Notion page (a site where we can include texts, images, tables and many other features), it would be very positive if any of these platforms served as a communicative bridge with the Cardano community. Talking now about the final scenario, success is seen here as numerical factors: \u201cat least 1 million Kenyans will be able to buy Ada on the platform and use it for transactions or investments + at least 100 small businesses, in different sectors, will accept Ada ( or a Cardano-based stablecoin) as a payment option.\u201d But a deeper analysis would need to be done beyond these numbers of users, Ada being transacted and companies that would be accepting payment with our currency. Are Dapp users actually understanding blockchain better and getting involved with other Cardano projects? The ideal, in my view, would be for the proponents to carry out a broader study to understand how the initiative would have affected the lives of these people, and consequently, what this would have generated for our community/our ecosystem. How would these people be participating in community activities, if they are? Therefore, I believe that auditability is ok too, the information passed is valid, but as with feasibility, more depth is needed.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3317, "q0": "This is a good concept of attractive kenyan into the Cardano Ecosystem.

Thus, if this proposal is implemented, both Africa and the Cardano ecosystem will grow together. I realize the goal of the proposal is to make it easy for Africans to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, this is a big step forward in information technology - cryptocurrency blockchain because Africa is underdeveloped than other continents. The ease of buying and selling cryptocurrency will gradually increase the number of people who know about cryptocurrencies and use them in daily life. This is an important factor that helps increase the value of the Cardano ecosystem now and in the future. M-PESA is an application built on the Cardano platform, I hope that there will be many similar applications like M-PESA for Cardano to grow stronger and meet the greatest goal that Charles Hoskinson and IOG's mission is to build a better world. I think the team's M-PESA application can be fully developed in terms of features shortly. This will greatly help Kenya in particular and the whole of Africa in general. I have commented on the impact of the application that you mentioned in the proposal in a very appropriate sequence. Initially, it was encapsulated in Kenya, then gradually developed the application for people in the community in Africa. This sequential increase in impact is consistent with the African situation.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It seems that your team is full of high-quality members with experience and information technology expertise. I am impressed with the membership of Emurgo Developer Professional, but one thing I think is quite important but I have not seen you in the proposal is the proof of the identity of the members, specifically the links of the members. a social network containing profiles and photos of members making this proposal. This is important because it increases transparency and feasibility and community trust in the team. I would like the team to add the missing member's profile with a picture for the community to see clearly. The total amount requested by the team of $33,300 seems reasonable for such a potential proposal. If funded, the amount of 33,300 USD will be used by the team to implement the proposal within one year (until 8/2023). The budget allocation is shown in detail in each subsection with the corresponding amount. This is appropriate, making the community believe in the feasibility of the proposal. If the proposal is successfully implemented in practice, I think you can submit more proposals for the development of applications running on the Cardano platform in the following years. The team also outlined the plan and 7 implementation steps, I have questions: Refined market research and Deploy initial MVP version only take place within a month for each stage, is it short and the team does not have enough time to do these two stages for real quality? In some projects, the implementation of this stage takes at least 2 months. Although your staff is highly appreciated for their expertise, I still doubt the feasibility of carrying out these two stages. So can you please describe more clearly the implementation of these two stages within a month or not? On the other hand, this is a proposal that has a lot to do with information technology, specifically the Cardano blockchain. That's why I think the community needs you to explain in more detail the technical aspects, and the technology used to implement the proposal. Regarding the challenges and risks associated with implementation, you have outlined 3 challenges and associated solutions to overcome them, I have thought about one challenge when implementing the proposal in your document. friend. That is, with the elderly, do they easily absorb new technology like young people? Elderly people will have to work a lot with applications, wallets, and digital currencies on the Cardano platform. Are they happy with that? If it is an obstacle, what should the team do to overcome it? I think the team should build a very thorough user guide so that even the least tech-savvy customers can use it. I would like to take an additional risk to contribute: the African community may not or only a very small number of people accept this application. Because of the concept of digital money, digital blockchain is still foreign to the vast majority of people in African countries. Therefore, when implementing the proposal, the team should have videos or articles related to the topic of Cardano blockchain technology, and digital currency to popularize knowledge for people in the African community. Thus, we will be able to carry out both tasks at the same time, which is to improve people's knowledge about new technology and more convenient for the implementation of the proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap and the milestones are quite clear - that is, the proposal will be implemented step by step within 12 months. I just want to ask, why don't you specify the months of the year in which each stage of implementation takes place. Doing so will be convenient for the community to track the progress of the team's work. That is my suggestion. I have read the numbers the team gives when the project is successful: At least 1 million Kenyans will be able to buy Ada, and at least 100 small businesses, of different sectors, will accept Ada. But I think this is the metric you describe the success after the proposal was implemented across all East African countries even beyond East Africa, are you sure that after 12 months of being approved funding you will achieve the success as described or not? Now, are there any metrics to measure the success of the proposal after the proposal is funded? But anyway I still believe in the success of the project. Do you think KPIs are important to evaluate the success of the job? I would say that if the team includes more KPIs, it will be good to increase the transparency of the proposal. This is also what the community wants. In summary, I am very interested in the proposal you have raised.

Most exchanges are either too classy for Africans or have a more advanced way of KYC and as such, having a native means of buying Cryptocurrency will help level these bottleneck and lead to an even better adoption. These proposal aim to build a mobile app that allows users to buy ADA using a payment gateway called M-PESA. The solution is targetted as first approach to Kenyans and since M-PESA already has KYC of over 35M users, it becomes easy to integrate and facilitate payment through their platform. However, my little concern is where the cryptos will come from and how is it guaranteed that users who send back cryptos are trusted and reliable because according to my understanding of the proposal, the payment gateway will not be connected to any known crypto exchange but probably some kind of peer to peer mechanism where only the payment is automated but token issuance is manual. If this is the case, i can only imagine the possibilities of vulnerabilities and inadequacies. Secondly, it is very likely according to the proposal that the app is just a marketplace where ADA can be purchased with Fiat and also other products can be sold and purchased with ADA. In as much as these idea will add value to the ecosystem, i see the need for more refinement to the solution presented to the problem. I see the need for smart contract to automate the sending of ADA after confirming payment and smart contract should also be designed to hold a certain minimum ADA balance at all situation to ascertain consistency and reliability and as such, these proposal does not fit into these challenge criteria.
