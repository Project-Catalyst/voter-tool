However, the adoption rate in the African tertiary sector is very minimal and thus needs to be uplifted, but how?", "f6_no_assessments": 19, "f6_rating": 4.701754385964912, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1624, "q0": "Theoretically, the proposal aligns with the scope of the challenge. Here we seek to fund projects that are beneficial for Africa and for Cardano, simultaneously, and this would be done through workshops that teach what the technologies of our blobkchain are and about Catalyst - which would certainly generate a greater number of citizens from Ghana, specifically, active in our community, generating opportunities and income for them, how much would popularize Cardano in that locality. However, unfortunately, I didn't find this idea all that innovative. The proponent aims to increase the integration of Africans into the Cardano ecosystem, focusing mainly on Ghana - with its inhabitants as a target audience. He intends to hold some workshops covering various topics such as what is Cardano, what is the Project Catalyst, the roles in the catalyst (CA, vCA, proposer, proposal mentor); in addition to other aspects of the ecosystem, such as betting pools, development tools, wallets such as Yoroi, Nami and etc\u2026 The problem that I identify here is that we already have well-established groups on such matters. For example, to teach everything about Catalyst, from what this funding program is all about to the functions we can work on, we have the Catalyst School, a group that has already been funded has several funds and has been active in the community for a while. There is even a branch of the School dedicated especially to Africa. We also have the Wada group, which is already well established in the ecosystem, and which works especially for the support and benefit of Africans. There are many channels on youtube that also address such teachings; I believe that it would be more interesting to partner with projects that already exist, improving what has already started, raising the level of teachings and working so that they can reach more people, than creating a project from scratch, in which all the dissemination work would have to be done. I have no criticisms regarding the planning and quality of the contents that will be transmitted here. It is very positive how the proponent outlines what his role would be both online (\"organize meetings with potential participants who live on the outskirts of Accra to make the fundamental presentation on Cardano. I see LinkedIn as a good place where I can also look for university students, Ghanaian developers and instructors who can be marked as potential participants before their appointments and activities\u201d); and also offline (\"I plan to visit the university's blockchain hubs to give a keynote presentation on Cardano to spark your interests, while scheduling a one-on-one meeting with instructors to run them into a foundation presentation/discussion\"). It conveys a lot of confidence that he has already defined the frequency of the workshops and the teachings that will be transmitted in each one. It is also positive that the proponent already foresees some problems and how to deal with them. The issue here is that there are already several projects in this direction and in my opinion it would be interesting to invest in those that already have a certain base than to start a new attempt at an early stage.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The script is satisfactory in the sense that it gives us an idea, on top, of what will be done. Let's analyze it by parts. Starting with the first month, it would be interesting for the proponent to justify why he needs an office with so much equipment, I believe that providing a computer with a good camera would be enough for the main thing to be done. I fully agree with the need for a fiber internet that is fast and consistent, as well as the creation and subscription of some online tools such as zoom. I don't think that the furniture itself, such as tables, chair, blinds, rugs and air conditioning are Catalyst's responsibility, I believe they are items that will certainly increase the comfort of the activity of recording the course, but that are not indispensable for this. I didn't quite understand why 1 month was reserved for creating the virtual platforms, because creating accounts on youtube, zoom and social media is something fast. When it comes to the development of a website and the dissemination of whatssap, telegram and etc channels, I understand that they are a more complex and time-consuming process, it would be important for the proponent to have explained in more detail how this would all work. What would be the steps, how would the site be developed? We noticed that the team is composed only by him, would he hire a designer and a developer to create this site, or would he do it himself? What tools would you find on the site? When it comes to preparing for the launch of the first series, various activities are required such as \u201cSearch for potential participants from the Ghana University of Communication Technology via a key face-to-face presentation / Add observed potential participants to various social media platforms / Create and deliver workshop invitations to potential participants.\u201d The time is quite extensive (about 2 months) for several activities to be developed, so I believe that more detail would be necessary. Now talking about the team, as I already mentioned, we only have the proponent as a permanent member, we have some information about how he acts in the community (he is a previously funded proponent); but it would also be important for us to know your professional background and how to learn about blockchain, how you intend to transmit this knowledge. In my opinion, the ideal would be for the team to also be composed of a developer, to program the site and take care of the technical parts of the project, a designer and a publicist so that the visual part, UI/UX was well assured and that the dissemination was done in the most assertive way possible. The funding requested is split ok, we know how the money would be used, but the parts could be better broken down. For example in: \u201cWebsite development: 2,000 USD + Marketing and promotion: 2,000 USD + Maintenance cost (12 months): 1,500 USD + Fiber broadband installation cost: 1,000 USD\u201d. Why would each of these parts cost the value that was delegated to them? What would the marketing campaign look like and why would it cost $2,000? In my understanding, for this part to be more adequate, each small value should be better broken down, more detailed. Therefore, we need to know why everything needs such an investment. In general, the proposal is viable, but it will take some small adjustments to make the topic ideal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In terms of progress, the bidder states that he will keep in touch with the Cardano community via telegram, through a chat with the catalyst coordinator and also a monthly report (until the site is finalized - and after that, how could we audit the tasks behind the partial results?). He also states that the series of workshops itself is a means of verifying whether the project is having the expected results; in addition it all provides what are the numerical expectations for participants and Cardano portfolio by series. It also takes into account the channel's success in number of views, I believe comments, subscriptions and likes. In my view, it was necessary to clarify how we could follow the actions that do not directly involve the creation and dissemination of the series itself; but aspects such as: the formation of the physical office, the networking being done with students and important groups in the middle, in short, the entire pre-production process that says about what would need to be done for such products to be created. I would like the proponent to clarify whether this type of information would also be posted on telegram and included in monthly reports, for example. When it comes to success, it is defined as \u201cHaving a strong network of Ghanaian tertiary sector university students, developers and instructors engaged in the Cardano ecosystem, contributing to Project Catalyst and other areas such as SPO and development\u201d; a good percentage of the participants as active members of the Cardano and Catalyst community (and who perform various roles). Indeed, this is what needs to be measured, but how would such data become likely? How can we confirm that such successes have been achieved? Research with quantitative and qualitative data would be necessary to prove whether these scenarios have come true. A simple way that could generate this would be a direct survey of the participants, in my opinion. Understand where they are, that is, if they are applying the knowledge that was obtained, and if so, in what way; became CAs? bidders? Are those in the tech field participating in Dapps development projects, studying Plutus? In fact, was the knowledge passed on, did they teach people close to them the basics of what was studied, so that the people affected could be multiplied, even if indirectly? In my view, the auditability of progress is good, and that of the final results is well underway, but more tangible ways of dealing with what has been said still need to be implemented.

The medium selected to discriminate the series of programs will get the buy-in from the tertiary sector as majority of people within this target market are actively on the various Social Media Platforms like Linkedin, Whatsapp and Telegram. \nOn the suggested name, I strongly recommend the proposers adopt the name \u201cTime with African Catalyst\u201d instead of time with Nana Sarfo right from the beginning of the project. This is because it cause a lot of economic resources (money and time) to build brand names. The amount of money, time, networking, marketing and advertising that will go into building the brand name \u201cTime with Nana Sarfo\u201d should be channeled form day one to building and propagating the Catalyst project hence \u201cTime with the Catalyst\u201d. This will also help to reduce the risk of Consistency in Workflow where other participants will perceive the project as centered around one person. In spite of this, the proposers have provided a thought through guide on the perceived risks that will affect the success of the implementation of this proposal and have provided adequate mitigating measures to avert this risk. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers have provided a detailed roadmap on how the project would be executed with specific activities and deliverables. The sis (6) weeks allotted period for the execution of the project is feasible giving that the proposers have outlined weekly activities aimed at growing adoption to Catalyst activities and growing the ecosystem. Also, the various activities outlined in the 6weeks roadmap are in line with the Challenge setting. Regarding the budget submitted, the proposers should look at the allocation made for office furnishing (USD1139) as against that of maintenance (USD1500). Also, a detailed breakdown should be provided for workshop incentivization to cover cost per head for persons supporting the project over the six (6) weeks period. In addition, giving the experience of the persons going to work on the project, coupled with the roles they have played on other projects and previous funds the Wada community in Africa, they should be able to execute this project to a successful completion. However, since the proposers hope to secure future funding, the promoters should provide a detailed self-sustaining plan with timelines on when the project will be self-sustained financially. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The KPIs and the deliverables seams measurable especially giving the target number of 10 active participant for each of the series outlined under impact. This includes the onboarding of 10 new Cardano wallets in (yoroi, CC Vault and Nami) which can be easily measured. Though these numbers are achievable, it is important for the proposers to upscale on this number of 10 by replicating their sensitization and onboarding activities at various university campuses. Also, looking at the budget request, this upscaling of the targeted numbers to be on boarded on Cardano Wallet is feasible especially when the proposers hope to access future funds for project sustainability and continuity. The proposers have further outlined various channels to communicate progress of the project and provide accountability. This includes Catalyst Coordinator Chat Group, Project Reporting Website and the submission of monthly report to the community. In spite of these deliverables, I will recommend, the proposers add to their deliverables the total number of persons they hope to sign on at the end the project. This should include the number of proposals to be submitted from this target market, the number of Proposal Assessors to be on sign on etc. \t", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3352", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12055, "q0": "This is the kind of project I highly support!Catalyst should fun individuals who wish to make a business out of building Cardano.\nAdditionally, doing so within the African continent is surely to be beneficial.

At the offline workshop, the team proposed to reach out to lecturers, with online seminars, the team aimed at students.

All the processes can complete because of the much-experienced team.\nHowever, the implementation team is experienced in Catalyst projects, but the team does not disclose the relationship of these people to the universities.

I personally have been on his workshops and those workshops have actually encouraged and motivated me to be part of the cardano community.

The team has vast experience in the Cardano ecosystem, 2yrs mentorship and guiding most of the new African community members through Wada and also some personal workshops, they seek to provide a Cardano based learning and onboarding ground for students, developers, instructors in different tertiary institutions through various social media channels by creating/organising series of workshops.

If this problem can be solved, it will have a great impact on the education of students - the continent's current young intellectuals, and teachers in universities, and indirectly increase the value of the ecosystem. Thai Cardano. Thus, the proposal is seeking to solve the goal set out in the Challenge, although it only solves a small part of the many problems that still exist in Africa, but has a great impact. Proposed objects of direct impact are university students, teachers, and school leaders. Because they are the intellectual class in society. If this proposal is successfully implemented, it will open many opportunities for Cardano and Catalyst. In the long term, it is possible to scale up and solve many challenges in the future. Because young people in universities have access to the door of knowledge. I strongly agree with the author of the proposal when it comes to a direct impact solution, which is to create webinars for college students, developers, and instructors.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I'm impressed with the proponent's work experience in many positions: consultant, educator, etc... You have 2 years of experience in advocacy. This is very beneficial for the implementation of the proposal. Because this proposal when implemented is highly educational and motivating for people to be able to recognize and absorb new technologies (blockchain Cardano, Catalyst). Although the number of team members listed in the proposal is not much, everyone has full experience related to their major and everyone makes their identity public through social networks. Especially, there are members from the Wada organization - an organization representing Catalyst that stands out for its activities that benefit society in Africa. These factors contribute greatly to the feasibility of the proposal and build the significant trust of the community in the team. Based on the detailed budget analysis, I can see that the team has carefully calculated to request the amount of funding. In my opinion, that amount is reasonable, not much, not less, and completely consistent with the current price and current work if the proposal is approved for funding. I believe the proposal is workable once you have considered all the factors to come up with this budget analysis. Budgets are broken down by items from the smallest things (costs for tables, chairs... to social media). I commented that the plan and implementation method has become simple with members who have experience in advocacy and in organizing the implementation of Wada's proposals. I find it very reasonable that you choose the first development point in your home country of Ghana, then if successful, continue to proceed in other countries. However, can you explain to me why you chose to implement the proposal by creating introductory videos about Cardano and Catalyst? Organize online and offline seminars... Is this the way you've used in the past in education and advocacy? When I ask this, is it because the above jobs require a large investment in human resources, but can it be done in a team with a limited number of human resources at the moment? If so, do you have any solutions to ensure the number of human resources to implement the proposal? I mean the resources needed to implement (the number of people must be qualified, qualified to implement the proposal). I strongly urge you to review your personnel situation to be eligible to implement the proposal if funded. In terms of technical aspects to implement the proposal, I consider it not superior to have a full grasp of blockchain-related knowledge of Cardano and Catalyst, and skills to create videos and organize webinars, offline. Regarding risks and challenges, I agree with the possible risks mentioned by the team (internet, attendees, consistency, inflation...). If inflation risks occur, how will the team manage them? Is additional funding required? In summary about the feasibility of the proposal, I fully agree and affirm that the proposal is feasible when applied in practice.

The community can rely on it to more easily check the work progress. Although I have researched very carefully, I still do not see the KPI in this proposal. Why didn't the team include KPIs in the proposal? I have advice for the team to add more KPIs. Because that is the basis for proving transparency and making it easier for the community to audit. On the other hand, the team has provided key metrics, I recognize this, I consider it a standard to evaluate the success and evaluate the team's work completion level. If you have both KPIs and key metrics, that's great. I wonder about the number of At least 10 active participants for each series. Is the standard too low for the scale of implementation of the proposal? On what basis does the team choose the number of 10 active participants? Why not more than 10 people?

I see that impact in this proposal clearly. \nThe idea of using the online workshop methodology to implement this project is very useful and indicates that the proposer clearly understands the rate at which lifestlye is translating into digitalisation. I see this to be  very impactful as it would allow participants from any location to be able to join the workshops. All they need is internet access and they are good to go. However, the proposer is unable to indicate whether or not he there's going to be any form of motivation for participants and I think it could have been addressed as a form of risk mitigation for \"Attendance\". This doesn't compel me to deduct a score though as I still see that the challenge has effectively been addressed by the proposal.\n\nUpon reading the proposal, I could hardly find loopholes that need to be filled up by the proposer as far as 'impact' is concerned and hence I give it a score of 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Nana Safo who has been a member of IdeaScale since March 10th, 2021, and having risen through the various catalyst ranks makes me believe that he has the requisite experience to be the main host of this project. I can personally attest to his experience as I have attended some of the previous workshops and events hosted by Wada where he presented on Cardano Project Catalyst. He does his presentations with a whole vibe that is rich in the African culture and well understanding too. \n\nWhen I visited the Wada website for the first time, I loved it. The interface and reactions to button clicks were amazing. I was wondering who that creative person is and I never knew until I read this proposal only to realize that Daniel Lezu is the engineer behind that awesome website. I don't mean to praise him but per his profile and previous work done as far as the Wada website is concerned, I have no doubt that he will be able to handle the website management position being assigned to him on this proposal.\n\nRichmond Oppong on the other hand who is the marketing and design lead for Wada as indicated on their website and in this proposal also does a great job as far as marketing and designing are concerned. I have had the chance of seeing some of his designs and they were amazing. Further research conducted on him also teaches me that he's the designer for the Catalyst African Town Hall and also has hands in their marketing sector as well. This and many other findings leave me with no doubt he is able to deliver his role on this proposal.\n\nWrapping the experience needed for successful implementation, the proposer clearly understands what experience is needed to aid the successful implementation of the project and hence has formed the right team. This team has the requisite experience to implement the project successfully.\n\nThe budget looks feasible to me. This proposal has a well-broken-down budget that details exactly what would be needed and at what rate(price). For purchases that will be made, the proposer has done a good job by providing links to the shops purchases would be made from. These two shops; Telefonika which is based in Ghana and Amazon which is international are by far, one of the best e-shops you can trust with the quality of goods. I have personally done some shopping from these shops and I loved the products!\nThe budget and its breakdown are reasonable for successful project implementation and hence feasible.\n\nWith a simple but detailed roadmap with clear milestones, the level of project implementation understanding for the team is very high. It depicts clearly that the team knows what to do and when to do it. A 30-day period for workshop preparation is indeed needful as of course, a lot of people are skeptical these days and require further engagements to accept an activity.\n\nThe proposer also indicates that he will further require funds from Catalyst for subsequent iterations and I think his reason for that is absolutely fair. however, he discloses that he is also open to suggestions and I would like to suggest that he can make use of YouTube monetization to gather some funds to help the project\u2019s self-sustainability.\n\nAll links in the proposal are functioning and lead to the appropriate content. A YouTube link in the proposal, after clicking taught me that \"Time With Nana Safo\" has been done before. The contents were on point but I realized that there were technical hitches that could be due to poor internet or digital gadgets. This makes me believe that a portion of the budget being allocated to cater to the problem is essential. Once the workshop has been hosted before and is evident to the YouTube link provided in this proposal, it shows clearly that this proposal is doable.\n\nAll of the information above helps me to confidently conclude that this project is feasible.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer has done a good job by answering the two fundamental questions under this criteria. He has answered the question of how and what would be measured to determine project success. He provides clarity in his answer by mentioning exactly how the community can get along with the project\u2019s progress which is to report the initiating progress upon commencement of implementation via the Catalyst Coordinator chatroom on Telegram which is open to all funded proposers. The inclusion of the monthly reporting to Catalyst through the form means that the community will have direct access to information on progress regarding the project.\nThe idea of developing a website to report progress is a good idea which I think will help the community be educated in style on what's happening with the implementation.\n\nThe metrics to measure are quantitative and well explained where not.

It's very good to see there's already a sort of course syllabus with an already pre-defined topic for each session, including a necessary introduction to blockchain and cardano at the begining, before deep diving into catalyst. Risks are properly identified as well. The main challenge, the internet availability in Ghana, was already perceived by proposer, which is key for this project to work. A demo video on a introduction to ideascale is provided which helps to illustarate the course (sound quality is not so good but proposer says in feasibility section he intends to buy new equipment)\nAs minor suggestions, there were already other funded proposals , in past funds for creating cardano/catalyst workshops. It would be nice if proposer could get in touch with these funded proposers to collect their lessons learned and apply already to his reality in Ghana. Moreover, it is also essential to collect feedbacks from attendees at the end of every section to improve/adjust as it goes, not just at the end.
