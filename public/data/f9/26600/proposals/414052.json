Proposal is generally well strcutured explaining well what the tool will have and how the different feautures in it will integrate. It's nice they consider 2 moedules: a basic one, focused on begginers and with cleaner/easier UI/UX design and one for pro traders, with more complexity. As a personal experience, I had a lot of difficulty in the beggining using the current exchange available in the market due to its complex UI/UX. It's good also to see that the initial target countries were already selected. In this sense, The proposal is aligned with the challenge as it can potentially increase challenge kpi \"Number of proposals addressing the fundamental issues preventing Cardano adoption in Africa\"\nThe whole project is divided into 3 proposals: 1 for the exchange (This very proposal assessed here), 1 for payment processing and 1 for the crowfunding portal. Going through the other proposals, it's possible to see that the content is exactly the same. I dont consider this much of a problem as its possible to understand what is going to be developed in each by their names and in the proposal itself. However, it could be clearer here if the project can go foward if one or two do not get funded now and this would impact the final product . Other thing that could be better explored here is how their marketing strategy will happen to reach the right people and organizations.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There's a very solid timeline provided. However, as pointed out in impact comment, the whole project encompasses 3 proposals and the timeline is the same for them all. I understand that the ideal would be to develop them all together as one single project, but what would be the timeline if only one proposal gets funded? how different it would be? this particularities would be nice to see in each of these proposals to understand how they work as standalone developments. The same comment stands for the budget breakdown (the breakdown is the same for the 3 proposals but the number requested is different). Overall, it is well done but it considers the whole project get funded together (3 proposals). It would be nice to see what part of the budget would be applied to each proposal. Naturally, some budget lines are common for them all (for instance, office equipment) but others may not be and this distinction could be clearer, specially considering the budgets requested are different for each one. (one note on budget is that proposal run out of time on editing and it ended up with no budget in the proposal. However, he provides it fully in the comments).\nRegarding the team, it is composed of 5 people with backgrounds in management, media and software development. Their roles are clear linkedin links are provided. However, it could have more details on their past experience.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are very good kpis and milestones proposed for auditing this project. It's good that most of the metrics have targets and are time-framed. This helps to track progress throughout time. One extra thing I'd add here is a way to collect and measure users feedback from the platform, at least in the first months, to track quality and improve it in the next months.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2461", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 1, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4025, "q0": "The solution proposed fits the challenge in the sense that it would foster the adoption of Cardano in the African continent. By having a cryptocurrency exchange that accepted fiat currency from the African countries in an easy and not bureaucratic way more people would be compelled to use cryptocurrencies and eventually more people would enter the Cardano environment, directly or indirectly because of its growth. The metrics outlined in the proposal align with this objective because by having more new users, a bigger transaction volume, more active users and more funded projects through the crowdfunding platform, it would mean more adoption of cryptocurrencies and more people integrating the Cardano environment. However, the proposal lacks a plan for future sustainability. They could have explained how they intend to develop long-term sustainable revenues so the company continues as a going concern and do not depend upon future funding.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team described seems to have the necessary experience and skills to implement the project. The LinkedIn pages of all 5 engineers was provided in the proposal and their experience sounds relevant to the needs of the project. The total necessary budget is pretty significant, but the team has asked for only USD 150k of the USD 350k. They claim the rest will be asked in future fundings. Also, this USD 150k is broken down into three different proposals and this particular one asks for only USD 55k. This raises a few questions. First, why only USD 150k of the USD 350k? If this present proposal is not successful will the team give up and basically just use the money without any returns to the community? Second, why break down into three different proposals, what happens if one of them is not funded? Also, the budget is designed from Jan 22 to Jan 23. We are already in Jul 22 so has the project started before the funding or will those dates be shifted? The timetable provided does not seem realistic and the milestones are too aggressive to be completed in the timeframe proposed. Another point I really missed in the proposal is how they manage to operationally put in place a platform that will integrate with the financial sector of every African country. They have stated that they intend to offer the option of accepting fiat money from most of the African countries, but to do so they will have to integrate with the financial system and all the regulation that comes with it from every country in the continent, which is not an easy task.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is a roadmap with pertinent milestones but they sound too ambitious for the time horizons provided. For example, 10 thousand users in 3 months would be extremely challenging to achieve. Also, it is mentioned that the goal is to accept fiat currency for most of the African countries. Each new currency accepted by the platform is a challenge per se so it would be nice to see a milestone regarding that. The KPIs defined are consistent with the stated goals of the project but apart from the number of active users it is not clear which values would mean success for the measures of new users per day, transaction volume and projects funded through the crowdfunding platform. As for the problem targeted, it is clearly explained; the lack of access to ADA in African countries due to the lack of crypto exchanges to serve the demands of these countries and the proposed exchange would address that. Finally, the proposal says they will announce the progress of the project through social media and blog page but provides no links to those and no dates or periodicity regarding when that will happen.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2513", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7509, "q0": " The idea is very good and directly dialogues with the objectives of the challenge, as it seeks to create cryptocurrency exchange platform for ADA trading with local fiat currency in Africa. The authors justify that it is a strategic place to invest and exchange ADA and fiat currency, since it has a high number of participants graduating annually, Africa is also one of the continent that do not know and use cryptocurrencies. I found it interesting how the authors thought about the introduction of crowdfunding portal for fund raising, that is, they don't just intend to introduce cryptocurrency trading in Africa, but to assist participant to raise and invest funds. In this way, participants will attracted to trade on the portal. That was my general understanding of the proposal. What could be improved, in my opinion, would be the introduction of claims and complain portal that will help traders to lay complain and refund money after wrong transaction. I would like to see more detailed planning, that is, specific time for each programs, to provide clarity but not monthly duration for more than one program. But overall, the impact of the proposal is high and fits in very well with what is asked here.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer made a very submission about themselves: they do not only define who they are, what they do individually, what their areas of training are, but also include several links from their social networks, such as linkedin, where we can get to know them more better , and several direct communication channels, where individual contact can be established with each. A lot of confidence in the proposers ability to successfully execute the project is established, most of them are from the software engineering and technology area. I would just like to suggest that you efforts should be made to present the budget on every important activity to be carried out, this will help in cost-benefit analysis, these parts are also very important. There is a very detailed script here, in which we know what would happen in phases, divided into months. which doesn't fit so much in a table, in my opinion. However, the level of detail is quite satisfactory. On the exchange portal, I think this proposal ideally explains how the cryptocurrency exchange portal would be use. In this way, we have an accurate understanding of how this portal would be used. What I suggest here then is just a more detail budget script in relation to the funds is used, otherwise that's fine.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is clarity in the description of the problem, the solution and how the proposal is aligned with them.

Buying ADA in most African countries is a challenge due to the lack of exchanges that support fiat currency trading. The problem raised has very clearly defined the problems of the proposal. Blockchain can help benefit regions like Africa in many ways. This proposal could expand the challenges in the future.

This proposal is well thought out and argued by the author in the current challenging context. The author's proposal has listed the risks that the project may have. The author identifies three main risks affecting the proposal: Fait withdrawal and deposit gateways in Eritrea, Somalia, and Djibouti, regulatory approvals in Somalia, and Eritrea, and Communication difficulties in some regions without speaking English.

They acquire relevant skills in research to give confidence in their ability to achieve their proposed goals in the shortest possible time. They also mentioned a long-term goal that clearly outlines what needs to be done towards that goal, by saying that the proposal is an ongoing process that spans years, and they also address the continuum of Cardano-related issues. The success of the project is clearly described by the author through 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months of work. In the months, the author lists in detail the things to do to make it easier for the viewer to visualize and observe. These successes are directly related to the challenge's campaign. With the arrangement of the launch programs of the team, I see that success will soon come to them. I agree that the country's restrictions on trading crypto pairs on the major exchanges lead to relatively low adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology on the continent so the exchange Their e-wallet was born and supports fiat currency deposits and withdrawals in most African countries.

The solution is to use a manual deposit and withdrawal mechanism to help users use their platform. This technique is used in many other countries where payment integration is not available. This requires legal approval in Somalia, Eritrea. Some countries do not have legal provisions regulating cryptocurrency, so the team will hire a lawyer to fulfill their legal grounds.
