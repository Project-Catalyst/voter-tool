They aim to attend this by, firstly sponsoring 4 artists and creating a comic NFT, which it states will attract looks from worldwide people. This solution\u2019s intention is to diminish the struggle of the artistic class in Gabon by creating a way to them expose their art to the world.\n\nThe proposal is not clear about its implementation, meaning that they do not expressly say that they will use ADA blockchain and neither how the transactions will work inside the platform. That being said, the impact to the ADA community is prejudiced.\n\nAnother point that should be taken into consideration is the fact that it does not clearly say how the marketing is going to be made. The only approach stated is the 4 sponsored Gabonese artist. Therefore, I\u2019m wondering what is the actual impact of this proposal, since there are some NFT platforms already. \nThe proposal would be a greater good to ADA and Gabonese community if it had clearly stated: a)  the mechanics inside the platform (monetizing, transactions etc); b) the marketing (if it was directed to the Gabonese people, respecting their culture it might have a huge impact),\n\nMoreover, there is nothing saying that this platform will be exclusive for Gabonese.\n\nTherefore, I do not see a huge impact to ADA community neither to African community.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "To verify its feasibility, we could verify some aspects, such as:\n\n1 \u2013 roadmap: the presented roadmap is quite general, not giving a clear \u2018time\u2019 definition, neither giving us milestones to follow. The proposal would gain a lot if the tasks were subdivided and was added some important \u2018check points\u2019 in-between. Another good practice is to allocate the person and resources needed to complete each task (not given).\n\n2 \u2013 budget: the budget is also too general. It should be divided into smaller parts and explained exactly what would be needed to accomplish the tasks. To exemplify, it was asked USD 4K to computers, tablets, licenses etc. However, how many computers and why, how many tablets, whoch licenses etc. These information would give more robustness to the project.\n\n3 \u2013 Self funding/scalability: There was not provided a detailed plan to provide self funding (artists rewards, etc) which is necessary to scale the project. The proposal would gain if there was more detailing about NFT monetization and reinvestment.\n\n4 \u2013 team: The team seems solid and with knowledge in their field, however it was not given any link to prove their abilities. Besides that, there is no team member with knowledge in ADA blockchain development nor a budget allocation to implement it.\n\n5 \u2013 artists selection: the proposal aims to select 4 Gabon artists in order to promote the platform, however it does not describe how the selection will be made. Maybe, creating a social media account (Instagram, e.g.) and interact with the public to make them choose the artist.\n\nThat being said, there are some lots of aspects that should be addressed to allow us to verify its feasibility and success.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "To be auditable it must have some points, such as:\n1 \u2013 roadmap and milestones: As said, the roadmap is general and does not present milestones. Therefore it is quite hard to know what to expect and follow its progress. Adding more information in this part should improve the proposal;\n\n2 \u2013 Metrics and KPI: The metric presented is the community growth, which is a good indicator for the platform but not necessarily to the Gabon or ADA. Might be interesting to add some KPI like # Gabon artists, # transactions, volume of transactions. These KPI indicates if the Gabon community is getting results and if the ADA community is getting bigger and increasing transactions because of this platform.\n\n3 \u2013 Channel: there is no dedicated channel to share all the information regarding this proposal.

Crypto and NFT are the current trend in the world, It is not easy for countries that have not developed Internet infrastructure to access and understand all the benefits that this industry brings to localities like Gabon, especially the African.\n\nThe solution of this idea is good, it identifies some of the problems of the challenge, in addition the author of this idea logically, neatly and creatively argues, that African culture in general is a cultural treasure of humanity that other parts of the world need to know about its greatness. Artists in Gabon or Central African countries are a smart and discerning choice for this project. Bringing ART, COMICS, AND NFT IN GABON to Catalyst will help the community better understand African culture through comics, and in return, the project will also be supported by a large organization like Project Catalyst.\n\nThe project highlights some risks in implementation, which will help the community to manage the risks if Funded, in addition, the feasibility of the idea will be better if the author comes up with a solution. to overcome those risks when it occurs. The risk to NFT minting is not too great when we do it on Cardano, as it is designed on the principle of exclusivity, longevity and high security when we update the input information. . for that NFT.\nWhat the community is most concerned about is the risks that the proposal will face during implementation, so it will make it easier for the community to control the progress of the project if it is funded.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Very well, This Proposal provides clear and reasonable timelines for implementation and completion, which, compared with the information provided, is entirely feasible, but the objectives are not yet met. detailed. compared to the potential that the project brings.

The execution part seems to be a bit lacking but the proposed solution fits into the specific challenge category. One more thing I am quite worried about is how they are going to select the artists, it does not say which method for this.

Talking about budget, it is reasonable to achieve the set goals as long as the future profits could help grow the team helping more artists with their jobs.

Web3, cryptocurrency and Cardano has provided these capability through collectibles marketplaces but yet, education and know how is lacking in most African regions. Gabon been one of the rich African countries is plagued with similar problem and these proposal intends to remedy that barrier and create a level ground between artists and the global market to enable them showcase, market and sell their artworks at a global landscape by leveraging the Cardano blockchain powered collectible marketplaces.

The requested budget amount seem relatively high especially with some items in the budget like website development $3k, NFT minting gas fee $2k (I wish to know how many collection team is planning to release and for what time frame to be able to relate and align such gas fee) although there's no concrete plans of team coming for further funding unless for a different need but not same proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Progress can be tracked through the projects online social media community.

A uniqueness that I probably experienced for the first time myself, although I have read a lot of manga, most of them come from Japan.\nIt is proposed to start selecting 4 artists in different fields, helping to diversify products. Artists use comics to tell stories about Africa, combine blockchain technology to spread to the world, a great combination, I'm really impressed with this idea\nTechnological risks, NFT minting, you should join Cardano groups on social networks like Telegram, Facebook, Twitter... is one of the places with the most civilized community, the most talented people about blockchain, they are always willing to help everyone, projects that bring beauty to society and the development of the Cardano ecosystem\nI would be happy to rate this section 5 points.

The detailed budget sheet is quite reasonable, with a total budget of $21,800 ~ 4.4% of the total Challenge.\nThe team consists of 3 members, proposed listed with diverse knowledge and experience in the industry. You should update each member's social network link for the community to check and interact with. I think Benjamin MENDOU is the team leader, he's from Gabonese but working and living in Paris, it's a great intersection, both understanding of Central Africa and approach to European technologies and working styles.\nIn addition, as mentioned above, you should find more NFT-specialized advisors for the project, that will help a lot for the project, the artists don't have to worry much, they just focus on composing.

And you should also create social networking sites, media channels like Facebook, Youtube and Tiktok, they have very high interaction and coverage.

I think there is also a risk that artists and buyers don't want to trade the usual physical art for NFTs, especially as NFTs have been in a delicate situation lately.
