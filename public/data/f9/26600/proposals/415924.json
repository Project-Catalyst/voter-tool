This mission in valuable as the world is facing thhe climate change due to human actions on the environment. \nAs a group, attract them to the cardano ecosytem would be a way to make them adopt it, and through them reach other people, but also given the work they are doing, they may also develop an initiative that would use the blockchain to facilitate their work.\nAs a targeted group adopting the cardano, this may expand to other groups, and go beyond Malawi, where it'll be starting from.\nThe impact is real out of this initiative, and my rating will be of 5 star.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers team comprises people from diverse professional background, for instance Fintech, Cyber Security, Electronics Engineer and some with experience being part of the catalyst project, which gives then an understanding on how the funding process works in the community. \nWhile the idea is genius andn realistic, but I still feel there are some pieces missing for this project to be well implemented. The plan of proposers may have touched on what i'll point out, but as a reader, i don't find that information in the text.\nIn order to translate the information resources, it needs someone who works in the translation field, which is not explained in the text. Unless if one team member who is a Wrier and editor would be the person to play this role6 But this is not mentioned.\nAlso, how will the team train the Pikes members, will it be  through workshops, information sessions or any other approach ? Sharing that information in this proposal would make it more understandable. You are planning on showing the participants about how to transfer their rewards from the wallet to the exchange and finally to their bank account. I would think, setting a staking system would also prevent some participants to withdrawal all their rewards and go away, while the idea would be to keep them active Cardano ecosystem members.\nI would like also to see this proposal identify one problem faced by the Pikes Litter Crew in their daily work, and that may resolved through the cardano blockchain. By solving the issue, participants will also stay connected to cardano through their daily work. Meantime, this may be a second phase of this project in future funding cycle.\nEven though i see how important and successful this proposal may be, I'm rating it with 3 star since they are key elements that are still missing and that could make it more sustainable.\nFor the budget breakdown, the translation cost lacks some information about the number of hours allocated to it and at what cost.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This proposal is straight forward with onboarding a group of people who have already been working together.

And the best way to transmit knowledge is through their native language, and Pikes Malawi Community is not an exception to this approach.\n\nYour suggestion is to provide materials on the basics of Blockchain and Cardano, then conduct training for members of Pikes Malawi Community, and after that, these members will go viral and spread this knowledge to others in Malawi and Africa.\n\nHowever, learning the above knowledge is purely theoretical, so in order to get the most results, the participants must have the opportunity to practice the knowledge they have learned, and if they want to practice, they must be equipped with a laptop or smartphone. Therefore, it is also necessary to consider whether the members of the Pikes Malawi Community already have these devices, if not, there should be a plan to equip or train the necessary technology skills.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "You are expected to implement this proposal within 04 months and divided into 04 phases. At each stage, specific timelines are given along with the main tasks to be performed. However, these jobs are still described in general terms. For example, in Phase 01, you want to train on Blockchain basics, so what will the specific plan be? How to prepare documents? How to communicate, register? What are the class arrangements and assessment methods after each session? It needs to be very detailed and specific for the community to be able to assess whether you can complete the amount of work in the corresponding time period or not.\n\nThe budget for this proposal is $13500, with each cost items are listed in full. In my opinion, this budget level is suitable for the scale of this proposal.\n\nThere are 07 members participating in this proposal, along with the experiences and capabilities of each member are clearly described with verifiable personal information. I believe that with this team, you can completely complete the work as committed.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "To measure such an educational project, the most important indicators are the number of people trained and the quality of training. Regarding the number of participants, I have not seen you mention it, but in terms of training quality, you use measurement metrics like \u201cHave an ADA address, Have a verified Binance account, Has made a transaction\u201d using ADA, Has converted ADA from their wallet to their local currency\u201d I completely agree with the above indicators.\n\nHowever, to evaluate the success of the project, the above indicators need to be accompanied by specific numbers. For example, 50 people are trained, 50 people have ADA addresses, or 40 people Have a verified Binance account,... these indicators will help the community have a basis to evaluate the efforts of members in the community to make proposal can achieve those KPIs.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2678", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9242, "q0": "The proposal presents a clear description of the problem and a solution that has the potential to fully address the issue.\n\nThe author demonstrates awareness that his proposal benefits a limited number of individuals, but clearly presents all the problems of the challenge that are faced by his proposal. Consequently, it is evident how the project can generate value for the community.\n\nIn fact, another point that the author demonstrates to be aware of is the limitation in terms of scale and, therefore, the maximum value it can generate. Basically the project is a pilot that, if successful, allows the reproduction of the playbook for a really wide audience.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The multidisciplinary team allocated to the project has extensive experience and includes a leader from the local community, which greatly strengthens the chances of project implementation.

I like how the proposer has thought about onboarding members into the Cardano community, who are already having a positive impact on our world by fighting environmental pollution. This proposal is clearly in line with the objectives of the Grow Africa, Grow Cardano challenge.  \nWith the CVs provided, I think the team is well prepared to execute this project. They are already targeting about sixty(60) participants in the Pike's Litter Crew( a team based in Malawi that is fighting environmental pollution by helping to eliminate plastic waste pollution). By introducing this crew to Cardano blockchain, they would be helping them by providing an avenue for them to even raise funds to help fight their cause. This can also help create a ripple effect as these participants can help introduce new members to Cardano.\nThe proposer also did acknowledge some potential barriers which may hinder the success of this project, and diligently provided potential solutions that could help tackle such situations. For example, the proposer talks about translating the training resources to Malawi to help bridge the barrier of language since most of the members of this crew don't speak English.\nThe KPI's stated are also closely linked to that of the challenge, and shows great potential for success. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has elaborated a detailed roadmap to help in the successful implementation of the project. Timelines for each phase of work have also been clearly stated. This is going to be a training type of project, so each phase and what will be covered have been vividly stated. The team is well experienced and highly equipped to see to the successful implementation of the project. \nThe budget is well outlined and clearly stated but lacks detailed breakdowns. For example, the proposer could have elaborated more on certain points like; \"Translation of documents to Malawi - $3000\". How will this be achieved? Will it be done by a team member or a hired translator? How much will the charge per hour/words? Another confusing metric is, \"Educating the crew-$2000\" This also lacks a bit of clarity. Apart from these, the overall plan is easy to follow and understand and looks implementable.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The KPI's provided are very measurable and deliverable and could help track the success of the program. The roadmap is simple and easy to follow, making auditing much more effortless. The plan to prepare a closing video that will detail the whole process of work, the challenges, and how impactful the program has been to the participants is commendable and could help future projects perform even better.

The team will translate the document into Malawian so that the community can easily access knowledge, know how to create a wallet, and find an exchange to turn crypto into their currency. This project may at first only bring a group of people into the ecosystem, but I think they can then scale up on a large scale. The team identified the main risks when implementing the project: language barriers, and lack of equipment. But the team came up with the idea to address those risks and challenges very well.

The team will prepare a documentation package on blockchain fundamentals, then help the Pike community trade on Binance, trade ADA, and finally, they consolidate all the work into a complete template and guide so that others can replicate the project. The team's budget breakdown is quite detailed. To improve this proposal I would like to see more specific metrics, for example, \"Translate documents to Malawi - $3000\", how much is paid per translator, per page, or per hour translated?. \"Equipment: Resources for filming - $1000\", how much to buy, price of each?. If so detailed and specific, then I think this proposal will be more feasible and easier for readers to follow and evaluate. The members' experience information is presented by the team and there are links to LinkedIn profiles and related websites.
