In fact, Africa is a very promising continent for us to have massive investment in, as it is a place where blockchain technology develops solidly. However, some obstacles still need to be overcome, and one of the main ones is the language barrier. The proposal launches the idea of \u200b\u200bpromoting weekly workshops that will be recorded and made available on youtube (for those who are unable to attend in person, or even have internet connection problems, which do not allow them to follow the event online). I think each encounter could be better explained. We know that experienced developers will be invited, who will share their knowledge of blockchain and how to create applications that involve smart contracts. We also know that some professionals are bilingual, so they can study courses in English and bring this knowledge to the target audience in the Democratic Republic of Congo, who speak French. But what course would those be, and where would they be available? I believe that it would be enriching for the impact of the proposal if each workshop were better detailed, if we had a kind of pre-defined schedule. We know which topics will be covered per month, but not the specific topics of each meeting. It would also be important for us to know exactly where these face-to-face meetings would take place, in the chosen country, and what the logistics behind them would be like, that is, more pragmatic details of the production, which involve renting space, drinks, perhaps food, transport, etc. It would also be very important that the dissemination mode - which is said to be through social networks - was a little better detailed. For example, will posters, videos, informational texts about the workshops be posted? How to effectively attract the attention of the target audience? In general, the idea is excellent and it certainly achieves the objectives of the challenge well, because once these workshops are done, new students in the areas of technology, design, law, etc. who can join Cardano will be well educated. But I believe that a little more detail regarding the meetings themselves, the pragmatic part of the production and the publicity of the events would add even more confidence in the impact of the project. However, the proposal continues to be well aligned with the objectives of the challenge to benefit both Africa and Cardano, favoring the expansion of our blockchain technologies there.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal's script is a little confusing because it says more about the contents covered in the meetings than necessarily what activities would be necessary for them to become possible. I missed a temporal organization, indicating what would need to be done by whom, how and when, so that 1) the meetings are held 2) the physical space becomes adequate 3) the online content is recorded and made available 4) the dissemination be done properly. Therefore, I think it would be important to establish a more direct temporality associated with the actions that would result in the progress of the project phases, even if its complexity is not so high, the project involves several aspects so that the final product (the workshops) can happen . That said, I consider that the script part leaves a little to be desired, unfortunately. The ideal would be that the activities were really detailed and well related to each other, as well as better situated in relation to the total timeline. When it comes to the budget, in turn, the information is given in a more concrete way, but still without the degree of detail that I would like. For example, $3,000 is requested for the creation of content in French (in this case, the contents taught, I believe, the teachings themselves) and also for the creation of a promotional video for publicity. How much would go to content and how much would go to video, and why? Who would be working here and in what way, for how many hours per month, what would be the hourly price of the professionals involved? In the second part, $6,000 is requested for various things, such as training Saturdays, video editor and trainers. It would also be important to know how much would go for each. However, the asking value is quite reasonable compared to most proposals, I found the funding to be quite fair, I'm just suggesting a few more explanations so that our understanding of it is even more solid. Finally, when it comes to the team, I think that trust is passed on to those involved, as we are told a lot of details about each one of them. We know their names, professional roles and linkedin profiles, their resumes are also included, containing some previous work and also a greater clarification on how these professionals are involved with the Cardano ecosystem. As we know that the proposal is a continuation of an already funded project, trust is automatically passed on to the team, in addition to having a lot of detail about each one of them; with that I consider that this, without a doubt, the best part of the viability. In general, the proposal is feasible, but as I suggested, a greater depth of detail could be done in the script - so that we could understand more precisely what would be done, how, when by whom, etc.; and we could also have a better detail about the financing, as I mentioned the value is very fair, but it does not exempt it from being carefully argued and justified.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Monitoring progress is suggested through the content available online, both recorded videos of the meetings and files corresponding to past teachings. However, in my view, these ways focus on realizing the partial results achieved in a progressive way in the project, but not the production that would be behind it. In my view, it is necessary that the proponents, in some way, keep the Cardano community up to date with updates regarding the preparation of the workshops, how the professionals behind it would be working, how the translated content would be selected, for example, how would be the professionals' work routine, what challenges did they face while carrying out the project... A crucial point for the success of this idea is certainly publicity, so one way to follow this issue would be sharing the reach of the ads and also the process of creation of the material disclosed, for example. In other words, I don't think the proposal is so simple to audit when it comes to its development process, because we don't have such a detailed roadmap for that either. Therefore, I suggest that some improvements and deepenings be made in this part of the proposal. Talking about the success scenario, the final results, we know that the main objective of all this would be that developers from the Democratic Republic of Congo participate in these meetings, integrate the technologies of our blockchain in their projects, that more and more developers are reached and that the community who speak African French will benefit greatly from the project. One way that I thought would be very interesting for us to follow this would be if the developers who participated in the weekly meetings give us some feedback, after a certain time, informing if they are actually using the technologies learned and how, in what way they are applying the Blockchain tools in their applications, such knowledge was passed on to their colleagues as well\u2026 Anyway, how did this influence their daily work. In this way, we could have a very good idea of \u200b\u200bwhether the initial objectives and goals of the challenge were truly contemplated. So this topic, like the previous one on feasibility, is not bad, but it gives us a more basic understanding of how monitoring could be done - further information on both progress and perception of the success scenario would be welcome . In summary, I think that the proposal is indeed possible to audit, but the proponents do not explore this point so well, giving us adequate materials to be monitored periodically.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 7, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "- AUDIDABILITY\n\nThe professionals in charge of producing these videos are selected according to the content to be produced.

As per the Cardano way, which is decentralization.\n\nThis proposal seeks to do just that, by educating Congolese and African developers on Cardano. The proposers intent is for these developers to then create dApps or to integrate blockchain into their existing IT projects.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Reading the scope of this proposal which is quite limited to education of developers, the experience provided by the proposers are plentiful.

It is purely attempting to educate developers and  to enhance their understanding of blockchain and Cardano through French.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Since it is a very simple proposal, the effort to audit is categorically easy. The usual metrics are all there and can be accounted for. An interesting note, since they are developers besides their own YouTube and Telegram channel, a website they also are using GitHub. A stable trademark of project initiated by developers.\n\nThough there is a footnote here, they indeed have identified a very important risk/challenge, which is the possibility of having low tractions. To mitigate this, steps taken are not comprehensive enough or forward thinking enough. One can perhaps utilize an onboarding campaign. Their only method to mitigate this is by promoting in all their social media channel. Since this is already a funded proposal, that would potentially incline they will be saturating their existing proposal target which perhaps resulting in future traction will be limited.

This is an unfunded proposal at Fund 8. I find that the content and impact of the solution in the proposal submitted at Fund 9 have not been changed or updated. The solution content is to establish a Cardano community in DRC to share knowledge and resources about blockchain in French for developers in the region. The aim is to create an environment that encourages African developers to mass adopt blockchain technology and gain more exposure to the Cardano programming language. The team plans to reach more than 300 French-speaking developers across Africa by December 2022. The form of implementation is a combination of meeting online and posting and sharing resources on channels: Youtube , web, group telegram. I appreciate the value of the solution, in an effort to help developers in Africa not be isolated and fall behind in the development flow of Blockchain technology. In fact, Africa is also the area Cardano prioritizes to reach and expand its influence. However, the difficulties our Cardano ecosystem is facing in reaching this area are: expensive internet costs, English is not a common language, many blockchain terms are not easy to understand when translating. into another language\u2026 Consumers in Africa are paying 10-20% of their income per month for the internet, the highest rate in the world (https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/22/ africa/internet-affordability-africa/index.html). In particular, the Democratic Republic of the Congo - the country proposed by the authors to be the first deployment site of Cardano's French-speaking community is also the country with the highest internet cost in the group, up to 20% of the total income. people's monthly income. Not to mention, blockchain documents are mostly in English, a language that is uncommon in Africa. The team also anticipated the risk of poor internet connection and had solutions to overcome such as: storing videos recorded for each online meeting, sharing on youtube. However, I think the team should further consider internet cost risks that could affect the effectiveness of the solution's impact. I suggest the team create a blockchain and Cardano educational directory in French, categorize documents by content topics, store and share them for free to the community through platforms: web, Youtube. The goal is for the masses to have access to this free resource at any time. In addition, I also suggest that the group should add Q&A content, answers and tutorials in addition to the document at the online sessions. This helps make the most of the online meeting time of the French-speaking Cardano community. Personally, I rate 4 points on the impact of the solution because the information given by the authors is concise and clear. I believe that if approved by the community, this solution will make Cardano more accessible to developers in Africa. However, I minus -1 point because the proposal has almost no refresh in content and approach.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Regarding the implementation schedule, the group has described it quite clearly, with a specific timeline. Specifically, blockchain documents and introduction to Cardano will be compiled and posted by the team on the web and Youtube for 4 months, one content topic per month. Every week, Saturday is the time for online training. I consulted the site shared by the team https://uptodatedevelopers.com. The team member information, profile of their experience and qualifications through the link provided to sites such as LinkedIn, Twitter is clear. I learned about the team's information through a number of activities they have successfully organized in Africa in the years 2020, 2021 such as: Updev Challenge for programming training lasting 5-7 sessions for ages 12 \u2013 30 years old, gathering new technology enthusiasts. I believe that, with their proven capabilities and experience, they are capable of successfully implementing this solution. However, regarding the project implementation budget, I suggest the team should have a more detailed explanation. This will help the community better understand how each cost item is used. Specifically: $3000 the team plans to create content in French and a small promotional video. I suggest the team to build a unit price $ for the number of hours of document translation, or $ unit price / production video. Similarly, the cost of $6000 aggregated for 3 categories (16 online training courses, payment for trainers, video editing costs) is unclear. In my opinion, the group should clearly divide the cost of each item, with the unit price attached. For example, the unit price $/number of lessons to be paid to the lecturer. Similarly, how much does video editing cost $/video * number of videos to edit\u2026 I give 4 points for feasibility, the reason I appreciate the solution's feasibility but deducted -1 point due to the lack of unit price for each item in the budget.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding auditability, I think that the community can completely audit the success of this proposal. The reason is that the group has provided links to the group's web and Youtube, where the community can follow the teaching materials and video of the online sessions shared by the group. However, what I find unfortunate here is that the team lacks specific KPIs that measure success. Although, here the team has given the main auditable metrics such as: number of session attendance, number of new developers, follow-up and engagement questionnaires, but there are not any numbers any specific commitment. I suggest the team add in KPIs for each indicator. For example, 100 people are expected to join each online session, 20 new developers join the community every month\u2026 These numbers are very important, helping the community to measure the successful outcome of the project what it will look like.

Aware that projects developed in French-speaking African countries lack information about blockchain technology, the proponent has come up with a strategy with comprehensive and concise information on each stage to address this challenge. The project will allow users to communicate directly with advisors to draw on their expertise by linking French experts via Telegram. This will certainly benefit the continent, as it will provide education for professionals in the field of technology, opening up other opportunities for them. The positive thing is that the team will record the meetings and post them on youtube, contributing to the expansion of Cardano Blockchain in Africa, starting with the Democratic Republic of Congo. Another positive is that they already have a Telegram community with over 130 developers who are African and French-speaking. Proposals are accessible to more and more developers in the long run.

We also know the general issues that will be solved during each month of the project, however, it is a bit sketchy and needs to be better organized. I wonder what steps you mentioned here (rebuilding English classes in French in pdf, PowerPoint, and Creating a small promotional video for the invitation) correspond to the timeline in your plan. friend. So the team needs to add information such as the time of classes, and who will write the content,... The proponents explain to us the areas to be studied each month, and the subject The topic of each class should also be specified separately. Example: \"June 2022: Introduction to Cardano, Blockchain and Smart Contracts\". I think the team should mention the number of meetings that will take place this month? What is the topic of each meeting?... Regarding the budget, the amount requested by the team is 9000 USD, which I find quite reasonable. However, I think the team should come up with a clearer and more specific budget breakdown for the community to follow. For example, $3000 to pay for creating content in French and creating a small promotional video to call for engagement. I want to ask how many content creators are paid? How many editors make videos?

Africa and Cardano's Blockchain. In the current situation, online meetings will be developed between French-speaking and African developers, the project team has come up with solutions to solve the challenge that will invite developers experienced developers with advanced knowledge of Blockchain to share their knowledge in designing smart contract applications. Some bilingual developers can take courses in English and share them in French in the community. This can bring many benefits as it provides education for professionals in the technology field, creating a variety of job opportunities for them. The plus point here is that they do record meetings and save them on their Youtube channel for resources available in French. Usually, people will have a problem with where to find data information from, any specific source, the positive point here is through various social networks that any developer anywhere in the world. A French-speaking country in Africa can join for free. Therefore, this will no longer be a barrier when they want to participate in the project. The next advantage here is that the project team already has a community with a telegram channel with more than 130 developers, meaning there is already a significant amount of people involved in the project. However, this project still has a few details that have not been mentioned: what will be covered and discussed in the meetings, who will be chaired and maintained, who are the participants, and What is the expected outcome after each meeting? I think, if these parts are added, it will make the project more convincing. To successfully implement this project, the proponent also pointed out the risks faced such as poor internet connection quality, and problems related to reaching a large number of participants. However, each of these risks was also foreseen by the proposed team, and proactively taken remedial measures.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has given a timeline, budget, and participants to implement the project, but this plan is not detailed and complete.

Get project information as well as the proponent to conveniently control the workflow. For example, the team will first restore the English lessons in French in PDF and Powerpoint, so how long will this work, and who will be in charge of this work. Next comes the introduction of Blockchain to the stage of UTXO and the account model, here the publisher just stated a rather general plan, for example, June 2022 introduction of Cardano, Blockchain, and another smart contract however here I see, this topic is very broad so how many meetings will it take to complete the intro, what will be included in the showcases and in what order? And the detailed planning for each month should be done similarly for the following periods. As for the budget, the proponent has allocated it for two different purposes. However, I think the proposer should have a more detailed statistics table, for example: in Step 1 will spend $ 3000 to create content in French, so what are the specific contents, how much content is there? content, the budget is divided equally for each content or there is a classification and assessment of the importance and necessity of each content to balance the budget reasonably. The rest of the budget is used to pay the video editor, to pay the coach, so how many hours does each coach teach and what is the salary of each coach or the amount to pay for each edit? How much is the maximum video editing? Regarding project participants, the proponent provided some information about 4 members about their names and positions. However, in my opinion, these contents are still incomplete, the proponent should add more information about work experience, professional qualifications, and job positions that each person is directly responsible for in the project. this and their job suitability. Besides, if possible, the proponent should provide more links so that the community can conveniently check and track team information, helping to increase the persuasion and reliability of the project.

Networking can also have very positive effects on scalability.

For many of us, who either speak a second or third language (learned most probably in school) or for those who are native English speakers, the thought of not being able to learn something because you cannot understand the language is almost incomprehensible. And especially when it comes to the African continent, the barrier is even bigger, caused by the lack of internet coverage or financial resources that would enable gifted children to receive an education.\nAs such, a small project like this one, built by devoted and gifted developers willing not only to translate important resources like smart contracts programming, UTXO, but to also hold virtual meet-ups is laudable.\nFrom what I have seen on their channel and mentioned also in their risk section of the proposal, their reach is not very high. I would highly advise them to also start thinking and taking into account how to reach a wider audience, as I am sure there are so many more other people who would be interested in this subject and who are willing to learn, but haven\u2019t yet found the right source.\nBut, this is more of a suggestion, so I will not be taking any point for it, but I do hope the team will find ways to market their efforts more.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan the team presents is not very detailed, but I find it offers enough information and I am not left with any important questions unanswered. They aim on having live sessions 6 days a week for the 4 months following project funding. They intend to make each session available on their website and on Youtube, which I find to be a very good idea, as that makes it easy for anyone starting their learning journey to find the information they need.\nRegarding the budget, I find it a bit too compact, and even though the amount of money requested is not high, I still feel some additional descriptions would have been beneficial in reviewing the project\u2019s feasibility. For example, I do not have the knowledge regarding salaries in the DRC, so it would have helped me get a better picture if I had the numbers for the estimated amount of hours of content creation, video editing or the number of trainers, etc.\nWhen it comes to the team members, I find the information provided is ample and combined with the Linkedin profile I have been able to acquire additional information that proves the skill and dedication of all project members.\nAs a small downside though, the questions regarding the team\u2019s other proposals from either this fund or previous ones have not been addressed at all beyond the positive answer. Providing more context to these questions would have been beneficial, as maybe some of their proposals are inter-related and as such, they could sustain one another by providing further details.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team makes the progress of their project easily verifiable online through their uploading of the sessions on Youtube and in written format on their website. Since both sites are easily accessible, I see it as a great way of tracking the evolution. The team\u2019s view of success is well described, but lacks any kind of metric, maybe setting even a modest goal would have helped in setting some expectations in regard to the project. However, I don\u2019t see this as a great impediment and since the team plan on returning for future funding, the Cardano community will have a second chance at evaluating the project\u2019s success.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 2, "ng": 11, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 606, "q0": "This proposal\u2019s goal is to create (or expand) a community of developers in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The proposing team already has a community of around 100 participants in their Telegram channel, but they want to increase it, and with this community, run some workshops about blockchain in general and Cardano more specifically. Those will be weekly workshops, ran for 16 weeks, where Cardano developers will share their knowledge about the Plutus and the blockchain technology with the community. These workshops will be hosted in French and will focus the DRC community. Some of the team members will take place as hosts of these workshops, and external persons will be invited to participate as guests. One of the reasons of creating these workshops is that there\u2019s not much information available about Cardano in French, and it\u2019s more difficult for people who are not fluent in English to learn it - even though the language itself is written in English, lowering the entry barrier by translating content is still a good approach. The events will be recorded and made available on YouTube afterwards. This approach allows people who cannot watch in time to watch it later, or even get the file offline. In my opinion, this is a very good proposal in relation to impact, since they are aiming at including 300 new developers in their community. This would have a very good direct impact and has the chance of having an even higher indirect impact, with the people attending these workshops bringing more people to the community. Also, the impact of this proposal is not only limited to DRC, but other French-speaking countries and communities can benefit from it. Since it\u2019s focused on the DRC community, and the team is based there, this proposal is very well aligned with the Challenge. Among the risks mentioned in the proposal, they say that it\u2019s possible that some people wouldn\u2019t be able to attend to the sessions due to limitation regarding internet, but as mentioned this can be worked around with the recording on YouTube and offline files. I\u2019d say that there is also a risk of not having enough participation form the community. I\u2019ve seen other similar projects trying to create something like that but having a lower community engagement than expected. To mitigate that, I\u2019d try to open this for other French-speaking community outside DRC, but still in Africa. Overall, I believe this proposal\u2019s impact might be very high.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The execution of this proposal seems to be quite straightforward: plan the sessions, prepare the material, market the sessions, and finally run the session. The proposing team presented a timeline to execute the proposal starting the session on June/22. This scheduled is very tight, and impossible to achieve, because the results of Fund 9 voting will not be available before August/22 at least. Some proposers do this, and in some cases it\u2019s just a matter of shifting the schedule to a few months ahead. Although, in this case the team has not considered some time to translate the content and to do the marketing before the sessions take place. I\u2019d say these are important steps and at least 1 months should be considered to execute them before the sessions themselves start. The budget for this proposal is presented as lump sums for two different steps: step 1, comprising material creating, and step 2, the budget for running and editing the training sessions. Budget are, respectively, $3k and $6k. The issue is that since the budget is not broken down, it\u2019s not possible to evaluate if it is appropriate. There is not information about how long the sessions are going to be, what\u2019s the hourly rate that\u2019s being paid for lecturers, editors, and there is also no budget for marketing. The latter might be ok if they do light marketing in their social media but would be better to have specific marketing budget to increase the reach and consequently the impact of the proposal. The budget overall seems to be appropriate though, even if the details are not provided. The team behind the proposal are part of the Uptodate Developers, a center for developers based on DRC, and a member from Canada that is part of Gimbalabs, one of the greatest developers initiatives in Project Catalyst. They are leaders of an already existing community, and even if the community is not big yet, this has a lot of value, since they are recognized in their field in their country. The links they provided to their LinkedIn pages make it possible to verify the information provided, and I also personally know one of them and know their work. I believe that this team is very capable of delivering this proposal successfully. The team has been working on previous proposals and has other proposal, which is other cases could raise a warning, but since this proposal might not take that much time to be completed, I don\u2019t think it is an issue in this case.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The way that the community can track this proposal is very simple: check the uploaded videos. The proposers will upload them to their YouTube channel and to their own webpage. They will also provide the content in text format. This is sufficient to track the progress of the proposal. The main success metric proposed to be tracked is the contribution of people who attend the sessions to the Cardano blockchain and ecosystem. Though, this is something very difficult to measure because it would mean keeping track of the activities of possibly hundreds of developers over the next months and years. Even though it\u2019s a good metric, it\u2019s really hard to track it. Possible metrics would be attendance of the sessions, number of views on YouTube, numbers on social media and number of developers who joined the Uptodate Developers community for example, with specific goals for each one of these KPIs. In general, the auditability of this proposal is good, and it won\u2019t be difficult for the community to track the execution and also measure the success, if the KPIs I just mentioned are considered.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2110", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 5, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 13807, "q0": "Creating a French Cardano Community is one of the missing elements in a strong outreaching strategy for Cardano Community throughout the African continent.

Being language one of the biggest barriers in the outreaching African strategy, this proposal effectively addresses the challenge and will certainly transform the Cardano Catalyst African environment.

In the Cardano space,  developers represents the backbone of the its success. Therefore, considering the huge role of developers in the growth and success of the cardano ecosystem, this idea is a great initiative. The intention is to organise educational meetup events for developers in the French community. Due to the low number of developers from Africa, I anticipate that this project would be provide the foundation to scale up the growth of developers in the Cardano ecosystem and Africa. This project presents a clear and coherent solution in addressing the objective of grow Cardano grow Africa challenge. The proposed solution will provide the possibility of not only educating but also introducing developers to the opportunities and  possibilities of the cardano blockchain via the regular meet ups. The value proposition of this project to Cardano ecosystem is to ensurw adoption via the integration of the cardano blockchain into software applications in the French communities. This will eventually increase awareness creation and encourage more developers to make cardano the blockchain choice. Obviously, right from the onset the proposer points out its target audience and subsequently provides marketing strategy to attract developers across the country. However, I think the use of the team\u2019s social media platform to attract developers may not reach a larger audience, especially considering the number of audience the team wants to attract. Therefore I wish the team adopts a more advance approach to attract developers. In my view, I suggest that the team adopt the use online Ads and the use of social media influencers. These strategy would provide a bigger reach to its target audience. Again what\u2019s the long term strategy here? The proposer only indicates that the project would continue indefinitely. But I prefer a more strategic outlook that would make the project a national event. Therefore, I wish the team adopt incentive mechanisms to scale up this initiative and make it more sustainable in the long term .Other than that this is a great initiative.

The proponents presents a thorough plan of what the team seeks to do each month and a well constituted team of experts for the activities to be undertaken. With the information on the roadmap, I think the proponents have presented a clear and concise plan with details about what will be done. We know very well which activities will be happen for each month, however, I notice the absence of a marketing phase within the roadmap. In my view, there should be a conscious effort to attract audience across the country. As a result, I suggest the team include a plan for marketing. In respect of that, I expect that either a marketing expert is hired for this role or the team assigns such a role to any of the team members. To the team experience, I suggest the proposer consider assigning specific role to each team member, to ensure that each person is aware of where his or her expertise would be required during the project implementation phase. Apart from that, I think the teams profile is great, very comprehensive and detailed with all relevant links and documents presented to support the needed information of the team. Considering the vast level of experience of the team, I am convinced of their competence in implementing the project. On the budget, the proponent has not provided a clear information on the breakdown of the budget scheduled for this project. For instance, instead of providing an amount of $6000 for a total of 4 items, for the purpose of transparency, I wish the proponent gives us a breakdown of how much each item would cost. At least with a  specific amount for team members, so that we can tell how much each team member is paid for the 16 Saturdays of training scheduled in the roadmap. Therefore, I wish the team could provide budget allocation to each item on the budget. Again, should the team consider my suggestion  at the impact section on the appropriate marketing strategy for the project, then I also expect a subsequent budgetary allocation for marketing.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It is quite possible for us to audit the process already based on the information made available on the activities that needs to be performed. The available of information on the YouTube page and website provides enough grounds to monitor the progress of the project. In my view, aside the provision of channels that would enable the community access the information on the progress of the project, there are no clearly stated KPIs here. For the purpose of this project, the proposer should think of KPIs such as, the number of developers the team intend to train and the number of views the team expect from their YouTube channel, these could guide the community in monitoring the progress of the project. These KPIs gives more understanding when used as metrics for the progress and success of the project. Even though monitoring the success of a project is very important , it is equally ideal that we know how to carry out this monitoring. In reference to that, the proponent provides a link regarding the channels to access information on the progress report. Aside that, I also consider it satisfactory the attempt to provide continuous update on their channels. This will help access these documents and videos by any individual who could not join any of the scheduled meetup at any time.
