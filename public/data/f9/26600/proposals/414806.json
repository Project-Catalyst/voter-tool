As the concept of Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) is currently being developed and it is deeply related to the concept of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). This proposal discusses the difference between the western concept of identity, considering the individual as a completely separate being from everything else, and opposes this to the concept that was developed by ancestral African cultures, where the individual is part of the whole and their life is deeply connected to the environment around them. The team is proposing the create a series of sessions to discuss this ancestral concept of identity, and how it could be incorporated to the recent developments of SSI and DIDs. This would occur every 2 weeks during the breakout rooms of the African Town Hall. They would bring the community and subject matter experts (SMEs), from Kimuntu, for example, to discuss this topic and figure a way to incorporate it into SSI. Considering the different perspectives in relation to the development of new technologies and concepts is very inclusive and, in my opinion, the results are better overall. The goal of this proposal is not to discuss the technical details of DIDs, for example, but to have a collective brainstorm and use this as input for future developments of SSI. This proposal differentiates itself from all others I\u2019ve seen, in a positive way because it brings the philosophical and cultural aspects to the center of the discussions, and many times the focus is only on the technical side. Also, the proposal fits very well the Grow Africa, Grow Cardano challenge, since its goal is to incorporate elements of the ancient African culture into the development of SSI, and it will be executed by an African team, focusing mainly of the African community as well. The main risk mapped by the team is to not be able to challenge the status-quo of the western way of thinking about identity. The American and European way of perceiving identity has expanded to Africa and most of the population has, unconsciously, adopted it. I see this as a real challenge, but I don\u2019t believe the objective of the proposal will be to convince a large group of people, but to find at least a small group that would be willing to provide their perspective and to work together to define the next steps to incorporate the ancestral African concepts about identity into the development of SSI.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The execution of this proposal will be done in 3 phases, ran in parallel. The first phase will last for 6 months and will focus on creating and strengthening the partnerships with subject matter experts. The second phase will also take 6 months and will focus on hosting the conferences, debates, and discussion about the topic of SSI and ancestral African concept of identity. The last one will last for 6 months as well and will focus on using the knowledge and results obtained from phase 2 to work on an MVP for a DID solution that takes into consideration the context of Africa and its ancient culture. The information provided is a high-level planning for the execution of the proposal, but I\u2019d like to know more details about some of its steps. It\u2019s mentioned that some sessions will occur in the breakout rooms of African Town Hall every two week, what means that a total of 12 sessions will take place. In the budget part, there are some costs related to travel and logistics, besides equipment, what indicates that some in person events will also take place, but this was not mentioned previously in the proposal. A total of 12 appearances of SMEs are also foreseen, what means that probably all sessions will have the presence of a SMEs they are attending only to Town Halls. During phase 3, and MVP DID solution will be produced, but it is not clear if it will be developed and or just conceptualized, and they don\u2019t mention which technology will be used (in case of implementation). The budget of the proposal is $25k, and it includes costs related to SMEs, logistics, support team, translation, and equipment. As mentioned previously, it was not clear until this moment that local sessions would take place, and the budget allocated for live translation seems quite higher than market rates. The cost per appearance of a SME seems quite high: $625. I believe the budget will be enough to execute the proposal, but from my perspective, it is actually more than necessary to do so. The team behind the proposal is part of WADA. They are well known in the community and have contributed a lot to the development of the Cardano community in Africa. They are very capable, and I have no doubt they would execute this proposal successfully. Also, links are provided to check Manfo\u2019s and Megan\u2019s background, and information about their accomplishments so far and the WADA Hub in Cameroon as well. The team is currently working on other funded proposals and has other proposals submitted in this Fund, but they have been successfully delivering their ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposed KPIs to track the project progress are good, but some of them, like the number of attendees are actually measures of the success of the proposal. To keep track of the progress, it might be enough to track, as mentioned, the bi-weekly gatherings during Town Halls and to see them on YouTube. They have added some KPIs to track the conceptual evolution of a SSI that takes into consideration the ancestral African concept of identity, to see how it evolved over time based on the input of the SMEs and the community. The definition of success of the proposal is good, but there are no metrics to be tracked there and no KPIs related to the success - although some KPIs proposed to track the progress of the execution could be used for that. I would include at least a KPI related to community participation (which is mentioned in the other section), because other things like the number of people who changed their concept of SSI based on these conversations would be very difficult to track. Overall, I believe the easily track the execution of the proposal and check the SSI concept developed at its end, so the auditability of this proposal is good. They also mentioned that this proposal is a continuation of a previously funded proposal, that hasn\u2019t been completed yet, but whose outcomes led to the submission of the current proposal.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2110", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 3, "ng": 5, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Feasability: the assesor states that \"the budget allocated for live translation seems quite higher than market rates\" but I am surprised by this comment because our rates are low compared to what some translators have asked for which we have seen up to $400//hour"}, {"id": 1533, "q0": "It is a quite interesting \nnotion to integrate various levels of defining identity in the concept of SSI thus making it more inclusive and multifacetted.

In short, bringing to light ancestral African perception on the concepts of identity, through philosophical debates. The proponent cites how SSI is associated with the project, but does not explain exactly how and why. Would Atala Prism DIDs be part of that debate, would some data be minted on the Cardano blockchain? It is quite abstract how this subject would relate directly to the technologies of our ecosystem. Not that the question is not valid, important for the debate, but in what way would this reflection bring new active members to our community, propagators like Cardano technologies, increasing the popularity of our blockchain in Africa? In my view, this bridge should be better established, so that we have a more continuous understanding of how the project would meet the specific needs of this challenge, which are the best proposals for the well being and giving to others Cardano; So I believe the idea is better developed, but it still needs to be better developed, but it still needs the proponent to be better developed and needed. would approach the concrete target audience of our blockchain, mode and insurance, the impact of the proposal would certainly be better guaranteed. My suggestion is for him to clarify this point, not even after reading the other parts of the proposal (feasibility and auditability) it became clearer. The proposal does not seem to be accessible and needs to be better with the objectives of the challenge presented and developed for this to be possible.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal's script is average, having some points that certainly should be improved. The problem here is temporality, in my opinion. Each phase would last a very long time of 6 months, nor is it explained how much time the activities that make up each phase occupy the period corresponding to the whole of it. In addition, the activities are not very detailed, the greatest wealth of detail consists of the list of all the topics that will be discussed. The most extensive and impactful phase would be phase 2, but turning my attention a little to phase 1, first. How would contracts with specialists be defined? How would these experts be selected, would they understand a bit about blockchain and Cardano, too? In phase 2, several activities would take place, but the main one would really be the meetings to discuss the defined subjects. Would these be face-to-face, online (proponent cites both cases, but what would be the predominance? How many people are expected per meeting? How would these people be motivated to participate in these events? How many meetings would take place per month, and where? How would Cardano be introduced into the debates ? The proponent states that it has a proposal financed in fund 7 on Hackathons; how would this concept be related here? How would the contents to be translated be selected, who would do this translation, how would this work routine be? would English speakers reach French speakers? In my view, several things are suggested, but it is not clear how these would develop in practice. Moving on now to the budget analysis, $30,000 is requested. The total amount is divided into a few parts, but these are not well explained and argued. For example, we know that 6 thousand dollars would be destined for the consultation of the spec ialists: how many specialists would there be, what is the price of the consulting hour? What are these trips and logistics surveys? How would these actions be marketed and publicized? Through which strategy would the content be disseminated, what is the plan for it to reach the target audience, arousing their interest? Would the developers have a work schedule that would justify the $400 monthly incentive? From the way this part is presented, it is not clear in practice how the money would be spent. Finally, when it comes to the team, this is the best part of feasibility. Still some improvements should have been made. For example, some team members attach a lot of information about themselves, as in this case: \u201cManfo - Technical Lead @ Wada Cameroon Hub, DITC, interested in identity and ownership solutions with a deep passion for honoring traditional practices through modernizing technology . Manfo and Mermoz will be in charge of reaching out to the subject matter experts (Ntumwa Nswadi Kimbasi, Mbog Bassong, Philipe Omutunde), organizing a work schedule and securing contracts with them. Manfo will also coordinate the team of development interns on the MVP solution.\u201d But like other people, not so much detail is provided. It would be nice if we had the same amount of information about everyone. Confidence in the team is conveyed as they are part of the Wada group, which is already well established in the Cardano community. Therefore, the feasibility is average, as we have positive points, but certainly several things to improve.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This is the best part of the proposal. Regarding the monitoring of progress, the proponent would provide a series of variables that can be used for us to make a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the whole, such as the observation of the fortnightly meetings of the City Council, number of documents shared from GitHub, bimonthly conversations with experts , number of videos and documents translated into English, etc. I think that what could further improve the quality of this monitoring would be to define how this information would be accessible to the Cardano community. Would there be some interface (a website, a telegram channel?) where all this would be gathered? Because they are diverse and different content, in my view it would be interesting to use tools such as Notion or Miro (online interfaces that support the upload of files, videos and photos). Another thing that would certainly benefit this part of the proposal would be a better detailing of each suggested data. For example in \u201cQuarterly Hackathon Session\u201d. How would this indicator be analyzed? How would conversations with experts be monitored? Would they all be recorded and made available on youtube, perhaps some file summarized in written form could be useful for our better understanding of these meetings? Overall, I like how the proponent is aware of the importance of tracking partial results, but beyond that it would also be important for us to monitor the tasks and work routines that would be behind these products. In relation to the final results, the degree of specificity decreased. We know that the goal is \u201cto open up the debate on a whole new perception of what the notion of SSI is in the African ancestral circle, a great participation in the debate space will definitely be the first step towards success, the next step will be to be developing a game conceptualizing that notion and making it useful and fun.\u201d But in what palpable ways could this scenario be perceived? Perhaps some direct research with the public that got involved in the debates? It would also be essential for us to understand what the effects of all this were for Cardano. Did the events attract people to become active members of the community in one way or another? How will all this be presented to the community? I suggest that the team choose some official communicative bridge to provide all this data to the Cardano community, to improve this contact between the team and us. improve I think the auditability is good, but a few more details would make it even better, easier to verify, and more accessible.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Feasibility: the assesor's commments show they did not read the proposal in detail. \"nor is it explained how much time the activities that make up each phase occupy the period corresponding to the whole of it....How many meetings would take place per month, and where?....how many specialists would there be, what is the price of the consulting hour?\" We go over these details in our proposal. \"Concretely we will invite guest speakers once per month and use the other one or two meetings that month to discuss as a community the content brought up at the lecture.\" etc."}, {"id": 2780, "q0": "\" this proposal offers a very novel idea, which is perhaps an extension and evolution of the project \"\"Cardanno Conservation Culture\" that this development team has worked on and has succeeded in many places.

I welcome your comments raised in the proposal, I consider it an innovative thinking concept that has been ingrained for many years. Up until now, you have applied high technology: Cardano's blockchain to combine and express African identity and culture. I rate this as very good in terms of the spiritual value of the Challenge's overall goal of \"Grow Africa\". This is a novel and rare proposition among the proposals I have read in this Challenge. This is interesting. If this proposal is successfully implemented, it will have a great effect on spreading African culture to all people in the African community and even to people all over the world. The promotion of culture and national identity is always necessary for any country, any continent, at any time. However, when I would like to point out the other side of this proposed impact, which is increasing the value of the Cardano ecosystem - I do not appreciate this goal. Of course, developing a proposal on the Cardano platform is already good for the Cardano blockchain. Specifically, SSI (a technology that allows a user to disclose only part of his or her information, etc...). SSI has been widely adopted by previous proposals. Have you ever thought that this proposal will have a big impact on increasing the value of the Cardano ecosystem? And if this proposal has a small impact on the Cardano ecosystem, what will you do next to make a high-impact proposal, that is good for the Cardano ecosystem? With that, what will you do to scale in the future? I greatly appreciate the impact on the traditional cultural identity of Africa.

In my opinion, when in this proposal, the team should still clearly present the members and accompanying identities so that those who have never read the proposal quickly grasp the profile, and professional qualifications. professions of the members. I strongly agree on how to break down the budget by the items that you have presented. It is specific, detailed, and easy to understand. In the same way, the practice is tied to the depiction of traditional African culture. One thing I would like to add to the proposal is that the team can elaborate on the technical aspects, in addition to using technology using SSI. This further increases the feasibility of the proposal. I understand the challenge you are facing about the current way of life of African people, especially young people who come into contact with the West a lot - they will gradually lose their ancestral knowledge and lifestyle. , the tradition of previous generations of Africa, of their ancestors. I believe this proposal will help them realize their current way of life, and better appreciate the history and traditional culture. I would like to propose an idea to contribute to improving this situation, that is, you can develop communication channels to propagate African national cultural traditions to people in African countries to understand more and understand better.

Also, do you present your success or performance metrics for the community to understand? I understand your core goal is a whole new understanding of SSI. But for me, we need more specific criteria to help the community evaluate the auditability of the proposal. Example: How many people have access to talks and discussions? And after those talks and discussions, could the team use the survey to see how many people are fully aware of SSI, or the cultural traditions of their African ancestors? Or, after implementing the proposal, can the team get more input from the participants to see if they are interested in this approach (adopting the Cardano blockchain platform)?
