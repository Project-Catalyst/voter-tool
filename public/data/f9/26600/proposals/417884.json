The solution statement, to measure CO2 emissions caused by the production of coffee, seems counterintuitive.  Global warming that will cause a reduction of farmable coffee land on the 2050 timeline presented likely has no significant link to coffee farming itself...  According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, only 11% of US greenhouse gas emission is caused by agriculture activity, a figure which is likely much lower in Africa due to less efficient energy production and less industrialized agriculture.  In fact, according to a CDP Africa Report from 2019, Africa as a continent of 1.2 Billion people only produce 3.8% of total global emissions - Compare with 23% from China, and 19% from the US.\n\nBeyond greenhouse emissions measurements, the project proposed here is really a Cardano affiliated carbon credit system which aims to recruit African developers to build a system of connecting coffee drinkers around the globe with farmers located in Africa - where coffee drinkers will be (somehow) incentivized to provide feedback to the farmers.\n\nMy opinion is that this project is well intentioned and aims to scale to a mass market within African -  aligning well in that mission with the selected challenge of Grow Africa, Grow Cardano.

For the development portion, the proposal states that a major risk is lack of Haskell engineer, a necessary element to phase 2 implementation linking the project to Cardano.  The proposer himself has a background as a coffee judge (presumably skilled in the sense of taste) and a barista (preparation of coffee beverages from beans and other materials).  The proposal has mentioned environmental, research, and engineering partnerships, but provided no details of whom those team members are.\n\nAnd as it relates to the technical implementation, the goal to \"contribute to research on the mind and brain, including neuro science\" is a bit difficult to understand in terms of how it relates to this very broad initiative, other than as a peripheral way to utilize some of the data collected in this project.\n\nA light financial plan is presented along with a manpower budget accounting for the project leader and the 2 developers mentioned, but none of the other partners indicated in the feasibility section.\n\nI believe the proposer is well intentioned to deliver this project, but might have limited knowledge on the technical portion of this proposal, therefore it's difficult to evaluate the likelihood that the project will be implemented if funded - the key reason for my neutral position on feasibility.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability KPIs present more of a broad overview of the project success in full operational mode.

Although the introductory video is impressive, I would still like to know more about the author's profile, with a link to the social networking site (Facebook, linked, discord...).

You know that when evaluating a proposal, the community must know who wrote the proposal and his or her relevant information in order to confirm the feasibility of the proposal. Therefore, I would like to suggest that you add more information so that the community can better understand yourself. You mentioned the team members that made this proposal. What do I need to know more about that member's profile information (links to more social networking sites)? Even in cases where the proposal has spanned across Funds - only revealing the team's identity in the previous Fund proposal without naming the team in this Fund proposal, I still recommend the team that group fully identifies all proposals in the Funds. This is convenient for the community and PA in verifying and evaluating feasibility. You have been to Ethiopia, I believe you are a coffee connoisseur. I like the two-phase problem-solving you have presented, it involves algorithms and academic research, not simply being an environmentalist or a mere coffee connoisseur. It looks like you have a mix of technology and reality inside of you. Because there is a technical element in the proposal, I want you to clarify and explain the technical aspect more carefully so that the community can understand. You have divided the proposal's plan into two phases. That's good because you've tied each of your periods to specific timelines of the year? This makes the feasibility of the proposal much clearer. I would like to mention the challenge and risk you mentioned: the absence of haskell engineer in the team. Do you see the lack of practicality, lack of feasibility when the team currently does not have a haskell engineer. This is what makes me wonder if your proposal is supported by catalyst? The technology you apply when implementing the proposal is new technology, so it requires qualified resources (quality of personnel). This is not simple. In addition, do you see any other risky challenges? Like the prohibition of local authorities when implementing the proposal in Africa?

The factor I look for to better assess auditability is KPI or key metrics. I wonder how you would rate your performance if it weren't for KPIs or success metrics. My advice is to add KPIs and success metrics to export as soon as possible. For example, the number of measurements, the number of users, the results achieved against the goal to be achieved (specific numbers) KPIs, and success metrics make the community understand the auditability of the proposal. In addition, I would like to ask more: How will the real effectiveness of the proposal when applied in practice be improved in the future?

The proposal has pointed out a problem that is quite concerned today, that is: By 2050, global coffee production will be halved. There are two reasons given, the first is due to global warming affecting the farming areas; The second reason is the inadequate monetization of African manufacturers. Perhaps they have problems in the business process, resulting in revenue and profit that do not meet the needs and goals they set. The climate of Africa is the hottest and driest in the world, while coffee is a crop that requires rainfall and is suitable for hot and humid climates. Therefore, global warming has a huge effect on coffee cultivation. This proposal emphasized the goals of climate change impact assessment and future trend prediction, identifying priorities for accurately modeling climate change impacts on coffee production in Africa. The proponent also mentioned the issue of CO2 emissions, which is also a matter of concern because of the increasing environmental pollution, the control of emissions and the treatment of these emissions are very important. The solution proposed by the proponent I found identified most of the problems of the challenge. By presenting the current situation as mentioned above, the impact of the problem has been emphasized. To successfully implement the project, the proponent also anticipated the risks. There is a risk mentioned that the implementation of AtalaPRISM in phase 2 will be difficult because there are no Haskell engineers on the team.

The roadmap is implemented in a logical order, starting from the research and survey step to the next stage starting application development and development testing. This specific roadmap will help everyone easily control the progress and quality of each stage. Regarding the project's budget, the proponent also presented a very specific and reasonable way to allocate and use the budget. The budget includes field surveys for $16,000, documentation of surveys for $4,000, and CO2 Visualization application development for $30,000. However, in my personal opinion, if possible, the proponent should deduct part of the budget to set up a risk reserve fund or apply for additional funding, because implementing any project will unexpected occurrences that cannot be avoided. For example, a field survey of 8 months is a relatively long time. In addition to using the budget as planned, there should be additional costs because each survey site will have different conditions, travel costs or administrative procedures, or related factors to the weather, topography, and culture of the region. Having a reserve fund ready will help to deal with unexpected situations more reasonably and flexibly. Regarding project participants, the proponent has outlined the positions and titles of each person, including project leader, engineer, visualization algorithm researcher, field assessor, and teacher environmental professor. However, in my opinion, this section only lists their positions and does not elaborate on personal information such as their name, work experience, professional qualifications, and suitability for the project.

The success of the project is also clearly demonstrated through the specific goal of reaching 30 million users per year by 2025 both in terms of manufacturers and consumers.

Definitely, the price of a cup of coffee would be more expensive than the present.

Thus, the survey, data collection is extremely necessary and needs to be conducted in a timely manner that is long enough to ensure the quality of the data source.
