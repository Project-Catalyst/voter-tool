Despite East Africa being quite populous, the proponent claims that there are few active community members from that location. It is about creating a face-to-face location to develop activities relevant to the Cardano ecosystem in the city of Dar Es Salaam. This would be important because, according to the proponent, there is a low involvement of the East Africa community in Catalyst in Cardano in general, which can be justified perhaps by the difference in languages \u200b\u200b(the most spoken language is Kiswahili), and also because of of the time zone. So the proponent suggests making a physical hub, which would facilitate online and offline meetings, coordinating collaboration between entities in that part of Africa with the rest of our community. The proponent states what the role of this place would be, some of which are: serving as \u201ca center to facilitate awareness campaigns of the Cardano ecosystem and a bridge for collaboration between local entities and the Cardano ecosystem\u201d, in addition to \u201cproviding the general public with to the mainstream media and engage stakeholders directly to create support and momentum for policy solutions for favorable legislation, tax reduction and a free market environment that promotes creativity and innovation of individuals in building the Cardano Ecosystem\u201d and so on. In general, the engagement of public policies with the adoption of Cardano would be worked on, both in legislative aspects and in the issue of people knowing and understanding what blockchain technology would be and its uses in real life. I believe that theoretically the idea fits very well with what is sought in the challenge, because with the establishment of this center, perhaps large projects can be developed in the locality; certainly more active members would be added to the Cardano community, while more people would get to know what our ecosystem is and how it works, understand some opportunities like Catalyst, for example. With the addition of new active members, new digital wallets would be created, more CNFTs would be in circulation, most likely the number of Ada in circulation and being delegated would increase, especially if the projects that this center helps to establish are of a public nature. For example, if the center assists in the education of young people from the local community, who are of school/college age and are interested in programming areas (for example), with the help of a local hub, opportunities for paid scholarships may arise. in Ada\u2026 I believe that this idea has a lot of potential and is very necessary, because in places where technology is not so accessible, it is important that more tangible initiatives are made, such as the preparation of a physical space to assist in the development of projects.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal roadmap is quite superficial, the activities could have been reported in much more detail. As this information is conveyed, our understanding of process development is only basic. For example, in the first month, it says that \u201cTeam and key hires identified and integrated. Production of branding materials for Cardano and Catalyst (brochures, roll up banners and merchs)\u201d. A lot of information could have been provided here, for example: how would these teams be selected, how would people be hired? The proponent should be responsible for making such choices, but what would be your criteria for analysis? How would the dissemination materials be prepared? I believe that it would be necessary for a graphic designer to be responsible for this part, and it would also be interesting for someone from the marketing field to have an active participation here. In months 2 and 3, it is said that an extensive research phase would take place: what would be researched, and how? How would the hub be officially launched (would there be a publicity event?). In the others, in the same way: more details could be provided; we don't know how the interested parties would be involved, that is, institutions (governmental or not) that deal with environmental issues, or companies that want to use blockchain technology in their services, etc. That is, several explanations were pending so that we had a proper understanding of the script. Regarding the budget, 40 thousand dollars are requested, and in my understanding the amount is not so well explained. We know which main parts it would be divided into, such as rent payment, infrastructure such as internet and electricity, payment of staff salaries and the community manager... But each of these small parts could be better explained, for example in the team part, we don't know how many people would be paid here, how they would work, how many hours per week and so on. The payment for the community manager is a little clearer, as we know he would be working full-time on the project. The educational outreach and awareness part could also have been more detailed; it's 5000 dollars and it's not very clear how it would be used. Finally, when it comes to the team, I think past trust is average. We know who the people involved in the project are: their names, areas of activity and a little of what they have done so far. What worries me the most is the fact that we don't have anyone who is really specialized in Cardano's technologies or who has solid experience in our community (we have a team member who CA, but we don't know if he's involved in any projects beyond from that). So, this topic in general is average, some basic information is passed, but other, quite essential, is missing.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The partial results can be measured by various KPIs, such as the number of online and offline meetings held, climate impact activities carried out, proposals that address the fundamental issues preventing Cardano adoption in Africa, African developers integrated in 2022 and many other metrics reported by the bidder. However, the observation of these advances is not enough for us to understand the project development process accurately. Behind these final results, we have several processes, several tasks that need to be developed, so that they can be achieved. For example, for face-to-face and online meetings to take place, it is necessary to decide the day, who will participate, what topics will be addressed, etc. For new developers to be integrated, it will be necessary 1) to teach Cardano's programming languages \u200b\u200bto people already in the field 2) to qualify people who are not yet developers, to start studying about the area and, in the future, work for Cardano. All these processes should be guided by the main script, by the schedule of activities to be followed. Therefore, I think that the greater detail of the script would be essential so that we could accurately monitor what was happening throughout the phases. Ideally, then, the proponent would keep us (the Cardano community) updated on what was done, how and what the results of the small advances were. In my view, this gathering of information should be done at the end of each month, at the very least, so that we have a better understanding of the whole. Talking about the final success, very little information is passed on. What is said is that success would be achieved through a \u201cMass Adaptation, Participation and Contribution to the Cardano ecosystem in East Africa and Africa at large\u201d. But it is necessary that we delve deeply into this notion. The proponent and his team could carry out a survey of how the existence of this hub has affected East Africa and what the consequences of this are for the Cardano ecosystem. It would be important for a detailed study to be carried out, raising data such as those cited as the auditability of progress (quantitative); some projects that were born through the activities of the hub could also be exposed, where the people benefited would be today and how they would be adopting Cardano's technologies. For example, company X adopted transactions made by smart contracts and in Ada, and a total volume Y of native Cardano cryptocurrencies was moved from this project. How would our technologies be better and more used by the local population, etc.; all this data must come directly to the knowledge of the members of our community. As it is a broad and complex proposal, my suggestion is that a general study be carried out and that the results be exposed during participation in a Townhall, for example. With that, I think that auditability is not all bad, but it needs to be improved in several aspects.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 7, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 447, "q0": "As an effort to continuously educate the Cardano community of the importance of having multiple hubs in Africa, one should understand that the continent of Africa can fit in the U.S., China, India, Japan, Mexico, and many European nations. COMBINED.\n\nHence, the need to have multiple hubs in Africa. One other aspect that we need to understand, Africa is as equally if not more diverse than Europe. There are different nuances in the use of language, different nuances in cultural and many other things.\n\nThis proposal, seeks to focus on East Africa Nations. Who historically has a stronger affiliation with Asia. Through this proposal, the proposer seeks to address in persuading the creation of legislation that are more supportive towards blockchain and cryptocurrency, specifically build more support to Cardano.\n\nThis hub acts as a physical conduit between government officials, legislators, medias and other influencers with the African Cardano community. Through education and communication, potentially innovation in building on the Cardano Ecosystem will happen through this hub.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Although the proposer is an individual that is highly active in various Cardano communities and also an owner of a local company that operates in the field of financial investments, to achieve their intended main goals they would need an individual that is either directly related or has connections to local legislator or policy makers.\n\nThe reasoning behind is to lower the barrier of entry, for to my understanding, there are numerous countries in Africa whose governments are not crypto/blockchain friendly. Direct approach would not be the most effective approach.\n\nIf no human resources of such is available, then the focus should be on educating the general masses. By having workshops in universities, by having online meetups such as the Town Halls. Build a reputation of directly helping the local community, through persistence will eventually lead to a critical mass of awareness that attract local policy makers. Though aiming lower, such as by just having these workshops alone, one can slowly build connections to influential individuals. Adoption, onboarding is a long term domino game. It takes time and it takes patience which the proposers seems to understand for the budget asked is to accomodate a whole year of operations. In this budget there is also a significant amount allocated to education  which is inline with what should be the best approach of onboarding.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "With that said above, this proposal is unfortunately disjointed and not straightforward. The wordings of their intention is confusing and actually unclear of what they want to actually deliver. Let us take example, the following goals of \"Establish a center in Tanzania to help aid the mainstream engagement within the public policy space by shaping legislation and providing innovative policy alternatives for adoption of Cardano and blockchain at large.\" One could just say, create a \"Cardano Tanzanian Hub that seeks to influence policy makers to adopt Cardano through various educational use case of its technology in legislative reform.\" Pardon for critiquing the writing, but it is essential to get out the right and simple message, for the workload of Proposal Assessors are very high. Convoluted languages tends to be glassed over by PAs.\n\nWith that said, there are metrics, milestones and roadmaps provided, it just needs to be rearranged to concise to be easy to audit. \n\nGoing back to this proposal being disjointed, there is a section where the proposers identify a certain risk/challenge they may face down the line, where they offered a solution of the importance of education. This education effort though is not stated in the roadmap, but it suddenly appears in the budget makeup. One can assume that perhaps it is a typo or forgetfulness by the proposer, but since this section addresses auditability, it does begs the question have they really thought out their proposal? In the budget section, the education part is not explained in detail of what they seek to educate on. Since it is regarding adoption of Cardano for legislative reform, one would expect the materials will be according and differ from the materials of Catalyst School.\n\nAnd that is just one aspect of auditibality of this proposal. There are other questions that comes from this proposal, but as is, it will be challenging to follow and gauge the success of this proposal. Reckon to just start small and focus on onboarding students and developers.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2088", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 2, "ng": 12, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2420, "q0": "We realized that the central focus of the proposal, the creation of a space for meetings and debates, is in line with the objectives of the challenge, as it aims to promote ideas and initiatives that add value to both the African continent and Cardano's ecosystem. So in fact, if the project is successful, there is a good chance that a positive impact will be made in the long term. However, as it is about establishing a physical space, a concern is whether the project will be able to generate enough engagement for this space to be maintained in the long term, and consequently for new actions to continue to emerge. We note that the value being requested is consistent with what you want to accomplish, but as mentioned earlier, there are some caveats that must be considered, and we will develop this further below.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The execution plan for the project seems to have a correct organization, and the most attractive point would be the movement to attract people from different areas of society, and thus form a rich and interdisciplinary space for the production of comprehensive solutions. However, a concern regarding the feasibility of the project would be the initial proportion of what is planned to be accomplished. And here we can pay special attention to the word 'initial'. In other words, in fact, it doesn't seem like an unfeasible plan for a hub with so many features to be implemented, but it seems that the amount requested, despite being considerable, may not be enough for that; or maybe it generates only momentary engagement. For the project to reach its full potential, it seems that a safer strategy would be to choose some main points to be debated, and some more specific areas in which to seek to implement solutions based on Cardano's technologies. And in view of the technical quality of the professionals who make up the project team, we have a favorable environment for more specific solutions to be well developed, in fact, a positive point is also the availability of the curricula of the professionals involved.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Regarding the metrics chosen to monitor the evolution of the project, we noticed the presence of several quantitative factors, which fits very well with everything that was disseminated in the proposal. As it became quite evident, there is a great interest in attracting different agents so that different solutions are built, and we realize that the construction of these solutions will be accounted for, considering the different areas. Additionally, it would be interesting if some numbers were stated as goals to be achieved, for example, an expected number of proposals offering solutions for infrastructure and education. Finally, it also seems constructive to use a project tracking tool such as Jira, so that the project's evolution could be easily followed visually.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3461, "q0": "Proposer does a good job explaining the value of the hub he intends to create.  In fact, this region in Africa represent a considerable amount of  the total world population and incentivizing Cardano there might drive its adoption and potentially help to increase some challenge kpi such as \"Number of African developers onboarded in 2022\" and \"Local impact\". The strcuture of this hub is outlined in the feasibility section. Two very good points that this hub will approach is enviromental and legislation aspects, both of which are trending nowadays.\nThere seems already also to have a strategy to attract people to this hub by educational outreach, meetings or seminars, website and media in general. This is essential to engage not only people in Tanzania but in other countries in the region, targeted here.  My main suggestion here would be to focus first in one specific target audience (as, for instance, University students or tech companies), to gain traction and learn, and the, after that, expand the audience to other groups.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There's a structured plan divided by month and with good activities, that shows how the hub will work and what the steps are to build this hub, and that matches project scope, stated in impact section.

As for the team, there are 2 people committed, with experience in development, Cardano and financing. These competencies seem good for this project but they will need to leverage a lot their network to make this hub work well. This network could be better explored here in their description. There are linkedin links provided to verify the info.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There are some  good kpis suggested by proposer. It's good they consider climatic impactful activities carried out as one of the metrics. They could, however, some targets proposed as well, to help truly assess project success. In addition, there could be more kpis specific for this proposal as most of the other metrics are actually from the challenge it is in. No problem on tracking that here, its actually good, but the particular carachteristics of the proposal might require more kpis of its own. As examples, it could be included here the number of people in the hub from different countries in the region, number of leggisliations proposed/suggested or passed or even some quantified enviromental impact results (such as CO2 reduction, energy consumption improvement, etc).", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2461", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 1, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4365, "q0": "This is a direct contribution to the Catalyst and Cardano ecosystems. The problem raised very clearly is the lack of links between regions with the Cardano ecosystem for a long time. The team wants to do it through the proposal. I very much agree. Because this close connection will greatly increase the value of the Cardano ecosystem, solving the existing situations in areas of Africa, not only in terms of economy, and people's knowledge but also the natural solidarity among the East African regions. The proposal has addressed the stated goal of Africa's growth, Cardano's growth. If the proposal is implemented well, I believe the scale not only exists in East Africa but also extends to other regions across Africa. Thereby the Cardano ecosystem continues to grow and achieve success in making the world better. I think this proposal acts as a bridge between the regions, and the Cardano ecosystem. Through this, areas can communicate and connect. This has a great effect on the social development of countries (now East African countries).", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I was interested in the members of the team and noticed that you clearly stated your contact information. I want to ask: Do you have any other members in the group? Because creating a hub to act as a bridge between East African countries and the Cardano ecosystem online or offline is not an easy job and it will be hectic. I'm afraid that with 2 members, the team can hardly do this job in the best way. How many members are members of the RFFXTZ company? You have experience and expertise in the job. That's why I believe in the feasibility, I am only afraid when the workload is very large and the number of members to do the work is not much. In terms of budgets, I'm happy when the budget is broken down into categories that are logical to the goal. You guys have considered carefully and seriously when reducing the budget from 90,000 USD to 40,000 USD. I find that this is a reasonable calculation. This small detail builds community confidence in the proposal. You have outlined a specific plan. However, I would advise you to be more clear about how it is done and the assignment of team members to perform the work areas. I am afraid that the team cannot perform well if it is limited in human resources. Although I know that, the two members of the group are good people with good expertise. I am impressed with the risk you posed and the solution that comes with it is to convince the experts to believe that the project is not a scam. I have advice for you that the best way of persuasion is to act so that the experts see and have absolute confidence in the team and the team's youngest proposal. Please do a lot of action, and organize many activities to not only prove to the experts but also everyone in the community, this is also a way to promote the team, RFFXTZ company. So I always think that the best way to survive and thrive is to take action.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The timeline provided is well detailed. However, I would still like to know when do you guys start implementing the proposal, specifically what time of year? The proposal is made within a year, I fully believe that after 1 year the team can return to Catalyst to report the results to the community and depending on the actual situation, may request more funds to continue operating in the following years (if the operation in the first year is effective). I understand how project success is presented in your proposal. However, I have another question, can you specify that success with measurable numbers? Because that is the basis for measuring work efficiency in a specific way. The team has given the criteria, for example, the Number of online and offline meetups practiced, the number of Climatic impactful activities practiced... But there is no specific number.

The proponent therefore wishes to collaborate with RFFXTZ Co Ltd to create a physical hub in Dar es salaam to facilitate online and offline meetings and coordinate collaboration between local entities in East Africa with the Cardano Ecosystem, I think it will be a bridge to help connect localities in the region, through a center that organizes online and offline meetings, people can meet to talk and exchange ideas. exchange information, knowledge and experience related to blockchain and the Cardano ecosystem, especially between those with shared knowledge and new people, helping the East African community to have a lot of knowledge and information Learn more about Blockchain Cardano as well as other crypto projects, helping them have a background knowledge and be able to judge for themselves which crypto projects are bad and which are scams or which are good. investment, thus avoiding financial loss and can increase income, making people's lives better, contributing to The Cardano community is expanding and growing more sustainably in East Africa.

Doing so will create conditions for other agencies, those who are busy and do not participate directly, can review, help more people have the opportunity to exchange, learn and share experiences and knowledge about Cardano. The proponent has provided the profiles of members and partners working through linkedin in a clear, detailed manner, with appropriate work experience to be able to successfully implement the goals of the challenge.
