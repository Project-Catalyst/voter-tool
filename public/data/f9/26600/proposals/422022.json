Because of this, best practices is disregarded. Numerous proposals either over express their intent, making it almost unreadable or under state their intent which then categorizes it as an incomplete proposal.\n\nYes, this proposal might not directly answer the Challenge Setting but it will have an effect down the road. For its main goal is to create quality proposals together with proposers which then increases the likelihood of receiving favourable reviews from Proposal Assessors. This in return enhances the proposals chance of receiving votes. Whatever the proposals topic may be.\n\nWriting advanced and effective proposals based on the Catalyst guidelines is difficult, let alone for newbies, let alone for those who are not adept in the English language. This proposal seeks to address this core issue that is floating in various other communities that do not have English as their main communication tool.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has been continuously funded for a similar proposal but differs in the intent. Their other proposal seeks to educate while this proposal seeks to create together with the proposer the intended proposal.

Which is to create 2 (two) proposals with ratings of 4 to 4,2. It's very straightforward and makes the work of a Proposal Assessor easier.\n\nHow they calculate their budget is also exact, for they use work hours over general lump sum values, which I highly appreciate. Which then is multiplied by an hourly rate. Very easy system to audit, again a testament to their skills and experience.

The solution is to provide a face to face sessions with the aim to understand the proposal, collect all the required information and then prepare a draft. Next, the refinement procedure occurs, where another session is scheduled to improve parts that are required to be improved. As stated in the proposal, the goal would be to proposals that are not too technical or educational, and will be easily comprehended by assessors. Another barrier when making a proposal can be a language, and this service will also is tackling this challenge. I personally see a very large impact on this proposal, because I have seen many proposals already which would definitely benefit from such a service.

The estimated time spent on these tasks is 165 hours, per 40 USD which gives the total budget 6600 USD for two proposals. Despite a very good detail is provided on the tasks to be performed, I think it will vary from a proposal to proposal, from a client to a client, but I get that it is an estimation that is currently making sense.

It\u2019s a shame when something good for the ecosystem gets lost because it doesn\u2019t meet the criteria we set, so what Tevo and his team proposes is to have a few people funded that will help write good proposals for those who require this service.\nAs risks, Tevo identified the fact that the language barrier between the writer and the proposer can lead to misunderstandings (this will be mitigated by reviewing the proposal together after it is written) and that proposers may not have all the necessary information to build the proposal in the first place. To mitigate this, the team will come up with a set of guiding questions.\nI fully agree that this proposal effectively addresses the Grow Africa, Grow Cardano challenge.

As a result, he has a very detailed plan on how this will be done, an estimation of how much time a writer should spend with each proposer and a total number of estimated hours for the requested budget of only 6600 USD. The team will be composed of Tevo himself, Tonis, a freelance writer and Caue, the founder and manager of the LATAM Catalyst school.

Additionally, the team has set a goal of having at least 2 approved proposals in Fund 10 and at least 4 in Fund 11.\nI am fully confident that this proposal will be easy to audit by the community, as Tevo always makes sure to post all the necessary information for his projects.

This proposal will have the ability to have a global effect on the ecosystem by allowing more ideas to be made and giving more people the ability to receive funds for their great ideas.

By including the community into these proposals and allowing others to share their ideas and thoughts, there is more room for improvement, and it allows for the principle of accountability to be measured.
