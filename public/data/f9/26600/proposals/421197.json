By accompanying this alliance with existing prominent individuals and entities from the Cardano communities it will further help in building their credentials. For one aspect of a SPO, which is a compelling mission to drive delegation, credentials plays a huge role for it provides trust for any potential delegators.\n\nWith a strong and healthy alliance of stake pools across Africa, their combined strength and potential SPO rewards can further fuel African based project without the help from Catalyst. It is a win-win solution that requires patience from the general Cardano ecosystem, for setting up a SPO is no simple task.\n\nWe all know, or for those involved in the larger Cardano community, that single SPO's are suffering and have been continuously closing. The one weapon that promotes Cardano and is the so-called beacon of liberation is slowly falling into a broken promise for it is untrue the unofficial slogan, \"anyone can operate a stake pool\".", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Both the core and support team are all seasoned veterans of the Catalyst community, where each have built their own strong reputation by delivering on their own funded proposals.

We have Yoram, the individual that has connected Seedstars with Project Catalyst to launch their own funding efforts. We have Evans from Tanzania, a consistent contributor and translator for the African Town Hall.  And so many other reputable and trustworthy individuals.\n\nIn terms of their formulated plan, of that was mentioned, the importance of matchmaking SPO's with potential delegators is what would the core effect that SPO's would really appreciate. To achieve that, the proposers seek to first formulate various best practices for the potential SPO's to follow. Some form of building credentials which indeed is important.

Which in regards towards the end goal of a SPO, which is delegation, target numbers are crucial for a SPO to receive rewards the would need a healthy delegation of 500K to 1 million ADA.\n\nIt would have been more direct if the road map started from a simpler target, such as achieving delegation of 500K and broken down to into various steps to achieve that simpler target. Indeed it would ambitious for this is their first iteration, but it would make sense if the approach were as suggested above.\n\nThough the most important concepts here would be ; importance of Africa as the greater strategy of Cardano, importance of formulating financial independence of the African Cardano community through stake pool operations, importance of experimenting to find the best practices to achieve a high performing SPO. The three mindset above would be the overriding factor of any shortcomings of this proposal.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2088", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 2, "ng": 12, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2517, "q0": "Given the present time of uncertainty surrounding the regulation concerning Crypto Currencies, the need of the decentralization is being felt by everyone. The role of a stake pool operator in a proof of stake Blockchain like Cardano is most important in this regard. But given the recent trends of ISPOs for securing funding for the projects, the small stake pool operators have been struggling to get enough delegation to be able to produce blocks and hence remain profitable. Many stake pool operators have to stop operating due to becoming unprofitable for not getting enough delegation.\nTo overcome this challenge many small stake pool operator alliances like CSPA( Cardano Single Stake Pool Alliance), Ardana Stake pool alliance etc have been created. It has been seen that due to the collective efforts of all these stake pools, they are able to bring the delegation to these pools and hence helped in the decentralization of the Cardano.\nThe proposal is planning to create such an alliance specific to Africa continent. Given the emphasis put by Cardano on Africa, there is very genuine requirement for such an alliance in the region. This will not only help all these small stake pool operators to work collectively to achieve the decentralization goals of Cardano and remain profitable by collective efforts of marketing but it will also help in adoption of Cardano in the continent. We have seen that stake pool operators are the ambassadors of Cardano and many of them have are conducting great initiatives like providing clean drinking water, tree plantation, providing food and charity to name a few. Creating such a alliance in the Africa will help these small pool operators and create a positive impact regarding Cardano in Africa with their collective efforts. This perfectly aligns with the objectives of the fund challenge. \nOnly concern is that there have already been some proposals funded though Catalyst for creating such alliances in Africa but we are yet to see a large scale alliance seeing the light of the day. But they have mentioned that they will work with some of these previous successful funds to create such an alliance and I am hopeful that we will be able to see it being successful in the near future.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project is divided into stages spanning to 3 months from September to November and includes working with existing proposals who are working on this kind of initiate, establishing a panel to evaluate such efforts and ultimately enroll large number of stake pools to Africa stake pool alliance. The proposal also includes developing a software tools, dashboards and data management to support all member SPOs. The team consists of around 10 people who are part of Africa Stake pool community and are running their existing stake pools. \nThe team is requesting the budget of $36910 to achieve this initiative and breakup of the cost shows that the amount is reasonable. It is also worth noting that $10000 will be spent to just incentives the SPOs which is very good initiative for bootstrapping this alliance. \nGiven the experience of the team and adequate funding being provided, the proposal will be feasible to implement and will be very true to the objective of the Challenge.\nOnly concern would be the fragmentation of the such efforts as there are already some proposals to create such communities in the African continent. I request the team to bring all such members on board to have a broad and impactful alliance which will be beneficial to all involved and ultimately be very good for Cardano\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The project is already developing a website and all the progress of this proposal will be posted regularly on the website. They will also create a google sheet for SPOs to apply to be included in to the alliance and this sheet will be publicly viewable. Given that these are existing stake pool operators and most of them have a good community following, the regular updates regarding this initiative will also be posted to the their communities via their social media channels. All this will make monitoring and auditability of the project very easy. Only concern is that their website is not yet live and in case the website launch is delayed due to some unforeseeable events, it will become hard to monitor the progress. In case they are not able to secure the funding, I would request them to launch their website before the next proposal or at least have some alternate ways to share the progress with the community.\nIn the end, I would like to add that this initiate will be very helpful on all fronts be it the decentralization, adoption of Cardano or the welfare of the local communities in the Africa.
