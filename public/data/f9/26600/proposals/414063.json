It will help spread the word about the Cardano initiatives involving the African continent. By providing workshops, demos and speeches and by connecting people from different origins to work in African-related projects the proposal can add value to the Cardano community. The keys and metrics laid out by the proposers strongly align with the challenge settings. In other words, KPIs tracking the number of users onboarded onto Cardano, number of new Catalyst members and number of African projects seeded in the current year meaningfully measure the success of the proposal. The only point I would add is concerning scalability. The team could have detailed plans regarding future presentations that could spin off from the CatalystCon 2022 to spread the word to more and possibly more remote locations.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers have shown enough evidence of relevant experience of the team.

Also, the team has diversified experience that ranges from designing and education to web developing and cryptocurrency-related skills which will be necessary for the successful implementation of the proposal. Additionally, the number of members seems the ideal to achieve what is being proposed. The budget was clearly outlined and broken down into identifiable items and the total amount is reasonable. The timeline described seems pretty attainable as well. My only suggestion here would be to introduce dates to the roadmap. Because the event is happening in December it would be nice to know more precisely when each target demand is set to start. Besides that, it would be nice to see a more detailed description of who exactly will be responsible for each of the bullet points exhibited in the plan and how they intend to execute them.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team has provided a roadmap with clear milestones and a time horizon for the execution of each step of the plan. But as I have mentioned before, they could have given more details regarding the dates they intend to start each stage of the roadmap and which metric they will use to consider an item has successfully been completed. For example, how many translators will be hired? Is there a minimum acceptable number? What about speakers and panelists, how many is the ideal number? Is there any person they consider special enough to be consider a great success obtaining him or her as a speaker? As for the KPIs I believe they translate very well the definition of success for this campaign. In other words, the number of event sign-ups, new proposers onboarded and partnerships created, just to name a few, accurately measures if this proposal has addressed the problem or not. Finally, one suggestion would be to exhibit the progress of the funded projects in a single webpage.

Thus, the proposal is closely related to the goal set in the Challenge. The team has determined that the problem to be solved here is to improve the relationship and role of individuals and organizations in Cardano, Catalyst. I very much welcome this idea because it directly impacts the Cardano ecosystem (increasing value). At the same time, contributes to solving the long-standing problem of African development. Hopefully when this proposal is implemented - put into practice it will have a very good impact on all those individuals and organizations who are interested, are researching Cardano, Catalyst, and attracting stakeholders outside attendance. I consider this Cardano's big event in Africa. I do not deny its importance in synthesizing, promoting, and engaging the interests of individuals and organizations. I don't know if you're like me - seeing the potential through events like this will be the premise for continuing to build a community to drive Cardano blockchain adoption in the region. In short, the proposal has a significant impact on Africa and the Cardano ecosystem. I strongly agree with this proposal. I vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The first thing when I was satisfied with when I read this proposal was the credibility of the Wada team. I know the team has had other proposals in previous Funds, as they are a collection of members with extensive experience and expertise in the fields. They are experts working together to build a better Africa and a more efficient Cardano ecosystem. The members of the group all reveal their full identities through access links on social networking sites. I love this because it increases the feasibility of the proposal and increases the community's confidence in the proposal. Through the detailed budget breakdown, I found that the team had a very detailed and reasonable analysis of the budget allocation when implementing the proposal. This is a professional projection shown by professionals. Along with that is the plan and implementation method in a clear and understandable sequence to create CatalystCon - \"By the community, for the community\". I found that with the gathering of good experts in their field, the team had quite the necessary resources to execute (except for the financial resources waiting to be completed). fund grant). However, I still want you to explain more clearly the technical and technological aspects, the language used when applying to implement the proposal. Because of that, it is possible to verify the feasibility of the proposal. If we could do more of this, it would be a great proposition. Can the team do that? Because of the risk factor when implementing, I believe the team is fully qualified to maintain or improve the quality of the event. However, I think of another risk factor, which I would like to highlight for the community and the team to refer to. It is the response of all communities and individual organizers to the event. We know that our team successfully organized a similar event last year. But will this event attract everyone's attention like last year? The team can answer me, if the interest is not as good as last year, leading to a decrease in the number of organizations and individuals attending, what plan will you have to overcome this risk? In summary, I still highly recommend the feasibility of the proposal, believing that it will be successful when applied in practice (but still have to take into account some possible risks as I mentioned).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The route you have outlined is very clear. But I still regret one thing I can't see the roadmap associated with the months in a year? Example: From January to the end of March: Marketing campaign launch; Speakers & Agenda confirmed; Translators hired & Multi-lingual resources identified; Event registration opens... (This is simply the example I gave). I wanted to add transparency and auditability to the team's proposal. What I'm impressed with is how you manage the workload when creating a new manager for each funded proposal. I think this is something that other teams when making proposals need to learn. Because it will have high efficiency. It's welcome for the team to have such a work management idea. In addition, the challenge and the KPI seem to be very reasonable, it is in line with the things that need to be taken care of. As for key metrics, this is how the team shows professionalism with 8 factors. I am very convinced with your key metrics. I have a question about the part of the project that is considered a success: Did you state the target \"Day 2 has more than 50 participants from Africa and Africa-focused groups; At least 20 new Catalyst members from Africa, including proponents, CAs, and community members\". I have a question, assuming the fact that the target is not met, will the project be considered a success? Were there any specific team reports made public about this?

In my opinion, it is necessary to hold an big event like this for connecting talented people together, and sharing their success stories which could become an inspiration for other communities. Besides, I think, this proposal is suitable for the challenge as it will attract, expand cooperation opportunities, improve knowledge and understanding about Cardano blockchain, and bring new developers, entrepreneurs and Creatives into the Catalyst ecosystem, which could become an Africa event spotlight. This will be a full program of speakers, workshops and product demos focused primarily on the African market. As I know, it is not easy to hold an big event which requires a lot of resources, great efforts and might deal with some unexpected challenges: the event quality, technical requirements, and language barrier among stakeholders and partners. From the proposal, I know that the Wada team had some experience in organizing a 2-day Catalyst conference last year with 100 participants from 15+ countries. Therefore, I am more convinced about the executing ability of this proposal. However, I would like the proposer to give detailed link, if possible, proof of evidence of that event.

However, I only know this event will be held in December without detailed date on when will they start their first month plan? As far as I know, to be able to organize an event, especially event with large number of participants and different partners, you need a very detailed plan: Where will the event be organized? What is your proposed event date? Are there any sponsor? and I am not sure about who will be in charge of which task? especially who will be the direct project manager of this proposal? My suggestion is that they should make an marketing plan on Excel, on a daily basis or weekly for better management. In terms of project budget, I am confused about the requested fund because they listed all the cost for each item, but the total cost should be $56,200 instead of $50,200; I will assume it is a calculating mistake. Moreover, why the total budget is $50,200 but the proposed budget is $36,000 in which I would like the proposer to explain a little bit more for community understanding? A good point of the project is that this proposal is carried out by Wada team in which I found that they are talented and qualified people with a lot of experience and with provied Linkedin.

This would be a perfect way to show the world how Cardano has played a major role in African daily life. The mixture of speeches, demos, and workshops will show the stakeholders and participants how fruitful their investments of money and time have been. It is also expected to draw a lot of new minds onto the Cardano chain, who might want to be a part of the ecosystem and will try to submit their own ideas in the future rounds.

However, the only area where auditability metrics look feeble would be the number of participants and new catalyst members the author intends to onboard at the end of Day 2 of the event.

The project aims to converge Africans at a conferences with diversified series of activities that will showcases cardano projects, highlighting their potentials in providing solutions that ennui towards the advancement of the growth of the continent and the cardano ecosystem. This projects is well designed to further create awareness on blockchain based products and services that offers national solutions to the local problems that confronts the continent of Africa. This will further enhance and facilitate the adoption of the cardano network and also foster the transition of businesses onto blockchain technology. Therefore, I see a clear connection between growing cardano and growing Africa with this initiative. The proposer also presents a clear target population for this initiative \u2013developers, entrepreneurs and creatives based in Africa, or with an Africa-focused product. The design of the project does not only offer awareness creation, but also attempts to also on-board at least 20 new Catalyst members from Africa, including proposers, CAs and community members. I am also convince of the greater sense of sustainability this project seems to offer the continent, especially in terms of sustaining the interest of blockchain in the continent by this initiative. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal provides a well-defined work structure and a set out plan that could guide the team in the project implementation process. Again, on the roadmap, it is great the team provides more information on the duration for each activity. The roadmap gives us a visualize image of each activity and the timeframe set for each to  happen. However, I think the duration is quiet lengthy. For instance, for activities such as \u201cdesign & branding, content creation, workshops & agenda outline and outreach to speakers, panelists and products\u201d, I think a 2 month period is adequate. I think the duration from the start of the roadmap till main event should be reviewed if possible. Therefore, I wish the team presents a shorter version of the roadmap including the duration allocation for each activity. In respect of that, I suggest the proposer assigns specific role for each team member for the varoius activities within the roadmap. Nonetheless, I trust the capacity and the expertise of the team to deliver on this project, especially considering their years of experience in the cardano ecosystem. That aside, I am convinced with the work experience and the profile of the team members. The attached LinkedIn profile of the team is an indication of a team\u2019s transparency and the professionalism in carrying out this project. Further checks of the link presented confirms the expertise of the team. On the basis of this, I think the team experience and roadmap would complement each other to ease project implementation. Additionally, the budget is also rational for a project like this. Presents all the relevant breakdown required to justify the amount allocated. On the average, these are best prices ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The project provides sufficient information to audit the progress and the success of the proposal. It is really possible for us to audit the process already, taking into account  the extensive information made available on feasibility of  the activities that needs to be done. With the clear KPIs indicated, the progress and success of the project can easily be determined by the community. However, in my view, the only thing that should be clarified is how the Cardano community could access such information aside the links to the various sites provided. Would the team update the community through the Catalyst social media platforms? In my view, the proposer could continuously (as and when is available) prompt the community via their social media channels of the availability of a progress report on their sites; this could be done alongside posting links to the sites on the channel to enable easy access to the updates. We know that the team provides a link regarding the metrics, but I will suggest the team consider indicating how the community should monitor the progress from each update provided.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_4093", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "A dedicated program at the CatalystCon 2022 for African projects, speakers, demos and workshops.", "experience": "Cardano-based community network of 25+ professionals focused on connecting the world to Africa using blockchain and AI. 20+ funded proposals with strong partnerships within the Catalyst ecosystem.
