Therefore, having a proposal which tackles not only the language barrier but also the infrastructure to connect and participate is quite good.\n\nTherefore, looking into the metrics and goals of this proposal and the possibilities behind its success (creating awareness, knowledge, access etc) and, moreover, acknowledging the infrastructure solving this problem, aligns with this challenge.\n\nAnother point to validate its impact is when we look at the scalability possibility. Once the medium is created it allows the translated content to be uploaded and, therefore, the quantity of content is enormous. Therefore, it can scale to French content quantity and even to other languages. Also, having an easy to access and organized medium, it\u2019s quite possible that people will start to visiting and learning about ADA and blockchain. Therefore, it\u2019s quite scalable.\n\nThere is only a point that I visualize that could change its impact, being the content selection. There was not stated how the content will be selected to translate. Therefore, I imagine that the team will select all the content and that might be a huge risk, since the content you think it is better to translate and release might not be the ideal to that specific community at the time.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There are some important aspects to verify its feasibility, being:\n1 \u2013 roadmap: The roadmap presented is clear and plausible. It indicates all the milestones and also which group integrant will tackle each task.\n2 \u2013 Budget: The budget is clear, dividing all the cost into smaller costs allowing us to know exactly where the money is going. The only point that could be more detailed is about the translator payment. I\u2019ve noticed that the translator team member is not a \u201cprofessional translator\u201d. That being said, the majority of translators that I\u2019ve already worked together charge for the word. When the proposal states that the translator will work for 180hrs to translate and edit it gives us no clue of how much it represents \u2013 how many articles, videos etc. Therefore, this part of the budget might be more detailed in order to allow us, voters, to understand what it means, its impact and quantity.\n3 \u2013 team: There are team members with the desirable knowledge to accomplish the task. Unfortunately was not provided any proof (LinkedIn links, e.g.).\n4 \u2013 risk management: The proposal\u2019s considered some risks and also provided some mitigation\u2019s actions. However, it would be good to include one more risk which is the content selection. The team is composed by 5 people and, since they\u2019re developing this tool they are far beyond, in knowledge, the people they are tackling (clients), therefore the content selection to be translated is a very important aspect of this proposal. Therefore, in order to mitigate this problem, probably includes in the marketing part (in social media) a survey to meet the public and to know what they are eager for.\n5 \u2013 self funding/scalability: Unfortunately the proposal do not present a way to become self sufficient and scale (besides the next fund). It might be good to think about a solution. Of course the amount of needed money will reduce since the platform will be done. Therefore, the money needed is to the translator(s).\n\nThat being said, there is a  possibility  of this proposal be done and, if manage those minor points, it might increase its possibility and even increase the success and scalability success.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "KPIs and metrics provided are sufficient to track its progress and success. Besides that it was said that have a github and open project platform, which is great to verify its progress (link not provided).\n\nThe roadmap is very clear with milestones, turning this proposal easy to follow.\nThe problem was clearly stated and the solution tackles it and it align with challenge.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2298", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 3, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thanks for your valuable time and opinions.

Cardano and the ecosystem would be difficult to grow without the strong technology infrastructure and weak access to information from Catalyst in some parts of Africa.\n\nThe solution of this idea is good, it identifies some of the problems of the challenge, besides that the author of this idea logically, neatly, and creatively argues that Creating a vehicle of Cardano based on a server with HTML-CSS of the province in French will help some French-speaking African Countries where Internet connection speed is low, this is a persistent problem in some countries, Africa.\n\n The project highlights some risks in implementation, which will help the community to manage the risks if Funded, in addition, the feasibility of the idea will be better if the author comes up with a solution. to overcome those risks when it occurs. Financial, technological, and marketing risks are part of the project, when implementing the project, there will be many other risks: such as implementing human resources with a long-term commitment to the same project or quitting halfway. , factors affecting the project implementation schedule are considered risks and need to have solutions to limit those risks.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Great when a project provides a clear, logical amount of timetable information for implementation and completion.

Budget analysis is quite complete and detailed, in addition, in my opinion, the author should prevent price slippage, that is, at the time of ADA price at the time of proposal and time of disbursement, the author considers the project.\n\n Human resources to implement this project have been assigned specific jobs for each item, and the experience of the members shows that they are entirely suitable for the project.

Updates in the Github and OpenProject platforms are needed, however, the author needs to mention the KPIs achieved by the project through the provided progress timeline.\n\nThe concept of this project has not yet been determined to be a success, information from the proposal indicates that the idea is in the works. However, future products are very vague and unclear, as the author has not described what they will look like after implementation. The author's recommendation should focus on answering this Ideascale question: Please provide information on whether this proposal is a continuation of a previously funded project in Catalyst or a project completely new. In my opinion, this is probably a completely new idea on the Cardano platform, which has never received any funding from the Cardano ecosystem.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2489", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thanks for your valuable time and opinions.
