By taking advantage of the transparency of blockchain and low transaction fees on Cardano, the DApp can finally provide accurate information about the origin and the movement of the minerals, while at the same time incentivising miners to register and benefit from the ability to sell their minerals for the best price, without relying on third-parties any longer that are usually taking advantage.\nThis is a much-needed product, that could hopefully lead to several changes in the industry, hopefully in time, one of them will be to reduce to a minimum child labour in the mines, amongst others, such as working conditions and a fair income. I have come across another study regarding blockchain and mineral supply chains, I will post it here, in case it offers additional help to the proposer https://www.rcsglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ICMM-Blockchain-for-Traceability-in-Minerals-and-Metal-Supply-Chains.pdf \nIn conclusion, I see the proposal as being very well in line with the challenge brief and on top of that, the subject being tackled is of high importance as it could lead to a positive change, first in the lives of the miners from the DRC and through that have a positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From the information provided in the detailed plan, I am left with a clear understanding of how the process will function and when each task will be implemented. The chronology is well thought out and the timespan looks reasonable. The team is planning to start with a website design where all mining quarries of Coltan will be mapped, as such providing them and us with a clear overview picture. After this first step is completed, they will proceed to the next ones, ending with offering validation tools for DID certification based on identification. A very important mention is the fact that the DApp will be self-sustainable through the small fees of transfer of ownership of DIDs, as such, a successful enterprise can be forged through this funding.\nThe budget is split into 4 categories, \u201cDesign Validation Website\u201d, \u201cCatalogue quarries\u201d, \u201cOnboard Miners\u201d and \u201cTools and Equipment\u201d, each with an associated amount needed for completion. While all tasks are well described and all amounts look reasonable to me, I have to say that the budget would have been easier to assess if it would have contained numbers of hours and hourly rates, where applicable - for instance for the website, such information would have been welcomed. However, considering the nature of the project as a whole and how well it is otherwise described, I will not be deducting any points for this.\nThe team members are clearly described, all names have been provided and for 3 out of the 5 members they have also included LinkedIn profiles. Considering the information provided and the clarity of the text, I feel very confident that the team can successfully implement the project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team has provided ways to track the project\u2019s progress in ways that go beyond the obvious, minimum needed requirements. They intend to produce a video highlighting the targeted quarries and will continue to upload videos to Youtube for regular updates, which I find to be a great way for the community to monitor the progress in an easy and engaging way.\nThe success definition is very well described and looks reasonable and realistic. It is well based on the goals of the project, and as such, it makes perfect sense. One of the important points, that have been mentioned before, is the self-sustaining of the project through small fees from DID validation.\nConsidering all the data provided, I find the proposal to be easily assessed in regards to progress and success.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 3, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2443, "q0": "We found in this proposal a great example of the application of blockchain technology, as we realized that a latent problem on the African continent can be greatly benefited by the use of Cardano technologies. With that, it is easy to say that this proposal fits perfectly with the objectives of the challenge in which it finds itself. Furthermore, as indicated in the proposal itself, the success of this project would significantly contribute to the visibility of Cardano's ecosystem, as well as possibly open the door to solving other problems on the continent. Bearing all this in mind, we can say that the budget being requested is appropriate, since we have an innovative idea and qualified people to carry out the work.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "For the realization of a project like this, it is interesting that there are actions that reach several fronts of the project. By this I mean that not only the development of Dapp should be focused, but it would also be interesting to carry out a good mapping of the project's area of \u200b\u200boperation. And in a very positive way, we were able to find this, as the mines in which the project can be implemented are being located, as well as miners to initially participate in the platform. Regarding the team that will develop the platform, we can say that the professionals involved have, together, an extremely cohesive training with the objectives of the project. It is very good to see that his knowledge goes beyond the area of \u200b\u200bdevelopment, also contemplating the sphere of economy and public policies. We see that information has already been collected on miners who can participate in the project. Regarding the detailing of the budget being requested, we see that very correct capital allocations were established, and the activities are concerned both with the development of the website and with complementary actions so that this website has sufficient engagement.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The ways chosen to monitor the project make total sense in relation to what was developed during the proposal and we realized that the metrics chosen help to measure the impact of the project.

It is clear there's a need for such a dApp that offers an authentic chain of ownership of natural resources in the DRC. If successful it could be used as a model for other African nations plagued with similar issues.  Secondly, utilising the security that Cardano offers in creating the Certified Trading Chains (CTC) certification scheme should deliver a positive impact on the lives of the miners and improvement on the entire supplier chain. The plan of employing the Atala-Prism-based identification to miners will reduce smuggling as they can come together and remove the middlemen who exploit these miners due to a lack of proper representation on the international markets thereby increasing profitability. Due to the above reasons coupled with the existing relationship the team has with WADA-a Cardano-focused blockchain Hub fostering young African minds into the blockchain space, one can see a positive correlation between the success of this project and the onboarding of young minds into the Cardano eco.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Most of the pieces required to carry out the roadmap and complete the milestones are already available like designing QR codes for sealing containers holding minerals at storage and transit facilities, and providing DIDs for quarry operators using the Atala-Prism-based identification.

I understood from the milestones that this project features a revenue model from DID validation and transfer fees, but there is no established model present to evaluate how that may create barriers compared to the existing trade, or what additional financing for later phases will aim to achieve in terms of runway and adoption of this solution.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team and plan for this proposal offer confidence of a high likelihood of project delivery.  The proposer has a demonstrated history of participation in Cardano/Catalyst (Haskell/Plutus/Development/Node Operation/etc).

The proposer also states that they are involved in previously funded projects, as well as other project proposals in Fund 9, and given that active level of involvement, the 2 month delivery timeline for this project seems very tight, but not unbelievable.\n\nI liked that the proposer thought in advance about resources needed to present this opportunity in the remote areas mining areas where they will be operating through procurement of presentation and solar tools.  The one thing that could easily help me build more confidence in successful delivery would be to talk more about the challenges that face adaptation of a technology like this.  The mining industry (like agriculture as mentioned in the proposal) has a long history of monopolization and murky trade activity aimed at perpetuating limited access to valuable resources.  \n\nOverall, essential elements of the proposal are present and in enough detail to indicate the proposer's capability and intention to deliver.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "While this is a new project, the proposer has presented a clear roadmap for delivery of this first phase with delivery dates for each phase as well as open source tools for tracking progress (Github).\n\nA clear description of problems in the mining industry is complemented by a logical use of Cardano to deliver a solution with clear KPIs for early stage development, implementation, adoption, and revenue generation - including a promise to provide updates via social media and website content to build transparency in the project and affected industry.\n\nWith a clear overall vision for success and understanding that follow-on funding will likely depend on the ability of this team to deliver results through a variety of public forums, I'm confident that the results will be measurable as defined even though the proposer does not provide exact targets for adoption or use at this early stage.

I can infer the creation of new wallets, attract new users willing to invest in technological solutions, a local impact through the activity of these new users, interesting alliances with governments and other institutions in the sector.\n\nThe proposal is very interesting and from my experience working for almost a year in blockchain traceability solutions in the food industry I could give some recommendations to consider: \n\nFirst it would be interesting to explain in more detail what DIDs means since for many it is a concept not so easy to understand. \n\nFrom the little I know about DIDs I understand that they will serve in this solution to identify small miners and quarries as well as to identify product claims. I could be wrong but at first I thought so.\n\nIf the DIDs serve as product identification, a more detailed explanation of how they are linked to the miner is needed, and if there are certifications, how they are linked to the product, near the end of the proposal it touches on a point where miners will not be tempted to extract their product from protected areas, in the future it may help to create certifications linked to the product that prove that the product was obtained from non-protected areas.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\nThe proponent has provided references and links on the skills and experience of the team, also reading the profile of each member it can be said that the number of people needed for the execution of the proposal has been well identified, as feedback I propose to the team the integration of a person oriented to supply chain management and regulatory compliance and certification, if not within the team at least as an advisor on these issues. \n\nI touch this point because I could in the proposal a lack in details regarding traceability, in the future it would be interesting to expand the implementation so that traceability reaches the final customer, from my experience I can notice a challenge in the aggregation and processes specific to minerals, ie trace a product whose characteristics change due to multiple processes and is potentially aggregated with other minerals from different sources, underlines the need for an expert in the management of the supply chain.\n\nAlthough the necessary resources are detailed in the budget, it seems to me that the detailed plan does not explain a little more each of the tasks to be performed, especially who will be in charge or those involved in the performance of each task, I also find that the task of designing the website starts in June and ends in July, for that task have been designated 9000 dollars and does not specify how they will do to cover the expense since by that date still will not be awarded funds to be favored by the community.\n\nWhat happens if they are not favored in the voting? the tasks that started in June, July, how will those expenses be covered? If they already have funds to start those tasks, why include them in the proposal? \nThe roadmap seems fine to me but this inconsistency especially in the dates and not having detailed why they are put that way, time before knowing if they will have funds or not makes it difficult for me to say if the proposal can be implemented satisfactorily. \n\nto be more concrete, most of the tasks in the roadmap end in August, the winning proposals are announced in September, I think that if these tasks need funds (\"detailed in the budget\") it is impossible to carry them out before even having them or at least in the proposal it is not specified how this is solved.\n\nIt was probably a mistake that can be fixed by changing the dates to a later date, but unfortunately I have to evaluate what is written, and in writing is very complicated the implementation by this issue, coupled with the fact that one or more members are working on proposals of the same fund and funds passed without having an explanation of the management of the workload or something that refers to that issue. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Related to auditability I was able to find a lot of information regarding the channels of communication that will be used to communicate with the community and communicate the progress of the implementation of the proposal.

It would also be interesting a metric that allows the community to see how many stakeholders are involved, the number of products that have been successfully traced, etc.\n\nIf we are talking about a traceability solution these metrics are important, if the idea is to avoid confusion about the origin of the minerals, a metric that allows to know the amount of minerals that have been traced correctly or amount of minerals coming from healthy working conditions or amount of minerals coming from unprotected natural areas.I invite the team to reflect on such metrics and how they can measure them to provide transparency in the mineral supply chain but also transparency to the cardan community. \n\nFinally in relation to the budget, the amount and the budget breakdown seem reasonable to me, but due to this lack of metrics the auditability can be compromised, however the references of the team, the clarity of the solution plus the communication channels can be expected that the community will be aware of the progress of the solution.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2575", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5253, "q0": "Your suggestion is \u201cCreate a DApp on Cardano for the traceability of minerals through the certification of mining quarries & artisanal small-scale miners (ASM)\u201d I think it would be more appropriate to put it in Challenge Dapps, Products & Integrations.\n\nThe solution you have given is quite general and does not explain why applying Blockchain can remove the confusion about the origin of Congolese minerals and elsewhere sold on the international market.
