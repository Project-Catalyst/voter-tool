Word of advice to proposers, for future iteration, please do take more notice on readability, perhaps further attending Catalyst School workshop would be beneficial. Please understand some of the Proposal Assessors go through around 100+ submissions. It is quite a taxing job and we take our efforts very seriously.\n\nWith that said, this proposal seeks to empower women to be able to code on Cardano. The extent of the capability of their coding though is limited only to have created wallets (I assume creating an account and not a wallet itself), moved assets and learn about IT security and cryptography. The intended outcome of this proposal is low. From what is explained it does not actually provide applicable skills to build on Cardano.\n\nIt would seem that this course is only a basic introduction into Cardano although the proposer has gone into lengths to explain the syllabus that they would design. There is a confusing disconnect between the weight of the program and the intended outcome.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "One of the proposer have a strong background in education, specifically related to Cardano for they are graduates of Plutus Pioneer cohort 1, 2, and 3. This is very impressive for there are numerous reports on the difficulty of this program. The drop-rate is also high for the Plutus Pioneer program. Graduating from 3 cohorts itself deserves a massive round of applause.\n\nThough from what is stated in the proposal it does not translate well into a comprehensive and understanding action plan. The proposer attempts to address simplifying the Plutus Pioneer program so that it can accomodate newbies of Cardano. The simplified syllabus only goes for 1 (one) week. From what I understand, this course is extremely hard, and to be condensed into only 1 (one) week of training is asking the students and the educators too much.\n\nIt would be best practice prior to launching this program and it's syllabus, to first have a test-trial within the Cardano community. For there is a community that has developed a syllabus to educate on Plutus in a project based learning system. This project based learning system is created by Gimbalabs, and to my understanding it is open-source. Even if the proposer is reluctant to use Gimbalabs materials, they can collaborate with Gimbalabs to find insights that perhaps can ease the work of the proposers. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "From the information provided, there are many holes that need to be addressed. Some of these holes I have gone over lightly in my assessment above this.\n\nFrom my understanding, there might be a chance of oversimplifying the education material learnt from the Plutus Pioneer program. This can be detected by the output expectations of the students participating in this program. From what is shared, the students will have limited applicable skills to build on Cardano, for they are only expected to produce 2 (two) smart contracts. It does feel like a stop and go program where although there is effort to address continuation, there is not solid plan on it.\n\nThe proposers also although consider the risk of having no/limited number of students due to the prerequisites to attend these classes. There is limited effort to explain in detail how to mitigate this.

Therefore, foreseen the main risks involved and representing them in the proposal would make it stronger in the impact section.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This proposal leaves open one question, that is how will they make sure that they will be able to reach their targets? To assess the feasibility of the proposal, it would be necessary to have a contingency plan in case they don\u2019t have enough students interested or fully participating in the clubs. In addition, the budget has some unclear points. For example, the proposals say that they require 13500 USD for a \u201c3 Girls support Materials and Incentives\u201d. However, the proposal does not explain what are these incentives, nor why it applies only for 3 girls, if their target is more than 100. And this part of the budget is more than half of total budget. Therefore, the execution of the budget and the plan could be improved if they provide more details on what was pointed above.

I believe if cardano must get more African users on boarded then we must stop been biased when it comes to gender because we believe some things are meant for the male gender and not the female and because of this mind we have deprived the female gender from actively participating in some issues such as cardano blockchain.
