This solution can help to socialize power investment on a large scale and share burden on huge investment cost in Africa in particular and over the world in common by using cNFTs and smart contracts on Cardano. I suppose this proposal very interesting and has good impact on the electricity, society and Cardano ecosystem.\n\n\nBut I found it lacks of evident to show the huge potential but creating waste of micro-solar without grid infrastructure problem. For more confident, as an electricity expert and doing research on blockchain application, I suggest the proposer provide some ref link of statistic for current potential of solar energy in Africa compared to other areas in the world, the current power grid and energy access rating in Africa. One ref link that's useful for this situation is the Africa-energy-outlook on website: https://www.iea.org/reports/africa-energy-outlook-2022/key-findings\n\nThe impact will be huge across Africa. It will enable every landowner or building owner to monetise the excess power that is produced from solar panels or other form of renewable energy.\n\n\nThe proposal enables all prosumers to utilise locally produced sustainable energy, help Cardano adoption in Africa \nby infrastructure concerns impactful. So it well address this challenge.\n\nThe Author has not given direct risks, just provide some mitigations, but we could understand easily the risks in developer team and enough fund for development.\n\nIn my opinion, the most important risk that the team has not paid attention is the technology barriers such as: data collection from solar inverters, electricity meter for physically energy transaction measurement that I will tell more in the feasibility assessment.\nIn general, the proposal gives out current problems, have a suitable solution, bringing a lot of value to the community and the Cardano ecosystem. But there is still lack of evident for problem and important risk with mitigation, so I could not give maximum score for this proposal's impact.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has not given the roadmap and timelines for the community tracking easily, company establishing is just a first small step and we are still wait for feasibility study in next stage.

I suggest to build a roadmap with further vision for getting support from the community. \n\nThe proposal has not clearly explained technological aspects in architecture system. I recommend to build a whitepaper to show the solution in solar inverters data collecting and inputting into the platform, adding blockchain smart contract or CNFT features into smart electricity meter for physically energy transaction measurement and regulation.\n\nThe team could reference from Powerledger Energy Projects (https://www.powerledger.io) and some papers about Internet of Energy (IoE) for more details.\n\nFor engaging prosumers in long term, I suggest the proposer gives out a marketing plan and budget for community advertising.\nIn common, I doubt about the feasibility of this proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "About the auditability, the team have not delivered measurable KPIs to track progress of the project.

This problem affects as much as 30 countries on the continent according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). A few of the challenges facing African countries include the following:\n-\tElectricity outages because supply lags demand\n-\tPoorly managed electrical distribution and management utilities.\n-\tHigh tariffs and utilities usually paid by the end users.\n-\tDifficulties in attracting investment to this sector. \nTo highlight the urgency of this issue, the African development Bank (AfDB) has identified access to energy as one of its High 5\u2019s. That is one of its 5 strategic policy areas that must receive priority. It is noteworthy to point out that with regards to the electrical energy challenge, Africa can be divided into 3 different regions.\n1.\tNorth Africa \u2013 almost entirely electrified with most household having access to clean cooking energy.\n2.\tSouth Africa \u2013 which shares a similar situation with Northern Africa, and\n3.\tSub Saharan Africa \u2013 this is where the energy challenge is felt the hardest. It is estimated that as much as 600 million people still rely on biomass (wood and organic waste for cooking). Two \u2013 thirds of the population in the region do not have access to power, while the remaining one -third are affected by blackouts and brownouts resulting from structural constraints of the available power supply.\nSub \u2013 Saharan Africa needs new solutions in terms of finance, generation, supply and management of electrical utilities to solve this myriad of problems. One of those solutions could be the development of micro \u2013 grids and platforms to enable peer 2 peer distribution and supply in small and large communities. \nThis proposal if implemented, would effectively address the challenge of Growing Africa \u2013 Growing Cardano as its impact will be tremendous on the lives of not just African businesses, but the population as well. Smart contracts, DAO\u2019s, NFTs and even cryptocurrencies could solve this energy crises by turning energy consumers to producers (prosumers) of energy in a small- or large-scale network.\nNFT\u2019s and cryptocurrencies could serve prosumers as loyalty reward tokens if applied with the necessary hardware to manage both the physical and virtual layers in any community. While smart contracts could be deployed in the virtual layer for the supply and management of energy in a small or large circuit system.\nHowever, this innovation cannot function by itself in any environment without the needed partnerships with organizations managing the physical layer (grids) and the regulatory authorities in any country. \nDespite my assessment of the priority of this energy situation, this submission falls short of providing the necessary key metrics and goals that will be used to assess the impact of the project. Also, the plan lacks a clear path to future sustainability of this project.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team behind the idea of SurplusMap is adept with the necessary skills to effectively implement this proposal from a technical standpoint. However, it is well known that African countries present a unique challenge for any enterprise to navigate the socio \u2013 economic marketplace. \nFor this team to succeed with implementation, they need to recruit team members that will chart and provide solutions to the political, social, economic and technical challenges they may face or visit any of the target African countries. They should also consider the recruitment of an advisory board member to aid with their early pilot programs in any chosen country in Africa.\nThough in their application, it is mentioned the need to conduct a feasibility study before implementation commences. I find it quite odd that an initial research and development of the idea hasn\u2019t been undertaken, even without a feasibility study. \nI would propose that the project team should at least read some reports and publications about the energy sector in Africa before embarking on the feasibility study. Here are some links to research reports provided by some credible organizations operating in the African market.\nhttps://energsustainsoc.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13705-021-00325-1.pdf\nhttps://www.bakermckenzie.com/-/media/files/insight/publications/2019/02/report_blockchainandcryptocurrencyreg_feb2019.pdf\nhttps://library.oapen.org/bitstream/id/d21a3835-de79-4ed2-8c5b-6ccf0e8e269f/1006859.pdf\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2021/05/02/africa-needs-electricity-now-more-than-ever-especially-to-keep-covid-vaccines-cold/?sh=5395aeb95806\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02390.pdf\nThrough these reports, an early assessment of the African energy challenge can be achieved. Early plans towards implementation would be developed. The key enabling factors and the regulatory organizations to partner with will be identified.\nThese key enabling factors include: \n-\tDistributed renewable energy resources\n-\tDigitalisation\n-\tConducive Regulatory Framework\nI would suggest that in the near future, the SurplusMap team should consider working in small communities in Africa to pilot their ideas and gain the needed traction in terms of success stories. \nWith regards to the budget as proposed, the figure given was for the development of a feasibility report. I would propose that in a new budget, consideration should be given to the purchase of the needed hardware to manage, analyze and check the reliability of the power system. These include smart meters, broadband communication infrastructure, network remote and control systems for the virtual network.\nDue to the fact that a budget breakdown wasn\u2019t given, one cannot ascertain if the required amount for the proposal is sufficient or not. This should be provided for in a new submission even if it is still a feasibility assessment that needs to be done with the duration it takes to complete a study of the situation.\nI also propose that the team should build partnerships with the regulatory authorities in regions or districts they choose to pilot their proposition. This will ensure a level playing field for all platform-based organizations. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Since this manifesto requires a new submission as many of the features needed to reach an assessment is missing. I would submit that the project team needs to conduct a research and development of the challenges of the African market before the preparation of a feasibility study. \nAs this proposal stands, it lacks the milestones needed for an impact, feasibility and auditability assessment.  This proposal should be resubmitted for Fund 10 with the required information provided in the new proposal. \nAlso, one of the weak areas of the project team is that there is no one skilled with the knowledge or capacity for marketing and digital marketing. This skills gap will be needed to announce early success stories to the Cardano community and the World. \nA new submission is required to fulfill the need of this proposal.\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_3800", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 5, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 542, "q0": "Creating new secure ways to record microgrid transactions with a blockchain is an excellent use case that directly addresses the challenge question. As a community member with a background and diploma in sustainable energy technology, I am well aware of the challenges with renewable energy generation, energy distribution, and maintaining base load and peaking power by creating a flexible supply of renewable energy that can match a fluctuating demand. For a brief overview of these concepts see this link: https://www.kcet.org/redefine/explainer-base-load-and-peaking-power.\n\nAdditionally, here is a brief overview of what a microgrid is. https://www.treehugger.com/what-is-a-microgrid-5208727 \n\nAs this proposal plans to use Cardano to enable a payment system for this micro production of electricity, this could bring significant transaction volume to the Cardano blockchain as it scales up. One can imagine it creating a \u201cbase load\u201d of on chain transaction volume that is completely uncoupled from the crypto market price action, and having a large impact on the Cardano ecosystem. \n\nFunding this proposal could lead to creating more renewable energy ecosystems where energy credits are traded between separate microgrid installations, further enhancing their economic viability. Another example of this blockchain technology in use is the work done by https://www.powerledger.io/ who at the time of this assessment have a market cap of $93,984,106. Some of this market share could come to Cardano if this proposal is funded. This concept has great potential to have a massive impact on the Cardano vision for Africa and helping more communities gain access to renewable electricity, internet, and the cardano ecosystem. Additionally projects like this will be an important tool for addressing some of the financial challenges that renewable energy producers face while providing affordable and renewable power. In remote areas where large-scale electricity grid infrastructure is lacking, small microgrid systems consisting of renewable power are not just about environmental concerns, they are often the most economically viable source of electricity available. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team consists of experienced professionals in the renewable energy and blockchain space, therefore it is highly likely they will be able to complete this proposal consisting of an early stage feasibility study.

How is the exchange happening, if any at all? How can the NFTs be traded on the secondary market, what does that entail?

Second, they could have dived deeper into the connection between excess energy production and Cardano.
