Taking good care of the young generation by way of genuine education, and transparency is a good solution to reduce violence problems in the future. Funding sent directly to select parents in the form of cryptocurrency is a smart and innovative idea. The project has a detailed description of some of the risks when implementing, in addition to some solutions proposed by the author and the idea for overcoming them, but the community needs to be informed of more solutions for these problems.

The author proposes to focus on answering the question.

However, it is a very difficult project in a sensitive environment and I believe there are more risks involved than the one mentioned. For example, is internet and cellphone access widespread so people would use Cardano as currency? Do the beneficiaries have the adequate educational level to be properly educated on blockchain? How to avoid people lying about being victims of violence to get the benefit?

This has happened to families as well and so for this reason the Support for Education is being proposed. There is a challenge to be solved here because if these atrocities and harm caused to families care preventing children of school going age not to be in school, this this challenge must be addressed and supported. Thankfully, the proposer is aiming at introducing this in the Cardano Community and also aiming at  registering the affected children in Cardano system to create a reliable database which the proposer believes will bring relief and other benefits. This i believe will add value to the Cardano ecosystem in various ways because children of school going age will find help in ways that can help them have vocation education and other TLMS (Teaching and Learning Materials) which will aid in their education. This will also make the Cardano ecosystem happy. The KPIs used are not much but the proposer hopes that, once project kick start, much would be achieved. This project will address future challenges if proper monitoring and evaluations are done which the proposer has stressed more on to make it work even in the future .", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There are no links and supportive document supporting this project but the proposer has demonstrated how successful this project has been implemented. Isdrgl is already a higher development with vocation of secondary education graduate which has placed more than 2740 graduate into the job market. This means that the project is already producing result in the community. The project is made up of about 4 team members with each one having a background in different fields which they believe will help in implementing the project well. One holds a degree in development science, the other degree in project planning with an experience in Mushroom cultivation etc. The budget is clearly laid out how it will be carried out with fund of USD 59525 is granted. A period of 6 months would be used.\nThe proposer presented clearly how he will utilize the fund in this for\n1. environmental scan to have a contact with political authority $ 1500\n2. .identification and beneficiaries selection with transport  includes $  5500\n3. training on the project   philosophy  3500 :$ \n4. school fees support for 205 students    30750 $ \n5. school bad  and  other supplies $ 5075\n6.  staff salary   8400 :$ \n .office suplies 2800$ \nThis budget is reasonable to carry out his project because TLMs and Tuition fees of 205 children will be catered for. The proposer intends to apply for more funds when the need arises.\nThe proposer talks of database they will get from the government in other for them to keep track of the population since it is a war ton area. However, the proposer does not talk of the means of communication(Language) by which it will use to engage the community. English may also be part of the communication mode.\nAwareness is being created in the community by rising people who are victims of war ,hunger and other calamity ,and the opportunity ADA is  promoting which is opportunity for the proposer in securing the wallet of the African ,reason of grow Africa, Grow Cardano.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer believes that in a mater of 6 month, this will be implemented successfully. This is because there has already been job provision for over 8740 graduates and also tuition fees and other TLMs (Teaching and Learning materials) have been provided.\nThe proposer stressed more on Monitoring and Evaluation and also regular visit that(KPIs) to define the success of this project. This makes sense because consistent monitoring will help implement this project well.

First of all, in the problem statement we only find some general data on how the province of North Kivu is composed, stating as a problem that they have been victims of atrocities. Although this information serves to give us some context, this problem is beyond our reach to solve. I would suggest adding in the articulation of the problem, what are the effects of the situation reported and its influence on education, which is really the problem that I understand is intended to be addressed in the proposal. Further, I would have liked a more detailed explanation of the differentiating factors provided from the adoption of the Cardano ecosystem and its sustainability. This is because, at present, I only observe the project team's intention to use it as a cryptocurrency through a traditional method of receiving funds. While this would increase wallet activity, there is much more potential in Cardano to exploit with this proposal.\nTherefore, I would like to suggest that the author provide us with more details of the 12 listening sessions they plan to conduct on the use of Cardano. If the content of such trainings is of high impact and has the potential to engage people into our ecosystem, then it would add value to the proposal.\nFinally, for the purposes of introducing another example of the potential that could be leveraged to maximize the impact of this proposal, I would like to mention the possibility of using solutions that allow you to have verifiable data of the 205 children and families benefited, with governance and/or digital identities built on Cardano, such as Atala PRISM (https://atalaprism.io/). Thus, we would not only be guaranteeing the use of ADA but also contributing to the scalability of the use of the ecosystem in Africa.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "In order to better understand the project team, I would like to request links or detailed references to their experience with concrete examples of their most significant accomplishments, which would help us to endorse that they possess the necessary skills to successfully complete this proposal. For example, they refer to Apolinnaire SENZIBERA and indicate that he has a lot of experience in mushroom culture. An individual's definition of \"many years of experience\" may vary from 5 years to 25 years or more for another. So, my recommendation is to be as specific as possible. Also, in one part of the proposal they mention that a social supervisor will make visits to validate that the planned activities are being carried out. However, we do not know who this person is and what is his/her relevant experience for this function.\nRegarding the budget, it is recommended to detail the line items and break it down into clearly identifiable elements. For example, $8400 is allocated for Staff Salary and it would be advisable to identify who is part of that staff and to break down the pay rate of each one of them, in order to know if it is in accordance with their responsibilities. Regarding the $5500 for identification and beneficiary selection, I would suggest to identify the individuals who will be performing the identification and what the amount will be for each, as well as how many people will be traveling and how many trips there will be, so that we can estimate their unit cost. Following these guidelines with all the concepts of the budget, besides making it auditable, facilitates the understanding of the scope, and will help the team to monitor the cash flow once they obtain the funds.\nFinally, I see the need for the proposer to describe in more depth the tasks that compose the solution that is being proposed. For example, the proposer indicates that they will conduct 12 training sessions on the operation of blockchain cardano systems for beneficiaries and their parents for 205 families. Then, please comment on what is the agenda for these trainings, if they are already prepared or need to be created. If the material is not ready, how much time and resources will be needed to develop it, who will deliver the sessions and what is their relevant experience, what will be the duration of such activity, if they already have the appropriate location with capacity for the target number of people, if there is a cost for such location, among others. \nUntil we can have more details of the execution plan of the proposal and its budget, I strongly disagree the project is feasible.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Although the proponent describes the results that are expected to be achieved in a 6-month period, in order to be successful it must be clarified what are the milestones that will help us identify at any time during those 6 months, whether the project is on track or not. For example, they plan to conduct 12 training sessions on the operation of blockchain cardano systems for beneficiaries and their parents for 205 families. So, my recommendation would be to break down these 12 training sessions into a schedule for those 6 months, for example: 4 sessions by month #2, 4 sessions by month #4 and 4 sessions by month #6. That way, if 2 months have already passed and only 1 session has been completed, we will know that we are behind schedule, and corrective actions can be taken in time. Then, it is necessary to accompany the plan with specific KPIs that also alert us of any deviation, as well as serve to let the community know the progress of the proposal to encourage its replication at other locations. An example of KPIs could be: the number of attendees to the training sessions (to measure the engagement rate), the number of applicants to the program (to determine the target and potential population in future cycles), the number of schools enrolled in the program (to measure the reach), among others. In conclusion, the proponent should work on the above mentioned points in order to be able to assess the progress of the proposal in attaining its stated goals.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_3161", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11412, "q0": "The issuance of academic certification is heavily centralized.
