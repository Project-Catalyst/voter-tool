I would like to see this project again in the next Foundation if this proposal is not Funded in this Fund. Not only athletes, artists or creators (especially young student-age creatives around the world) but any social influence need access to resources. resources to monetize ownership, this is a matter of promoting respect for the exclusive value of creative works. The impact of this project is quite large,\n\nThe solution of this proposed idea is excellent, it identifies almost all the problems that need to be solved in this challenge, and the author's argument through the description is logical and clear. clear and complete. The solutions proposed by TiDi Nation are innovative and actionable as they provide education on blockchain industry, cryptocurrency, decentralized finance, NFT and monetization positions on Project Catalyst through channels. Influential, they identify target customers like Gen-Z and Millennials as Market Influencers, as well as have impressive companions like Diaspora Africans and current/former NCAA Division 1 and professional soccer/soccer players, HBCU (Black Colleges and Universities in American History) began with the Danish Technical College in South Carolina.\nColleges and Universities in West Africa and the Caribbean, But Youth Clubs, Professional Organizations and National Teams.\n\nThe project highlights some risks in implementation, which will help the community to manage the risks if Funded, in addition, the feasibility of the idea will be better if the author comes up with a solution. to overcome those risks when it occurs. On the other hand, funding risk, or more precisely, financial risk is just one of the general areas of the project when it is funded to deploy, the author needs to list more than other risks such as human risk. risk (is there any basis to affirm that the project participants will go all the way, is there any commitment contract or legal covenant?), macro risk Due to political instability is very common In Africa, the factors affecting the project implementation schedule are considered as risks and need solutions to limit those risks.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Great when a project provides a clear, logical amount of timetable information for implementation and completion. The goals that the project is aiming for are also very specific and completely achievable.

We know the work to be done, where, in space and time. Next is the budget. The proposal asks for $80,000. Less than 20% of the total challenge budget was set. In my opinion, the required value is quite reasonable given the complexity and time nature of the project. The author has provided a very detailed budget table. The budget is broken down and allocated to each very specific job, estimated hourly, for each job. Finally about the core members of the group.

After researching referral links, I found TiDi Nation (TN) is a professional athlete training environment, I think you should focus on this segment first, it is definitely an advantage for you, is the premise to develop other arrays. Can the proposal better describe how to support athletes to access blockchain in general and Catalyst in particular? Since athletes are mostly focused on training, understanding other areas will be affected. Not to mention most of them lack background knowledge about computers, finance\u2026 And that is also a risk of the project.

Why is the hourly salary of the delivery team higher than the R&D& manager salary? Looking forward to your answer\nThe team has 6 main members, diverse in areas as proposed presented.
