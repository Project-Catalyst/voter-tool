However, the budget in the proposal seems to not be on the same quality-level as the team description is. A more detailed budget would increase the chances of this proposal being voted on. I will list some examples. The costs for one outreach event seem a bit high and vague. In order to raise the transparency and really showing the community the quality of the budget I would suggest adding a financial breakdown (budget pre-event vs. the actual costs that incurred) of previous held events. 9.000 dollar for a return flight from Accra to Cape Town seems a bit much. Google shows me that 1 flight for 1 person is about 1000 dollar, so I assume there are more people coming over from Ghana?

The team and both supporting organizations have an abundance of experience in blockchain and supporting programs within Africa. The team also has blockchain developers that are plutus pioneers which will be beneficial for onboarding and further training developers in plutus. The proposal breaks down all costs including project management, event costs, presenter costs, marketing, etc, and also established this through research not just assuming how much the cost would be. The proposal has also taken into account inflation, so the project does not end up being short on costs, as inflation within Africa is high.

The challenge's objective is to help Africa and Cardano grow, the measurable metrics that would help successful audit implementation are users and developers onboarded onto Cardano.

This proposal clearly addresses the challenge effectively and I hope it gets funded this time around.

South Africa is by far one of the greatest countries on the African continent with lots of developmental activities going on. Recently I had a conversation with a South African friend who is Blockchain enthused and he was just informing me that the South African bank is placing a ban on the usage of visa/credit cards to buy crypto. This problem clearly is a result of a lack of education on blockchain in the country. It is of course true that a lot of people have used crypto in fraudulent activities and thus reserved banks want to take certain actions to prevent continuous issues like these. However, I don't think that's the right solution instead, it's education. The populace needs to be educated in order to have their level of vigilantism raised. This is one of the major challenges that the Grow Africa, Grow Cardano challenge setting seeks to find solutions to as far as the wide-scale of Cardano is concerned. \nScouting for solutions, I think one of the critical solutions is what this proposal provides. The idea of targeting students, developers, and business personnel is definitely going to yield a great impact. For instance, if business personnel are able to understand the Cardano ecosystem through this event, then Cardano will start receiving a boost in business proposals.

The fact that the team has consulted agencies to provide a clear budget and as well made room for contingencies certifies that the team is aware of the cost needed for the successful implementation of the project.\nThe proposing team does well to provide a conductible plan. Even though it may look broad, it is understood exactly what would be done and by whom, and at what time. \nThe team also indicates that it would need some round of funding from Catalyst to ensure that the adoption rate of Cardano in South Africa is being boosted and this is essential for the community\u2019s expectation in subsequent funds to come.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "From the roadmap of the project, there are clear milestones that can be tracked by the community.
