Ghana is a country in West Africa. Has a population of 31.07 million (in 2020. World Bank). Belongs to the African continent. The author proposes the idea to start an active educational club in schools to educate children aged 10 and up about the Cardano ecosystem, blockchain technology, cryptocurrency and smart contracts. The proposal impacts the challenge posed and I think it has been described in detail and richly through: Methods, Approaches, Uniqueness, and Benefits. By starting Cardano Academy GH: Education about Cardano, Eliminating Crypto Misperceptions, Africans will participate in smart contract and dapp development... Cardano will become a company owned in Ghana and it is the ADA currency which will be the most preferred cryptocurrency in the country. The author also realizes that the biggest difficulty in this project is the opposition of the parents. At the same time, the author has come up with an active solution to raise awareness about radio and television that aims to inform both parents and the public about what Cardano GH Academy is all about and the benefits of being a member. part of the Cardano ecosystem. This is a good proposition for future young generation and future Cardano development.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the plan of the proposal, the author provides us with background information to evaluate this section. The first is about the route. The author analyzes the work in detail over: 4 weeks since the start, 1 month after the start and 6 months since the establishment. We know what will be done in the project according to what the author has presented. Next is the budget. The proposal asks for $42,820. accounted for nearly 10% of the total challenge budget. This is a pretty high budget. However, in my opinion, this is quite a fair value given the complexity and roadmap of the project. The author has deeply analyzed and explained the value of each budget allocated to each job by time, space, tools and personnel in great detail. Finally, about the core team members. We know the members are all people with the right skills and experience to do the work on the project. At the same time, the author also provides a text presentation about each member, and attaches a link to let us know more about the history and experience of the members that the proposal has presented. In general, the plan of the proposal is very good, the budget is transparent and the members are skilled and experienced, increasing the feasibility of the proposal.

The proposal is new, but from the plan board, it shows the expertise and active efforts of the proposed team. The detailed roadmap in each milestone can help the developer easily audit the successful progress of the project.

The proposers have seen a challenge in Ghana especially among children of school going age. A  good number of the population in Ghana do not know about the Cardano community and the ecosystem Blockchain technology, cryptocurrency (ada), smart contracts and the Metaverse. This to the proposers is a great challenge. Because of the lack of information about the Cardano ecosystem, being a teacher, starting with a club activity in schools about the Cardano, the proposers believe the information and the awareness of the Cardano will spread fast in Ghana. In the club meetings namely Cardano Academy GH. It is aimed at introducing children above 10 years about blockchain technology, cryptocurrency and smart contracts. This will have a huge impart on the Cardano ecosystem because in the first place the whole project is about creating awareness among young children above 10 years to the Cardano ecosystem. Knowledge they say is power therefore as the children learn about the community during their club meeting, they will surely tell their friends from other schools about the Cardano community and even to their parents at home. In Ghanaian schools, children are very happy when new things are introduced to them especially this being an emerging technology club. Looking at the region where the proposer wants to start,(Northern Region) where majority of the children are ignorant about technology, they will embrace it fast. The proposer intends to start this project in the school where he teaches and then later on spread it to other schools in Tamale and even the entire nation. This will really benefit the Cardano community. There will be a great value on the Cardano community because the proposer articulated how he is going to work to make this happen. This because the proposer and his team members have 18 years experience in Child education and awareness creation.\nThe KPIs that the proposers intend to use is first of all their approach they will use to get young children informed about the Cardano ecosystem. Their first approach is to establish the club called the Cardano Academy GH in schools starting from his school where he teaches (Stepping stone education centres) Secondly Parents will get to know and thirdly Ghana as a whole will get to know of the Cadano community. Also the uniqueness and the benefits associated with this are the key KPIs used by the proposers. This is relevant to this challenge in a big way because at the end of the project, many people in Ghana and even Africa will be informed about the Cardano community. In the future many people will get to know about the Cardano ecosystem, the misconception about the crypto currency would be cleared among others.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer and his team have 18+ years in child education and also being a teacher and  blockchain technology awareness creation, they believe they are well equipped and experience to implement this project successfully. With this experience, the proposer have educated about 1000 youth on the opportunities of blockchain technology. The proposers provided a link ( a youtube master class lessons on the crypto currency) which explains more and educate more of the crypto wallet and it use. With this i believe the education will go very well in creating awareness of the Cardano ecosystem.\nThe proposers clearly outlined the budget they will use to run this project.

The proposer will be working with 2 more team members with ambassadors who will help spread the news and implement it successfully. The proposers are looking at using 6 month duration for this project. first 4 month for setting up on clubs and major publicity by using radio and T.V means of communication. By the end of the 6th month, the proposers are certain that there will be more than 30 Cadano Academy GH in most schools. Because the proposers want to spread the new across the whole of Ghana, they will be returning for more funds to create this great awareness. The main technology that will be used to implement this project is the education during club and the youtube master class program. in the link, part of the class is in French whiles the rest are in English.

The KPIs used make sense because since they will be doing more of education, setting up of the clubs in schools and the youtube master class on the crypto wallet education, success will be achieved .However this a project that the community can not keep track of its progress because once the school children get the education about the Cardano ecosystem and finish school, new set of student will be trained again.

The team will start the Cardano GH Academy at the Stepping stone Education Center, where the students will gain knowledge and spread the good news about the Cardano ecosystem to others.

The Proposal to effectively address the challenge posits \" that provides solutions to educational and infrastructure concerns\". The group mentioned the objections of students' parents who would object as the main challenge and risk when implementing the project.

The group created a radio and TV promotion campaign, three times a week for four weeks. 1 month after start: Cardano Academy's first GH Club will begin. 6 months from inception: At least 30 GH clubs will start in six different schools with a total membership of 300. The timeline is realistic regarding development. As for the budget, I found the team to give a pretty detailed budget breakdown. But I see the budget to pay for CONTINGENCIES = $3000, I don't see the group explaining this expense. The group presented about the education and experience of its members in the field of education.

However, there is no detail on how this would be done. Proponents suggest \u201caggressive education\u201d (what do you mean? How would this be done?) be carried out in schools, ie, the target audience is children around 10 years old. Although I personally think it is a very early age to introduce this type of knowledge, which is complex, if this is done together with computer and technology classes that are already present in the students' curriculum, it can work. The point would be that: it is necessary for the proponents to explain how the topics will be addressed, how they will be easily accessible for this age group. It is also not explained how the demystification would be done for the parents/relatives, who can often be resistant to it since they do not have correct information about the subject.

We know what would happen, approximately how long the activities would take place, but it is not explained in detail how they would be done. The advertising campaign on radio and TV: what issues would be addressed and in what way? How to ensure that the target audience is reached? The proponents do not explain how, after a month, the club would be set up. What small actions would be necessary for him to leave theory and become practice, with classes and several students? The budget division is very adequate, it is very clear how the money would be divided and used. And about the professionals involved, the level of detail about each one is good, what worries me is that no one shows a solid previous experience with Cardano itself. Thus, the feasibility is average, having some basic information included, but a series of necessary improvements.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability of progress is interesting.

Photos and videos of the club will also be taken, in general some partial results will be observed, my questions are: will the development process itself (club building and dissemination) also be monitored? How will this all be passed on to us? The auditability of success is weaker, because we have little information about what success would be, how it would be perceived. It would be necessary to carry out a more in-depth study on the consequences of the project, both for the children of Ghana, their families, and how this club provided a greater adoption of the technologies of our ecosystem in the country.
