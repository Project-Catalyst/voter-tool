The proposer states, that due to fraudulent issues with GoFundMe, and that these accounts are not accessible for Ethiopians, another way must be introduced. The proposer provided a system flow picture, and it is not really clear, who will represent authority. If we are talking blockchain, we are talking decentralization, thus there should be no authority. Or, if the authority will be this fund, then, it should have been specified, because now it is open for interpretation. Also, they aim to implement ID verification, which should have been also elaborated more \u2013 will be AtalaPRISM and DIDs utilized for this purposes? Or by \u201cID verification\u201d we are actually talking that the \u201cauthority\u201d from the picture will verify it? If so, why is blockchain relevant in that case? Nevertheless, even despite that not every question is answered, the impact of crowdfunding via blockchain in order to prevent frauds can be beneficial for Ethiopia, but it is not really inducing Cardano adoption, nor I do not see how it is preparing Ethiopia for a future Cardano adoption. One way is to have a crowdfunding in Cardano, but is it possible to withdraw that cardano? If so, how? Who will have access to it? Can people in Ethiopia create wallets on this crowdfund and own their wallets? This part is also unclear. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal is containing a roadmap in a form of a picture, whereas the columns are representing months. It is expected that the delivery of this solution will be by the end of February 2023. From the tasks on the roadmap \u2013 there is Requirements gathering, designing, system designing, coding, testing, deploying and advertising, Unfortunately, just a simple term describing an action item e.g. coding, is not self-explanatory and requires more details to actually assess, whether it is feasible. If you, as proposer, actually know what needs to be done, so a more detailed description is required. The budget is 60 800 USD in total, and also in this case, the tasks with their description are quite superficial, and e.g. \u201cBudget for requirement collecting\u201d -> \u201cFor recruiting data collectors to be paid\u201d is not very informative. The formula 3 x 2500 is not clear either \u2013 does it mean 3 people per 2500/usd/month? How many hours are expected? For the second item \u2013 development \u2013 only an amount of 35k is stated \u2013 how many people will be there? For how long? Hourly wage? Regarding the team, there are 4 people stated, with their linked in profiles. I can say, that according to the linkedin profiles it appears that the team is having a strong core, but nowhere in the proposal was discussed how they plan on hire the missing members, or, how to pair the team members with the tasks outlined in the roadmap/budget breakdown. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The problem (fraudulent accounts or inability to launch GoFundMe) is stated, and as a solution the proposer wants to create a crowdfund on the blockchain, utilizing smart contracts. Actually I think, the most beneficial part of this solution would be decentralization, but then I see the \u201cAuthority\u201d icon in the flow, and it makes me unsure, whether the relation between the problem and the solution is making sense. Regarding the audit of milestones, the proposer provided a picture, and I dare to say, that neither of these are actually sufficient for measuring the process. For auditing, we would need to see \u2013 some weekly posts, blogs or reports. Some public channel so the community can verify the status e.g. discord, twitter, telegram. Also, the proposer state that once the traditional way of funding (people asking for help) is replaced and also the need to set up GoFundMe account is not needed anymore, then the proposal was successful. Well, to measure success of the proposal, you should be monitoring (examples - 1. How many users are using it 2. How many request got funded 3. What is the volume of this transactions 4. What is the trend of new users (increasing, decreasing) 5. Fund success rate e.g. 100 requests, but only 1 got funded \u2013 not cool right?)). But given the current state, and the information provided, we are not really able to keep track with the proposal.

Offering a secure and reliable option would be a boost. however, there are already existing platforms that offer this service. The team fails to provide concepts that make their project different from the rest. Concepts like community earn initiatives- Where Atala Prism IDs will be given throughout the community those who actively participate in the building of the community can get funded when they have medical concerns. This would provide healthy community growth and offer a positive feedback donation loop. \nBased on the architecture of the project the DegaFund will be a centralised system. How? well, users have to send their data to an authority that will confirm, upload and mint that to a blockchain. Using a decentralised option like DIDs for everything identity is a better route to take for the project and the security of their client's data.\nThe amount asked is disproportionate to the work and impact of the project. There are already open source codes that could be used with a few tweaks here and there to make this project available for half the amount and it will be globally accessible through the use of the Cardano protocol.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "There are a few red flags why I find the completeness of this endeavour challenging. The team has provided names and their expertise but it hasn't shown who will be working on what aspects of the development and how much they will be paid over the duration of the building process.\nThere are some discrepancies with the budget breakdown( For recruiting data collectors to be paid on contract 3*2500=$7500 and not $10000) \nThere are other risks apart from not getting funding that can be seen. For example, having a centralised point of failure with the data of their subscribers due to the nature of their data architecture. Will the data be hosted on a centralised data storage facility like AWS or on a decentralised one like Arweave? These are details that should be provided.\nThe team boasts of having built and delivered full-scale end-to-end digital solutions and implemented successful product launches and customer acquisitions but doesn't show any that can be used as a reference for their past success. Additionally, the image shared to explain the inner working is vague and doesn't show any deep thought was put in to address some concerns.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "here is no Github that has been set up, and no social media channels. It will be difficult for the community to be updated on the project's progress. The milestones provided don't give any clear timeframe for completion and only provide activities they plan on doing without pointing out who in the team will be accomplishing these. Things like \" fully working on the system satisfying all the requirements including the digital money used for the transaction\" This implies that another currency which is not the L1  currency will be used on the platform but no more info has been provided like the tokenomics, team allocation or emission schedules. \nAlso, the team hasn't clearly shown how the mechanics of the Dapp will work. How will institutions like NGOs partake in the funding, do they create their own accounts or the funds will be centrally made available to the Dapp via a smart contract?

Sometimes these people can turn to other people for help. However, there are some instances this kind of call for help is nothing but a scheme for them to get easy money. There are also some organizations collecting money to help these people, and again sometimes these organizations are just vanishing with the money they collected. \n\nThis proposal is trying to find a solution to problems I mentioned. Creating a trustworthy crowdfunding platform for people in need is great idea. Also, implementing this idea within a blockchain technology can decrease the security concerns for many. There is still a risk of people lying about their needs, apparently for which Ethiopian Government has already found a solution. Unfortunately, the script does not give any answers to how they will be using the government\u2019s resources. I wanted to see some solid proof that the government does not have any problems giving their database for these purposes. Generally such an information is not open to public and there is nothing in the proposal saying it otherwise. If this aspect cannot be implemented, there will be no way of eliminating fraudulent people.\n\nThe script says that there is only one risk for it; lack of funding. In my opinion this can be considered as not being prepared enough. I cannot think of any project or an idea that has only funding risk. For example; proposal does not talk about what will happen if they cannot find donors and what they will do to find them. Even not mentioning is not a good look for the proposal. Also in addressing the challenge they did not give any answer. They have just put down the same things they have written while describing the solution and added a diagram that is also irrelevant with the question. This proposal is a good way for Cardano to increase its operability in Africa and to help the African people but the script failed to explain this.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The script presents a timeline and budget breakdown. However, there is no detail in timeline and very little detail in budget. Planned milestones and ending dates have been presented with a table but without further explanation for these steps it is hard to say that it has been planned very well. I believe there has to be more details for each of these milestones and what will be the success criteria and precautions for each of them. Almost same thing can be said for budget breakdown as well. They have identified the tasks and gave their descriptions but did not give any thought process for their costs. For example; in \u2018Development and testing\u2019 task, cost of infrastructure is given. There are no information how this cost is calculated. They could have at least given cost analysis from AWS for their required servers and systems. \n\nThe team looks solid, I have checked their pages and some of their projects. I can safely say that they can make this project work with some more solid planning. With that being said, I have to say one more negative thing for the project\u2019s feasibility. Further down the road they are planning to come back to Catalyst for funding; in order to spread this project to other countries. However, they don\u2019t give information or make any research on which countries has infrastructure similar to Ethiopian Government\u2019s, that this project can be applied. Therefore, saying this project will spread to other countries does not have any basis.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "They have given the details of the project milestones as a table under tracking the progress part, which is a totally different place than where it should have been. Also, this table does not give any answer to how they will track the progress of each of these steps. Putting just a table and not giving any explanation for it can be considered very lazy thing to do especially when the budget does not have any solid foundation. Same thing can be said about the success of the project. They are planning to replace using the traditional way of collecting help and using GoFundMe account. What I understand from this is that they want their project to be the only way to get help for these people, and to completely eliminate these said alternatives. In my opinion this is a very broad purpose and ergo not an easy feat to manage. I do believe that their idea is a great one, but they failed to prepare a solid plan to make this work.
