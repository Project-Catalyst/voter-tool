The problem is consistent with the challenge. The problem solves two challenges: expanding the Cardano community and improving the knowledge and standard of living of Africans. This proposal represents the expansion of the project in F8, expanding the community in the future with a population of 1.4 billion people in Africa by 2022.

The solution is to have a big impact on the Cardano community of participants, who are disseminated their knowledge of Blockchain and Cardano. The CoreTeam team is in charge of planning weekly meetings to discuss activities and programs that will be discussed in meetings every two weeks. The solution is done on the group's Youtube channel, Twitter, Discord, Telegram. The solution has the right way to solve the problem, creating a strong community development for Cardano. Risks have occurred in F8 when there is not enough funding to maintain, difficulty in finding enthusiastic members who are competent and willing to cooperate. The solution for the project to continue to implement is to propose more funding is in line with the project in progress.

This proposal has not been funded at Fund 8 so it continues to be re-submitted at Fund 9. The solution proposed by the authors is, to maintain and develop Catalyst Africa Town Hall (CATH) \u2013 a project established in March, 2022, supporting the African community to participate in Cardano and Catalyst. At Fund 8, CATH has just been established. Therefore, when continuing to submit at Fund 9, the proposed content has changed, aiming to maintain and develop the CATH community to transfer knowledge in different languages. As for how it works, CATH currently holds meetings every two weeks, in four languages: English, Arabic, Swahili and French. The aim is, to educate the community about Cardano and encourage cooperation to solve the challenges of the continent using Blockchain technology. The proposed budget at Fund 9 increased 242% to $23800 (compared to $9,800 at Fund 8). It should also be added, CATH is a project to support and connect the Catalyst African community on Telegram, Discord...  After 3 months CATH was established, the group now has 124 members on Telegram, 30 members join the Discord server. CATH meetings are currently attracting 20 participants. Personally, I think this is a good initiative that can expand Cardano and Catalyst's presence in the Africa region. However, as someone who has spent a lot of time learning about the difficulty of blockchain access in Africa, I think there are a few risks the group hasn't really addressed. It is the cost of internet in Africa is very expensive. People in the area have to spend an average of 10%, even 20% of their monthly income on internet connection (https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/22/africa/internet-affordability-africa/index .html). This barrier will prevent the masses from accessing CATH. Not to mention, the quality of internet connection in the area is often unstable. Second, the risk that the price of ADA coin during the bear market period may affect the budget to fund the group's activities. So, in order to overcome these barriers and help the Cardano African community to function effectively, I suggest that the team consider combining online meetings with traditional meet-ups, broken down by region language area. To do this, CATH needs to have a set of standards, documents for admission, training, and guidance for members. These documents need to be synchronized and consistent before being translated into many languages for different geographical and cultural areas. In addition, a 10-20% contingency budget should also be taken into account. My personal experience in organizing community activities shows that the group should consider opening a small media campaign to promote CATH to increase its effectiveness in reaching potential members. Therefore, I rate 4 points on the impact of the proposal, deducting -1 point due to some risks that have not been mentioned.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Regarding the feasibility of the solution, I think that the project is completely capable of successful implementation. In fact, CATH has been established and put into operation since March 2022. Currently, the number of members of CATH in Telegram that I observe is more than 100 people. In addition to the biweekly online events that the team offers, I need the authors to further explain how they will empower the community to rapidly grow new members. In addition, I did not find in this proposal the list of training topics, tutorials on Cardano and Catalyst that the team prepared. For example, how to become a PA/proposers, how to write a proposal in Catalyst\u2026 Project budget at Fund 9 increased nearly 2.5 times. Previously, the group only applied for funding for 3 categories of expenses: costs for planning meetings for CATH, document translation costs and general administrative costs. At Fund 9, the new cost goes to 50.4% of community management ($12000). In addition, new cost items were added such as: marketing and social networks, community events, internet subsidies for the community... This shows that, the team focused more budget on community managers and community marketing plans. However, I noticed that the team was missing a detailed explanation of the unit price * quantity of each item budget. The community needs to understand how the money will be used specifically. Regarding the team, I appreciate that the team has gathered many individuals with Catalyst experience to participate in CATH. However, the link to each member's profile is incomplete. 5/8 members of the team have no links to social media profiles. Therefore, it will be difficult for the community to fully verify the capacity and experience profile of each person in the group.

For example, the number of people participating in CATH each month/quarter is expected to be 30/90 people. Similarly, what is the minimum number of proposals submitted by CATH members to Fund 10?

The proposal, of course, tackles the challenge posed by doing good for Africa and good for Cardano. The issue that needs to be addressed very clearly is support for all interested in Cardano and Catalyst through a center called Catalyst Africa Town Hall (CATH). This is a common model in other continents such as Asia (Eastern Town Hall) and it has been very helpful to the community. Therefore, I do not doubt that it increases the value of the Cardano ecosystem. The impact is huge and it is entirely possible to continue to scale to address future challenges. It's welcome to the team that you've decided to do this in a place that is in dire need of investment and development. Cardano, Catalyst is like a mission to make it happen.

However, I also suggest that the team can add some necessary documents for readers to refer to, which is also a way to increase the feasibility of the proposal. Document implementation is vital to a high-impact and non-novel proposal on Catalyst. The budget is broken down into very reasonable items. I understand that in doing this, the team consulted and filtered the good things from previous similar proposals to create the CATH proposal. Therefore, the plan and how to implement it are also clear. I also appreciate the implementation resources, especially the human resources, where qualified professional members are gathered to write and support this proposal. However, I still have a comment on the technical aspect, can the team be more specific about this suggestion when applied in practice, what is your use of technology? You can be very specific to increase feasibility for the community. I know you have mentioned the risk that maintaining the quality of all the jobs in the CATH requires can get quality from that it requires the recruitment of input personnel to be filtered, and conducted strictly. tight. After recruiting, you will take measures to retain quality human resources. I would like to give my opinion on keeping the members attached for a long time.

I only have one small question, can the team explain why this project has a duration of about 3 months (starting from June 1 to August 31, 2022)? So, after 3 months, you continue to submit funding proposals? Is this the same as the other Town Hall implementation deadlines? I have always wished, that great ideas like this could be held regularly and last year after year without interruption. Organizing for 3 months may have an element of risk of interruption, choosing a program that is very beneficial to the African community and the Cardano ecosystem. Can the team think more about this, and maybe find a way to fix it?", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2552", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4139, "q0": "It surely requires a strong and diverse community to allow the wide-scale of Cardano in the African region. One major problem I have noticed with most human beings is that if you show them the way and refuse to guide them through it, they easily go astray and eventually fall off the hook. This is a critical challenge that affects the impact of whatever initiative started by a community just like the Cardano community. It can be said on record that a lot of people who joined the Cardano train some time back, probably from the African region, fell off due to the language barrier. This has indeed affected the Cardano impact indirectly. I see the solution to problems like what I have described above in this proposal. I love the fact that the CATH is not focused only on English but rather has diversity and a variety of languages like Swahili, Arabic, etc for participants to choose from and also seeks to be around through its community managers to further guide those who are shown the way until they're well acquainted with the ecosystem. At least, I can tell from this initiative that a certain percentage of people who join the train and fall off eventually are going to be sustained by this project. Really good initiative it is.\n\nFrom the proposal, it can be confirmed that the proposer has articulated exactly how it is going to add value to the community. This is evident in the proposal description where they seek to host biweekly town halls to engage folks who are interested in the development of the African region with regard to the Cardano community. I have attended this town hall before and I can attest to the fact that it really adds value to the Cardano ecosystem. It's such a welcoming community with great guidelines.\n\nThe metrics of this proposal align with most of the KPIs allocated in the challenge set. Measuring the number of attendees to the town halls of course would help the challenge to realize its return on intention. As the proposer clearly articulates that it will rely on Catalyst for some time till the project become self-sustaining, it shows how fair the proposer is to the community. With this being said, we can surely expect a proposal like this in subsequent funds to come from the proposing team. However, it would have been awesome if the team could provide details of what their self-sustaining plan is. Through exposure, they could have gotten ideas from the community as to whether it would be feasible or not.\n\nI strongly agree with the proposals' impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "For the team needed for a successful implementation of the project, the proposer has down well to identify team members needed. However, I am unable to confirm for all the team members whether or not they have the requisite experience.

This makes it hard for me to believe the described team on the proposal as one that can deliver successfully.\n\nA budget of 23,800 USD being requested by this proposal looks feasible with respect to its breakdown. The proposer has done well to provide us with details on exactly how the funds are going to be spent and on what purpose it is scheduled to serve. \n\nFrom June 1st to August 31st, the team has done well to inform the community on how they plan to go about project implementation. The proposing team has indicated that they plan to host the town hall on a bi-weekly basis and prior to that, the organizing team would be meeting to discuss activities that would aid the successful implementation of the project. I think the team would have done a great job by providing details on what activities they plan to deliberate on in their meetings prior to the town hall. This would give the community a sense of what to expect in every town hall and further encourage participation.\n\nThe risk of losing contributors with regard to lack of incentives is indeed a risk that could go a long way to affect the project.

It is mentioned that Telegram and Discord channels have been created since the inception of the project but unfortunately links to these channels were not provided and thus making it hard for a community member who has no access to these platforms to track the project.
