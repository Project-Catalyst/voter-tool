Started with impact analysis: the project works directly with what the challenge seeks. Here, we are looking to finance projects that benefit both the African continent, its inhabitants and so on, as well as Cardano; ie - ideas that can be useful, generating opportunities and income for the locals but that are also advantageous for our blockchain, fostering the growth of our community, contributing to Cardano being widely adopted in Africa and being better recognized and valued. That will certainly be worked on here. The problem raised is that, generally, people will not go out of their comfort zones to learn about a new technology, which is something as complex and different as blockchain. Therefore, the solution would be precisely to create a more attractive way for them to learn about Cardano and get involved with the technologies relevant to our ecosystem. This would be done by earning small rewards (in Ada, from what I understand), as users would read content and answer some questionnaires involving the various contents of the blockchain universe. Several positive points are observed here: first, the project is inspired by something that already exists (an application called coinbase), which performs the same function; probably the proponents observed how the proposal worked and will replicate it, directing knowledge to Cardano, which will certainly bring solid benefits to our blockchain. Another positive point is that the content would be produced in the Swahili language, which is certainly a very influential and strategic language for us to invest in. I say this because, in addition to the arguments provided by the proponents - that the language is spoken in 12 African countries and by more than 200 million people - I have already seen several proposals that seek to translate content in English into Swahili, that is, it is really a very relevant language for our project to invest in Africa. Another positive point is that the proponents are already financed, that is, they already have successful proposals in other funds (I remember having evaluated something of them before); but for those new reviewers and readers, they have attached the LidoNation website, where they already have a lot of content regarding Cardano available in English, Spanish and Swahili. They explain well what kind of content you can already find there (\"how to open a Cardano wallet, reviews and overviews of different types of wallets, how to buy ADA, articles on many facets of Project Catalyst and how to participate, news about Cardano and etc. \"); so we have a good understanding of the type of work they have been doing so far. And not enough, they attach a step by step of what would be done here (I consider this project as an extension of successful initiatives they have had before). In the \u201chow do we do this\u201d section, it is detailed what various steps would be followed for the ultimate goal to be achieved (that more Swahili speakers understand Cardano and get involved with our blockchain). In other words, the idea is very good, it is very well explained and it has everything to work out and reach the objectives of the challenge, as new wallets will be created (so that users can receive their rewards), new people will be learning about Cardano and maybe become active members of the community, in general, I found it to be a smart and accurate strategy on how to popularize our blockchain on the continent.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal script is entirely adequate; I say this because we know what would happen with a degree of detail rarely observed in the proposals. All the activities that will be developed are minimally explained, so that our understanding of the whole is very solid, we can visualize the development process with very solid accuracy. This can be noticed already from the introductory excerpt: \u201cGetting Started -> Create multiple choice quiz questions for 50 Swahili articles on LidoNataion. After quiz questions are created for existing articles, they will be created for each new article that is published (We publish 1-2x/week. Quizzes will be first created in English before Swahili translation. The lead resource for Quiz writing is writer and educator Stephanie King. For example on the build part, we know what would be built and how (supporting content such as program description and overviews to be translated into Swahili) and we also know who would be primarily responsible for that part of the proposal (Stephanie King King). Another very well explained part, to argue what I'm saying, is testing and launching - a long paragraph is dedicated to explaining how these actions would be done. Regarding temporality, although the level of specificity is not as high as the detail of the actions, it is enough for us to have a good understanding of when these actions would be done (speaking of the examples cited - the construction would be completed at the end of the month s 3 while testing and launch are scheduled to be done by month 4). Therefore, we can move on to the next topic of analysis, which would be cost sharing. The amount requested is approximately $37,000. The value is not low, but in my view it makes sense with the breadth of the project, and without a doubt it is very well argued. The total is divided into some parts and each one is explained individually, for example, we know that the translation of the quiz would cost 1000 dollars, and that \u201cthis amount pays for 100 questionnaires translated into Swahili plus 7,000 \"words\" - worth content translation (i.e. how-to documents, landing pages, etc.) at a rate of ~$0.05/per word\u201d. Likewise, the other parts of the funding are also well argued. Finally, speaking of the team, trust is automatically passed on to the team, since they already have other previously funded proposals; LidoNation already has a lot of content released, so it is possible to verify in practice what has already been done and the quality of the work (and the involvement) of this team. However, they also present themselves properly - we know the name of each team member, their roles in the project and professional area and a little of what they have done so far within our community, in addition to their linkedin profiles. So, in my view, the proposal is totally viable, because a lot of security is passed on to the team, the script is carefully broken down, so that we have a very detailed knowledge of what will be done and how, and the budget division is also argued with a lot of wealth of details.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "A lot of information is attached regarding the auditability of progress, and as with the other topics in the proposal, each is explained in detail. We know that partial results can be measured through the creation of multiple choice tests, we know how many tests to create (75) and also what topics would be covered (questions about Cardano, Catalyst and blockchain in general). We know when they have to be filled in and English and Swahili. Other suggested metrics are the number of wallets linked to the site, number of tests performed and NFTs granted granted. My only suggestion for this part of the proposal would be for the proponents to update us on each of the tasks mentioned in the roadmap part, in addition to the partial results presented here. As we have a very comprehensive wealth of details, it would not be difficult for the community to monitor whether activities are being carried out the way they were planned. My only question here would be, really, how could we be aware of this context - what would be our way of contacting the team? I don't think it's appropriate for updates to be posted directly on the LidoNation website, so I suggest they prepare monthly reports to be sent out at the end of each month to our community members (via discord, for example). In terms of success, the goal is for Swahili-speakers to understand decentralization and blockchain well, according to the proponents. They detail, once again quite richly, how this scenario could be better understood, in snippets such as: that they will understand why Cardano is an especially exciting blockchain project, important Cardano news, projects and partnerships; will have practiced basic blockchain interactions, including opening a wallet, connecting to a blockchain service, and receiving funds and NFTs; they will also understand the basics of DeFi, DApps, DAOs and DEXes and will have demonstrated their knowledge by passing tests, etc. Again, one more suggestion I would like to make would be in relation to the communicative bridge between the members of this team and the rest of our community. How can we be sure that the target audience would have enjoyed all these benefits? It would be important for the team to carry out a field research, post project, to understand how the participants of these questionnaires would be relating to all the concepts mentioned here; It is equally important that this information be made known to all members of the community (a good idea would be to present the final report/research somewhere after town hall). So, I think we have a lot of material to work on to audit the proposal, and we just need to establish a bridge between the project team and the rest of the Cardano community.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 8, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 13883, "q0": "This proposal clearly fits within the Grow Africa, Grow Cardano challenge in particular onboarding more users onto Cardano, providing education and offering local impact.\nThe proposers, creators of Lido Nation, have a website and community already in place with English, Spanish and Swahili resources to learn about Cardano and Catalyst. The next steps they are requesting funding for are to create more resources about opening wallets, and specifically learn to earn resources. They propose educational content supported with quiz taking to earn ADA similar to an existing popular feature from Coinbase. Through working in the education and technological integration sector for over 18 years I have experience with gamification and have seen many successful projects deliver educational goals. Although the project mentions possible rewards will be capped at $25, that is significant enough to motivate users to complete the task. I spent 4 years living in Tanzania (a Swahili speaking country like Kenya), and traveled throughout south east Africa. That small amount of money, plus the chance to learn and develop a new skill set will be very valuable and desirable to many people within the community.\nThe impact also reaches the blockchain lab in Kenya (created in fund 7) they plan to work with as Swahili translators, beta testers and local marketing leads. Having this local, on the ground support and integration allows for the impact to be felt directly within the community.\nThe proposers give clear detail as to the direct impact on the Cardano community, and the metrics that will be gathered to document the success in regards to the challenge. The proposal also highlights the ability to upscale it once the initial cohorts of learners engage in and give feedback to the learning system and quizzes. Once the initial success is achieved, the project has a clear future, but ongoing funding may be required, whether through Cardano or other means.\nThe potential impact of this proposal for the Grow Africa, Grow Cardano proposal is considerable, through the people in the African continent being able to learn about Cardano in their native language, for those who speak Swahili. I give this proposal 5 stars for impact.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind this proposal have provided a fantastic level of detail to assess the timeline, budget, staffing and many other implications. \nThe timeline for the proposal roll out is 7 months. Each stage is detailed with specific outcomes, and hurdles to overcome within that month. The timeline is realistic and I\u2019m confident they\u2019ve added enough safeguards and testing before the planned global roll out in month 5. \nThe staffing and support team behind the proposal are three main people, plus the local support of a blockchain lab in Kenya. The team have proven success with their website already being fully operational in multiple languages. Their ability to develop new content is highly likely, the only issue will be the blockchain labs ability to correlate the new content (quiz feature) and the ADA wallet payment method in the given time. The staff provide detailed information about themselves, their experience and motivations for the project to succeed.\nAs the proposers note, roughly 40% of the $38,200 requested of this proposal is going towards ADA rewards for the users taking their planned learn-to-earn quizzes. Although it is a rather large sum of money, it\u2019s clear to see that they have calculated these costs precisely and have a sliding scale understandability from how many \u2018super users\u2019 complete everything to get the maximum $25 payment to casual users earning a few dollars here and there. This being said, the real impact of the program is Cardano ADA adoption and increasing the number of people holding wallets. This incentive is likely to offer success within this aspect of the challenge.\nThe other financial information provided clearly outlines costs along the way for salaries, the contracted work for the blockchain lab and the NFT minting costs. It appears feasible, I would suggest that the budget had an additional component for contingencies, having lived in Africa for 4 years, there is the likelihood of difficult situations, governmental, electricity/internet, and staffing related that may severely hamper the project without this financial insulation. However, it appears the team has other projects in place, so hopefully they have the liquidity to overcome any minor hurdles.\nOverall, I rate this proposal 5 stars for feasibility. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability information outlined in the proposal clearly indicates how and when the team plans to document their measures of success.\nBeginning with the number of quizzes created, early on in the project, the community on the Swahili-language side of the program website will be able to see these implemented. They state that eventually these quizzes will be populated to the English side of the program as well.\nA clearly auditable aspect will be the number of wallets linked to the site. The proposers plan to document each month how many new users have joined and how many wallets have been connected. A thought, possibly a minor concern, is how to ensure these new users are Swahili-speaking Africans, what\u2019s to stop a \u2018bad actor\u2019 somewhere else translating the website themselves and completing the quiz? Without collecting overly personal information it will be important for auditability to ensure the true identity of the new users as the target audience.\nThe last key auditability factor will be the rewards given in the form of ADA and NTFs once the ADA threshold has been met. The team has explained clearly how the budget breakdown will occur for these items, and that they will continue to award the prizes as long as the budget remains.\nThe proposers go on in detail to describe micro level success attributes and public financial documentation that both lend a great deal of confidence about the proposals potential success. The proposers should be commended for the dedicated time and effort they put into such a thoughtful proposal.\nI rate this proposal 5 stars for auditability.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3840", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 449, "q0": "LIDO Nation has approached onboarding in a welcomed innovative way which is through the use of gamification of their translated articles. Their gamification system attempts to mimic that of Coinbase, where contributions are given a range from $1 to $5. It is capped though to $1 dollar per wallet per day. On paper this should be interesting, as the proposer has mentioned but through my personal experience, these efforts are more of complementary one and does not replace the effectiveness of free direct education. An approach that is being currently being used by many of this proposers peers.\n\nIt seems LIDO Nation seeks to establish this system to be a primary system of education on blockchain. In my experience no matter what the incentive is, if the topic itself is complicated and not engaging enough, it will face challenges in gaining traction. Let us take the efforts of Catalyst School themselves as an example, for instance Proposal Assessor. Even though the compensation are quite high for even advanced economies the growth of PA's are not as substantial as it was in the beginning of it's introduction.\n\nSeeing how LIDO Nations seeks to cap it to $1 per waller per day, this level of incentive has the potential to become wasteful no matter how engaging the content is. $1 per day is $30 per month. Even if we were to increase the incentives, there will always be stagnation of interest by the reader. An equally extensive effort would be needed in expanding the readers pool.\n\nDespite all that, it would be interesting to see how this effort pans out in Africa. Perhaps the results would be different, if so it would prove to be invaluable data as a strategy of deployment in various similar regions.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Although LIDO Nation does indeed have experience in creating bespoke solutions that have gradually become a new golden standard of proposal transparency and display, this would be their first attempt in creating such a solution. Though as was their previous effort to display proposal in a more friendly UI/UX, that too was their first experience. And the delivered with flying colors.\n\nThe plan they seek to execute is also surprisingly in detailed. What is impressive is that they also anticipated an important challenge that I touched briefly in the first part of my assessment which is ; low traction in which they addressed in a way that uses their local insight of the Swahili speaking community. They mentioned that these communities are currently in a depressed economic situation, which although $1 might seem small, it goes a long way in the Swahili speaking community.\n\nAnother preemptive effort is anticipating gaming the system, which again they go very deep in providing 3 (three) layers of anticipation with one going as far as the potential of utilizing physical proof-of-life if needed. This attention to detail is echoed throughout their proposal which instills confidence that their efforts and plans will hopefully go as intended.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As this is their first endeavour, having clear targets, numeric targets is essential for the Cardano community to have a general understanding where all the funds go. And indeed they provide numerous metrics, one though does cause for concern which is their plan to use NFT as an incentive.\n\nNFT currently is at a phase where it's existence is being questioned. We can see this from the attacks on Spacebudz. People are asking what is the underlying value of NFT.  Perhaps if the mechanics of their NFT were to be tweaked in a way that it can be accumulated which then can be exchanged for perhaps with some form of merchandise. This can be done by collaborating with NFT Link. Therefore it does not become just a $1,500 gimmick but actually educates that NFT is more than a *.jpeg.\n\nOther than that, they have covered a litany things, with the most important is their main delivery item, which is the Coinbase inspired gamification. The mechanics are clear, how they mitigate gaming is also clear, the educational effects of this gamification is also clear.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2088", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 4, "ng": 9, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3385, "q0": "Incentives and rewards always attract people to fulfil a task, even if it may appear to be small.

The creative idea to spread knowledge about Cardano and blockchain in general is to create an engaging educational content that uses gamification to make learning more appealing. This strategy has been proven to work in different scenarios and it is even more likely in this case due to the use of monetary reward in the form of ADA distribution as prize for the quizzes. The goals of the proposal clearly align with the challenge as they aim to grow the number of African-based users onboarded onto Cardano, increase awareness about Cardano in general and cause a local impact. Unfortunately, I could not find suggestions regarding scalability and future sustainability in the proposal. But I would add as next steps at the end of the project a search for a way to maintain the project as a going concern. For example, with the success of the proposal the team could quantify their results through the KPIs proposed and look for partners or sponsors that could fund the plan in exchange for marketing or access to potential clients.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has exhibited compelling skills and experiences and they have provided LinkedIn pages for Stephanie, Darlington, Sallyanne and even for Lido nation to back it up which is enriching. In the budget section they clearly explained which type and how many members will be necessary to implement this project (they range from the translator to the project manager). The amounts requested are reasonable and their destination is very clear. It is worth noting that roughly 40% of the funds will be directed to future users in the form of rewards. The timetable they provided is pretty achievable with the resources they will have. It is good to see they left enough time for testing and for the beta phase. All in all, the plan is well written, articulate and sensible. The team is transparent when it comes to not only what they want to do but also on how they intend to do it. For example, they described in detail how the mechanism of rewards will work but they are aware it may need to be adapted depending on new information they gather or how the software ends up being developed. Finally, their assessment of the risks is conspicuous. Not only they have precisely identified risks such as turnover and lack of interest but they have also offered mitigating actions to prevent them.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap provided in this proposal has pertinent and consistent milestones. It is very complete; it goes from the first steps as creating the quiz questions and starting the development on the website up until the rollout and the exhaustion of the prizes that will be rewarded. Also, for every step of the way there is a time horizon estimated which sounded reasonable and achievable. The KPIs chosen by the team are well-thought and translate well what success means. For example, the number of quizzes taken and new wallets linked to the site measure how engagement is flourishing in their website and tracks how much knowledge is being spread by the initiative. The solution found is effective and has a cascading effect because once someone is lured to the website and sees first hand it is both entertaining and rewarding chances are they will tell their friends about it.

This directly adds value to the Cardano ecosystem. If successful, this proposal could scale up in the future and solve a similar problem. I love how you make engaging content in the familiar language (Swahili) of the people of Kenya. It is a way of encouraging learning that contributes to improving the community's knowledge, understanding, and understanding of Cardano. This is very important for underdeveloped African countries. It is proposed that Swahili speakers have an understanding and access to the Cardano ecosystem, a cutting-edge blockchain of its kind.

Can the team make that clear? I am satisfied with the presentation of the budget, the budget has been broken down into categories, reasonable with the goal. In the section Mint & Send NFTs: $3000, I have a question for you, can you elaborate on what the team will do if the price of ADA goes above 1 USD and you won't have enough 1,500 NFTs? The reason I ask the question is that I want everything to be clear when implementing the proposal because it is directly related to feasibility. The team has a plan and a good way to execute it. Regarding required resources, I want to emphasize human resources i.e. team members. With that said, we need at least one member who knows very well about information technology and what is involved in the Cardano ecosystem. From there, explain more about the technical aspects for the community to know more clearly. That is my contribution to the team's human resources.

Less than 10% of the total challenge budget. In my opinion, the required budget is appropriate for the complexity of the work the proposal needs to do. The team also presented a very detailed budget sheet. We know each budget is delivered hourly, weekly, and monthly for each person, per job. Specifically, $1,000 for 1 artist is 3 NFT, 2500 USD for 75 quizzes and 7,000 words, translation words, etc. Of which the positive thing is that more than 40% of the budget goes straight to my wallet. artist. new Cardano users, in the form of puzzle rewards and NFT badges.

There have been previously funded translation and writing proposals, but this is not a follow-up proposal, but a completely new one. The proposal has a detailed roadmap, the budget is analyzed reasonably and transparently, creating favorable conditions for monitoring project progress. A team of skilled and experienced members will contribute effort and time to complete the task according to the set plan.

We have many ways to check that, I believe, complete and satisfactory information has been established. We know what will be done and how it will be done to achieve the end result that is the desired success in the proposal. Regarding the final product, which is what is expected of this project, there are product indexes listed.

So the team that came up with the solution is to encourage Swahili-speaking people to learn, open wallets, and earn ADA + NFT by participating in educational content and answering quizzes. This project fits the challenge posed by \"increasing the number of new users in Africa participating in Cardano, targeting education directly\". Based on the facilitation available on the website \"LidoNation.com\", they add a Swahili multiple-choice question to each article. Encourage anyone who visits Cardano's informational site to answer 25 quizzes that will be rewarded with ADA and will be sent an NFT. This method will help more people in Swahili-speaking Africa to open Cardano wallets. The project effectively addresses the challenge.

February & March: completed development work to assist users to log in to the site, take quizzes in Swahili, and receive ADA & NFT Rewards. April: Testing and demos. For the rest of the months, they release globally. I find it a very realistic timetable to get the job done. Budgets are clearly outlined, detailed, and broken down into definable items. The total required team budget is $38,200, of which $12500 is the cost for the team to award ADA rewards to new Cardano users. I find the budget to be divided like that to be reasonable and increase the feasibility of the project, stimulating the user's participation in the website to learn knowledge.

This proposal hits the core of it. Developing gamification in dapps for the learning of Cardano blockchain can be a practical and concrete project that will rapidly increase the amount of Cardano wallets. A monetary-reward by learning can be a really attractive way of drawing in a wide range of newcomers. Also, giving people the chance to have monetary reward for their learning will help Cardano Catalyst fight against the reluctance the wide audience may feel towards the blockchain universe. It might be interesting to find a way to engage dapp players into the Cardano Catalyst Community because it may be a risk to lose the opportunity of engaging potential active members if gamification only focuses on solving quizzes.

Based on my analysis of the script, I see a comprehensive approach to provide education on the blockchain technology in a way that would attract more young African people. Considering the unemployment challenge in africa, I am convinced that this incentivized learning platform would drive the growth of the Cardano in Africa especially among the young population. This is because incentivized learning system stimulate students to pursue more successes. Therefore, I think this initiative has the potential to scale up the growth of Cardano in Africa in several ways. Firstly, this initiative has being designed to be used in several communities with different language background. By estimate, close to 14 Africans speak Swahili, and with the improvised environment in africa, this could serve as an escape root from poverty. Therefor, this platform could serve as the springboard that would advance awareness creation of Cardano among young African population. This project could help address the challenge of adoption in Africa. In several ways, this project opens the door of value addition to the Cardano community \u2014from awareness creation to on-boarding, to increase in developers and to adoption.
