Allied to this, we have that the project focuses on a place on the African continent, so it is possible to say that the proposal was correctly aligned with the objectives of the challenge. Furthermore, the success of this endeavor would certainly increase the visibility of the Cardano ecosystem. We are just in doubt if the budget being requested is enough to build what is planned, as we will see below.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As mentioned before, we were in doubt if the budget being requested would be enough to build such a wide tool. And when we look at the detailing of the budget, we see that the sum of all expenses is actually exceeding that amount initially being requested. Furthermore, taking into account the complexity that the project will involve, it seems that the actions described in the timeline are not detailed enough, so unfortunately we can't have much confidence in their feasibility. For a project with these proportions, it would be nice to include additional illustrative materials to better understand the distribution of tasks. As for the team behind the proposal, we see that the professionals have experience in areas that are interesting for the project, such as software development. However, as we are talking about the real estate market, it would be interesting to have people with legal knowledge on the team.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Regarding the perception of success of the proposal, we have that the desired objectives are consistent with the ideas that were developed. However, we noticed that few ways were indicated for us to follow the progress of the project.

In this aspect, the use of some development methodology such as Agile could have been indicated, as well as the possible duration of sprints.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2549, "q0": "The project would be a great value-added to the ecosystem if implemented correctly which is quite a complex task. The project seems to be a bit outside of the scope of the challenge since it doesn't really address an Africa-specific issue or intend to be widely used in Africa. Instead, the project seems to be described as a general solution for the tokenization of real estate. This brings us to the impact part which would be a big global impact and a paradigm shift if implemented correctly. Furthermore, such projects can definitely scale in a limitless manner due to the nature of the market it targets.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Although the team seems to be a pretty able one with a wide-ranging expertise in the IT and computer science industry. It is still a small team to tackle such a big endeavor. Furthermore, the legal aspect of the matter and the lack of legal framework makes it even harder to make the tokenization of real estate happen currently. From the team's timeline, it is hard to judge what will be done when since there is some plan to onboard individuals but no design of MVP is provided for the product which is odd.

However, it is my perception that successful implementation of this kind of transformation in the local real estate market will require a strong buy-in from local government/regulators in order to understand, recognize, and provide enforceability for tokenized assets within its borders.\n\nThe proposal does briefly mention laws regarding transaction costs in the real estate market, but not enough information is provide to indicate that the proposer has a strong grasp of the resources required to overcome the legal barriers that they will surely face in this kind of total transformation of the real estate market.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The author's answer to the auditability question about how they will measure and track progress is a restatement of the conceptual impact of tokenization on the real estate investment market - perhaps a misunderstanding of what was asked of them in that section.

The team is also realistic in listing down the main risks of delivering the project successfully ie. internationally aligned regulatory framework and the interpretation of key terms (custody and supervision) etc. Also the current players in the market are also reluctant to embrace the solution not to mention the security and trust issues.

From their detailed timeline, they intend to map the real estate in the city of Goma, create the issue certificates and then generate the tokens along with validation tools. The project is highly feasible as it centers on the tokenization part of the business. However, the detailed budget breakdown doesn't list the number of working hours and the rate per hour. The real estate catalog will cost up to $60,000 but has no breakdown how this figure comes from. The proposal will improve significantly if the budget breakdown is more straightforward. For the tools and equipment part, the team should specify why they need 10 tablets for real estate registration. Also they haven't mentioned any team members with prior background in property sales, management or any capacity related to property. This casts some doubt if they are experienced enough to tackle the said mission. However, feasibility score just reflects their ability to complete project technically as per milestones and expect them to adapt/troubleshoot any issues that occur during their deliverables.

Cardano-based certified trading chain (CTC) certification system for tokenization of real estate in the DRC, technical method & documentation and the onboarding users through DApp. They could explain more for the validation and resale of DIDs as DID is mentioned first time in the auditability section. The project is auditable by checking if these mentioned checklists as project success are being present. The roadmap and milestones are sufficient to evaluate the success of project between September - March.

However, the advantage of the tokenization of real estate is a huge opportunity for small investors to break down investment barriers and open up new markets. And it's remarkable if it runs on Cardano platforms. Typically, we have to trust the third party about our rights over our properties. But if real estate is tokenized, time-consuming and inefficient processes through intermediaries become overdated, as blockchain is based on the peer-to-peer principle. With it in mind, the trust happens between two contractual partners and guarantees a secure process thanks to blockchain technology. I am so excited and expect this project.

The author's own speech demonstrates this, but for the proposal to be more in line with the challenge and, consequently, for us to see more value delivery to the community, it would be recommended to see a proposal designed to encourage adoption, not only in the implementation of the technology.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The author clearly indicated who will be the members involved in the proposal, as well as references about their experiences.
