The idea here is to create a peer-to-peer mobile wallet, called JUS, which works as follows: an Atala Prism ID structure is made, new users are verified and their biometrics are linked to a DID so that they can start doing exchange and integration transactions. They build, according to the proponents, a system of credit history and scores. It is important that the processes are done with an intermediary (bounty hunter) so that the transactions are complete when all the steps are followed, the fiat money is pegged to a stable currency and the transaction can proceed safely. This entire process is summarized by the proponents in the excerpt \u201cin the scenario where the bounty hunter confirms that he has successfully received the fiat payment, the stablecoin is released to a VC minting smart contract that sends the new user\u2019s biometric data to a service external third-party biometric authentication. It is also very relevant, as the proponents already have a well-defined target market, Sub-Saharan Africa, where the population (as far as it is understood) suffers from high fees charged on financial transactions, and in addition, unfortunately, it is a portion of the population that suffers with an economy that does not allow them to have security and quality of life financially speaking, that is, many people there experience economic problems. In this sense, it is essential that tools and solutions can be created and managed with the objective of filling these needs and truly benefiting your target audience. Undoubtedly, this project would also bring real benefits to Cardano, as it would promote the adoption of our technologies by a large portion of the population, which is marginalized in financial terms. It is difficult for people who do not have stability to bet on Ada, for example, so it is super valid and necessary that we think of ways to bring Cardano to them without this risky investment profile. On the contrary, proposing solutions to real difficulties they face, such as the issue of lack of access to bank accounts and the lack of infrastructure to convert crypto assets into fiat currency, as the proponents cite. That said, I believe this proposal perfectly meets the requirements of the challenge of developing projects that benefit both Africa and Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The information provided in this topic is generally superficial. But let's go by parts. Starting with the development of the project, phases are not established. We don't have an organized timeline that allows us to understand when an activity ends and another begins, or which ones would happen in parallel. We are told what would need to be done and the total time for each activity itself, but we lack a better idea of \u200b\u200bhow this would be organized in relation to the months of the year, who would do each activity, what the work routine of the professionals involved would be like. In other words, we do know what would need to be done for the project to go from theory to practice, but the level of specificity is low, so I don't fear such a solid understanding of the whole. I would like to suggest that, first, the temporal division be done in a more chronological way, with the establishment of phases. Afterwards, each of these activities was better explained. For example, about providing the staking contract for the JUS token + Javascript SDK, how would it be done in process? What small actions would make up these activities, and how would the professionals involved deal with them? Talking now about the budget division, an amount of 50k dollars is requested, and during the financing detail we see that different parts cost different amounts, most of them above 50k, which confuses the reader. The values \u200b\u200bare quite high, for example, 100k is requested for 10 weeks of work in relation to the development of the order book exchange contract + JavaScript SDK; what a result and 10k per week. How many hours would this professional dedicate to the project, so that we can understand if the requested amount is, in fact, fair? So, in general, I found the explanation of the budget a little lacking in detail, I believe that more information had to be passed on so that we can have an understanding of the asking price being, in fact, fair. Finally, speaking of the team, information about the members is not provided individually. All we know is what their names and roles are within the project, but more detail would be needed for us to have peace of mind about this team's ability to successfully execute the project. For example, Siddi Barrack: Co-founder. Besides being the co-founder of the project, what is his professional background? What jobs have they done previously? What is your experience with Cardano? Likewise, such information should have been provided to the other team members as well. I would like more to be said about each member, because the more knowledge we have about those involved, the more confidence is conveyed about how they will carry out the project successfully and peacefully. That said, the feasibility of the project is ok, but there is still a lot to be improved, both in terms of explaining the development of the project, as well as in the financial arguments and finally in the presentation of the team.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Regarding auditability, there is a lot of information about how we could monitor the development of the project and also the success scenario. The information passed in relation to the follow-up of phases is quite scarce. It would be important for proponents to organize ways in which advances, however sensitive, would be perceived by the Cardano community. It is essential to first establish some direct communication channel with the community. It could be a youtube channel, discord and telegram channels, written monthly reports and etc. And in these channels, the proponents could inform us about what activities were developed that month, for example, what difficulties had to be overcome, and how they were mitigated, if all the professionals involved were properly committed to their tasks, if their work were respected, possible adaptations that had to be made and so on. In this way, we could follow not only the final result, but also what was behind it. Now talking about it, the success scenario, the proponents use a numerical indicator to state when success would be considered: 100k active users in the year. In fact, observing the number of people involved in the project is a safe and direct way to understand if it has reached its target audience, consequently taking Cardano's technologies to these people. But I believe that we need to go further in this study, in this research. We need to understand if, in fact, the problem that was initially addressed, at impact, was solved. Did people in Sub-Saharan Africa who had difficulty accessing bank accounts and loans get more assistance in this regard? How were these people supported, taught to use such technologies? How can we measure the direct benefits to your quality of life? Another important point, in my view, would be to understand if these people, who started to use this technology, became active members of the Cardano community, started to participate in other projects as well, as they are working within our blockchain. Both information on tracking progress needs to be made available, in relation to tasks and partial successes; as much as what it says about the success scenario. It is even possible to notice by the amount of text that is attached to the proposal (very little) how superficial the topic is, the ideal would be that some member of the team (the leader, probably) do this thorough and periodic work so that the community aware of all updates, even if the advances are sensitive.

This is very much in the sense of Cardano and suits the challenge quite well. A big bonus is that the project is supposed to be community-owned by a big part, which even more matches Cardanos spirit of decentralization. The proposal seems by principle scalable.

Creating a marketplace with a biometric wallet could ensure safety, which is one of Cardano's core values. Furthermore, the development of this product coincides with the increasing use of mobile phones, while the African banking system remains underutilized by the general public. The creation of this product would bring more African users to Cardano, which is one of the campaign's primary objectives. Another goal of JUS is to provide education about cryptocurrency-related terms such as stablecoin and blochain, as well as to provide educational infrastructure, which is also a goal of Cardano's The Grow Africa setting. The scalability is not described in detail, but in the proposal, they refer to statistics recognizing exponential growth in P2P transactions in Sub-Saharan Africa, and I can extrapolate from this that the scalability is the project is successfully executed.

If the team could elaborate further on what they think (on a high level) to scale the product across multiple African countries (for example, technical requirements, legal requirements, partnership requirements), it would be very helpful for me to assess the long-term impact of the project.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "While the proposer did very well on the impact criteria, I have yet to see the same caliber for feasibility criteria. First, the budget requested is inconsistent in different parts of the proposal: at the beginning, they requested $250,000, then at the MVP roadmap, it was $500k, and further down the proposal, it was $50,000. Lacking a well-presented roadmap adds to the confusion. The MVP development plan roadmap is very high-level for the large budget ($500,000) requested. I would recommend the team to spend more effort breaking the MVP into details such as system design, acceptance criteria, user stories, wireframe, mock, etc,. for the community members to assess the feasibility of the progress. I understand that this is a large scope project, at this initial stage, the team should probably ask for a smaller budget to build a whitepaper and prototype before asking for a big one without many supporting documents (there is a website but with no content). In addition, the risk section should be further considered. Currently, the risk section only has one sentence, which is overly simplified for a project of high budget and large scope. Some other risks you should consider are legal complexity (many African countries have unclear regulatory frameworks for crypto), dispute mechanism beyond community mediator (especially for a large amount of money), partnership challenges (mobile payment app partners, 3rd party KYC partners) and address those risks accordingly.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "[This proposal is a duplicate of the other proposal by the same team https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414100, I hence copy my assessment for the other proposal here] The project is not highly auditable, mostly because it is not clear which phase of the project this particular proposal is addressing.

I would like to comment to further improve the suggestion that the funding may not be enough due to the slide in the price of the specific cryptocurrency here ADA. But I believe Catalyst will know and deal with this well so that all proposals no longer have to worry about ADA slippage in the market. If it has not been funded by Catalyst in Fund 9, will the team continue to implement the proposal? In addition, what other risks does the proposal entail?

JUS is a peer-to-peer, decentralized marketplace and mobile wallet that allows users to facilitate secure crypto/fiat swaps and collateral-free stablecoin lending, users only need biometrics of their face, phone number, and mobile money payment method.
