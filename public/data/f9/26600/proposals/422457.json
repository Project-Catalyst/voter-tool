Many of the fields of this proposal have not been filled properly and are simply empty if not incomplete. Finally, out of a team of 5, there are 2 Electronic technician and 1 accountant. There is no expert in digital identity, no teacher or education expert. The proposer did not give a clear account of what skill sets will be necessary to deliver on the proposal. Beyond the website, the proposer did not provide evidence (references, links, etc.) of relevant skills and experience from the team members needed to implement the proposal.\n\nThe budget presentation is nonexistent, so is the timeline, roadmap and key milestones.

However the lack of resources comment is bit distracting, since the proposal originates from an IT company with a sole purpose of raising funds for an (presumably) existing team to deliver a solution to this problem.\n\nThe overall idea is valid, however my neutral position stems from the author's inability to provide a clear description of the solution, or methodologies for overcoming risks to the project's success.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Timeline and milestones for delivery of this project are not present.

This is specially for those in the government sector. The proposer believes that there are inefficiencies and corruption in the education sector. The project named My Identity is what the proposer and his team think will help solve the problem in DRC, Corruption is one thing that does not enhance development and in the education sector where most of the teachers do not have their salaries pass through the right channel, most government authorities syphoned the money and do not pay teachers their due salaries. When this App is introduced in DRC, it will help bring transparency and help curb corruption, However the proposer thinks that this app will explain things well for teachers in the Cardano ecosystem. The value it will add to the community is that every government sector teacher can monitor their inflows regularly. Since the Cardano community is a digital world, the impact will be great because there will be a reduction in inefficiencies (corruption \nwindows, interoperability issues, uncertainty and complexity).\nHowever i disagree with the KPIs used in this proposal.

For example, they would have to see the minister of education as so on. And also the problem stated here says that teachers names are not on the list of state employees which means those teachers whose names are not on the state list do not get paid. They further went on to  propose that , there should be an education  digitalized system, which the very first issue to be solved here is to make sure every teacher\u2019s name appears on the state employees list before digitalization can set in to ensure everyone is on the same pace else, even after the digitalization, some teachers names will still not appear on the list if the measures are not put in place to first make sure every teachers name appears.
