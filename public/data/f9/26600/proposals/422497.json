This project is in agreement with the main factors of the Grow Africa, Grow Cardano challenge. This is an already ongoing project, the team now wants to onboard two new African-speaking developers to help promote their educational program to the various countries listed above. This will thus widen the scope of onboarding more Africans to the Cardano community since content (which speaks about Cardano, Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and Project Catalyst, as well as demonstrating successful projects like Minswap, Cornucopias, and Paribus) will be coming from people who speak their language and are familiar to them.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team lead provides an easy plan to follow. Though no specific timelines are given, it looks simple to implement. Since the team is already established, the introduction of two new members wouldn't be a problem.

The budget is also quite simple, it entails the remuneration packages for just the educators and the project lead. The members of the team are well listed with their various qualifications and experiences, with most already members of the catalyst community. Their emails and contact has also been provided for easy verification of their identities. \nWith the experience of the team and the success of their previous funded programs, and the simplicity of the plan, I see no barrier hindering the success of this project", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The most interesting aspect of this stage is how the team plans to report the progress of work, and also track referrals into the catalyst community through attendance of their programs. There is a plan to develop a feedback mechanism to help track new members who are referred to the catalyst community to help track their progress in the community and also develop a better communication system. I believe this is a great initiative as it will help greatly measure the success of this program and also keep taps on new members. \nThe KPIs stated are easy to understand and be used to track progress.

These proposals are very similar in their goal structure. As a result, the assessments for this set of proposals will also be similar]\n\nThe premise of this proposal is quite simple. They have a project that has been funded in past Fund regarding raising the awareness of Cardano and they want to bring the project to Africa. To do this, they need to hire 2 educators that can speak Afro Asiatic language to deliver their program to students and professors in major African country (e.g. South Africa, Egypt, etc.). I think the idea is acceptable and aligned with the challenge brief which is to grow Cardano\u2019s outreach and adoption in Africa. However, one thing that is lacking from this proposal (in my view) is the discussion regarding the challenge of recruiting these local educators that not only can speak the specified language but also has the sufficient knowledge about Cardano. This challenge was touched upon in the proposal however, there were no further explanation on how this will be overcome (i.e. the sites or method they will use to recruit these talents). Regardless, I think the proposal is still acceptable and can add value to the previous project.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project is a continuation of a funded project so the team should have the ability to carry out a similar objective, just in a different area.

As mentioned before, the proposer\u2019s plan for recruiting these educators should also be explained. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The KPIs chosen for the project are number of students participating on each presentation and number of referrals to Catalyst, which are relevant metrics to measure the project performance, as well as being quantitatively measurable.

It is about hiring native African developers to translate knowledge about Cardano into languages \u200b\u200bcompatible with the inhabitants of the countries of South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya and Morocco. This makes perfect sense with the scope of the challenge, since here we are looking to develop projects that are at the same time profitable for our ecosystem, helping Cardano to become a blockchain widely adopted on the continent; just as the projects are expected to benefit Africa. And that will certainly happen here, since, with more content in their native languages, Africans will have easier access to the technical knowledge they need to actively work in our community, whether in Catalyst projects, dApp development, etc. With more professionals converted to Cardano, surely the number of Ada and CNFTs in circulation will increase, just as more Cardano smart contracts and digital wallets will be created. In other words, it is something that has everything to do with what we are looking for, and besides all the project does not start from scratch, since the proponent has already started work with other approaches.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Using the budget is very simple and clear: the money requested will be 100% used to pay the hired professionals.

The feasibility problem is the absence of a detailed roadmap, we know what would be done based on the information provided in the impact part; but this should be broken down into phases, into detailed activities. What would be done, how, by whom, when... There is a need to temporally situate ourselves on the beginning, middle and end of each stage. The absence of this knowledge greatly compromises our understanding of the practical application of the project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of progress is great. A lot of information is given about how we would track both tasks and partial successes. The proponent claims that there will be a wallet created especially for the project, so that we can monitor whether the money is being used honestly. We know that there will be content to be shared on social media \u2013 for example CardanoMinute on tik tok; from there we can see if the promised contents were actually being created. We also have quantitative data \u2013 around 50 students are expected per presentation, feedback would be collected from those involved and so on. That is, on this part, there are no suggestions for improvements to be made. Success is defined by educating students, directing talent to Catalyst so they become active members of the community. It is not so clear how this scenario would be safely demonstrated to our community members.

Africa is a continent of diverse languages and affiliations and if Cardano would be seeded in Africa then an effort of presenting cardano to the African people in their local dialects will be highly recommended.

Seeing that the proposer intends hiring 2 additional team members to present educational program (speaks about Cardano, Cardano Foundation, Emurgo and Project Catalyst, as well as demonstrating successful projects like Minswap, Cornucopias and Paribus) and onboard talent to the ecosystem is very crucial to the mission of Cardano that I will say is a big win to Cardano ecosystem. Hence the problem identified aligns with the challenge. The proposer and his team have been winners in previous catalyst rounds and hence I believe their projects are sustainable. That aside, the proposer has indicated that \u201cDepending on the success of this pilot we may approach Catalyst for further funding to continue to reach more students and onboard them to the ecosystem\u201d; it makes it clear that if the need of further funding is required they will return to catalyst, hence the project will be financially sustainable.

This helps to create a better understanding of the budget. However, the budget is still understandable and I believe it\u2019s reasonable to achieve the desired outcome.\nThe plan is rather so brief but however understandable. I believe the proposer employed some high level of synoptic skill to the whole scope of the project. The proposal  has not provided clear timeline and key milestones for delivering the project, and I will say it\u2019s rather unfortunate because it\u2019s difficult to tell how long the project will span and the deliverables and goals at every period. \nThe proposer has provided a risk that may arise during the implementation of the project but has not provided a mitigating measure. One other risks that could have been added is timing of Cardano education program delivery so that it does not conflict with lecture periods of the students.
