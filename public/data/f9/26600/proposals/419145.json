About 1.3 billion people live in 54 different countries in Africa (according to 2019 statistics). However, the lack of access to financial credit, which is a major difficulty for informal enterprises in Africa, is due to the lack of collateral. Therefore, the idea team proposes to apply smart contracts, without financial collateral while leveraging the Cardano blockchain. The idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal is good, it solves the financial problems of informal enterprises in Africa and develops Cardano. Impact on the goal of the challenge posed. Propose a clear description, specific solution. The Cardano blockchain is secure and reduces the risks associated with traditional collaborative operations. With a smart contract developed on a daap that will encode traditional cooperative activities on the Blockchain. Blockchain technology works confidentially, transparently and securely between individuals in the informal sector. and pays in ADA, using yoroi wallet. The proposal is seen as the engine of economic activity in Africa. Applying smart contracts to cooperative organizations, businesses in the informal sector is the future of Cardano growth in Africa. Besides, the team has recognized the potential risks in the proposal and has many solutions, minimizing the risks when the proposal is implemented.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In my opinion, the feasibility of the proposal is quite good. We know what will be done and are presented in great detail. The roadmap is divided into 4 phases, each phase is divided into weeks. and deployed in 16 weeks, that is 4 months. The work to be done in each stage is also analyzed in detail. It is very positive that the team provided several milestones right from the presentation of the roadmap. Show that the team has precise goals, knows what they will do, how they will do it, and that all work will be based on this goal. This is a great sign of reaching the ultimate goal of project success. As for the budget, the team requested $67,950, more than 10% of the challenge budget. and properly explained. We know what the budget will be allocated to. However, given the relatively high number, we need a more detailed explanation. The daap development example is $30,000. approximately 50% of the total proposed budget. 20,500 seed credit fund. more than 30% of the budget. It would be good to have a detailed budget table, transparent budget will add sustainability and credibility to the proposal. For the team budget is $1,550. However, we would like to know how much time they will spend on the project. Finally about the core members of the group. A very good thing here is that the group provides very clear information about the members, and a short text about them, and attached profile of each member, so that we have a clear understanding of the members. member. their history and work in the past and present. We know their identity, qualifications, skills and experience are suitable to take on the project. In which Nathaniel Dwamena is the CEO, a member of Wada has joined Catalyst from Foundation 7. and Christopher Aikins from Foundation 4. They are all competent, knowledgeable and knowledgeable people about Blockchain, the ecosystem. Good cardano. They will be the ones dedicated to completing the project and contributing to the development of the ecosystem. The plan of the proposal is good, but the budget needs to be explained in more detail. I will deduct 1 point from the budget here.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team's proposal is new and independent. three of the five team members also did not work at all on any previously funded projects in Catalyst. The budget explanation is current, but more details can be added, increasing transparency for the project. The project roadmap is presented by week (16 weeks) and it is explained what to expect during that time period. As for the audit, the team provided us with a lot of detail on the auditability, progress reports will be published monthly on the website, daap development will be documented in Github, and updates. Sponsorship updates, Discord impact, and lots of KPIs provided. These are obvious ways to see if the development of the proposal has been successful. Ultimately, all that the team has presented with enough information is provided to facilitate serious and ongoing monitoring and supervision of the project.

The budget explanation part is unfortunately not good, the asking amount of 67,950 dollars is high, the parts that it is divided into are equally expensive, for example the development of the dApp that costs 30 thousand.

But the final success is defined in a somewhat generic way, only repeating what is said in the impact, it is not informed how this would be understood and proven, how this scenario would become palpable for the Cardano community.
