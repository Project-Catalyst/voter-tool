Please do note PA's go through hundreds of proposals and might not be as patient as others. Word of advice to the proposer, to please make your proposal more concise. Perhaps attending/refreshing the teachings of Catalyst School. Besides that, the intent of this proposer is amazing. Which is to onboard more women on to blockchain, in this case Cardano.\n\nCardano is very much dominated by men. Equal education and opportunity should also be open to women to provide a different perspective and solutions on blockchain issues. This hub for ladies I can actually imagine it being exported to various regions, having a safe space specifically for women to support each other and feel comfortable in is very sought out.\n\nBesides the importance of empowering women to be more involved in the Cardano blockchain sphere, education in general on Cardano is essential.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The solution deducted from the problem statement is a bit off. The proposers mention there keywords \"want to learn and contribute\" and that doesn't actually need to involve a physical space. Catalyst community has been thriving under covid restricted circumstances, though there are indeed merit to having a physical hub.\n\nSeeing that there seems to be a lot of anticipation towards the universities acceptance of having a physical hub and what this hub will be representing, add to that the identification of initial interest into learning about blockchain seems still low, I would actually recommend the proposer to continue their workshops first.\n\nIn the very beginning of this proposal, the proposers mention that they have been doing workshops and have been achieving small successes by onboarding new PA's from their university. So build on that first, educate more students, educate the dean and the upper echelons, educate the local government and then setup a physical hub.\n\nTherefore it lessens the burden of achieving the goals of this proposal and at the same time being more effective. For, the proposer would have done the initial groundwork of building a community.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The structure of the core delivery or the main make-up of a proposal is quite well done. Their effort to mitigate potential risk and their roadmap is very extensive. You can clearly see what will be done continuously, there is very little gap for self imagination which in turns means high transparency and potentially high auditability. \n\nAlthough high transparency also opens the proposer to higher scrutiny, and there is one major critique, there is a lot of emphasis on creating a physical hub rather than creating an engaging education syllabus/equivalent. Hence as previously mentioned above, between the headline of this proposal,the identified problem and the solution does not correlate well with one another.\n\nIt is very much a proposal that can be audited easily but at the same token it exposes some flaws. If not funded, please do not be discouraged, as mentioned, please find a balance between setting up a physical hub and actually creating a ecosystem that is conducive in learning effectively how to build on top of and to contribute in Cardano.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2088", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 5, "ng": 11, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2375, "q0": "This is a very good initiative to help women in Cape Coast University ,get introduced to crypto and Cardano.\nThere few initiatives that are geared encouraging African women to crypto and i love it.\nI would have loved if the team provided information how they intend to make the HUB self-sustaining as \nCatalyst will not be funding its activities year on year or the HUB gets closed as soon as the team run out of money?\nthe impact of this proposal to this challenge is obvious.There is a saying \"If you train a woman, you train a whole village\".\nI will be giving 5 stars for impact according to the PA guidelines.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Well this proposals roadmap is very detailed with associated timelines of events.However, i noticed the activities are starting in August 2022 whereas \nfunding might likely happen in September.

I will want to suggest that in dealing with misconceptions about blockchain technology being a barrier to participation, proposers can partner with SRCs of the university who may probably help create awareness if the buy into the ideas. \nThe budget is reasonable and well allocated. It is great that the proposers outlined relevant skills of team members but there are no links or evidence attached which i think is relevant. \nThree month to be used for training is feasible, but the plan does not give who does what during the delivery of the program so i think proposers should include that. \nIn all i believe the program can be implemented successfully given the experience and timelines given", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The KPIs given are fine for tracking the progress of the project.

The University of Cape Coast is full of women who want to learn and contribute to Blockchain, but don't have the means to do so. The Cardano Women's Center will provide them with the environment to do just that. To do that, the team proposed the idea of \u200b\u200brenting a space used as a hub for the purpose of training women at the University of Cape Coast in Blockchain technology, in order to scale up and boost the number of women in the community. Cardano ecosystem. Proposal impacts the challenge and is described in detail. The author of the proposal researched, interviewed women and most of them did not know about Cardano and any cryptocurrency. When taking into account the population of the African Continent, one can see that women are in the majority and these women because of their lack of this knowledge in the blockchain has resulted in a less likely growth of Cardano Africa. . Therefore, when fund 9 was launched, the author found it necessary to apply for some funding to establish a women-centered center at the University of Cape Coast.

Mohammed Mustapha is: a central leader at WADA, running a private cryptocurrency and Fintech solutions, he organized 4 Cardano meetups with over 300 attendees in Ghana... and has attached a link profile to help us understand more about the background of his work history, increasing confidence in the abilities presented by the proposal.

With my experience in these kinds of projects, it can go either way, If it's positive then it will definitely blow wide open and bring some level of traction and be well received.\nWith regards to the budget, all I can say is it is properly done, broken into several elements with each phase of the budget addressing a major element of the project.
