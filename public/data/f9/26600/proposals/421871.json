This will certainly bring more value into the Cardano ecosystem. It is also to highlight that these newcomers will be potential new proposal creators and will bring new creative ideas and business. Getting artists to engage with our community and to know how Cardano foundation process functions can change their life-projects and open up an unlimited potential for them.

The NFT market is still at its infant stage, with several market platforms.  Meanwhile, a lot of Africans still remain new to the NFT ecosystem.

Why would housing cost be necessary, when it is already captured in the possible artist needs? Isn\u2019t the artist already having a housing facility? Why would budget for wallet funding be needed when there is a provision for giveaways to artist? I wish the author provided more details here. This project failed to provide the relevant justification for some of the amount allocation budgeted for. In my opinion, some items are not needed here (such as housing cost, etc), therefore I suggest the team restructure the project  to downsize the budget allocation.
