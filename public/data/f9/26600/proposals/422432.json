And despite being a very ambitious idea, we noticed that its possibility of having a big impact is quite considerable, since there are already visible implementations around the project. One of the factors that makes us believe in this impact is the usefulness of the budget being requested. We realize that he is focused on the development of one of the parts of the project, and we see that without him the enterprise is still alive and in progress. However, with the funding and eventual success of the proposal, we note that this could be one of the projects that helps Cardano to achieve greater visibility at a global level. In addition, as we will mention below, the team involved is also highly qualified and the amount of capital being requested is fair. For all these factors, this seems to be a very suitable proposal for the challenge it faces, and with great chances of positively impacting the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "When studying the development characteristics of the project, we noticed that the actions are extremely well structured and that, together, they cover several aspects for the successful launch of the platform. It is interesting to note, as described in the videos, that there will be a great concern with the treatment and analysis of data. In addition, there are relevant partnerships with educational institutions. In the timeline, we can confirm this concern with different areas of construction, as the Milestones are quite diverse. Another point that makes us very confident in the team's engagement to make this initiative a success is the highly structured project website, with clear information on the objectives and areas of activity. The central idea of \u200b\u200bthe platform is even quite assertive, as offering returns in crypto that can be exchanged for essential items also helps in local development. Regarding the professionals involved in the project, we were able to find a vast team with knowledge belonging to different areas, we even see who these professionals are on the website and there are links to their resumes, so that their experiences are proven. Regarding the budget details, we can clearly see what the expenses will be and how they form the total amount being requested. In fact, for proposals that aim to have such visibility, it is always interesting to observe if there is part of the budget being allocated to marketing. But as here we have the case of a project already with considerable traction, it seems plausible that we have not found such an allocation.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Regarding the ways we chose to follow the evolution of the project, we have chosen great parameters that measure not only the registration of patients in the system, but also factors arising from this registration such as tokens generated and reports on the use of this new system.

In this context, a dashboard with adoption and effectiveness statistics could be made available.

Giving incentives to follow the medications and getting into a programme that will be informative as to why medication is vital for HIV, could help those people overcome their pessimism and inaction.

The people of Kenya receive monetary incentive and medical attention, the company at Immunity Life is able to collect data to advance research, and the Cardano ecosystem receives adoption by onboarding users in Kenya and having innovative technologies interact with the ecosystem. While this is what I observe and deduce from the proposal, I would like to see this section of the proposal more clearly point out these (and other) impacts for voters to understand what is actually coming out of this proposal.

The ever-rising global HIV/Aids crisis is strengthening its hold in Africa year after year, due to the many social and economic inconveniences. These problems, one of which the immunify.life team has identified and has proposed an incentivized solution, to propel lapse HIV positive patients into consistently taking their medications is game changer. The study which is aimed at grouping patients in Kenya, and making a connection on who avidly takes his/her medication consistently with or without the influence of incentivized rewards. As this initiative could potentially spare the lives of many lapse patients, I think it is admirable that a former traditional system is integrating digitization's like that of the blockchain ecosystem, and it should be encouraged and supported. With some phases of this study already completed, I think this is a team looking to implement great changes in the African continent. Nonetheless, Cardano as an ecosystem can greatly contribute to these developments by [1] demonstrating that it is community centric and [2] it is an ecosystem frontiering sustainable innovations. This way, innovators like immunify.life can benefit from the technologies built under the cardano ecosystem, as well as implement the integration of crypto incentive modules as promised in the proposal, possibly with the Ada currency or tokens.  Likewise, the ecosystem can  have a foothold as the first collaborator and subsequently increase its adoption into other African markets.

With the project already in its  implementation phase, I strongly agree that it will continue to run smoothly and fulfil each milestone set.

Doctors and medical staff will be more convenient during each medical visit, they can use Immunify Life software to create patient records and track patients by verifying IDs, tracking treatment schedules, treatment drugs, and results collected after each medical examination. The patients will be rewarded with Immunify Life cryptocurrency every month after meeting the treatment goals. This reward will incentivize HIV patients to take medication for treatment. In my opinion, this will be an extremely effective solution because it not only benefits doctors and medical staff in treating and caring for patients but also encourages the spirit of HIV patients to treat their patients treat.\nThe proposed team has pointed out the risks in the project construction process. Yes, the risks of price fluctuations inform that the amount of the bonus will not be uniform every month and it is difficult to find a sufficient number of HIV patients who have stopped treatment.
