It is important that the listener is captured from the very beginning and step by step, and that the vision is communicated as a gradual and sensible one. This is especially true if the listener is not one person, but a large audience like the ADA voters that these Catalyst proposals are intended for. In my humble opinion, the proposers do not follow these steps and \"shout\" (in capital letters) how passionate they are and that they want to increase awareness of Cardano in Africa. This is a passion we all share, but we need to know what makes this proposal stand out against others. We need to know which countries and neighborhoods this proposal targets, what kind of demographic or businesses would benefit and how the number of Cardano users, Cardano wallet, people's incomes or people's quality of life would be increased or improved by the work of each proposal. The challenge brief for Grow Africa, Grow Cardano has evolved over the last several funds where it has been a fixture, and it is no longer sufficient to just seed potential Cardano businesses that are located in Africa, but do so with a clear vision and high return on intent. When I read this proposal, I do not understand which steps the proposers plan to take if they get funded, what the funds are going to buy to have an effect on the project's success, and I therefore think that the impact for Cardano might not be as high as with others proposers who provide detailed links to their online profiles and a detailed business plan to instill confidence in the community that they can \"get the job done\". Although I feel the passion of the proposers, Project Catalyst is also a commercial enterprise, and we need to manage our Treasury ADA carefully to preserve their value in order to have impact not only today but also in the future. I highly encourage the proposers to read more about business plan writing, and possibly attend an incubator (like Ariob?), accelerator, or training program to that end. In its current form, I cannot agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge, which focuses on Growth as much as it focuses on Africa. I believe that this is mainly a communication thing and encourage the proposers to keep at it until their proposal clearly communicates what they are trying to achieve, have a budget, KPIs and defined goals.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Without breakdown or itemization of the budget, milestones or timeline, and a clearly defined business plan, course of action and goals, this project is unlikely to be implemented successfully. While I do not doubt that the proposers have good intentions and may be highly effective in bringing attention to Cardano in Africa, I would need to see a lot more details to recommend this proposals for the voters' approval. This is not about \"being good with words\" but about communicating a course of action so the distribution of funds can be targeted to areas where the are most needed and the risk of the entirety of ADA disbursed kept at an acceptable level.\nThe proposers present the names of the team, but it would have been great to get a link to the blog of the \"blog man\" and maybe see resumes, profiles, statements, even clippings of local newspapers demonstrating the work of the proposers so far would have been awesome to see.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Unfortunately, there is absolutely nothing provided in terms of quantitative performance metrics, timelines, targeted demographic, testing or validating ideas - it is not even clear what the product or service of this proposal are. I assume that the proposers plan to \"spread the word\" about Cardano to their social media and face-to-face contacts, but in order to assess whether this is worthwhile for the 25,000 USD requested, the voters would need to assess the likely impact, for example by looking at the current number of contacts, existing evidence of previous work, what the goals of the project are and how they can be communicated.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_2554", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5100, "q0": "This is a $25,000 fund request without any substance.
