There is not enough Marketing. Lets fix it", "f6_no_assessments": 10, "f6_rating": 3.8, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1608, "q0": "The proponent is very assertive when he says that most members of the Cardano community are unaware of Catalyst, let alone conscious voters. The objective of this challenge is to make dRep's activities as diverse, coherent and useful as possible, and none of this is valid if the community itself does not know who they are and what they do. With that, the idea here is to make a kind of \u201cmarketing blitz\u201d, as the proponent names, that is, a strong investment in publicity so that the members of the Cardano community know what dRep's are and what their role is for our growth like blockchain. It is positive that the proponent has already established what exactly the communication channels would be through which these campaigns would be disseminated (Twitter, Twitch, YouTube, Facebook and Reddit). The problem I identify here is mainly the lack of understanding of how these materials would be created. We know that the intention is for them to be fun and attractive, to be high quality and interesting. But first, what are we talking about? How does the proponent intend to create a survey on the topic, so that it can be disseminated? How would these contents be studied and elaborated? Another question I was thinking about would be in what format they would be addressed. Would they be written texts, or a mix between visual and written language? Or even videos? The same content would be posted on all social networks, or would it be adapted for each (for example, on youtube would it be a video while on facebook it would be an illustrative poster?). On the feasibility part, the author cites some formats (comprehensive videos, logos, banners, 3d content, AR, CNFT), but it is not said where each one would be published and also the percentage of them in relation to the whole (there would be more videos than banners , for example?). I wish these details had also been mentioned. If the proponent gave us more certainty about how these contents would be elaborated (how the technical part would be understood) and which design, marketing, artistic illustration strategies, etc. would be used so that they were generated in the most attractive and simple way possible, I believe that we would have even more confidence in the impact of this proposal. However, it is still an important idea that is very much in line with the objectives of the challenge, to boost the work of dRep's. Something that could raise the level of impact of the proposal would be the inclusion of some examples of materials that would be created. That way we could better understand how they would be designed in terms of design, how they would be built, and we would also have a more solid notion about the contents that would be covered in this publicity blitz. For these reasons, I will give it 4 stars because I agree with the need and urgency of what is to be done, but it lacked that some details were explained, so that we had greater solidity in the total understanding of the project.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project is divided into 3 phases, which from what I understand would last 1 month each. In short, I can understand very well what would be done and when, but maybe not how. I think that the vision we have of the process is very good, even solid, however some more details could be added in each of the phases so that the degree of understanding could be even more benefited. For example, in the first phase, the focus would be on creating these marketing materials. From what I could conclude with the full reading of the proposal, only the proposer would be responsible for this creation. But how can we verify that he has mastered all the techniques mentioned here? He says that he will invite some freelance artists to the project, I believe a graphic designer, so that some more specific content can be developed as well. It would be important for us to understand how these would be selected and their degree of commitment to the project. During this first month, how many hours per week will the proponent dedicate to the work, and how many will be the responsibility of the recruited artists? In the safe phase, how will it integrate and educate community advisors, how will this contact be made, how can we ensure that those involved are aware of the importance of the project? Finally, in the third phase, it would be interesting to know how the informative materials would be spread to the community, we know for when this solution is planned, but in practice it is not explained to us exactly how this would happen. Talking about financing, the asking amount is divided into a few parts. It is quite possible to understand how this would be used, but I would like to make a few observations. First, the $2,000 amount would be split between the contracted artists and marketers. However, we don't know how many there would be, nor how many hours of work they would dedicate to this project. Thus, it is not possible to have peace of mind about whether what is being asked is fair. The price of 25 dollars per hour for the proponent to prepare the materials seems to me to be compatible with the market, but we cannot say the same about the freelance workers who would be added here, precisely because we do not know their amount of time dedicated to the project. Talking about the financing of phase 2, this one did not open me to doubts. Now regarding the 500 dollars dedicated to comprehensive distribution methods, I couldn't quite understand what that would be, so if the asking amount would be adequate. In general, I think the money asked is fair, but a few more explanations would be useful to resolve these doubts. Finally speaking about those involved, we only know the proponent. From the description provided, there is a lot of confidence in him, but it would also be important for us to know about a portfolio, for example a linkedin profile, in order to verify everything that has been said. I also think it would be more appropriate if the freelance artists mentioned were already defined.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Unfortunately, this was the topic that left a lot to be desired, because the information given is quite superficial both in terms of understanding how the development process would be monitored and the final results would be contemplated. Regarding progress, the proponent says that \u201cit will document the number of posts, likes, comments, video views, to track engagement and make all data available to the public with full transparency\u201d. But what data would be made available, exactly? In addition to the generated materials, how could we follow the work behind it, the production of posters, videos and the like? How can we be sure that the work routine, ie the amount of hours promised by the bidder, would be being fulfilled? How could we measure the quality and commitment of the freelance artists involved here? I think there was a lack of a view more of the daily work, a view that would provide us with an understanding of whether there were difficulties and how they would have been overcome, for example. I would like the proponent and guest artists to keep us abreast of any progress, however sensitive. I think that this feedback could be disseminated in the form of monthly reports, perhaps, through some means of communication chosen by the proponent - one of the various social networks in which he intends to work, for example, or even the telegram and discord channels already used by the proponent. community. Turning now to the final results, it would be important for us to know, in addition to numerical data, how this campaign qualitatively affected the Cardano community. Do people now know what dRep's are, what they do, their importance? How could this understanding be proven? Perhaps a field survey sometime after the marketing blitz? Overall, I think we need to know how this information about awareness of dRep's role in the project catalyst would be understood and proven. Much more study, research and depth is needed so that progress is accurately and periodically monitored by our community, and that all information is accessible; and a deeper understanding of how the proposal would be meeting the specific objectives of the challenge, such as increasing the number of dReps, working on the issue of diversity, inclusion so that the most diverse groups can be part of this initiative and that the work of these community agents is executed with quality. Unfortunately, much improvement is needed. Having said that, I believe that the auditability of the project still has a lot of improvement and deepening to be done, so that it becomes more adequate.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 10, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 13692, "q0": "This is an appealing proposal to me and totally fits the challenge that it was submitted to. With the excerpt that the proposer stated \u201cMany Cardano users are unaware of project catalyst, how to be an informed voter, and the dRep role specifically\u201d it tackles the question of how to make the dRep more diversified. I agree with you that there wasn't enough Marketing to attract the dReps therefore it\u2019s time to  develop tools for the Cardano dRep program, also deliver massive improvements to dRep understanding of how the program operates, just like what the proposer stated in his work. The proposal also impressed me by accidentally extending the Cardano community participants which made the ecosystem more developed more sustainably in the long run because the Cardano funcion partly based on the dRep. The proposals suggested a full marketing blitz which aimed at onboarding dRep's and explaining the incentives and strategies for success as an dRep and out reach on 5 social media platforms. I have a small curiosity about what \u201cartistic methods\u201d is exactly and what actions you take to explain the strategies for being successful dRep? Are they the social platform\u2019s content including images or Zoom\u2019s meetings? I just expect a clearer explanation of this, which would give PAs a better overview about the way you approach your target, and also suggest you to choose 2-3 platforms your target uses the most so that it would decrease resource dispersion. On the other hand, you said there would be tools developed for Cardano dRep programme and I had read 3 times just to confirm that I missed no information about the tools but I saw none so it would have been great if you have stated what tools were developed and the way they were functioned, based on which PA can justify the effectiveness of the proposal to the challenge. Every project underlies a risk and this project is no exception. I can\u2019t agree more with the risk you have stated that would not create interesting high quality content, I believe that stating this risk means you have thoroughly understood this initiative as \u201cContent is king\u201d, we mainly approach our target individuals by words, therefore, it plays a crucial part in this project. However, I saw no solution for the risk, I suggest one in hope that it would help you overcome the problem. There might be senior content writers from the community, attracting them to join in this project with reward offered would be one way. In conclusion, your idea is supreme and I would give you 5 instead of 4 if these unclear points were to be explained in a specific manner", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The detailed plan is generally described with activities divided into 3 main phases and the approximate time for implementation. If the plan were to be explained precisely, from general to detail, it would be easier for me to catch up. I only saw that the first phase lasted for approximately 1 month, what about the 2nd and 3rd phase - how long would it last? I expected the first phases should include planning or implementing (if having a plan in advance). The reason I suggest planning first is because it\u2019s vital to have a Marketing plan to clarify the purposes, the activities and KPIs, v.v for each, which keep you (and PAs) track with the plan. The one shown to me wasn\u2019t really a Marketing plan as the actions are implemented with no specific purposes and timeline. For example, phase 1 will be started right after being funded or how long after that? During phase 2, which you stated coincided with Fund 10, but the date of Fund 10 has not yet been decided. I believe that the project should start right away after Fund 9 because it takes effort to raise people's awareness. Next, let\u2019s talk about the activities included,  \u201cset up interviews,... as many platforms and community groups and members as possible.\u201d, \u201cas many'' is how many, I suggest a limited number to focus the resources on. There are only 2 members in your team therefore doing as many tasks as possible will lead to overload. With the budget breakdown, a total amount of 9.5 thousand dollars is requested, which is suitable with the complexity of the project. However, there weren't  specific platforms to tackle so I wonder how you exactly divide for each platform and on air time based on this \u201c40 hours of platform distributions - 20 hours of on air time\u201d. On the other hand, I expect you count pensions based on fee/task to increase the transparency. The tasks you included in your proposal are quite diversified therefore I suggest you recruit more members, each specializes in one specific field to maximize the effectiveness of the project. In terms of the members involved, you are experienced in Cardano blockchain under various positions: stake pool operator, Cardano community member, catalyst community advisor and one of you has experience in MKT, in this way both the technical parts and the design, marketing etc will be well assured. My only 1 suggestion regarding this part of the proposal is: everyone would attach their linkedin profiles or anything I could check your authenticity. Above all, I still appreciate your effort so much.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Regarding the development of the process, I congratulate you on having some indicators that can say well about the progress of the proposal itself: number of posts, likes, comments, video views, to track engagement which I believe are easy to measure by the tools of the platforms themselves. Moreover, I expect you to state the link in which all data is available to the public with full transparency so there will be more trust given by the community. With the successful scenario you mentioned, it is outlined quite perfectly, as I can see from the following excerpt: \u201cSuccess would mean to have a robust marketing strategy that captivates the audience and increases awareness about the dRep role in project catalyst.\u201d. The proponent states that such information must be measured, but again, it is unclear how it will be counted and measured. I just suggest you clarify your definition of \u201ca robust\u201d marketing by quantitative data and when you reach that point, success seems to be clearer. I think that the proposal is quite auditable, it just needs to be clarified with the community Cardano can actively participate in this auditability.

Due to the provided information about team\u2019s members and, the request budget, this proposal cannot be considered as commitment for a high possibility of success. Thus, it impacts a lot on the possibility of the proposal and the expectation of voters as well. First, this is not a difficult or high requirement on skills of manipulating data or programming but it\u2019s a complicated project and requiring tasks are much more than our imagination. The number of users on those platforms is definitely in an enormous range and the managing those data will need a lot of efforts. Moreover, to achieve the effectivity and productivity as the KPI of the proposal, there should be various ideas, opinions to guarantee about the creativity of the marketing strategy. However, there is only one member that will participate and conduct the project. This would be not enough since creativity should be involved and contributed by more than one viewpoint. If there is only one person, that would be the subjectivism. Although the proposer has his/her friends supported, this requirement needs to be considered again about its possibility and the proportion of success as well as errors during the process when there is just one person, and the errors or problems are unpredictable. Moreover, as I said, this is quite a fascinating idea about creating a new strategy and I can claim that if it is just a hand, there would be a small puzzle not the whole picture. Because, when you build a model on your own, you would see only your perspective and there might be some biases as it\u2019s your product. Thus, I think there should be more team members. No matter how outstanding you are, work in a team would go far and farther instead of going alone. So, I do recommend that two or three more people cooperate in such a wonderful proposal would raise the value up a lot. Also, at the beginning, we can freely choose our own teammate and come up with the final list to ensure with the organizing committee and then conduct the project smoothly since a list of people with a specific job in the workload is planned already.

By the way, about the budget, although the proposer has included almost all the costs that might occur or absolutely occur during the conducting process, some potential risks are able to happen, as I analyzed above.

There are some unclear points in this proposal like the specific \u201croute\u201d, KPI number, etc. so that the voters can estimate quickly and easily the possibility of the proposal. We prefer a timeline that indicates for us which important milestone is showing the success of the project. In other words, the proposer should mention his expecting number that would reflect the effectivity of the proposal. Also, I suggest that a criterion for measurement to better evaluate the proposal progress would enhance the benefit in auditability for the proposal. For example, he could offer to provide the community a statistical report about the actual number of views or posts\u2019 reactions and then the voters can base on those number then make their evaluation and compare to the initial implied numbers.
