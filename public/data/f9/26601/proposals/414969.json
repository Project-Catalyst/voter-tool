This affects the efficiency of voting delegation.\u00a0", "f6_no_assessments": 11, "f6_rating": 4.545454545454545, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1625, "q0": "The proposal theoretically aligns with the objectives of the challenge, which are basically aimed at improving the work experience and benefiting dRep's. By translating a summary of the proposals into Japanese and English, those dRep's who have these languages \u200b\u200bas their mother tongue will certainly have their work much easier. However, I think some important remarks should be made regarding the impact of this proposal. First, regarding the choice of languages. The proponent argues that Japan and Vietnam are countries with a high degree of acceptance of cryptography and especially Cardano, but we do not necessarily know how many dRep's will be elected nor how many will come from these countries, besides the doubt as to whether they would be fluent in English or not. With that, we don't know if we would have many users for this tool. Another point would be the question of not translating the entire proposal, but a summary. The proponent says that the dRep's will be important and very busy people in the community, which will be a fact, for sure, but their main task will still be to analyze and vote on the proposals; so I think the most appropriate thing would be for the proposals to be fully translated, so that the dRep's can do the most careful and in-depth reading possible, so that they judge the validity of the proposal in the safest way possible. I believe that through summaries, the proposal would already be partially changed according to the translator's opinion, and not that this is a bad thing, not that his opinion is less relevant, but in any case it will not be identical to dRep's, most likely. So, in my view, this would influence the final judgment of the activity, which I don't think is a positive factor. That said, I think it would be interesting if we had a translation tool for non-native English dRep's, but I think it would be necessary to do some research regarding which languages \u200b\u200bwere most spoken after the dRep's were elected; then, we focused on working on those that were most common among the group; and ideally, the entire proposal, in my opinion, should be translated, so that no kind of bias is involved in this process. So I think the idea is valid, but some characteristics here should be rethought, with the aim of making the best possible use of the funds.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal roadmap is very practical and specific. We know well what would happen on each day, and as the project will be parallel to background 10 and will have a pre-defined duration, we can understand temporality very well. As it is a simpler project than the other proposals, it is not necessary to detail the activities or establish phases to be fulfilled. In my opinion, the information given is enough for us to have a good level of understanding about the development process of this project, and it is super positive to know what would happen exactly on each day. With that, the script part is totally satisfactory and adequate. Moving on to expenses, it is also very positive that they explain with such specificity how the money will be used. We know, for example, how much you will be charged for each translated word, for both Japanese and Vietnamese. The problem here, in my view, is that we have no way of predicting how many proposals will be launched in fund 10, nor how many words each will have. They estimate 1000 proposals with 300 words each, but that number can vary greatly, either more or less. The bidder states that if the number of bids launched in the fund exceeds 1000, anything that exceeds this amount will not be translated, but what if it is lower? An amount of funding is set aside for verification and adjustment of expenses, but we do not know exactly how these adjustments would be made; the provision expense part is also a little confusing, what would that be, exactly? In my view, the money requested is very well explained, but there is this doubt regarding how the adaptation of expenses would be made, in relation to the variation of content to be translated, which is not so simple to define. However, the level of detail in this part of the proposal is very good. Finally, analyzing the team involved in the project, a great detail is passed on each team member. We know that they are people with previous experience in the Cardano ecosystem, we also know their names, their professional areas, different projects in which they have previously been involved, who already have some experience with translation (with certificates attached); finally, a lot of specific information about each one is provided. And with that knowledge, a lot of confidence is passed in their preparations to successfully carry out the proposal. Having said that, I think the feasibility of this proposal is very good, it has indeed several positive points, but also some important issues to be worked on and improved, to raise the level of the topic even more.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Unfortunately, the proponent does not explain how the process of translation/creation of the tool could be monitored, as the suggested follow-up for the partial results relates to the feedback received. I agree that it is important to have a goal here on the number of downloads made, in addition to user satisfaction, which can be perceived through the comments. In fact, this is the most direct and logical way for us to know if the tool was being used as intended, but it does not allow us to understand if its development/production process was done as planned. Could it be that the activities, which are already determined to take place in a certain number of days, were actually carried out? Would each professional involved be respecting the work routine the way it should be? How can we follow up if they had problems, and consequently if they were remedied in the best possible way? I believe that what is lacking here is a certain concern to follow the tasks behind the partial results, not only what was produced and its acceptance, but also how it was produced. With that, I suggest that the proponent develop some way to bring such information to our community members, in a simple and summarized way - it can even be some report written on our communication channels, such as discord and telegram, for example. As an analysis of the partial results, the success scenario would indeed be \u201cincrease the participation rate of the Japanese and Vietnamese communities in dRep in the next Fund\u201d; that's our main focus here. But how would this data be verified? How can we be sure that, in addition to an increase in participation, this audience had a good experience, better than it would be if they translated the proposals themselves (or read them in English, if they were fluent)? I think that this analysis of the final scenario lacks a little depth, it says what would need to be audited, but not how this fact would be understood and proved. So, in my view, as in the previous topics, there are hits and misses here, some improvements would be needed to make the auditability more secure. However, what makes the proposal more auditable is the very precise script. More in-depth analyzes would need to be carried out on both sides, both in the auditability of the process and in the analysis of the final results.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 8, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 882, "q0": "This proposal aims to enable and empower non english speaking dreps by providing proposal information in their native language.
