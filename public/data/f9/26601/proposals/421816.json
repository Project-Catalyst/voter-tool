The solution to these issues is (as stated in this proposal) by creating a campaigning center that would host 5 dReps (voted for) from the LATAM community. It\u2019ll act as an official workspace for the representatives, and has great possibility of increasing collaboration, logistic and communicative easiness. From my experience of being a PA since Fund 6, I have observed The LATAM community growing rapidly and having had several very competent people stepping forward as trusted and experienced members of the Cardano Ecosystem. This makes them an integral (and trustworthy) part of being represented through the diversity of dReps. \n\nI have a slight issue with the presentation of statistics in the background of the problem statement: \u2019Statistics show that 30% of Catalyst voters randomly vote without reading the proposals\u2019. \nIdeally I would like to have seen the source of this information included in the proposal, in order to tie everything together a bit more. I know these facts are stated in the challenge brief (not referenced there either), so it is no issue within this proposal. \n\nThe proposer underlines the importance of having dReps representing proposals that underprivileged countries care the most for, something that I completely agree with. And if the representatives are chosen with the help of the LATAM community, there is a good chance that the individuals chosen hopefully will be committed and competent (since the LATAM community probably has very good knowledge of its members). If the less privileged countries are not represented as proposers, voters, PA, vPA or dReps; Catalyst will become segregated an unequal (hence why the focus of this proposal is so important). \nIt will also be useful for outreach to have a webpage created with the sole purpose of supporting the candidacy, amplifying the voice of dReps to as many people as possible (acting as a dRep-megaphone of sorts). \n\nConsidering that this proposal has the potential to affect (1) diversity of dReps, (2) number of dReps, (3) number of delegates and (4) accuracy of delegate decisions by creating, developing and implementing this proposal; I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. Outreach, education and support is a very strong combination when done correctly. Let\u2019s hope it is.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal includes a detailed roadmap with included milestones set on a timeframe of 3 months. Judging by the type of milestones, it seems the team has taken lots of precautions wanting to do this thoroughly (the first month being dedicated to develop, assess and bringing information out methodically for example). Second phase (month 2) includes a lot of focus on on-boarding, outreach and communications with the community through the dReps and making their responsibilities less heavy. Phase 3 is dedicated a lot of time for retrospective analysis and preparing for the next round of Funds. All in all, a very systematic and thought-through approach. \n\nThe total budget requested for this proposal is relatively small (19700 USD) in comparison to the impact it has the possibility to have (and possibly creating good practices for supporting dReps that can be used by many others). What I would like to see included is an estimate of work hours for the 3 staff members, that way we could see the hourly wage of each member, along with estimating the workload for each person. There is a section included on potential risks when developing this proposal, and in my limited knowledge of dReps (hard to tell when it hasn\u2019t been implemented properly yet) the biggest risk does not lie in the hands of the proposer but the dRep system not being \u2019ready\u2019 to be implemented yet. This is something that the proposer has thought through, and even if the system isn\u2019t ready they have plans to acquire value and information on best practices until it is ready. They still plan to educate and onboard people into the community. \n\nThe proposal includes a detailed roadmap with included milestones set on a timeframe of 3 months.

We are provided with LinkedIn-profiles to each member listed in the proposal (technical expertise, organizational experience etc), along with the Gitbook link for the LATAM-community. I only have a few suggestions on how to improve on this, and I don\u2019t deem them large enough to state anything else than that I strongly agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This is something that I have yet to see in all of my time as a PA since Fund 6: The proposal contains an extensive roadmap with milestones on a timeframe PURELY dedicated to KPI-tracking. Even the previous roadmap had elements of tracking KPIs and sharing them with the community, but this is something else. \nContained within the roadmap are many \u2019checkpoints\u2019 that include tracking all the actions, analyzing them and sharing them with the community. There are numerous active channels in connection to the Catalyst LATAM community (twitter, gitbook, youtube, discord, telegram, etc) so tracking the progress of development will be very easy. I love that each section of the roadmap contains some sort of analysis of data, evaluation and sharing of these. In my experience as a researcher, it is reminiscent of grounded theory (where you are constantly evaluating the data you collect and let that shape the purpose of your research), a great strategy for concepts that are fairly new and unexplored. dRep votes will be made public, as will most steps before that as well. I believe that this much consideration and commitment to transparency should be textbook in any proposal. \u2028As to the relevance of the KPIs, they are spot on. I believe that on-boarding 5 dReps initially will be no problem, especially since the community already has scouted the interest for it even before implementation of this proposal. Whether or not the dReps will achieve 1% of delegation from existing registered staking (listed as one of the goals), it will only be shown after having completed this proposal. \u2028This proposals approach to auditability is nothing but inspirational, and I hope that many other proposing teams learn from it. I very very very strongly agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.

This will benefit the catalyst process by avoiding DREP concentration among already popular community members and potentially creating a more diverse and decentralized representation of DREPS for voters to delegate to. The proposal clearly explains how it will add value to the Catalyst process. Fair and decentralized representation and voting systems are key to the overall success of Cardano, and this proposal helps to achieve that vision. The following KPI's are clearly aligned with the challenge and included in the proposal as part of the plan:\n \"\u30fbDiversity of dReps: From the 5 DREPs, which languages are represented, national origins, occupations, genders, ages, religions, etc.?\n\u30fbNumber of dReps: Had we achieved the 5 expected DREPs?\n\u30fbNumber of delegates: How much delegates each DREPs got, how much ADA and which % of the total Stake?\n\u30fbAccuracy of delegate decisions: How many visits the website has? How many people attended to the DREPs events, Did the DREPs voted according to their publicized strategy?\"\nI have given a 4/5 rating for impact because this is an important and impactful proposal. I have removed 1 star for the following reasons. 1) It is not clear this proposal will be successful enough to help the underprivileged DREPS to achieve saturation or 1% of the vote, and therefore this proposal is higher risk than some other proposals in the challenge category. 2) It is concerning that with this proposal we are setting a precedent for Catalyst funds to be used for DREPS campaigning. If this is funded, it may set a precedent, and there is a possibility other DREPS will also begin submitting for catalyst campaign funds, and I believe we should avoid using excessive treasury funds for campaign spending.  This could reduce the overall efficiency of the governance system. While this is currently a valid use of treasury funds at this time, there is potential for the long term impact to result in less diverse and decentralized representation instead of more, if we see a trend of the most popular, wealthiest, or highest funded DREPS gaining an unfair advantage in representation and exposure. If a popular DREP can receive delegation, surely they can also sway Catalyst voters to fund their campaign. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposing team is experienced catalyst members and they are well qualified to deliver on this proposal.

The challenge shows a thorough understanding of the barriers faced by dReps from underprivileged communities, and of the theoretical underpinning of liquid democracy; and suggests a practical and well thought out approach to beginning to address these issues. It feels important that such a proposal should be implemented right from the first Fund in which dReps are opearting, so as to embed right from the start these approaches to making dRep work more accessible.

I also like the fact that dReps are being paid for their time in campaigning, which is something I feel the actual dRep \"wages\" does not allow for. The proposal also has an excellent and high-profile team behind it, all very embedded in the Cardano LatAm community, which increases its feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Auditability is very solid.
