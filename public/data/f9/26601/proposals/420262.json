The Eastern Town Hall is Diverse in both number of non English speaking countries and population of the countries involved. The number of DReps involved is indeed leaning heavily on representation from Western countries. If the number of DReps from the Eastern Hemisphere increase, that will certainly make the system fairer. As the proposal states, supporting translation for 7 East Asian countries is a great start.

The proposal targets a large group of people who are currently under-represented. \n\nThe graphs show that each of the 7 languages to be supported are underrepresented in Catalyst. \n\nOrganizing a place for proposals from the Eastern Hemisphere is needed to diversify the group of dReps. Language barriers are very real for much of the world. This proposal addresses that problem head on.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The group is very experienced with Cardano. They are also experienced community organizers. The group has a very high likelihood of creating a hub for people to share proposals, and share feedback on those proposals. \n\nThe Catalyst program is evolving. The dRep program is very new. The point is that needs will change. The plan addresses the Catalyst process as it is now. The only hesitation is that the plan might be a little rigid and not allow for enough adaptation as times change. \n\n\nThe workload could become very large. The group of proposers can likely manage current volume. A risk is that volume grows and there is not enough budget to hire more organizers.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, absolutely there is enough information to audit this project.

Apart from that, the framework here is to make proposals available in more than 7 different languages in the community in the southern hemisphere. This initiative is in sync with the objective of the drep improvement challenge setting. Translating  and making available plain english summaries of IOG dRep workshops and dRep research to the Eastern hemisphere community would help introduce the drep initiative to new audience and enhance more awareness on the Drep role within the Eastern hemisphere community. Additionally, I envisage  an increase in enrollment or on-boarding into the Drep role and an improved engagement within the dRep Chat. Obviously, the creation of a chat that accommodate all people with different language background to ask questions, share knowledge and ideas on the drep role fosters community engagement and create an entry point for new members into the dRep role.\n\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The projects provides a detailed description of what would be done to achieve the overall goal. However, the information on the feasibility of the approach is insufficient. The only point worth noting here is the experience of the team. The team\u2019s profile indicates a group of team members with an extensive level of experience that cut across all areas relevant to this project. These team members are professionals within  the Cardano ecosystem and have a lot of track record in terms of project execution. Therefore I am impressed with the team\u2019s profile especially given the link attached to verify their expertise. Apart from that, I think the information provided at the budget section of this project provides a detailed budget breakdown that outline identifiable items with their associated budget allocation. Per my understanding of market prices of these items, I think the budget is more reasonable, accurate and moderate. Apart from that, by the outlook of the project, I am impressed by the roadmap; it anticipate and incorporate future events and how it could affect the project. Bythe design of the project, I agree with the proposer that the insufficient data on the drep role makes part of the activities difficult to be undertaken. I therefore anticipate that the rest of the activities would kick in when the first phase of the drep role is completed under this project. While they wait, the team plans to monitor 50 projects from the Eastern hemisphere community. I consider this laudable because it would offer them insight of what to work on.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Has the team provided sufficient information to help audit the project?

I appreciate the impact the project intends to make with this project,  as the overall initiative and role is novel\u2014make proposals available in more than 7 different languages in the southern hemisphere community.  In my view, KPIs like number of project monitored (from Eastern hemisphere community), number of participants E.H.C), number of statistical respondents, number of translation, number of plain English summaries, number of town halls and few others are more aligned KPIs to the objective of this project; and are more understandable and accurate metrics for determining the performance of the project. Apart from that, how would the data on these metrics be accessed by the community? I wish the team indicates  clearly if the team would update the community and how would it be done?
