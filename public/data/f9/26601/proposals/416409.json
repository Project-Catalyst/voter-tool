The team are not only native speakers but also have experience with translation work within Cardano already.

Still a five star proposal nonetheless.

This proposal tries to tackle this problem by translating and providing frameworks of translation for documents of Catalyst (Catalyst school, Catalyst circle...). The way they contribute to this challenge is by specially, but not only, focusing on dRep documentation. This is great since not only does this proposal align with the strategic objectives of fund9, but also with this specific challenge.\n\nTranslating Catalyst documents will result in more people from different backgrounds entering this space, which subsequently will provoke an increase in all areas, such as delegation rate or number and diversity of dReps. As a native Spanish speaker, sometimes it\u2019s hard to convey to other people how governance in Cardano is organized, and I also recognize that people who don\u2019t speak English find it impossible to learn about how this system works due to a lack of content in their language, that\u2019s why I find this proposal particularly interesting and beneficial.\n\nA plan for future scalability is also mentioned, and it involves the growth of the Cardano ecosystem and the involvement of LATAM as a whole. If successful, this project could also expand to other regions of the world, which in my opinion is a logical next step.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team in charge of carrying out this proposal have the skills needed in order to succeed. Enough evidence is provided in the form of LinkedIn accounts as well as a web page where all evidence of the previous work can be found. Regarding the team, it is great to see that many of them have participated as CAs, VCAs and have funded proposals, as this means that they know the Cardano ecosystem and also have experience in Project Catalyst. It\u2019s also good to see that the number of translators which will work on the project is also listed.\n\nWhen it comes to the budget, it is broken down into 4 elements. Two of them consist of document translation in Spanish and Portuguese, and ask for $3750 each ($0.05 per word). Considering the average cost per word of translating from English to Spanish is in the range of $0.09-$0.13 (depending on if it\u2019s a general or technical text. Source: GTS Translation Services), the amount requested in this department seems more than reasonable. The other two elements are repository development and project management, which also ask for a reasonable amount. On another hand, the proposal states that future funding will probably be needed in order to keep supporting the Spanish and Portuguese Cardano communities. Perhaps the team could explain if they plan on requesting funding indefinitely or if the project has a determined lifespan.\n\nRegarding the roadmap, this project will last for a period of 4 months and will translate a total of 50 documents. Considering the amount of translators who will be working on this, this timeline seems realistic and justified.\n\nFinally, there are two possible risks listed and some solutions which can be effective to mitigate them. For example, in the case of possible overload of documents, a priority order for translation would be established. This solution effectively addresses the problem and also serves as a guide to translate the most important documents first.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The milestones for this project are the translation of a determined number of documents for each month of the project\u2019s duration. This makes sense, since translation is the main focus of this proposal.\n\nRegarding metrics, the team have chosen 3 which align with the project and are efficient at tracking success. That being said, perhaps they could clarify how they are going to measure some of them. For example, one of them measures how many dReps require the translated documentation. Some more information on how will they keep track of this would be helpful, but nonetheless the metric serves the purpose.\n\nFinally, it is important to mention that the voters will be able to follow all the progress through \u201cappsheet\u201d(a public channel), which is a great thing for people who are interested in seeing how this project evolves.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2151", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 4, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4914, "q0": "Although dReps are still a ways off (and therefore perhaps this Challenge should have been approved for the next Fund rather than this one), as the Challenge team indicates, \"(1) dReps must be diverse, and (2) there should be many dReps. Failure to achieve (1) and (2) is centralization\". In this regard, translation/interpretation services ensure that Catalyst not become a centralized experiment, and when it comes to highly unequal regions such as LatAm, where English is not a predominant official language, Spanish and Portuguese are key to inclusion of the regional diversity and the many fine people that may act as dReps for the community as a whole. Otherwise, we risk that dReps end up centralizing decision and delegation within a Euro-centric frame of mind, which lacks the necessary sensibilities to the developing country regions where Cardano prides itself on focusing for the economic development of the world as a whole.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team comprises key members of the LATAM Cardano Community and even EMURGO Academy, such as Sebastian, and as such already have a long history of engagement with Catalyst and Cardano, providing translation services for Latin American proposers for several Fund iterations now.

The end goal of the initiative is to have accurate translation of all proposals from and into English into the two predominant languages in Latin America as soon as possible, contributing to the LATAM Dreps onboarding. The value addition to the ecosystem is cited as, helping to scale up the growth in drep participation. In that respect, I agree absolutely that this project fit the objective of the dRep improvement challenge setting. Apart from that, I see this project becoming the starting point in translating English based drep materials into several languages. This would certainly foster awareness creation on drep, improve the accuracy of delegate decisions and increase participation in the drep role.

On team experience,  we understand from the profile presented that LATAM is a well recognized brand within the ecosystem and with a track record in terms of project execution, as per the link provided.
