It\u2019s hard to get motivated to read books, and often harder to fully comprehend on one\u2019s own. We benefit from a facilitated way to learn the material.", "f6_no_assessments": 10, "f6_rating": 4.533333333333333, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1627, "q0": "The proposal is extremely interesting and meets the requirements of the challenge well, as it aims to better prepare the Cardano community for delegation and proper selection of dReps, through education. I confess that when reading the first parts of the proposal, my impression was that the idea was not so directly related to what the challenge seeks, but due to the explanations of the proposer, this relationship became very clear. In this challenge, we are working towards the best establishment of who will have the right to vote for Catalyst projects, the dReps, and it is necessary that this group is extensive, diverse and highly participatory in the Cardano community. It is therefore necessary that we have a solid knowledge of governance, and this can be sought through some books already published, which, according to the proponent, have valuable knowledge about the process of self-governance. So the proposal suggests establishing face-to-face meetings every month, where some people would read and discuss these publications, which talk about different governance topics. The proponent states that it has already established some studies in relation to very important topics such as \u201cImpact Networks, Systems Thinking, Design Thinking and Reinventing Organizations\u201d. As it is understood, this type of knowledge would also be studied in these meetings. The proponent claims that civic duty is awakened through an awareness of a sense of community, study and education, and book selection would increase collective knowledge, people's ability to select others who are appropriate and capable of exercising voting function. What the proposal says about face-to-face meetings is quite positive, because in my view this type of debate is much more established in person. However, the meetings will also be recorded and posted on youtube, so that more and more people can be included in the project. I believe that the only point that I would like to suggest improvement, in the impact of the proposal, is in the way in which the books will be chosen. We know that \u201cbooks will be crowdsourced from the community for ideas and recommendations, and one book per month will be selected by the book club team\u201d. What would this crowdsourcing process look like, what is it specifically? It would be positive for the proponent to provide a better description of how this process would be carried out, as I believe that the core of the proposal is based very much on what content will be studied. I also think that it would be necessary for us to work towards a great commitment of the group involved with the book club, because we know that nowadays most people have busy work routines, so that reading is always in the background; but it is essential here that the agreements are respected, the readings are carried out periodically and as previously established, and we need strategies to mitigate any obstacles. In general, the proposal is very much in line with the challenge, as it aims to prepare the Cardano community to properly select and promote dReps, so in my view it deserves top marks in terms of impact. It is also very positive how the proponent outlines several possible obstacles and how to mitigate them.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the script, in my view the information is not passed on properly. I say this because all we know is that the selection of books would begin in September, and we also have certain dates for when the meetings would take place. However, all the processes that would be behind it are implicit. For example, how would the book of the month be selected? As I mentioned in Impact, it would be necessary for the proponent to better explain what this crowdsourcing process would be, how the Cardano community would be activated and encouraged to participate in this choice. Then where would the meetings be held? How would this location be selected? It is not clear in which country the project would be developed and how individuals would also be attracted to this moment. We have no understanding of the breadth of these meetings, that is, how many people would participate in each and how many hours they would last; we don't know how it would be done to record the content and make it available on youtube; it is not said how the online content would be disseminated to the Cardano community. Finally, details regarding the process; although the proposal is not so complex in terms of organization, it would be very positive if we had such explanations available. Speaking of costs, we know how the $3750 amount would be broken down (in parts such as \u201cManagement and coordination of the book club / Marketing and dissemination of books and book club sessions / Miro Council and planning for the book / Facilitating book club sessions\u201d). We know how many hours of work would be delegated to each of these parts and the price of each hour ($50). In general, it is very clear how the money would be used, my only suggestions would be in relation to \u201cother costs\u201d; it would be positive if the proponent had specified what these technology costs would be, what materials would be purchased and especially what the miscellaneous budget would be (perhaps a reserve money, for unplanned situations?). Finally, when it comes to preparing the proponent to successfully carry out this project, complete confidence in Nori is conveyed, because we know a lot of information about him (for example, that he is a very active member of the Cardano community, being \u201ccurrent member of the team of Catalyst Circle, member of the Cardano4Climate core team, ambassador Cardano, PA and funded bidder.\u201d We can also see that he already has experience with similar projects (book club), and that because of his extensive presence in the Cardano ecosystem we are sure that you are capable of taking this project forward safely and seriously. Therefore, the only part of this topic that I think deserves more attention and improvements would be the script explanation, a more detailed schedule would definitely add a lot of value for the feasibility of the proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding tracking progress, this can be done through metrics provided, such as \u201chow many books read / how many sessions were held / how many people engage in social media channels / how many people show up for book club sessions\u201d. However, this information is only enough for us to have an understanding of the partial results, and not the processes that would be behind it. As I mentioned about the script, several works and activities are part of this project (how to select the book of the month; how to publicize the face-to-face meetings; how to make the Cardano community absorb the debated knowledge, through the videos posted on youtube ; how the debates will be conducted; how the location of the face-to-face meetings will be defined; etc). All these tasks should also be monitored, in my view. In order for this to be done properly, the proponent could prepare a monthly report; could be written, but as he will establish a channel of communication with the community via Youtube, perhaps such summaries could be posted in video form at the end of each month as well. That is, in addition to recording the meeting, the proponent could give a brief summary of the work routine that month, if everything went as planned, if any problems had to be worked around, etc. Speaking now of end results, success is defined as \u201cwhen community members read, engage and participate in book club conversations and documents and provide access to the discussions for the community\u201d and also when the level of education on governance is higher and better established. My suggestion is that the proponent do an analysis that can result in verifiable data on how this book club positively impacted the Cardano community, that is, how did people have knowledge changed from the project? How have the books contributed to a better understanding of the importance of collective governance, how have these contents changed the view on dReps? I think that an interesting way to understand this scenario would be to do a qualitative research, that is, in addition to knowing how many books were read and how many people participated in the meetings, we hear directly from them what was the impact of the project on their perceptions about the topic and about the dReps project. Overall, I think the proponent has an auditability principle well underway, but it is necessary that 1) more detailed tracking of the roadmap is done to measure progress 2) that book club impacts are understood further from a survey of those involved.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 11, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1047, "q0": "The role of dReps will be vital to the future of Cardano. Staying up-to-date not just with the events within the community, but also with the theoretical governance side will pave the way to a successful outcome for the entire blockchain and perhaps, even the entire crypto space. Starting off with a group of well-documented individuals will hopefully set the tone for those who\u2019ll follow to strive for greatness. As such, having a book club geared specifically towards improving the knowledge of future dReps and the overall Cardano Community members is an important step towards a high rate of participation and consequently towards raising the collective knowledge of the community.\nAfter reading the proposal, I have actually downloaded the PDF for the first reading session \u201cA Treasury System for Cryptocurrencies: Enabling Better Collaborative Intelligence\u201d and after browsing through it a bit, I am convinced that the idea behind the book club could turn out to be quite successful. I already have some questions - and I don\u2019t mean regarding the mathematical formulas - but regarding the philosophical side of it, and I believe others will do too and will be looking forward to the stated date of each of the months to gather and talk and find answers together. Thus, I will rate the impact section of the proposal with a 5/5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Since this is a proposal for a recurring monthly workshop, the detailed plan is very straightforward: The project will last for four months starting in September and ending in December. At the beginning of the month, the community will focus on the selected book and towards the end of the month, they will gather together in an open meeting, facilitated by a host. The host will be guiding the conversation and use Miro boards to synthesise the information from the meetings. As such, I find there is no other information that would have been vital for the project description.\nThe budget is also very comprehensive, it describes all the steps needed for the book club meeting to be prepared, held and marketed to raise awareness and involvement. \nThe proposer has provided ample information about himself. He has provided us not only with a clear description of his skill and involvement in the community, a LinkedIn profile link, and a Twitter handle but most important, he has attached a series of videos of previous Book Club meetings, where we can see exactly how well the meetings were handled.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For the project\u2019s progress, I find the metrics to be spot on. The plan of the proposal is to read 4 books in total, so the number of books is obviously the first metric to follow. Then, for each book, one session will be held, as such, that is the other metric. The metrics for attendance and social media engagements will also be tracked, but there is obviously no timeframe given, as that will organically develop in time.\nAnd the question on how the success would look like is also clearly written, with reasonable expectations but, at the same time, offering a glimpse of a potentially positive change in the direction of community involvement.\nAs such, I find the information provided sufficient in regards to auditing the proposal and assessing its successful outcome.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 1, "ng": 16, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1117, "q0": "This proposal aims to engage with and educate the Cardano community through virtual book club meetings dedicated to dRep books/papers initially recommended by IOG. The monthly meetings will also be recorded and posted on a YouTube channel to make them available in perpetuity for dReps, or those wishing to become dReps, who were unable to attend the live meeting generating further impact.\n\nThis is a simple but important project in that it encourages the education of topics pertinent to current and future dReps and creates a format for participation that is inclusive and fosters the sharing of ideas and understanding, thus addressing the objectives of this particular Challenge.\n\nThe proposer has already set up \u201cThe Leadership Academy Book Club\u201d and held monthly book club meetings in accordance to his previous proposal that was funded in Fund 6. This is a continuation of that project but with a focus on governance related books and targeting members of the developing dRep community.\n\nEducation of dReps needs to be supported in order for this aspect of governance to be successful. Book clubs are a tried and true way of guaranteeing readership of materials. A virtual book club format for dReps is a great medium to do that as well as create a sense of comradery amongst dReps who will often be supporting dissimilar proposals.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As this is the continuation of a previously funded project, the presenter has laid out a clear step by step timeline for this proposal and the budget is well delineated with a break down of the time required for each task.\n\nFour books/topics have already been chosen as topics for the next 4 months' virtual book club meetings and the dates have been set. \n\nThis is a one man show. The presenter, Nori Nishigaya, has the experience and is more than qualified to run these book club meetings with over 30 years in software development, and being a member of Catalyst Circle Admin Team, Cardano4Climate, Cardano Ambassador and a PA, amongst other things. He is passionate about making Cardano the best crypto community in the world.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The timeline for the project has been presented in an explicit manner. The KPIs can be audited by measuring the amount of books/papers read, the amount of virtual book clubs held, the quantity of people attending the virtual book club meetings and the amount of views on Youtube of the uploaded meetings.\n\nThe ultimate success of the proposal is in facilitating a dRep's acquisition of the deep understanding of the foundational knowledge required for unbiased governance. Votes cast for proposals by a dRep's critical thinking based in the core values of the Cardano project will eventually become self evident.

It focuses on one specific element of the way dReps are being implemented (the fact that they have been given a reading list); spots the potential problem in that anyone who doesn't feel comfortable reading and analysing on their own could feel excluded; and solves it in a neat, low-budget and community minded way, using the tried-and-tested concept of a book club. While I like the fact that this book club is open to the whole community as well as the 150 dReps, this could make the meetings quite large and unwieldy, and make it offputting for people who are not confident in large groups, so I would perhaps like to know more about how the facilitator might approach this if it happens. But I like that sessions are recorded, and will have a Miro people can view afterwards (in fact, this will perhaps enable participation by anyone who is uncomfortable if meetings get too big). The explanation of how the proposal fits the challenge is very through and well-supported, addressing increased diversity and increased delegation via education. Obviously there are ways the proposal could be expanded to increase its impact, or how it could be... not replicated exactly, but versioned in a range of communities so as to reach dReps in different time zones, etc - but as a first step, this proposal is more then enough as it stands. Risks are well mitigated too; although I would like to have seen some mention of what is perhaps the most obvious risk with book clubs - the risk that people turn up not having bothered to read the book, so the discussion can't really focus on the book itself. But this is something the facilitator can come prepared for, and I feel sure that a faclitator of Mr Nishigaya's calibre would do so - i.e it's not a big enough issue for me to mark the proposal down at all.

I can't see anything that would negatively impact the feasibility of this proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The metrics suggested makes sense, are readily measurable, and are appropriate to the small scope of the proposal; and the overall \"what is success\" vision is clear. However, I would have liked to see the inclusion of some kind of qualitative assessment - perhaps a feedback form or an in-meeting poll - to see what people actually think of the meetings - have they enjoyed it, has their knowledge grown, do they feel any more confident in ther role as dReps?; and also, I think some measuring of how many attendees are coming back week on week as opposed to coming for the first time could be both interesting, and potentially useful for future planning.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2343", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5577, "q0": "Coming from an academic background myself, I like the idea of forming a book club to disseminate knowledge to the wider community.
