However, according to the roadmap announced by the proponents during the QA review round within 14 days, they will evaluate 1000 proposals. corresponds to an average of 1 person rating 100 projects. a relatively large number. I asked her to provide more clarification on what criteria these assessments will follow? as she paraphrases in the proposal \"our assessments are independent of the proposal's score in the Governance phase\". In the planning section, she laid out a roadmap to conduct a review of the proposals in the governance phase of fund 9 with 500 reviews in the first month. and as mentioned above with fund 10 they will do 1000 reviews in the QA review round.

The proposal raises the issue in line with the Challenge, which speaks to the current state of dReps. The number of proposals increases so much and rapidly in each fund that dReps do not have enough time, knowledge and experience to evaluate all proposals. Your proposal to create a trove of documents for reference dReps to vote on, which solves two challenge problems: making it easier for many people to become dRep, convincing people to delegate without much time, experience and knowledge. The proposal team has created a database of references that give dReps more information to evaluate recommendations and improve the quality of accurate decision-making at each fund to address Challenge's questions about creating content and tools that make it easier for dRep to perform its tasks. Your archive of documents will be implemented continuously according to catalyst development so the proposal will be able to scale in the future along with the growth of Catalyst. \nThe proposal provides a solution to this problem by creating references to proposals in each fund to help dReps who do not have much experience, knowledge and time can refer to make voting decisions easier and more accurate. This is the logical and appropriate argument that the proposal has made. The proposal also recognizes the risks of doing so that the reference can increase focus if too many dReps use the same reference without making individual reviews. The second risk the proposing team found that the reviews in this reference were subjective because they were based on the reviewer's experience and knowledge. The proposed group also offers a solution to the first risk of making the reference public so that the community can compare with the voting decisions and reasonable evaluation of dRep. The solution that the proposal offers to overcome the second risk is to make recommendations for dReps to use this document only for reference, the evaluation decision of the same must be based on the opinion of the dRep.\nI fully agree with your project, the repository of documents that the proposal creates will help not only the dRep but also the other participants of Catalyst. This has a huge impact on the Catalyst community. My score in this section is 5.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal defines the timeline according to each stage of work and according to catalyst's fund-by-fund schedule.

The second goal is made at the fund 1 in 14 days, the proposing team will evaluate and give a score of 1000 proposals then conduct a survey of the dRep on the quality of references for editing and development for the next fund. These developments of the project were shared publicly by the proposed team on the Goolge Sheet. \nThe proposal's funding budget of $15,000 represents 10% of Challenge's. The budget plan of the project is based on the number of completed assessments, I find this spending plan reasonable. The project has not yet come up with a budget plan for example due to the price fluctuations of the ADA or due to current inflation, the amount paid for each assessment will increase. \nThe proposed group consists of 1 known member and 10 members of VietCore Team. If the details of a member's experience are in line with their duties and experience, the task group has not assigned tasks and provided specific information to the remaining members.

The process of implementing the project is easily checked on Google Sheet as shown by the number of reviews that the team has made. The proposing team describes the success of the project specifically as follows as follows at least 20 people who will become dRep after using the reference, the second success being described as easier and more accurate voting dReps. These are successes related to challenges. \nThe proposing team does not yet have a test product, this is a completely new project of the proposing team. However, you have a review of some of Cardano's projects on the YouTube channel of the fairly clear and detailed such as Cardax project, Sundaeswap, Liqwid Finance....
