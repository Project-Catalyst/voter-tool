Cardano's decentralized app development is extremely reliant on developers, who are also an essential component of the success of modern Blockchain platforms. It's feasible that taking this Haskell course will make it possible for programmers to learn Haskell, which would make it easier for them to build applications that use Cardano. The concept that has been proposed to create training videos in Vietnamese is a fantastic one. This is due to the fact that local developers in Vietnam do not have access to any book or paper pertaining to Haskell.

The team has demonstrated their proficiency in Haskell through the production of multiple videos; however, I would be interested in learning more about the individual members'\u00a0backgrounds\u00a0through the use of personal profiles.
