The developer ecosystem for Cardano would benefit from this. By fostering a positive environment for developers in these areas, more people would join, which would increase the number of Dapps and stake pool operators from these areas. As a result, Cardano Catalyst's value would spread throughout the Asian community, increasing Catalyst participation as well. The proposal's KPIs are undoubtedly in line with the problem, and its implementation would draw many more proposers from this area.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal claims that the proposer has solid technical knowledge and multilingual experience. Additionally, the proposer has offered some references to his previous works, demonstrating his technical expertise and his familiarity with Cardano, both of which are necessary to produce documents or training materials in Asian native languages. It states that two translators for Chinese and Japanese are needed to carry out the proposal, which is reasonable and reasonable given the requested budget. However, there are still some details lacking regarding the specific courses that will be offered and which developer courses are important or in-demand. Does the proposal already have any demand for particular courses, such as minting nfts/assets or Plutus courses? This is crucial to determine because people are looking for better Plutus courses that are also available in English. Will the proposer produce new content if it cannot be found in English?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal states that this would go into effect in the middle of 2023, but it is unclear how much content is being produced or translated at this time.

A decentralized and knowledge-sharing platform that aims to translate content into Chinese and Japanese will make it easier for developers in China and Japan to join the ecosystem. Japan is a country that owns a lot of ADA, China is the most populous country in the world, and if we can develop Cardano in these two markets, it will bring a big impact to the Cardano platform. as the developers here increase they will develop applications for the natives the number of users will increase and the investors will also increase accordingly. In addition, Japan and China are both located in the geographic region that the challenge is aimed at. Thus, this proposal will effectively solve the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "And speak Italian, Spanish, and English. According to the links the Proposer provided he had https://cnftacademy.com/ which is an active Cardano NFT-focused e-learning platform on which there have been several lectures for the English-language developers have integrated Italian translations. that's a plus for his ability to execute projects. however, translating into Chinese and Japanese is not easy. he said that he has friends who are native speakers to be supervisors. but unfortunately, I can't check the information about these people in the proposal, how do I know they really exist, and if they do they have the experience and skills to monitor the wording technical expertise or not. about the implementation plan, he said that he will start with current content until the end of 2022 and continue with new content, and end in 2023. unfortunately, the plan is quite general if he lists Output the content to be translated and expected to translate with a timeline for each item which can be a week or a month for each item. This will help with the project's auditability. about the budget the required amount is 15000$ which he explained including the translation hours for 2 professional translators , however I don't have any information about these 2 translators. and in order to assess whether this cost is sufficient to successfully implement the project, or the reasonableness of this cost, I need the proponent to provide more information about the translated content, although it is a bit difficult to imagine the whole thing. and how many hours are expected the 2 translators will work, what will the project manager do, for how long and have the amount allocated for the time to do the work. In summary, the feasibility of this project is good because the author has experience in doing this work with English and Italian and the translation work is not too difficult a project. however the suggestions I made could improve this further.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proponent shows how we can track the progress of the project through the Site Activity Monitor and flags displayed in the site's language.

Creating good content for developers will increase the adoption of Cardano in Asia and certainly add value to the Cardono ecosystem. The lessons are linked to the official Cardano material.

She speaks Italian, Spanish and English and needs the support of the community to integrate different languages. There is therefore sufficient relevant experience to implement the proposal. Links have been added that refer to the platform. Currently, CNFTacademy has integrated the Italian translation of the content into the platform. The purpose of this proposal is clearly stated, which is to hire a Japanese translator for the text content and audio of the videos and a Chinese translator for the text content and audio of the videos. The planned budget is USD 15000. This includes the costs for the hours for the translation by 2 professional translators. CNFTacademy does not collect revenue, money is not returned, but is invested for the community. A potential implementation risk is that it may be difficult for non-technical translators to translate some parts of the resource. A possible solution is to use native speakers as facilitators.

The idea is aligned with the challenge setting objective which is to grow Cardano\u2019s outreach in East Asia however,  the proposer didn\u2019t discuss how they will onboard Chinese and Japanese audience to their website sufficiently. I mention this because based on what I see on the translated CNFTacademy website in Italian, the lesson is structured into videos and text based information. The text is basically showing similar information with the ones in the video but the video itself doesn\u2019t have any closed captions in Italian so Italian speakers have to basically only go with the text and maybe follow the video not as effectively. This problem will be even more pronounced once you consider that Chinese and Japanese are very different from English.
