At the same time, proposal targets Vietnam members who are keen on Cardano and running/jogging, potentially increasing their sense of community and therefore fitting well in the challenge. However, I think project could create a more strong connection between the activitiy proposed (running together) and Cardano, in order to better reflect its value proposition to the ecossytem. \nFor instance, during the main event week, smaller Cardano workshops could be held so runners could present projects they have in the blockchain or investments strategy, for example. There could also be some reward for people who are developing Cardano-based application focused on health. The ADA reward distribution could also be according to how many kilometres each \"competitor\" run rather than the regular 1st, 2nd and 3rd place so everyone feels incentivized. Post events meet ups, trainings and other activities could also be in the scope of the proposal to enhance the social interaction. This is reflected in the auditability part but what is going to be done afterwards could be more concrete. Outdoors advertising materials could also be placed in the main running circuits to market Cardano. I saw also in the feasibility part that a gamefication will be made. This is very good but could be better explored (and even better explained). For instance, the kilometers run by each competitor could be turned  into points and other acitvities could be included so runners could get points from them as well. As examples, bring a friend and gain more points, make a workshop/present your project on Cardano and gain more points, etc. There's space for this to enhance Cardano connection in the project.\nAll in all, the idea is good but it can still increase the appeal to Cardano ecossytem by integrating more the activity proposed with the blockchain. My rate is therefore 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan presented here encompasses the whole project scope and has good acitivities, telling what and how the project will be carried out.

There's a very clear descripition on what is included in each budget line with the number of itens and total hours necessary. There's also a gamification proposal inside it, which is very welcomed (it just got me wondering what \"Painter on run\" is). \nRegarding the team, it has 2 people committed with experience in Cardano and communcation plus a team for social running assitance (Uprace team). these competencies combined are enough to run this project. It is also provided links as references and a good level of details on the each one background.\nI general, I totally agree this project is feasible. My rate is 5.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Proposer suggests a lot of good kpis and they all have pre-defined targets/goals, which is very good. I liked the creation of new wallets will be incentivized. It's possible also to extract some milestones from project plan, they just need to be available somewhere public so the whole community can keep up to date on how the project is going. As further suggestions, I'd consider have as kpi a defined number of Cardano events held after the event.

The proposal's success is demonstrated by the number of participants, the number of subscribers to the Cardano channel, the number of kilometers run, and the connection of people from different communities. It will be interesting if this online running competition can expand to the Cardano community in other countries after this proposal is successfully implemented.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Proposal proponents have proven relevant with their extensive experience in finance, fintech, marketing, and event organization.

The group plans to create a Community Center for Cardano runners in Vietnam, with the first activity being to organize a virtual running event through the Uprace application - an application about running in Vietnam run by Joint Stock Company Vina Corporation (VNG) has been developing since 2018. The purpose of the proposal is to help the Cardano Vietnamese community strengthen its connection through social events and attract new people to join the community. The group also plans to donate trees to the Cardano Forest in Vietnam and raise funds to organize a global virtual running event called \"Cardano Amazing Race 2022\". This is a project submitted at Fund 8 but not funded. At Fund 9 to increase the feasibility of the solution, the team added support from Uprace through the addition of Uprace members joining the project team. Personally, I think that this is an energetic and inspirational proposal that will spread and attract a large number of running lovers in Vietnam to participate. In fact, in Vietnam, marathons are always well received and actively participated by sports lovers. According to incomplete statistics, in 2022, Vietnam will have more than 20 marathon races with different distances (5km, 10km, 21km, 42km), organized by many agencies and businesses (https://www.vietnam.com/www. //vrun.vn/news/detail/lich-tong-hop-cac-giai-chay-bo-marathon-2022). However, I personally think that the team needs to consider the risk because the Cardano Runners Community Hub participants may only be interested in running but not knowledgeable and not interested in blockchain and Cardano. Therefore, I suggest that the team need to have an effective communication strategy to target audiences who both know about blockchain and love running to increase awareness about Cardano. I rate 4 points on the impact of the solution for this reason.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Regarding the feasibility of the solution, I have confidence in the team because they have come up with a plan with a very clear and detailed implementation roadmap. The only point that makes me feel confused here is the time when the online race event will take place. In the event reference link (https://bit.ly/cardano-uprace-rule), the team describes the run as July 2022 (within 23 days), however in progress of the proposed information is November 2022. Regarding the project's budget, the team has divided the items but I still need to understand more about the unit prices of some cost items. Specifically, the award operation costs $1000 but there is no specific unit price and prize composition. Similarly, the POSM design category, event banners also lack specific unit prices and the expected number of banners needed. For email marketing items, which cost $500 for 10000 users, I suggest the team consider using email marketing support tools (MailChimp, GetResponse\u2026) to increase reach and reduce costs. As for the cost of 500 T-shirts and medals of $10000 (accounting for 40% of the total project budget), I suggest that the team consider reducing the quantity to reduce costs or need to explain more why this amount is estimated. Regarding the skill and experience of the proponent, the links provided are complete and verifiable. Therefore, I believe that the team has the capacity to successfully organize the online running event. However, I give 4 points for feasibility, after deducting -1 point for missing information in the budget section.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding auditability, I believe the community has enough grounds to audit this project. Because the KPIs are fully and clearly provided by the group. I just ask the team to provide more specific timelines to measure these indicators. For example, how many weeks after the virtual run event will be reached the target of \u201c2,000 new wallets created and exchanged for NFT certificates minted on Cardano Blockchain\u201d? I also suggest that the group consider setting up a supervisory team to ensure that the awarding and distribution of prizes to the winners goes smoothly after the event.

Definitely, if the project is funded, I will sign up to take part in .\nBesides, I noticed that the group has not apparently demonstrated  the risks and solutions to address the problems that would happen when too few people participate in. There are 3 main reason why this issue appears. Firstly,  the group's rewards are not attractive. Secondly,  most people will not understand about how NFT works and how to receive . Finally the sponsorship of the Cardano Forest in Vietnam Project that has not  been clearly established and verified yet.\nWith the above assessment and my interest in the project, I would like to give  4 points for this group.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Through inspection, I found that the team members have got considerable experience in the position they are in charge and it is necessary to cooperate with the experienced people in Uprace.\nHowever, my feasibility assessment would be better if I could see a survey on the ages of people who can participate in running in your area and the level of understanding and acceptance of Blockchain technology at each age level. In other words, if the age of participants in your area is between 40 and 60 years old, the ability to accept Blockchain technology as well as Cardano's technology will not be so high, leading to a decrease in the efficiency of the development of the Cardano ecosystem in East Asia because the capital is not concentrated to the right people who is in need.\nBecause I see the lack of an argument for the allocated capital to be served to those in need to be able to develop the ecosystem as required by this challenge, I would give the group 4 points.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The plan is well organized  so I can understand the group's activities after the funds are allocated. In addition, the idea of funding for the tree planting activity in some forests Vietnam is extremely beneficial.\nHowever, I consider that two indicators  are not clearly established. It would be better if I could see a survey of people running on similar projects so that I could have a verified number that the team would attract 10,000 participants. Furthermore, do the group have an economic way or a way to convince all 2000 people accepting to create wallets and receive NFT because I think it's too difficult to be practical.\nBecause the two important criteria have not been clearly analyzed that determine its success, I give the group 4 points.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3250", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11366, "q0": "I highly recommend this idea, its impact on the Cardano community in particular, and its value to society. Since the covid epidemic, people have become more and more interested in sports to improve their resistance. Run is a subject in which anyone can also be involved, regardless of age, knowledge, or wealth. Covid prevents large gatherings, so running is more suitable, so more people participate in jogging. In Vietnam, especially in the capital Hanoi, we see people jogging in the early morning, afternoon, or evening in the park or outside. More and more well-educated working-age people are participating in this sport (students, students, workers). Now well tested, easy to start running a team anywhere. The project focuses on subjects that love this subject. The interesting thing is that the project creates a virtual race that can attract a large number of participants because the participation time is flexible, regardless of the distance of the address as well as attractive rewards. I enjoyed this idea. Please imagine:\n- All participants are happy because their stress is reduced. Optimism is positive\n- For learners, and students, who have a lot of free time, participating in the explanation is an opportunity to receive valuable prizes and share knowledge from expert Cardano from there. startup assembly.\n- When participating in maintenance for 3 weeks, a habit of detoxification will be formed, which will help them get healthier, the community will be healthier and society will be more beautiful.\nFrom this event, Vietnamese people will know more about  Cardano.

What I mean here is that this project will be the first virtual running event of the Cardano Runners Community Hub\u2019s activity via the Uprace application, a well-known running application in Vietnam. Therefore, it would be a great advantage if the proposed team has a good relationship with Uprace team. This will be a great human resource which is extremely suitable for the project.

The proposal has raised the current situation that the Cardano coin community in Vietnam is lacking in social events, we need to make the Cardano community more cohesive and create an impact on new people. I find this proposal very necessary because Cardano is an ecosystem with great potential and is increasingly applied to life, so scaling is very important. Currently, the number of people who know about blockchain and Cardano is not much, not only that, but those who have joined this community also have very little interaction with each other. Therefore, the purpose of this proposal is to create Cardano Runners Community Hubs in Vietnam to connect the community of people who are interested in running, which is very relevant and meaningful. This helps to expand the size of the Cardano ecosystem, and thanks to this interaction and connection, members can expand their relationships, thereby finding many development opportunities more developed. The solution proposed by the proponent I found identified the problem of this challenge, the Cardano Runners Community Hub activity is an online running event through the Uprace app which is a famous running app in Vietnam, after creating a hub in Vietnam, they plan to make the Cardano community globally. Thereby, the impact of the problem can be seen not only in Vietnam but also on a large scale throughout the world. To successfully implement the project, the proponent has anticipated the risks. There are 3 risks mentioned here that are The Uprace application could not afford a big scale of people joining the event, The runners committing fraud/ cheating during the event, risk of ADA price fluctuation.

I understand that for the younger generation, using high technology is not a complicated issue, but what about the elderly? My advice is that the team should have a specific solution for how the elderly can access and use technology applications very easily in the running program (create a new wallet, use a new wallet). and NFT)? How many NFTs do you plan to mint? When the demand for NFT suddenly increases, does the team have enough people to do it?

The proponent should have a specific goal of how long it will take to attract the minimum number of participants. If the number of participants has not been reached within the given time, what is the plan to increase the number? If the proponent adds this detail to the article, I believe the suggestion would be greatly appreciated. The proponent of promoting promotion through media channels and the internet is very reasonable, in line with the current trend. This helps people get to know the program faster and broader, making it easier to reach participants. The proponent also provides specific and reasonable marketing program costs. Organizing a project that attracts many participants is crucial to managing the fairness of the players, which is also a challenge that the team faces and needs a reasonable solution. I think the team needs to come up with some specific policies for players during the participation process and maybe add more rules and penalties if it detects players cheating. This helps participants feel trusted and fair, and it helps the project grow and grow. In addition, the proponent should have backup plans in case of system or network failure during the virtual exam. One more difficulty that proponents should pay attention to when organizing a virtual run is the time difference in time zones between countries during the competition. The project targets the participants who are old and new Cardano members, so I think the rewards for the winners, besides t-shirts, medals, and certificates, there will be ADA coins that will help excite players and also helps to expand Cardano community membership.
