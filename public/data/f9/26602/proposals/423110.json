Therefore, adding a marketing specialist member might tackle this part.\n\nAnother important point to verify a proposal impact is the scalability possibility.

This is the translation of the content from the official Cardano videos into Laotian for Laotian speakers in Laos and parts of Southeast Asia. According to data from Wikipedia at the link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_language, only about 7 million native speakers speak Laotian as their primary language. Out of these 7 million people, after excluding the elderly, the working class, the self-employed and the number of people who use Laotian as a secondary language... I think only a small number of people have needs left. Discover Cardano knowledge. With the above number of people, and the proponent does not have an audience to follow, I see this export only attracting a small number of users and does not contribute to the growth of Cardano, It is important that you take care of the community own, without care, the community will not have the need to learn. The Laotian-speaking community now mostly lives in Laos, and some countries like Thailand, Vietnam... according to data at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_people . Therefore, this proposal only addresses a small part of the East Asian development challenge setting, Cardano Development. Here is a list of the same five proposals, broken down by community of fund8 proponents: #420380, #423129, #417311, #423110, #421010", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Among the five proposals for translating IOHK documents into languages \u200b\u200binclude #420380 Sinhala language; #423129 Khmer language; #417311 Tamil language; #423110 Laotian language; #421010 Burmese language. Because the above proposals include copying and changing data, sometimes there are errors in the editing content, so in this section, I will give a general assessment of 5 articles: The proponent can do multiple languages \u200b\u200bat the same time thanks to 27 experiences translating and work with the above languages, I think he will do well. However, the problem here is that he does not have a community of his own; the Cardano knowledge educational material only works when the proponent has to take care of each day and answer for his community, primarily through video documents. I am a PA, I have no experience as a translator, but I can still hire people to translate the above languages \u200b\u200bby hiring staff on Fiverr. So why don't I do as the proponent since I don't have my community? Without it, I can't profit from Catalyst by creating materials without an audience. These are the proposals that have applied for funding at fund8 but have not been approved by fund9. The proponent also increased the funding amount from 7100$ to 11150$ without good reason, and I consider this an improper issue worth. The above proposals only need to change the data for each market. Still, the proponent has not edited it all, omitting many contents, making the content of the proposal somewhat unreasonable. I also have not checked the LanCardano youtube channel and have not seen the Videos of some document translation projects funded in the previous round of funding; this is a sign of slow progress. Each project has translators, and testers will be good for this project, but the risk here is that translators, and testers without in-depth knowledge of blockchain, will make incorrect documents. The proponent also mentioned the risk of Covid variants, but right now, covid is no longer a concern of the whole world; this can only be a recommendation written from fund8 when Covid was still raging; through Fund9 the proponent just applied for funding without modifying it. By doing this, I judge the proponent for being lazy right from the start of the fundraising plan.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As mentioned above, since there are five customized recommendations, in this section, I will evaluate all suggestions #420380, #423129, #417311, #423110, and #421010.

This proposal has reasonable KPIs, and the set goals are within reach. However, the most important thing is that I can't find a Youtube channel to check.

While total population of   of Laotian people may live in Laos, Most of them dont speak English fluently and nowhere close to what Cardano videos or documentation is written in. Both these are written for Western educated people with primary language being English, often tech oriented or experienced. \n\nI quote \" Out of these people, after excluding the elderly, working class and self-employed... I think only a few have the need to acquire Cardano knowledge education.\"  \n\nALso I must mention this PA is using the exact same wording for all his Assessments with no logic.  On what basis does he presume that all Laotians know English, and those who dont are not worthy of consideration?\n\nIs this PA Elitist, Classist, Racist or just Ignorant?\n\nHe/she seems to believe that the elderly , working vlass, and self employed have no need for Cardano education. I am curious  whom he thinks does need Cardano?  Only techies, English speakers and devs? This person is yet another of the group of PAs who overstepped their boundaries last time and again went against the scope of their mandate. They dont like the idea so they slam the proposal. This is explicltly forbidden in the PA guide. and the previous CA guide.

To build the community one must first have content in their language.  One cannot build a community by using existing material in English when they dont understand English. This Assessor is sadly mistaken.\n\nprimarily through video documents. I am a PA, I have no experience as a translator, but I can still hire people to translate the above languages \u200b\u200bby hiring staff on Fiverr. \n\nIf one could get work done through Fiverr   , one can surely find develoeprs, graphic artists, translators of some sort, , marketers and even Proposal assessors who would charge a lot less to do than Catalyst is paying this asssessor.  So why doesnt Catalyst simply hire people off FiveRR?  because Catalyst knows, and the assessor knows very well that the quality expected cannot be delivered by Fiverr.  Therefore this argument is not only false but biased as its intended to give voters a negative impression\n\n\"So why don't I do as the proponent since I don't have my community? Without it, I can't profit from Catalyst by creating materials without an audience. \"\n\nIs the asssssor implying i am trying to profit from Catalyst?  As said earlier audience is built first from creating relevant materials in their comfortable and preferred language. Something the Assessor fails to understand.\nI invite the assessor to take his own country content, and get Fiverr translators to do it..\n\n\nThese are the proposals that have applied for funding at fund8 but have not been approved by fund9. The proponent also increased the funding amount from 7100$ to 11150$ without good reason, and I consider this an improper issue worth. \n\nTheres nothing improper about it. We have brought in a video expert as part of the team. Those costs are why the increase in cost.  When the cost was 7100$ this same assessor found fault. Now again he is finding fault. Some people have internal biases and seek to find fault no matter what flinsy excuses they have to find.. using flawed logic.\n\nin the Auditability, again he talks about Fiverr. Has he any idea whether qualified or experienced translators are going to give their work for 5 USD?  I question the justification for allowing assessors like this to asess proposals. It takes valuable time from proposers to type out rationale why he should be not only filtered out of this assessment but banned from assessing proposals.  He seems to have no sense of what is important and what constutes professional work and rates. As for the Youtube channel it hasnt been put yet.  Our timeframe is on track.  His expectation of having a fully functional channel is absurd since we are still in production phase.
