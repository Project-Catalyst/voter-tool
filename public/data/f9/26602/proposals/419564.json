Another advantage will be gathered when multiple notaries are joined into an ecosystem for the digitisation and management of legal agreements as it will create benefit greater than the sum of the individual parts through network effect.  So, the Proposer demonstrate that they know what exactly would be done and how it could be monitored. With their DAOs, which would also reflect on costs, by disseminating unnecessary expenses out of the way. In this way, the objectives of the challenge should certainly be achieved, because what Proposer are looking for here are ways to introduce many users to Cardano for a use case that will create significant benefit and utility.\n\nTherefore, this would be directly contributing for the community to be able to more securely audit one of its parts, and it is fully in line with what is sought in this challenge. It's good that we are able to identify how this proposal not only able to scale and address the future challenges but also provide the solution plan. I think this proposal also clear on the key metric and goals that will have significant impact to Cardano in the following excerpt: \u201cThere are many 1000s of notaries across Indonesia that serve millions of clients for the creation and management of contracts. Population of Indonesia is 270 million + Every contract that is created and stored on the Cardano blockchain leads to increased adoption and usage of the Cardano blockchain + With DAO and tokenomics, there will be wallets required for each user participating in the ecosystem\u201d. So, I think that in terms of impact, this proposal deserves top marks. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the project describes the resources necessary to implement the proposal. All the information we needed to know is passed on detailed timeline and project stage overview. The activities that would take place within the time span of 140 days are stated. This gives us a solid understanding of the development of the project, both because these activities are described in an detailed way, and with that it is break downed\n\nThe Proposer explains what would happen on project stage overview to a smaller scale, from Design until pilot project. We also can see that there is kind of temporal organization to be restructured and with that we would have a clear view of deadlines, and also for each of these activities are detailed. In regard to budget, I think that a high amount is requested, 50k, and it is not justified so well because it would be necessary. It would be better to understand why stage design would require 24k, why does it need for build? this is in order to know how much effort would be put into it and understand beyond the complexity of the tasks its extent. That way, we would also have a better idea of whether the asking price is fair or not. It would be necessary to explain the need for so much funding for this part. For example, what costs would be assigned for launch?  \n\nI also found that Proposer expect that they will be able to demonstrate the proof of concept to the regulators and that they agree it can be deployed nationally. How Proposer will convince the regulator on project that involving one notary is should be able to be detailed here. Also, the Proposer only put 20 days for getting the regulatory approval, I would suggest to put more period for this as this will also measure as the KPI of the project.\n\nFor details of the people who will work on the project, as far as the team is concerned, Proposer has put this in detail of team member along with detailed curriculum attached for each one, they are told in direct ways what they do professionally and what roles each of them would play for the execution of this project. In addition, Proposer proves the information given, such as a linkedin profile for everyone. Therefore, I think that everything that is informed here is detailed only at certain part that need for more attention, so that the feasibility will deserve for high rating", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Regarding the development process, the Proposer provide detail of the measurement of project progress and associated criteria for these two phases of design+build+test and pilot. And Proposer provides the whole will be done on time, by the right people and in the way as Proposer were promised. For this I think it is very detailed roadmap is present in the proposal, and therefore we have a basis for knowing what to look at to verify if things are right or not.\n\nOne of the ways of auditing progress suggested by the Proposer is \"Customer adoption - high customer acceptance proven at one notary. The notary agrees that there is sufficient benefit to adopt the solution for all contracts going forward.\".  I think in terms of the process, we have good ways of monitoring the project, and if this is established properly, I don't think I have anything to complain about monitoring the development phases. However, Proposer does not mention the target numbers of the expected customer that will be agree on migrating storing paper original contract copies in safes to storing digital contracts on Cardano blockchain. I found the suggestion given by the Proposer to be very superficial, the proposer should provide more detail on this to the understandable description. \n\nAgain, as i have suggested earlier for getting the regulatory approval as one of the key successes of the proposal. The Proposer should revisit the roadmap along with the time horizon for achievement. Other than that, we need to know if the audit that was made available for DAO management structure with tokenomics economy validated with notary, for this, it would be necessary to establish direct contact with the DAOs, develop a kind of questionnaire or guidance to understand how this audit is being used by them so notary will have clear picture on validating process as the notary may have their own term and condition or procedure on which to be aligned. With that, I think it is quite possible to audit the proposal properly and completely, but unfortunately, in the way suggested by the proposer, this monitoring would have a very superficial nature and would not be enough to convey confidence in relation to the final results.

I would like to see this project again in the next Foundation if this proposal is not Funded in this Fund. The management of documents, contracts, certificates, certifications, .. of centralized organizations such as state agencies, notary offices, .. is an eternal problem of mankind, when there is a problem. fire, accident, natural disaster, tsunami, all will be lost or misplaced. And this is a global problem, especially in underdeveloped and developing countries like Asia and Africa.\n\nThe solution of this idea is good, it identifies some of the problems of the challenge, in addition, the author of this idea argues in a logical, neat, and creative way. The application of the Cardano Blockchain to digitize and move the storage of native contracts is a solution of the times, providing convenience, security, transparency, and uniqueness. With electronic contracts and electronic seals through ChainSmart to replace physical and centralized storage, this is a high-impact solution.\n\nVery good, the idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal has detailed many risks that the project will face in implementation, but the author only gives some risks, the feasibility of the proposal will be good. then if there were more solutions to all the risks the author put forward, the risk management of the community project would become easier and clearer.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Great when a project provides a clear, logical amount of timetable information for implementation and completion. The goals that the project is aiming for are also very specific and completely achievable.

Looks like the author made a detailed set using Microsoft Excel (or something like that) but the file is not public for viewing and verification, hope the author considers it and makes the file public for all to see. see better.\n\nThe feasibility of this project is quite good when the human resources to implement this project have been assigned specific jobs for each item, and the experience of the members shows that it is completely suitable for the project.

Lower costs, higher transparency and more inclusiveness are all well-known benefits of distributed ledger technology for legal services. This proposal aims to create a proof-of-concept in Indonesia using a single notary office in Jakarta. The ambitious part of this proposal lies in creating a DAO that can reward future participation by other notary offices through token issuance. While it may impede feasibility, I think it is good to focus on scalability and the long-term business model for impact. Unfortunately, very little explanation is provided how this proof-of-concept aims to address Indonesian business culture and Bahasa Indonesia language, the volatility and exchange restrictions of the Rupiah, local laws regulating cryptocurrencies or the idiosyncracies of the local legal system. \n\nBenefits of the blockchain are described in detail, but remain very general without addressing the paricular merit in using Cardano, the eUTxO model or Plutus. The proposers could make this proposal more appealing and impactful by narrowing down the focus on a certain area of law, such as business law - where the Marlowe Domain Specific Language might be useful, or NGOs, where Cardano is strong and has existing projects in Indonesia, or any other field (marriage, property etc) where the proposers demonstrate credible contacts and domain knowledge.

It stands out for the critical discussion of obstacles and the amount of thought that has gone into overcoming them. The proposal presents a budget broken down into items shared between the three implementing parties, Chainsmart, Digisign and the notary office. A project stage overview over eight months is presented giving the impression of a well thought-out implementation plan. On the flipside, the proposal lacks evidence of any \u201con the ground\u201d preliminary research or demonstration of deep domain knowledge in either legal consulting or Cardano smart contract programming necessary to carry out the task. The team have been involved in blockchain services in Indonesia since 2021 and claim to be working with Universitas Sam Ratulangi in Manado for academic record keeping on the blockchain. Their website is only in English, with no Bahasa version available as of the time of assessment. The notary's website was down while I wrote this assessment.

The idea is to make all contracts publicly verifiable but the backup plans include storing sensitive documents in a private server but making the digital signature publicly verifiable. In case of legal issues, they plan on building a layer 2 private permission-based blockchain on Cardano. To incentivize the onboarding of notaries, they plan on developing a notary DAO with token-based incentives. This is an extremely ambitious project with tremendous potential.

It is recommended to provide evidence on what is required for the notarization of a contract in Indonesia, there are multinational PAs here, so we may not understand the law on contract signing in Indonesia. Based on the information proposed provided, it means that a signed contract will have the notarization of the terms between the two parties and the notaries, I have a question, how many notaries are there? licensed to practice in Indonesia and if the signed contracts are converted to the blockchain, have the relevant legal documents been licensed by the Indonesian state? For example, land purchase and sale documents need to have the state's carpentry stamp, how will the project be put on the blockchain, or currently the contracts signed are only at the level of businesses, the contract of purchase documents sell,...\n\nThe creation of benefits for individual notaries and clients is out of the question as the offer is also quite clear, but the tokenomics rewards here need to be more explicit.

In the Design and requirements complete and agreed stage, the proposal needs to describe this activity in detail, I did not identify this stage as an evolution of Chainsmart while Section 2 Design already has related activities. Section 4 What are Build, Unit test and Integration testing, they should be specifically listed, what role do these 2 tests play in the ChainSmart process, etc.\n\nHere, as shown in the picture, it is 8 months, but each activity is smaller, so there should be a corresponding timeline so that we can check the progress as well as determine if with the same amount of time and work.

One strategy is by incentivising the users (notaries) to get more participation. For doing this, the team behind the proposal surely will need more resources in the team as this will require more advanced technologies and working hours. The integration of token utilisations and smart-contract-integrated applications in my opinion will be how this incentive works.\n\nAnother interesting strategy to mitigate the risk presented in the proposal is by creating a layer 2 on top of Cardano blockchain to be used only for this project.

Even better.\n\nin terms of impact, its clearly described as well in the proposal that they have to achieve critical mass in order to see a sizable impact for the project. just like 1 phone in the  world means nothing, its only helpful if everyone you want to contact actually has a phone. it is also the biggest risk identified by the proposer themselves. however, i think that if the team can deliver the dapp, the value this can bring to the cardano blockchain will be tremendous. something along the scale of digital IDs in Africa, in my opinion.\n\nwhile this proposal could have very well sit in the dapp, products, and integrations challenge, i think that the proposer's proof of concept focus in the indonesia market is a smart one. to start off small, and if it works, to only take off from there. the proposers even addressed the risk that regulators might not be comfortable having indonesian contracts on a public blockchain, and i enjoyed the fact that their mitigation plan is simple and clearly achievable if the need arises.\n\noverall, i must say that this section, in this proposal, is well written. considering the complexities of the idea, and the risks involved, the team manged to pen everything down in the most concise manner and paint a vision of where they are headed in the longer term, aligned to catalyst's goals as well. \n\nmy only comment for improvement to them team would be to state why indonesia needs this solution right now, and perhaps add some stats, so that readers can imagient the size of impact this might bring. it is acknowledged that the team put \"There are many 1000s of notaries across Indonesia that serve millions of clients for the creation and management of contracts. Population of Indonesia is 270 million.\" - but what would help here is how many of them are businesses/individuals and which segment do they wish to target? if businesses, which industry would be in a dire need for such a solution (perhaps will writing), and would that be their key focus? that will help to scope down and narrow the focus for the team better as a proof of concept.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "for feasiblity, the timeline at this stage of the project, I would say is sufficient to paint a picture of the future months for the team.

This project will make digital contracts based on Cardano that will be implemented on a notary in Indonesia as a proof-of-concept. I think the issue brought up in this proposal is a really relevant way to utilize blockchain technology since blockchains have several advantages over traditional paper contracts (i.e. not easily altered or lost, easily trackable, more scalable, etc.). Additionally, if this initial project proves to be successful as a proof-of-concept, it can be scaled further towards a wider blockchain network.

This proposal posed the problem of matching the challenge in one respect. It will solve one aspect of the challenge, which is to develop the Cardano ecosystem in Indonesia\u2014a country in Asia. Paying a compliment to the very practical proposal, the proposal brings Cardano closer to the Indonesian people because any individual or business always needs to use contracts in business or personal transactions. Creating an alternative to storing copies of these original contracts optimizes storage. Replace the centralized storage method with a decentralized data storage method. Secure and permanent decentralized storage on the blockchain in digital format, original copies of executed contracts. This will encourage people to use this tool more and come closer to Cardano. The Cardano community in Indonesia will be developed. Therefore, it can be seen that this proposal is fully scalable in the future, possibly expanding to countries in Asia. The proposal is quite clever. The contract can be accessed and viewed online at any time by authorized parties, including but not limited to notaries, signatories, and interested parties. Blockchain is the platform for tracing and tracking the contract life cycle from initiation, through execution, to renewal and termination. To carry out the contract, use an electronic signature, an electronic seal, and an Indonesian tax stamp (meterai). Smart execution of contract terms triggered by events Perform a renewal or smart termination. It can be seen that the solution has solved the problems and difficulties faced by most of the contracts currently being archived on paper. The proposal has given 3 risks and solutions for them. I quite agree with risk management and their solutions. However, the proposal may still face some risks: 1/Security risks: for important security contracts, there is no plan to protect the confidentiality of these contracts. Notaries or anyone who can infiltrate the data can completely steal the data and sell it out for any purpose, revealing transaction information, subject information, 2/Risk of cost: Does the contract holder have to pay extra for decentralized storage? If so, how much do they have to pay? Why does the proposal only offer decentralized storage for a copy of the contract instead of the original? Can we replace manual storage of the original contract? Changing people's transaction habits, switching from using conventional contracts to smart contracts, and storing them in a decentralized way. I appreciate the impact this proposal has on the Cardano Indonesian community and the future of the Asian Cardano community, but this proposal needs to address some of the above questions.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "They have a detailed execution plan, which is a plus.

Phase 2: Measure pilot progress based on 4 identified key success criteria: 1/Technical-no technical buttons. Notaries agree that the solution is a suitable alternative to keeping contracts on paper. 2/Client acceptance\u2014high client acceptance demonstrated at a notary. The notary agrees that there is sufficient interest to apply the solution to all future contracts. 3/Confirmed DAO management structure with tokenomics economy.

In terms of budget, the proposed fundraising budget is $50,100, which is more than 20% of the total challenge. This is a pretty high number.

All members have professional qualifications relevant to the job. Some other comments The proposal has not yet provided the legal basis or the provisions of Indonesian law on being able to use the decentralized storage method. In the event that the law does not allow or recognize the backups/amendments to the contract, what is the backup plan? Besides, according to the law of Indonesia and most other countries in Asia, not all contracts are required to be notarized. Therefore, the project completely expands the scope of cooperation with other businesses, organizations, and individuals to diversify the audience using decentralized storage methods and smart contracts. This is a viable project. They can develop this proposal well. However, I am concerned about their funding budget, which is quite high and not well explained. So I rate the feasibility as 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In terms of transparency, their proposal only sets out the goal of completing the design and building the foundation engine. Unfortunately, they have not provided specific metrics on the target notary offices/notaries who will sign cooperation contracts. Building a platform where everyone can easily check the results. The check on the number of notaries cooperating and the number of contracts stored should be made public. The project should publicize the list of the notaries and notaries public to demonstrate the successful outcome of the project. Create more trust and attract more users. The project will be successful when it connects a large network of notaries in Indonesia. We will know this by measuring four specific criteria during the pilot process: 1/Number of Notaries who agree to cooperate, converting the entire manual storage method to decentralized storage on the Cardano platform. 2/Client acceptance and satisfaction: the notary agrees that there is sufficient interest to apply the solution to all future contracts. 3/The DAO management structure with tokenomics economy is confirmed with notaries so that they agree that they will benefit from adding more notaries to the blockchain. 4/The management agencies agree for the project to be deployed nationwide. The success of the project will have a positive influence on the challenge. This is an important step forward, changing the mindset and habits of manual contract storage to decentralized storage on the Cardano platform. Cardano's technology platforms will create opportunities for notaries and users to interact with Cardano's technology platforms, promoting security and transparency in transactions. Bringing the people of Indonesia and the future of Asia closer to the benefits of Cardano. However, this is a new proposition and they have never had a test product before.
