The proposed problem is suitable for the challenge, the idea is to provide quality knowledge to the Asian community about the Cardano ecosystem. With the rapidly growing Asian Community demanding that Cardano materials and news be presented in a more reliable, understandable and effective manner in local Asian languages, it is recommended that make it easy and fast for everyone to find quality information related to the ecosystem. Please present the problem clearly and convincingly. It offered solutions to a problem in the growth of the Cardano community, the growth of the Asian community. The specific solution of the proposal is that they build Cardano Asia's TikTok channel focusing on optimizing quality, reliability and interesting content for the community. Reliable source of information, timely updates, and interesting formatting/adding visual effects in short form TikTok will shorten search and crawl time for the Asian community. The team proposes to give specific examples in the presentation with arguments with specific, feasible, and highly effective numbers. It shows that the proposed team has studied very carefully and in detail the needs of the Asian community to answer the question: How can Asians learn important information in limited time and selectively related to Cadarno?. The specific goal of the product you recommend is: Knowledge of Blockchain and Cardano but optimizing the quality, reliability and interesting content for the community to make it easier to access via the topic's tiktok channel established. The proposal identified a number of risks in the implementation process and proposed solutions to overcome all those risks. You have pointed out three risks in the process of doing work and have solutions to overcome and limit those risks. In the first risk, Slippage of ADA because sometimes, ADA price drops suddenly, you cannot sell ADA for USD or VND in the exchange. This may leave you with insufficient budget to reward relevant admins/stakeholders and the solution is to Request Additional Budget ($1,680) to cover this slippage. On the second risk, the problem of local interpreters in Japan/Korea, especially in the future stages of opening up to more languages, then the team proposes a solution that has been planned. plans to recruit new Japanese/Korean talents for future fund proposals. Language group (this would be like a Youtube Short Functions Playlist). The last risk you mentioned is outdated information versus up-to-date trends, and the way you can overcome this risk is the Mitigate solution: scheduling workflows between FIMI admins and the core group of admins by Cardano Asia. However, I have suggestions for the team on solutions to overcome and limit the risks that you have pointed out. In the first risk, you only deal clearly but I would like you to explain more clearly why choose the figure of 1680 USD as an additional budget?; At the second risk, you need to come up with a long-term solution, specialize more or hire people who are able to update and produce informative videos that are not slow, outdated compared to the trend.

The effects are interesting, the image in 1 minute is enough to convey the necessary information. Information about Cardano from the originals will be translated and selected the appropriate content to give viewers the knowledge at random without constraints. The solution is in line with the problems presented, TikTok Asia directly impacts the Cardano community, attracting news updates, tracking the development of Cardano through videos. TikTok users have a different view of Cardano when watching videos that have attracted more developers to join the ecosystem. Contributing comments to the proposal, I look forward to the proposal to be able to link TikTok Asia channel with other social networking platforms. TikTok allows users to make links to platforms: Instagram, Twitter, Facebook. The implementation of multi-social networking links will help TikTok Asia channel impact more Cardano participants. The proposal presents 3 risks and has appropriate risk mitigation solutions. The most important thing that we see is the origin of the original video that was compiled and uploaded to TikTok, a large number of videos that have been translated and posted on YouTube of the project made by the Fimi team at F7, which has a link https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/385088 .

The goal is to make 210 videos full of Cardano/Blockchain-related content. I have an opinion on the videos posted, need to add a link to the original video so that viewers are more interested in the full content.

This is difficult content that requires the creation of videos in a way that is easy to understand and attractive to viewers. But you already had 03 months in the previous phase. So, in phase 02, your skills will be improved and you will be able to create videos with a high level of expertise but still attractive to viewers. The implementation plan of the proposal is completely reasonable and convincing to me.\n\nThe budget for the proposal is $16800 for 210 videos, the amount for each video is described specifically for each type of content that the video wants to convey. In my opinion, this cost is reasonable for the size of the proposal.\n\nAbout the members participating in the project, there are 07 members and a Fimi community. All members have experience building community, especially Blockchain and cryptocurrency-related communities on Youtube, Facebook, and Telegram. Therefore, I believe that project will successfully build the Tiktok Cardano Asia channel.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "To evaluate the success of a Tiktok channel, the basic indicators we must have are the number of videos, the number of followers, the number of views, and the number of hearts.

The proposal is also taking onto consideration some risks that could happen during the project, I am just asking why is not possible for you to transfer ADA into USDT, more explanation on this would be great since you ask for $1680 more.

This is a way of introducing blockchain and crypto Cardano to all citizens of Vietnam, Japan, Korea, and foreigners who know the above languages, the construction of the Tik Tok channel makes everyone excited and More interesting (especially the younger generation) when accessing Cardano-related knowledge and videos from the Cardano Foundation (which is not easy to understand). I know Fund 9 will propose Vietnamese, Japanese, and Korean Tik Tok, which will be done after applying for funding in the next Funds, which is a gradual expansion. When people in the 3 countries above have a clear understanding of Cardano-related knowledge, they will have ideas and thoughts to apply knowledge to improve real life, which is the way to solve the challenge. future knowledge of the proposal.

The team has been active for a long time and has a certain influence on the activities of the Cardano Vietnam community. What I strongly agree with is the publicity of the link and website to the community. It increases the community's credibility and trust in the team and the feasibility of this project. Team members are all experienced in their respective fields of expertise (as stated in the proposal). It is a guarantee of the feasibility of the proposal when applied in practice. However, from the perspective of a newbie who doesn't know anything about the team, I still advise the team to publicize their member's identity more by linking to social networks like Linkedin, Facebook, etc... There are already some members who do that but the other members haven't. If all members (including the consulting team) made their public identities through a link to social networks, the trust in the team would be greatly enhanced. The budget is reasonably divided into the goal, and the stages to make Tik Tok videos, which are very familiar jobs for the team. I think the community will believe it when they see the team working by their professional forte for so long. I have a budget question, if we haven't received Catalyst funding in Fund 9, will the team continue to work on the proposal? Or are there other sources of funding to implement this proposal? The plan, as well as the implementation method, has been fully stated in the proposal. Along with the resources needed to perform, the human resources seem adequate because of the team of collaborators working together. However, I learned that some members of the team are also involved in the implementation of other proposals in this Fund 9. Will that make the quality of work, and the progress of this proposal reduced? Please take note of this to strengthen the trust and feasibility of the proposal for the community. On the other hand, how should we make Tik Tok videos that are inherently knowledgeable and difficult to understand become receptive to everyone? And how do these videos stand out from other Tik Tok videos on the subject of Cardano? I know the team wants to make the information interesting and the Tik Tok videos more engaging. I advise the team to promote more marketing and communication activities so that more and more people know about Tik Tok made by the team (increasing competition). This is also consistent with the forte of some members specializing in communication. These questions and suggestions are for inquiry and constructive feedback.

This is precise because the videos and clips are the product of the team's many months of work. Based on that, the success of the proposal can be assessed. I find the proposal very practical, very necessary to disseminate knowledge, improve people's knowledge and be able to implement, easy to come to life. You also include key metrics, which is great for the transparency of this proposal. During the whole process, the problem was clearly described, easy to understand, and accompanied by a solution.
