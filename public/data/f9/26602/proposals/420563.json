Ultimately, the team intends to scale up the growth of the Cardano Network via this partnership and eventually allow musicians to exploit their potentials and also bring their fan bases into the community. Will this help grow Cardano and grow Asia? One key objective of the grow Cardano and grow Asia challenge setting is to increase participation within the Asia community. In that regard, I think the Objective of this project is well aligned with the criteria of the challenge setting.

The proposal does clearly outline the problem that we not only need to grow Cardano in East Asia, but can do so by onboarding musicians into the Ecosystem. We are already lacking a large music community on the Cardano blockchain. Thus growing the Cardano Community in east Asia would not only bring more people into Cardano, but also grow the music industry as well. With this in mind, the proposal does correctly address this challenge in a highly efficient way. The plan clearly indicates how the proposal will not only bring artists into the Cardano Ecosystem, but also support them to make sure they are successful; this will ensure that not only are more people coming into the Cardano ecosystem, they are also staying within the Ecosystem. I find the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges, The impact of onboarding musicians from East Asia goes beyond that of the artists themselves, this will also get the listeners and fans of these musicians interested in Cardano as well. The proposal could do better to articulate how it plans to stay sustainable so that the project not only is successfully implemented, but continues to operate over the years to come. My suggestion here would be to clearly outline the business model so the readers can make an informed decision over the sustainability of the proposed plan; no information is listed about pay rates for the team or exactly how the project will generate an income, this should also be communicated in some form so the reader has more information at their disposal to make an informed decision.

Further examining the project, I concluded the proposer has taken into account the appropriate team size as well as type of team members needed for this proposal to be implemented effectively. The team has relevant experience in the NFT industry, coding, which will be needed to onboard musicians into the Cardano Ecosystem through Music NFT projects, as well as team members that have experience directly onboarding and supporting artists outside of blockchain.  Previous experience is listed for all members of the proposal team, however not every member has a link that provides evidence. My suggestion here would be to make sure there are links to the CVs or Linkedin profiles for all members.

The royalty paid through musical NFT sold on a smart contract integrated marketplace offers a solution in this respect.\n\nFurthermore, the ability for Indonesian musicians to mint and market their musical NFT on a smart contract based marketplace will also bring Cardano to the next level of mass adoption in a country with a population of 275 million.\n\nI also noticed that this project has appointed several prominent figures as Ambassadors to Indonesia. These well known artists from various genres with profound organizational backgrounds would be the main factor in creating a bigger impact for they all have solid fan bases from various demography, thus this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\n\nAs the beginning of mass adoption, this is a great way to spread the word of how Cardano NFT can be used in a broader spectrum of utilities. In the future, the key metrics should pivot from having numbers of onboarded artists to numbers of platform users.\n\nNevertheless, I would like to take a few notes here as currently there are several competitors building quite similar music platforms on Cardano.\nThe first thing is that this proposed music platform should implement a user-friendly UI/UX that will allow more users to get onboard.

The first question is, why is the project aiming to have 5 East Asian musicians onboard at the point of launching the site? Are these musicians going to be endorsed by and to promote the platform? I have these questions because in my opinion, the key metric should be on how many varieties or genres of musical NFTs are being listed on the platform and the number of active wallets interacting with the platform, not merely by how many artists are being onboard.\n\nNow for the outline of the budget. Another question raised: Why are there still allocations in this proposal for (1) front-end design work (3 months) for $10,000, that is to update SoundRig.io to include Indonesian language support, and (2) back-end work  (3 months) for $10,000? In my opinion, this should be done along with all front-end and back-end work as a whole, not exclusively on Indonesian site pages.

Risks like getting famous musicians to come on board, and to gather a sizable customer base, and of course, to fund their work till they reach critical mass.
