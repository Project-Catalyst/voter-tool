The main obstacle in achieving this is the language barrier that non-English speaking people face in reading the different documents related to Catalyst as the material is in English language. \nThe proposal is trying to create a platform to translate Catalyst documents & proposals to various languages of the East Asia region. The objective is to first translate the existing Project Catalyst Fund series content into local language of the communities represented in Eastern Town Hall and later on it will be expanded to translate various existing Cardano and Catalyst material to these languages. The material will be converted using a semi-automated system which will include translating the material using a machine and then having it worked on by a multi-linguistic expert who will review it. This will make available a vide variety of Catalyst and Cardano related material to the communities in East Asia region and it will result in creation of a strong community of Catalyst participants who were not earlier able to participate in this governance initiative. This fulfills the objectives of this challenge and will help  have a well diversified and well representative Catalyst.\nOnly problem I see here is that they are translating the content in the local language of the communities represented in Eastern Town Hall only, but there are many other languages which are not yet represented in the Eastern Town Hall and they will be left out from this initiative. But as the mid term goal of the project is to expand it to other languages as well so I am hopeful that most of the popular languages of East Asian region will be covered by this initiative one day.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project, among other things, broadly includes maintaining the translation material for GitHub and GitLocalize, managing communication and uploading periodic content to instagram and Twitter and maintaining and updating translated content to the East Town Hall website. This translated content will be marketted to a wider community, in and outside of Cardano by collaborating with communities/business entities that would benefit from having this type of service. The team consists of more than 10 members and many of them have experience as Cardano Ambassadors, memebers of Catalyst Swarm, veteran community advisors (now called vPAs) and many of them are stake pool operators from East Asia region. The team is requesting for funds of $17000  and looking at the breakup of the budget it looks quite reasonable. All these facts show that the project is feasible to complete and will be very impactful.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Translated content and material uploaded to GitHub and GitLocalize, can be monitored directly on these wesites in real time. Similarly regular updates posted in local languags on instagram and Twitter can also be verified publically to track the progress being made by the team. All the translated content of Catalyst and Cardano is being uploaded to the East Town Hall website https://easterntownhall.com which is free to use for anyone. Updates are also  being provided in the  Eastern town hall meeting being conducted regularly. All this shows that monitoring and eventually auditing the project is relatively easy task as the required data and information is freely available in the public domain.\n\nIn the end I would add that they have described their long term goal as \"having a  decentralized workflow for translation and interpretation of any document, video, podcast etc., using the Cardano Network as the coordinating backbone.\" And with these words, I wish them all the best.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2312", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3819, "q0": "The proposal states problem that East Asia has underrepresented in Catalyst due to a lack of localized content and Town Hall participation.

So by this proposal, the language barrier is reduced and more individuals from those countries will start to understand what duties Cardano and Project Catalyst.

Their answer is to establish up a translation pipeline in East Asia so that proposals and documents may be translated into a number of different languages. A straightforward approach based on Git, GitLocalize, and GitHub Actions was also put to the test. The team said that they had conducted trials of the process of semi-automatic translation in a number of nations, and that the outcomes had been deemed to be fairly successful. Aside from that, they also present certain concerns, such as the challenge of designing a system that strikes a balance between the level of community engagement, the quality of the translation, and the rate of translation. This is a solution that makes sense to me and is practical.

I am from east asia myself as well and i understand the difficulties of the local, non-native english speakers in my region.
