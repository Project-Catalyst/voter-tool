This is a very good opportunity, and by offering them a hub through platforms such as Facebook, Discord, and Youtube, the proposer aims to provide basic knowledge to the Vietnamese community to get them onboard. That being said, I am a bit disappointed that the proposer has not explicitly mentioned the insights they gained during the previous four months of operation. What can be improved, what can be changed, and how can they engage with the community better? This is very important to analyze and explain because this proposal is targeting 62x their Facebook group size (from 161 to 10,000 members) and 17x their Discord server size (from 118 to 2000 members), so their feedback is crucial in order to successfully reach this huge target.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "When it comes to feasibility, the proposed implementation plan is provided with enough details except in the budget section.

I applaud the proposer\u2019s initiative on elaborating the milestones within their timetable and planning the requested budget based on those milestones. The budget item that revolves around article creation, Youtube video production, and community management is reasonable. However, the marketing campaign might need a lot more justification. Since the proposal\u2019s target is very high, the three marketing campaigns would be vital to the success of the project. As a result, it would be advantageous if the proposer explained that aspect in greater detail, such as what type of medium they would use to promote it and to whom they would market it. As of now, the \"how\" regarding their marketing campaigns is still vague. I am sure the proposer has some ideas on how to implement it, but I want to heavily emphasize it since the current market situation is bearish, so it is going to be harder to find new members. Another thing that could be improved is the miscellaneous and contingency costs. 1000 USD might be excessive. I would advise the proposer to exhaustively list all their non-fundamental project-related needs, such as the internet data, buffer for ADA fluctuation, etc. It\u2019s going to look more defendable if the budget section is filled with a list of those needs instead of one huge miscellaneous item.

We could easily monitor these numbers, but it\u2019s odd that the proposer targets those numbers after the sixth month because the marketing campaigns only last for three months.
