At the problem statement it occurs that there is an essential need of investment for Vietnamese local/village businesses to authentically prove their products. Following that they stated \u201cproduct-traceability infrastructure using Cardano metadata\u201d which is a good point of addressing the challenge hence the project will be done relying on Vietnam information, this is also relating to the problem of supply chain that could be enhanced by optimizing the use of Blockchain technology (in this proposal it\u2019s implemented QR Codes).

However as PA will proceed the fact that $39600 will be a considerably high budget (not mentioning about the budget break down section yet) for a micro project to support a small community of craftsman, farmer, there should be an explainable vision of how this small case of the project could be done in a more macro size through the integration of Blockchain. The proposer should also make a noteworthy point of how the proposed solution would impact the angle of sustainability more clearly.

As it could be seen, they have very detailed location, variety of products which are rich in cultural and medical value. When it comes to milestones, the proposal is broken down into months of execution, but as their project tends to follow a sequential process there are several types of risks that they need to deal with. The listed risk management are \u201cInternational travel risks, operational risks, technical risks\u201d, from PA perspective the proposer has carefully managed to deal with these risks through backup plans and building consensus with the local people. One additional point that would scale up the project in terms of Data Management was how decentralized the gathered data is, how they\u2019ll deal with the human erroneous factors during the collection process (since the locals are also involved). If the project could demonstrate the said suggestion the decentralization characteristics would be a foundational point for traceability.

I support your project.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3216", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11785, "q0": "Quite clearly, \u201cLotus Link: Eco-Farm Traceability\u201d is a good idea, closely linked to the challenge setting. I appreciate the practical application of this idea because it has brought blockchain into agriculture - one of the vital areas of my country, Vietnam. The solution given by the authors is to use Cardano's blockchain metadata to deploy a database, and generate QR codes to help trace the origin of agricultural products and the cultural heritage of the Cham ethnic people in Vietnam. This QR code will contain historical, cultural, and quality assurance information. All of this data will be recorded on the blockchain and presented in a simple, visually accessible web3 format. The purpose of the solution is, to bring blockchain to life and raise awareness about Cardano and blockchain in the local community in Vietnam. In Vietnam, the application of technology in agricultural production is currently very interested and given special priority by the Government. In particular, the issue of traceability of agricultural products is gradually becoming one of the mandatory requirements to meet circulation and export standards. However, one of the leading difficulties in traceability is the lack of a complete database (who, where, when, and accompanying quality standards..). The authenticity of applications and traceability software is currently relatively low. Therefore, this solution opens up a great opportunity for Cardano to penetrate deeply and reach the Vietnamese community, thanks to its high applicability and timely response to the concerns of Vietnam's agricultural industry. Although this solution's impact scope is only in a small geographical area - selected by the group is Sen Caraih farm, located in Ninh Thuan province, Vietnam. However, I believe that if approved by the community, this solution will open the door for Cardano to penetrate deeply and widely into the agricultural and heritage sectors across Vietnam. In Vietnam, each locality has a number of unique agricultural products and outstanding cultural heritage. This is a huge database that can be collected and stored on Cardano's blockchain infrastructure. However, regarding the risk of preventing success, the team considered three main risks: frequent international travel (because the project owner lives in the US), the risk of delay in data collection data, and technical risks due to unforeseen loss of life in rural areas. Personally, I think another risk to take into account is that the depreciation of the ADA coin in the bear market can affect the project budget. Therefore, the group needs to set up a reserve fund of 10-15% of the total budget. Overall, I appreciate the solution information given directly, clearly, and specifically by the team. My score is 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project implementation process and budget were also presented in a very detailed and transparent manner by the team. The implementation plan is expected by the group in 7 months (from October 2022 to April 2023). In which, the data collection (product name, properties, origin, production process...) will be completed in 3 months. The full database will be completed in the 5th month. After that, complete the QR code and start advertising communication. Vietnamese and English languages will be used simultaneously in the database construction process. Personally, I am very impressed with the plan presented by the group that is very complete, concise, and clear. Regarding the implementation budget, most of the items have an explanation of the expected unit price and quantity. However, there are still some items that need additional information. For example, $4000 label printing cost, $1000 workshop material cost without unit price * expected quantity needed. Similarly, the $2000 web hosting and development section also need a more specific explanation, including the cost of the domain purchase, hosting/year, interface design... Regarding the team, Lotus Link consists of 3 members from the United States and Vietnam, who have experience in the field of blockchain technology and an understanding of Vietnamese cultural heritage. Reference links to individual profiles provided by the team are complete and unambiguous. I believe that the project is likely to be successfully implemented if it is funded by the community. My review score is 4 points, -1 point deduction has been made in the budget section due to some expenses that need further clarification.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding auditability, I think that the community completely has enough grounds to audit this project. Firstly, the output of the project is the Lotus Linked website - where the community can access to learn about agricultural products and cultural heritage. Second, the number of QR codes attached to the generated goods is also an important indicator to evaluate project results. In addition, a number of other success metrics were also mentioned by the team: the number of participants in the workshop, and the number of followers on Twitter of Lotus Link. Unfortunately, the team did not provide any specific KPIs. The community needs as detailed as possible KPIs to understand the success of the project. Due to the lack of KPIs, I made a -1 point deduction for this.

QR Code implementation contains historical, cultural and quality assurance information.\nI appreciate the impact and ideas of the proposal as it will provide tourist village communities in Vietnam with an infrastructure to sell local goods - especially in the context of agriculture and tourism heritage tourism is being promoted to promote traditional culture to consumers and visitors. In order for this form to be more and more developed and replicated, for each local commodity, it is necessary to ensure good quality, clear origin, reasonable price ... are the issues that are being given top priority for each locality. Therefore, the traceability for ecological products & crafts becomes even more urgent when customers need clarity, speed, accuracy and reliability of information when they follow. I consider this an interesting point, different from other proposals with the same challenge and a pressing concern of the Cardano community. Because the impact the proposal has on the community is so great, I'll give this project a score of 5. A perfect score on the rating scale.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project has provided a master plan consisting of 3 main phases with the work to be done to implement the accompanying implementation. Inside is a detailed plan for each month, I consider this plan to be very specific and reasonable, with a detailed and clear work schedule for each team member.\nThe project budget is $39600, which is 15.8% of the total budget allocated for this challenge. To me, this is a number that makes perfect sense. The authors have divided the budget used for the items very clearly, explaining in detail how that money is used. The breakdown of expenses I find appropriate for each category and expenditure is necessary.\nThere are 3 main risks identified by the team: international travel risks, operational risks and technical risks. The measures taken by the authors to overcome these risks are very necessary and satisfactory, proving that the project team has carefully researched when providing solutions to overcome risks to bring about risks to the success of the project when it is funded.\nI find the project's proposer entirely possible implementing this proposal. They are experienced, knowledgeable, qualified and have a long-term understanding and research on the local culture and people of Vietnam. I see a lot of accounts that link to community sites such as web, twitter, youtube... and the identity information of the author group has provided to the community. The information is clear and completely verifiable. The project includes collaborators from the United States and Vietnam, once the project is successfully funded, I see the scale of the project and the impact it brings to the community is very important great. I will give the feasibility of this project 5 points because the information provided by the author team is very complete to me.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "To me, this project is completely auditable, the community can monitor the implementation level and successful progress of the project through each month, each specific phase of the project. Since this is a project with a long implementation time and a large budget, the author team has also committed to the community to update the progress throughout the project period until completion for continuous and close monitoring.\nThe proposed measurement KPI is evaluated on 5 criteria such as lotus links, number of workshop attendees, social media materials, project space and social media. I find these criteria quite detailed and complete, covering the success of the project, but the author needs to include specific data for each evaluation criterion, this will help the community a more detailed view to evaluate the success and effectiveness of the project.\nThis is a new proposal, I will give the transparency of the proposal a score of 4 because more metrics are needed for the evaluation of the project's success.
