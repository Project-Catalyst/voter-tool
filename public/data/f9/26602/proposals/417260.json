The coins collected would serve as currency to be spent in order to plant a tree.\nEvery new tree planted is recorded via a minting of an NFT. \nQuestion 1. Will the NFT also be given to the user who spent the coin, demonstrating the user is actually 'owning' the tree ?\nThe coins could also be generated by donors who care about CO2 sequestration/environment/climate change. \n\nQuestion 2.  Do you plan to partner with known organisations such as Treedom, that is already operation in the field since some years ?", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The implementation of the app does not require a high level of programming, as well as minting the NFTs.

That would mean 250 active users for a month exercising every day. I think it's doable, but you need a strong marketing to collect those participants and instruct them about the NFTs, wallet creation... I think more preparation is needed upfront from the educational point of view. \nI am going to rate 4 because the realization of the proposal is something that I see feasibile, especially because the required number of participants is limited, but it is not clear is the tree planting area and manintenance has been planned upfront.\nI also see that this proposal is relying upon the completion/funding of another proposal which is centered in creating the app that would be used by runners to track their mileage, so the risk that this proposal is not completed because of lack of funding is higher that the related proposal (which is the 'primary' one)", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team has provided a website https://healthfi.io to track the progress of the project, but the page is not working. \nThe cost sheet with the full budget breakdown (link provided in the brief) has not been translated into English. \nThe remaining information are accurate, the team provided a bio of the team members, listed the KPIs to be tracked (number of users/monthly, n. of trees planted ect.)\nI would suggest to propose a mitigation plan in case the app is not built on time: the challenge could be also be completed via a website or via leveraging already existing running apps.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2215", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12561, "q0": "Vietnam has a 42 percent forest cover compared to a global average of only 29 percent. The climate in Vietnam is pleasant and livable.

Therefore, I realize the urgency and this proposal is very suitable for the actual situation.\n\nBy developing a campaign with \"Dual aims\" that both improve health and plant trees, providing motivation for each person to be work hard in sports. Besides, it also takes a better look for blockchains and brings it back to users with the new and positive concept that the proponent has referred to as \u201cgreen cryptocurrency\u201d.\nHonestly, the proposal was pretty cool from the very beginning.

In fact, the authors have developed app HealthFI to version 1.1 and version 1.2 is also fully prepared ready for implementation. This is a positive.\n\nIn addition, the author team's strength is that the qualifications and experience of the members are quite excellent. It can be seen that the team has a long with Cardano. I have faith in their abilities. However I hope when doing tree planting project, the team should thoroughly review the documents and consult with an environmental specialist or someone with authority and a position in the forestry industry. Since afforestation, as far as I'm aware, also requires a license, and I think the paperwork in Vietnam is rather onerous.\n\nOne issue that worries me is that although data indicates that Vietnam's planted forest area has grown significantly in recent years, but most of them are running after achievements. Easier to say is \"take quantity instead of quality\". Hopefully, the author group will clearly analyze the methods and methods of planting, caring as well as solutions to overcome the risks that the group has given in more detail.

This is the way that the author team cleverly shows when hitting on the user's psychology that they always like transparency, and can also use transparency as a tool for marketing. Besides, the organizational plan, KPI and the author's goals are quite clear and detailed, I think this represents a significant part to help investors calculate the probability and measure the probability of project so that they can make the correct decision whether to invest or not.\n\nThe proposal gives enough information for me can readily audit the project and comprehend it.

It has given solutions to a problem in the development of the Cardano community, which is the development of the cardano community in Vietnam. The specific solution of the proposal is to build an environmental protection campaign for the Cardano Vietnamese community with the support of the HealthFI application, allowing users to plant trees by walking and jogging. Therefore, this campaign will help raise awareness of increasingly urgent environmental protection and encourage the Cardano community to switch to using more environmentally friendly means of transport.. specific evidence in the presentation by arguments with specific, feasible, highly effective numbers.

This proposal, in addition to solving the general problems of the challenge, is how to develop the Cardano ecosystem in East Asia comprehensively, increase the awareness level of the people here about blockchain and Cardano network, also contribute to solving the problem of environmental protection from planting trees.\nI find the uniqueness and outstandings of the proposal very different from other proposals in the same challenge when delved into building an environmental protection campaign for the Cardano Vietnamese community with the support of the application using HealthFI, allowing users to plant trees by walking and jogging. As far as I know, currently, Vietnam is one of the countries most heavily affected by climate change, the forest cover in Vietnam is decreasing every year while environmental protection activities have not been done yet effective in raising awareness due to a lack of transparency. Extreme weather events such as storms, floods, droughts, and saltwater intrusion... have been causing heavy consequences on life and production.\nI completely agree with the author's argument about the solution when building the campaign \"Turn your steps into a healthy Earth\". This is an idea that is combined from running to improve health and planting trees to protect the environment. For everyone, these may be 2 completely unrelated jobs and difficult to do, however, when applying blockchain to life, it has provided us with a platform to create a solution complete technical solutions help realize the above idea.\nI consider this to be a very realistic proposal, which needs to be prioritized and cared for by the Cardano community to help the proposal come to fruition. If funded and the project is successful, it will be a project with great influence in the community. As a Vietnamese citizen, I see that people in my country are paying more and more attention to the health protection of themselves and their families, increasing awareness of daily exercise and sports. To help myself have good health, the values \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bof exercise and sports are extremely great. Therefore, the daily practice of sports is becoming a common trend from children to the elderly, in which walking and jogging are always preferred subjects because of their convenience, easy to use anytime, anywhere. I think when the HealthFi project was born, as a Vietnamese citizen, I was willing to wait and participate in this project as well as introduce it to the community around me because of the benefits that this project brings. I think this project will receive a large reception and spread from the community when it integrates all 3 values \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bto bring to users which are healthy habits in training to improve their own healthy body, contributing to environmental protection, the more you move, the more trees you can plant and receive rewards from the project. Based on the above points I would not hesitate to give the impact of this proposal an absolute score of 5 points.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As for the planning part of the proposal, I find the plan table that has given specific monthly milestones to be reasonable, the content of the plan and the implementation milestones are included in the proposal clearly and in detail. \nAs for the proposed budget, I see the team's calculation for each item. However, when I look closely at the overall budget table in the proposal, I see a contradiction because there are 2 numbers displayed. The total budget applied for this project is 22 000$ and 59 204.43$. This makes me not know what parameters to use as a basis to evaluate the project budget. Additionally, when I drilled down into the budget breakdown for each item provided by the author team, although the items were explained in detail but I couldn't see a cost figure that matched the table's total cost proposed. I am really confused and see no clear link for this cost of use. Maybe this is an error in editing the estimate during the team's project completion. If I take the grant number of 59 204.43$ dollars, the amount now represents 23.68% of the total budget of the challenge. This is a large number that requires rigor, meticulousness, carefulness, and thoroughness in making estimates. I feel the authoring team needs to review this budget carefully.\nI see that the authors have also pointed out two main risks that can prevent the success of the project, which are objective risks such as natural disasters or improper care that causes the number of trees to grow after planting. Failure to meet the target and risks from diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) can cause fitness and sports activities in general and running competitions in particular to be postponed. However, I have not seen the measures taken by the author team to overcome these risks.\nI think the proposer is the person who is capable of implementing this proposal. They are people with capacity, qualifications, education and long experience. I can consult their information and public identities from Linkedin, web links provided by the author team.\n3 points is the score I rate for the feasibility of the project because -1 point for the part of budgeting, the data is not matched, -1 point is because the plan to solve the risk of the proposal has not been proposed yet.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Currently, for me, the project can be audited, but only at the level of the implementation of the project plan, and the implementation budget is not auditable or the audit is not agreed upon because the data aren't linked together. It is clear that when the data budget construction table does not match, the monitoring of the implementation progress and the success of the project cannot take place continuously and closely. Moreover, when developing a large-scale project, with a long implementation time and using a large budget, the author team needs to have a plan for publishing monthly reports in a transparent manner implementing the plan, what has been done and will be done with the use of the budget, how much has been used, what to use, and how much the budget is left.\nI see that in addition to the commitment that the data will be updated on the web and the application, the author team has also come up with KPIs to measure the success of the project, which is the goal of about 5000 runners participating, with 5,000 trees planted. With this proposal, we also expect that it will attract 10,000 installs with 2,000 monthly active users (MAU) after two months of launching the campaign. With the whole project, the author team also wants to change users' exercise habits towards a healthy lifestyle and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by creating a habit of walking/jogging with thousands of products thousands of trees were planted.\nThis is a completely new unfunded project in the grand total project at fund 9.

This proposal is part of a larger picture of ideas submitted by the team at this Fund 9 (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/417168). Here, the specific solution raised by the group is to build an environmental protection campaign for the Vietnamese Cardano community through HealthFI - a \"Move-to-Plant\" application that allows users to plant trees by walking and jogging. The purpose of the solution is, to encourage and engage the Cardano Vietnamese community in activities of greening crops and combating climate change. Since then, raising awareness about Cardano in Vietnam. Through Cardano's unique blockchain technology application to mint NFT - a valuable Green Certificate, recognizing the prestige and dedication of participants and contributors in environmental protection activities in Vietnam. What really excites me about this idea is that this novelty, and originality is that - for the first time, there is a combination of two activities: running for health and planting trees, against climate change. Specifically, how this solution works can be briefly summarized as converting the distance the user travels to Gold (the currency in the HealthFI app). Gold is used to accumulate, once a certain amount is reached, it will be converted into 5000 trees, planted by the project team in real life. The creativity of the idea also lies in the fact that, for each plant, the group will issue a QR code to look up information and its origin. In fact, in Vietnam, we are almost lacking in activities to apply blockchain in real life, creating value for the environment and society like this. So I highly appreciate the solution for its social significance and the contribution it brings. I believe that, when Cardano participates in meaningful activities like this, Cardano will find the perfect way to inculcate the awareness of the Vietnamese community. However, what needs to be further discussed here is the risk of the solution. All plants will be planted and cared for by the group themselves, after about 12 years, they will be handed over to local people. This is not appropriate in my opinion. I suggest that the group consider deducting part of the budget to invite more experts with agricultural knowledge to collaborate. This helps to ensure a high percentage of healthy plants. The group should also set up a fund for crop care and protection, and cooperate with local authorities and people. Because the indigenous people are the most suitable for daily care and protection of plants. Overall, I appreciate the impact and value of the solution.

Next, update the progress of planting trees, to cheer and guide application users to create daily usage habits. Finally, organize challenges to increase user connection, and prepare for the offline race in 2023. The monthly work plan given by the team in my opinion is complete, appropriate, and ensures the feasibility of the project. The only point that confuses me here is the budget item of the project. There seems to be confusion about the grant amount here. In the USD Request section, the number given is $22000. However, in the detailed budget breakdown, the required figure is $59204.43.

By putting running component into it, there is a chance to introduce cardano to a whole new audience, who would already be interested in fitness and the environment, and would help implement those ideas into the cardano ecosystem. The hard work that will be put into running to plant trees will have everyne feeling way moer involved and interested. This also gives people a more sustainable, more positive and approachable image to the crypto-space and cardano. Secondly, the usage of NFTs could be an interesting way to make use of the cardano dapps more. This would allow NFT users to take interest in the project, and allow for connectivity with the rest of the cardano ecosystem. However, I find the implementation of NFT idea a bit odd. If these NFTs are tradeable, they can be sold away to corporations that wish to show a environmental-conscious image, without them ever contributing to planting any trees.This would turn a good initiative into a very shady one, and soil the image of the app. I would like further elaboration from the author about this subject.

I don't have an opinion on this but the question is, if I haven't received support from Catalyst in Fund 9, will the proposal continue? Does the project have any other sources of money to implement? The implementation plan is also quite clear, and especially the team knows how to apply technology to deploy to everyone when it is the HealthFi application. I highly recommend this application because it is an effective bridge to help turn jogging steps into trees. However, what barriers exist to the adoption of technology by the elderly? When in general, it is more difficult for the elderly to absorb new technology than the young, will they have difficulty using the HealthFI application and other technology-related issues? I think the team should explain and guide more carefully about the technical aspects of technology used in the proposal so that everyone, even the elderly, who are not familiar with information technology can still understand. Okay. If this can be done, it is very beneficial for the team to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal. The team correctly stated the objective risk of having a natural disaster or having no one to take care of the trees, and the risk of the Covid19 epidemic recurring.

I even expect that number to be more than 5,000 (7,000 or 9,000) the next time. Of course, the number of athletes participating depends on the characteristics of the people living in the community in the area. Specifically, do people living in that area have the habit of exercising, and jogging every day or do they have access to high technology in daily life? Anyway, I still hope for the success of the proposal. It is very interesting in that it outlines two parallel effects that are to enhancing people's health and bringing benefits to the environment by planting trees. This is great.
