The articles will be condensed with the most complete information. It only took people 2 minutes to read an article in this proposal. Therefore, based on the recommendation engine, the community will shorten the time to search and collect the information they need. Therefore, it is possible to increase both the quality and quantity of the user community in Japan. The team proposes to give specific examples in the presentation with arguments with specific, feasible, and highly effective numbers. Shows that the proposal team has carefully researched the development of proposals on each fund and the needs of the community advisors. Specifically, as it has been carefully studied, the Japanese work very hard, focus on performance, and hold a large amount of ADA. Besides, they spend a lot of time at work, so they don't have time to read too long articles, especially academic articles. Therefore, they need summary articles with full content to save time and most effectively. The specific goal of the product you propose is: gathering information and knowledge about Cardano, Blockchain and financial resources. The main is concise but still fully breaks down the English language barrier, helping the community to have more understanding about Blockchain as well as Cardano.

You have pointed out three risks in the process of doing work and have solutions to overcome and limit those risks. In the first risk, after phase 2, users can contribute their own knowledge articles to the site. There will be articles with inaccurate information due to copying on pages that are not highly reliable and the solution you provide We have a feature to rate articles, make suggestions for better articles . Users who have good comments, have a community-building spirit, are supported by many users will be rewarded and motivated. At the second risk, the proposed team is not easy to create a team not only If you know Japanese but also have basic knowledge of blockchain, you will then open a knowledge training class for Vietnamese who know Japanese. (See details at Knowledge Center about Vietnam and Japan => https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/397460) .The last risk you raised is To translate and correct from English to Japanese and especially from academic language to common user language. This is a huge challenge, but the proposal will create a special team consisting of native Japanese people to connect with blockchain experts from our community to participate in editing articles for get the best results, reach the most users. However, I have suggestions for the team on solutions to overcome and limit the risks that you have pointed out.

This proposal is made to create a \"2 Minute Crypto Dictionary for Japanese\" that is relatively short. With the introduction of this solution, it will help the community a lot in accessing data, understanding the situation, and saving a lot of time searching while still being fully and accurately updated with new information best. This facilitates those who are interested and passionate about Blockchain, Cardano but have limited time and cannot read many related articles and documents. Through this proposal, I see that the proponents are very serious and carefully researched to come up with the best solutions to the challenges posed. The team pointed out that there are many reasons why not many people have access to the Cardano Blockchain, of which the most important reason is the language barrier. Knowledge and news about Cardano, Blockchain, and Finance are mainly in English, so it is difficult to spread widely and timely in the Japanese community, affecting the speed of Cardano community expansion in Japan. Moreover, Blockchain Cardano articles are often explained in length and detail, which is an inadequacy for busy people who don't have much time, just 2 minutes to read an article, they can get all the information they need. The content of the dictionary is separated by the proponent into 3 knowledge parts with a logical and easy-to-follow order and method of presentation.

To successfully implement the project, the proponent has to foresee the risks they face. There are 3 risks mentioned here: the first one comes from the fact that after the user can contribute his knowledge to the web, the information is incorrect due to copying from other sources, leading to the error. low reliability; The second risk comes from the fact that the participating team cannot guarantee both basic knowledges of blockchain and at the same time must know Japanese; The third risk comes from the language barrier, translating and correcting English into Japanese is also a big challenge.

Regarding the budget, the proponent has also provided a plan for the period and a clear way to allocate capital, helping the community to understand the information about the amount of money that needs to be used for each month, and the purpose of each amount. What will be the result of spending? The data presented in this section I find very transparent and detailed. However, in this part of the budget, I see the cost of labor paid to administrators, affordable costs for translators staff or the salary paid to the translator included in the translation fee ($3,825) and translation editing fee ($1,275). If so, then I think it is advisable to separate the human and material costs to create a complete translation. And if possible, I think that a small part of the budget should be used as a reward fund for individuals with good achievements in coming up with good and creative ideas to create videos to increase the attraction of the community with this project. About the team involved in the project: The team gave detailed and complete information about the team, differentiated into groups such as the project management team, the core team, and the team of experts to help the community easily Easy to check and verify the information.

This will help the project have more flexibility in terms of human resources. - In addition, the project needs to add a marketing plan and marketing budget so that more people know and use the project. A good product, but if it is not widely disseminated to the public, it will be very useful and will not spread value to many tech enthusiasts. - Currently the project does not have a Japanese community, so if the project can have to build a Japanese community now to prepare for the future when the website has a Vietnamese version", "q1r": 5, "q2": "(This Proposal is very similar, nearly identical, to several others, therefore I acknowledge that my Assessment is likely to be flagged by the similarity bot) - This project has its own website - The project has clear specific commitment indicators for each stage.

The authors appreciate this and provide a solution to connect with experts in the blockchain field in Japan and, through their knowledge, edit the articles for the highest efficiency.\nI think the project will bring positive impacts to the Cardano Community in Japan.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The authors provide a detailed plan for operating the project. The project lasted 4 months with a sequence of actions to produce results set out as they were writing this project. I can imagine the smooth operation coming from the staff involved in this project.\nThe number of articles in English and Japanese is equal, with the frequency of articles appearing in a relatively large month, about 1.5 days/article. With this frequency, the project needs a team of experts who have both language expertise and expertise in cryptocurrencies, especially blockchain and Cardano.\nThe detailed allocation budget table of the project is given, I think this is a reasonable budget for the project to operate.\nThe project provides a very long and quality personnel list. They are divided into 2 groups, a core group specializing in blockchain and a group of experts specializing in Japanese content. The most important thing about the project is having a team of qualified personnel who have deep expertise in the language and blockchain. From there, they create the foundations to help the project run smoothly and bring good effects in the Cardano Community.\nThe project has provided quality personnel, which makes the project viable and scalable if this project is successful.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The information provided in this project is relatively complete and the goals after the project is completed are also shared as soon as the author team writes the project. It is important that they provide countable numbers. After completing this project, what was the result?\nThe project sets a monthly target, but in general, has the following goals:\n1. Posting upload 20 articles to the dictionary in Japanese and English\n2. Complete the login feature, users can self-post, users can rate and comment on published article\n3. Completed adding the feature of sending request translation on demand (translating articles in the dictionary into Japanese)\n4. There are 100 new users from the community, there are at least 10 users who post and at least 15 users participate in evaluation and comments for the article\n5. Attracted 3,000 views\nThe project information is given to the reader fully and I can imagine the results after the project is put into practice. In addition, the project will be more transparent if the author team makes the spending budget report available to the Tracking Community. And besides, the project can reduce the risk due to market influences by increasing the project's risk management fund.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3049", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14103, "q0": "Yes , Given presentation is highly effectively addressing the challenge .Proposal is describing step by step process and its out comes .when we say ''time is money ''and ''communication is key to success '' then this proposal is highly effective and successful for growing cardano knowledge and growth of cardano community in specially Japan .This proposal is is giving wholesome knowledge about crypto ,block chain ,cardano  and other related words in brief and understandable manner in local language which leads to outspread of community knowledge and growth and by mouth to mouth publicity as easy understanding one can easily acquire knowledge and its outcomes .With the help of this project it help the update community save more time, update knowledge more effectively.
