If there is a large amount of content to be translated, the human will be the bottleneck, avoiding this proposal\u2019s expansion. Another point that should be managed is the self funding part. All the main points of this proposal needs a continuing funding, however it was not provided any plan to support it. \n\n\n5 \u2013 Risk management: Besides the risks and mitigation acts proposed, there is always the content choice risk, meaning that there is a necessity of choosing the right content to be translated and edited, mainly in the beginning of this proposal and, moreover, there is the queue risk, meaning that there is the possibility of having more people wanting to have their content translated that the project\u2019s capacity.\n\nTherefore, in order to increase the feasibility\u2019s chance and its success, it might be good to add some modifications in this proposal\u00b7", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The auditability is highly correlated with some points:\n1 \u2013 roadmap and milestones: as mentioned before, the roadmap provided is general needing more details to allow us to follow its development.\n\n2 \u2013 channel: There was not provided an exclusive channel to disclosure all the steps and dev.\n\n3 \u2013 KPI and metrics: The KPU and metrics provided are related to the hub access and content views.
