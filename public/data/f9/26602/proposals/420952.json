A core team of 15-20 members and a community of 100,000 trainees is a great thing and if funded and implemented I  trust objectives will be achieved in the shortest possible time. A clear budget have been outlined,  and Broken down into identifiable items which is reasonable in achieving the goals of the proposal.

Their intention is to build a sustainable Cardano community in Vietnam through supporting materials and online-offline training/consulting programs. They posed the right problem for the challenge. This proposal will address one aspect of the challenge, which is to develop a sustainable Cardano community in Vietnam\u2014a country in Asia. This proposal helps to increase the quantity and quality of the Cardano community in Vietnam. Individuals in Vietnam can access useful and complete information about Blockchain, Crypto and Cardano. The proposed solution is to raise awareness about Cardano by developing a community of common interests (Cardano, Catalyst in particular, and blockchain in general), thereby encouraging them to support others by themselves, building a strong community in terms of quality and quantity. The solution has solved the problem that many Vietnamese people do not have access to the correct, accurate, and complete source of information about Blockchain and Cardano. The Blockchain Cardano community in Vietnam has not really grown up. The solutions are described specifically as: organizing a series of online and offline events; small events; gifts; polls; consulting; companionship and support for Catalyst proposal writers;...in various forms to connect members; improve their knowledge and awareness about Cardano, Catalyst and also blockchain. The argument for the proposal is quite convincing. Regarding risk management, the proposal offers two possible risks and solutions for them. However, the proposal has not yet set out the target audience to which it will be directed. Is the target audience the entire Vietnamese people? For each target group, the proposal will face different obstacles and approaches, but in this proposal, they don't really have many specific ideas for each target group they target. In addition, the proposal does not have a specific communication plan to reach the target audience. The advice is to identify the target audience and make a specific and detailed communication plan for each target group to increase the persuasiveness of the proposal. For example, can target the younger generation of Gen Z\u2014the new generation. They are ready to receive new information sources and new fields. The project can be combined with the Vietnam Student Association, with universities, colleges, and intermediate schools to reach out to young people\u2014they are the future human resources of the country. Besides, in the shared content, it is recommended to add information about career opportunities in the Blockchain field to easily attract participants. Because everyone wants to have better jobs, more opportunities and challenges to experience. Again, this is a good proposal that will have a positive impact on the Cardano Vietnam community. But the proposal is only limited to Vietnam, not the entire Asia region. So the score for impact is 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "They planned to implement the proposal. It is proposed to define a total time of 5 months. The first month focuses on researching and developing documents; the following months will continuously implement solutions as mentioned above. a series of events, concluding with connecting the Catalyst community. The timeline of the proposal is relatively reasonable. They clearly defined the goals to be overcome: The first month focused on researching and developing documents (1 set of project documents including: 1 general introduction to Cardano, Catalyst, and the Catalyst Community; Highlights: Cardano, Catalyst, and Catalyst Community docs, tutorial streams, 10 Catalyst video tutorials, and how it works in the Catalyst Community Second to fifth month: Create and expand Catalyst Community Development; Conduct 2 online events and 2 offline events per month to raise awareness of the Vietnamese community about blockchain, Cardano, and Catalyst. Total: 8 online events and 8 external events. Events can be run separately or in conjunction with other related events for maximum impact, depending on the situation. online debates, giveaways, and other activities such as daily advice, companionship, and assistance in writing catalyst proposals to attract community attention. I applaud this proposal for clearly defining objectives, especially since the results and progress of the project are public on the website, everyone can easily check the effectiveness of the proposal. In terms of budget, fundraising accounts for more than 15% of Challenge's total budget. $3,700 for research and documentation of the project; $3,840 for online events; $9,920 for offline events; and $19,500 for the project manager. There is no additional estimate. The proposed cost is 5%\u201310% of the total fundraising budget, equivalent to $1,848\u2013$3,696.

However, they have not assigned specific tasks to each member. proposing specific assignments of tasks in accordance with the professional capacity and experience of each member to optimize work efficiency. All members have work experience that aligns with the goals of the project. Verify members' identities through the links they provide, including: website, linkedin, Facebook, and blog.

They think the proposal will succeed as they build a community of over 30,000 members, with 5% of them being daily active users. 20-30 projects from members of the community will be submitted in the next rounds of Catalyst. At least 6\u201310 projects from members of the community will be funded in the next rounds of Catalyst. At least 20 members of the community access Catalyst Proposal Analyst as a paid PA. There are at least 2,000 people attending online events and another 2,000 people attending offline events within the framework of the project. Easily check out Fund 10's project success metrics and report them publicly after their run. With the indicators of the success of the project, it can be seen that the project aims to provide a useful source of knowledge related to Catalyst, Cardano in particular, and blockchain in general for everyone. From there, they will have many career opportunities and will be encouraged to create many good projects in the next fund. This is the sustainable value, the value for the community that this project brings. The success of the project is completely related to the challenge. This is the solution to build and develop a sustainable Cardano ecosystem community in Vietnam, a country in Asia. The project has tested products on social networking platforms. They have built forums, groups, and fanpages on Facebook, Tiktok, Youtube, Twitter, and Telegram to share knowledge, information, and communication to reach a large number of Vietnamese people.
