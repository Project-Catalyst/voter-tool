The proposal to address the goal set in the Challenge is to grow and develop Cardano. Contributing to the knowledge of people in East Asia is indirectly contributing to the development of East Asia. Thus, the proposal is both beneficial for East Asia and adds value to the Cardano ecosystem. I support this interesting creative proposal. In addition, I also support that you broadcast a Livestream with the participation of experts in the field of cryptocurrency, although the idea of \u200b\u200blive-streaming is not new, it still has a certain effect on the community. I'm thinking about being able to scale and address the future challenge of the proposal. Can you be more specific about this? Concretize for future expansion if the proposal is successfully applied in practice? If this point is clarified, the impact of the proposal will be very clear to the community and attract more attention.

Therefore. it is reasonable for you to build a Tik Tok channel with the topic of the Cardano blockchain. What I strongly agree with is making your link and website public to the community. It increases the community's credibility and trust in you and the feasibility of this thread. The number of team members I know for sure is more than one person (Ms. LengKeng) because you have a team behind that specializes in doing the same job (as stated in the proposal). It is a guarantee of the feasibility of the proposal when applied in practice. The budget is reasonably divided into the goals and stages to make Tik Tok videos and livestreams, which are very familiar jobs for you. I think the community will believe it when it sees you and your team working at their professional forte for so long. Regarding the budget, I have a question, if you have not received Catalyst funding in Fund 9, will you continue to implement the proposal? Or are there other sources of funding to implement this proposal? The plan, as well as the implementation method, has been fully stated in the proposal. Along with the necessary resources to perform, human resources seem to be adequate because you have a team to perform together. In terms of technology and technology, Cardano blockchain is knowledge about new technology appearing in the world compared to other technology platforms, you think you will be confident enough to deploy Tik Tok videos about Cardano blockchain? If you have a difficult technical problem, the team can invite experts to do a Livestream to better answer the technology. So is the content of these Q&A sessions similar or different from the content of Tik Tok videos? And how do make your Tik Tok videos stand out from other Tik Tok videos in the same market? I advise the team to promote more marketing and communication activities so that more and more people know about Ms. LengKeng's Tik Tok (not only thanks to KOLs). This is also in line with your knack for communication. These questions and suggestions of mine are for inquiry and constructive feedback. I would love to give suggestions to make the proposal more perfect.

Hereby I would like to suggest that these milestones can be attached to the months of the year so that the community can easily monitor and evaluate transparency and auditability. What I find satisfying here is that you have mentioned the KPI performance indicator which is calculated by the number of viewers and participants. This is exactly because when a proposal requires high community interaction like yours, it requires the participation of everyone in the community. Only then can the success of the proposal be assessed. From the moment I first read the proposal, I found it to be quite practical, doable, and easy to come to life. However, if you can provide additional key metrics, it is great for the transparency of this proposal. Throughout the proposal, the problem was clearly and easily described, and the solution was attached. In short, I support you with this very implementation. I hope it will be successful to bring Vietnamese youth more knowledge about Cardano blockchain and cryptocurrency. Good luck.

The proposal is also quite reasonable when raising the issue of blockchain or cardano documents, which are now quite lengthy and complicated, making young people hesitant to approach. So surely, if the content direction is short, easy to understand and fun, it will attract a lot of newcomers to the ecosystem.

What's more interesting is that the person sharing on these channels is a girl who is also quite young and has a lot of support, which will attract more attention of the Cardano community both inside and out. Although I understand that she has already established some channels, her team will be very good, but if she showed more details about the other members' profiles, it would be more convincing.

The proposed way to add value to the Cardano ecosystem is to build a TikTok channel with videos with short content from 1-3 minutes. Using KOL's reputation as an investment specialist to easily reach the mass community. Host live streams with blockchain and crypto experts to make it easy for them to access and participate in both blockchains, Crypto is like Cardano.

In addition, the proponent also asked for an additional Contingency Cost: of $1500, equivalent to about 10% of the total cost of the project, I think it would be better if the proponent could give a specific plan for the project cost room. The actual timetable to complete the work is given by the proponent within 12 weeks with a specific, reasonable, and convenient plan for implementation.

This is a new project that appeared at Fund 9. The team proposed a solution to popularize blockchain and Cardano knowledge for Vietnamese youth by creating Tik Tok Channel, a platform that is very popular with young audiences in Asia, in That includes Vietnam. The purpose of the idea is not to stop educating and developing the community, the group also wants through the Channel to be able to orient careers and support risk prevention for young people related to the cryptocurrency market. The highlight I see in this solution is that the team has found the key to attracting young people who love technology. That is, they will invite KOLs to collaborate on content production in a simple, fun, and easy-to-understand way. In Vietnam, Gen Z is very passionate about blockchain and is also very influenced by KOLs in consulting, investment orientation and market analysis. However, the reality is that there are many marketing KOLs for one or several token projects, PR speculative opportunities x10, x100 times. This entails many consequences: fraud, loss of money due to the mentality of just wanting to get rich quickly in a short time. Personally, I find that only when orienting young people to constantly learn, improve their knowledge and understand the nature of the market can they succeed in the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, I appreciate and support this proposed solution and way of doing things. The team has harmoniously resolved the relationship between turning dry, confusing blockchain knowledge into simple, accessible and suitable content for young people, through influencers. Regarding the risk of successful prevention, the team has proposed 2 risks that can be encountered, with solutions to overcome: first, some KOLs have PR for tokens to profit, causing the community to lose confidence; Second, extensive blockchain knowledge may be beyond the team's understanding. Personally, I think there are some other risks that the group needs to take into account. Firstly, the risk in attracting development of members is because in Vietnam, there are currently too many blockchain communities and groups. Young audiences themselves are people whose behavior is changeable: they quickly like it and also quickly get bored. This requires the team to have an effective marketing campaign, accompanied by impressive content creation activities to attract young audiences to stick with the channel. Unfortunately, I have not found any marketing related content in this proposal. Second, the risk of ADA slippage may affect the project budget.

Regarding the budget, the team had a detailed explanation of the items to be spent, the unit price given in my opinion is appropriate.

According to my research, the group's Lengkeng channel on Tik Tok currently has more than 600K followers and more than 9.8M likes. I believe that the team has enough skills and experience to successfully implement the project. I only have a small suggestion, the team should consider adding some marketing and communication activities to the Blockchain Tik Tok Channel to increase the effectiveness of attracting the audience. These marketing activities can be implemented within the existing Lengkeng community itself. This in my opinion will contribute to the success of the solution.

The issue raised about technical barriers as well as English was also raised by the project author, it is a fairly obvious problem in a non-English speaking country. The fact that the team is able to create good, engaging content with easy to understand words is a good way for the knowledge of Blockchain as well as Cardano to be closer to newcomers. This is exactly a project of young people made for young people with a very youthful mindset. It's time we pay attention to the dissemination of knowledge about blockchain, metaverse, especially Cardano, to more young people. We have quite a few channels on Youtube, on Telegram but it is true that there is a shortage of one channel on the Tik Tok  platform that is most user-friendly for young users and especially short videos that are also suitable on this platform and also accessible to people. young. Moreover, the fact that the team has several strong investment Tik Tok  channels also makes the project quite easy to attract users with its own Tik Tok  channel for Crypto. Reading this project, I think the author should change the name a bit, for example: Blockchain Tik Tok  Chanel. As a whole as a Tik Tok  user, I will be more impressed with Blockchain on this platform because Crypto is often associated with many bad impressions.

These short pieces of content can also be used for other products, publications, and platforms. And if supported by the fund, hopefully they will deploy it soon to reach more people just on Tik Tok . Another part is that I don't know if the project is in English or Vietnamese. If it is English, it will be able to attract the East Asian community better, not just in Vietnam. There is a small problem worth noting that the Tik Tok  channel also relies on the distribution of videos of the Tik Tok  platform, maybe the content is good, but it has not been distributed. But anyway, the author shows that she is a person who understands very well about Content, Video as well as the tiktok platform, so she can handle it.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The coherence in the proposed cost by item is quite understandable, showing that this is a familiar part of the proposer's team.

There is not very much information regarding content of videos to be made or any follow up incentives. Perhaps this could be considered?

TikTok is an extremely good marketing channel because it has short video effects along with catchy music that makes people spend more time on it.

And if Cardano appears on Tiktok videos more and more, it will help Cardano's brand image become more popular for the community of crypto investors and those interested in this field in Vietnam. .\n\nFor this proposal, you choose the Vietnamese language for your Tiktok videos because this is a market of 100 million people with the majority is in working age, young and technology-loving.
