Therefore, it is paramount that language does not deter people from being involved within NFT projects.", "f6_no_assessments": 7, "f6_rating": 3.8095238095238098, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 2005, "q0": "The proposal\u2019s idea is to translate, English to Japanese and vice versa, CNFT projects aiming to engage Japanese people in this world. At first it seems strange, but a quick search on the internet you find out that the percentage of people speaking English in Japan is below 3% (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_English-speaking_population), which is quite low. More than that, the percentage of crypto users in Japan is also very low, below 2% (https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership/), meaning that ADA has a great opportunity to grow there. This absence of people using crypto in Japan might have something to do with the quantity of non-English speakers there, since the majority of the material of this subject is in English.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s clear that having a group which already has a platform of CNFT and Gaming (which the link was provided and the team seems very good) translating materials, English-Japanese-English, match with this challenge because it will encourage people from Japan to learn and produce this kind of content. More than that, translating CNFT from Japanese to English will increase the number of people who can consume this content.\n\nAs the proposer stated, the fund risk is very complex. Since you need to hire translators, it is imperative to have a cash flow in order to continue this project. Therefore, it is mandatory to think of a strategy (I\u2019ve seen that you\u2019ve said that you have these strategies, however you\u2019ve not told us what it is) to monetize it and continue to translate. More than that, maybe the volume of people willing to translate materials is bigger than your capacity to translate. Therefore, you\u2019ll have a huge problem \u2013 a very big queue or a need to select content to translate. These are points that should be sorted out.\n\nAt last, but not least, just translating materials might not be enough because of the low percentage of people in japan using crypto. Maybe adding a budget to marketing and creating awareness among this Country would be a nice expenditure.\n\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Since the idea here is to translate content, it does not seem quite hard. The first step mentioned is to translate the Alliance website content (link provided) and then a Full NFT project.\n\nHowever, one point that should\u2019ve been more explored is the budget. Every translator that I\u2019ve already used and know about translate the content counting the words. Meaning that they charge USD X to translate a word. Therefore, saying which is this value (X) would be a good strategy. Asking for USD 7500 does not tell me how many things we\u2019re talking about. It could be just the website, website + 1 NFT project, website + 2 NFT project, etc. \n\nAnother point that caught me is: how the projects will be selected both ways?\n1 -  English to Japanese: I imagine that there are several NFT projects that could be translated and the budget is short. Therefore, it should have a method to choose the right one \u2013 obviously this one should consider the cultural differences as well to have engagement. However the proposal does not specify that.\n2 \u2013 Japanese to English: Now the aim is selecting a NFT project in Japanese which has the potential to have an incredible grow. There must be a method to filter this one amongst several projects.\n\nThat being said, maybe for a MVP this would work, but to be scalable, it must consider these points.\n\nThe roadmap seems very feasible. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Important: I must start by saying that these proposers are proposing some similar projects. The main idea is to translate CNFT projects to the language. Therefore, I must warn that my accesses in these projects might be a bit similar since the main idea is the same and the group is the same.\n\nThe KPI are good. I would measure the queue growth as well, since this could be a problem \u2013 having people willing to use the service but, since it is a mechanical thing, it takes time. \n\n\nThe solution described really tries to tackle the problem. And the goal of helping people from Japan to onboard the ADA community is clearly seen if we remove the barrier.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2298", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "With regards to the translators rate, we already got the rate that was listed in the proposal.

In fact, we do not have here the creation of a new innovative product or an ambitious idea that aims to change paradigms in a certain segment. However, the main activity to be carried out, translations into the Japanese language, is of great importance to provide easier access for people from this community to teaching materials or services that permeate around blockchain technologies. Therefore, this proposal has a good potential to expand Cardano's horizon of operations in the medium and long term. Regarding the capital being requested, we note that it is consistent with what is desired to be accomplished, given some caveats that will be better explained in the analysis of the project's feasibility.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As a first positive point about the project's feasibility, we can mention that the team's objectives are well defined, which can even be perceived through the existence of a well-structured project website, with clear information that demonstrates the objective of the action in financing and support NFT related projects. Another advantageous feature of the project, especially when compared to other translation proposals, is the concern with the translation of certain specific terms, which is essential when a more technical project will be translated. Regarding the team, we can mention that many professionals involved have a great view of technology, having considerable experience in this market. However, the technology area is not the only one with which the team has an affinity, we perceive the existence of professionals who work in different spheres, which builds a very complete productive ecosystem. Among these other areas in which the team has experience, we can mention the management of human resources. However, in terms of budget detail, we realized that some additional details could have been stated. Even with the possible expense being variable, it would be nice to have quoted an average translation cost for a certain number of projects, especially because the costs per project may become lower with the greater volume of these projects.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding the ways to follow the progress of the project, we have the presence of parameters to verify the evolution that are very solid with a good detailing of the factors that will be assisted along the way. In addition, with regard to the perception of success, the team understands well how the ultimate goal must be a comprehensive ecosystem, which encourages the participation of an increasing number of people in Cardano's environment. As an additional detail, it would also be interesting to indicate a tool that would be used to constantly transmit the results to the Cardano community, increasing visibility around the entire project.

I will also not be copy pasting this comment to the other two languages proposal, vietnamese and korean, for avoiding redundancies.\n\nin a nutshell, for the convenience of voters, i did give good reviews for this proposal, a 4/5/4. the team intends to perform two way translation between english and another language, and in this case its japanese. this is on top of their current work at CNFT alliance trying to help and incubate CNFT projects by providing support and guidance to them. i believe in the impact this project may have if they are able to recruit more players / developers / community by reducing the language barrier, though i would say that doing 4 languages from the get-go is a little much for a proof of concept. no doubt, bringing down these barriers will add tremendous value to cardano.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "as mentioned, i wont be copy pasting my remarks made in the chinese community proposal. for the benefit of voters, i will highlight some feedback i think they can pay attention on that serves also as feedback to proposers, though not a huge con to the project as i am still rating them 5 for this section. timeline and budget amount and team credibility is all fine. \n\nfeedback\n1.

The basics for the impact of this proposal lies in the amount of speakers \u2013 claiming that more than 125 mil people speak Japanese, which could potentially lead to the onboarding. I think the overall idea is fine, but it would be nice to somehow consider also the fact, that out of these 125 mil people, some can also speak another language, such as eng, thus these language barriers would not be affecting them. Overall, I agree that more translated content we have, more people can eventually participate. Nevertheless, to support the potential impact of the proposal, the proposers could have provided current number of visits of their website, because we do not know whether it is well known, visited, or actually overlooked site, thus, the impact would be 0.

The lack of details is not really providing confidence, when having 3 months dedicated for hiring and translating the website. It Is very unclear how many days you will be hiring, and if you end up having no translator at the end of first quarter, then obviously you will not translate the website on time. Thus, some milestones should have been set, to provide a better overview. At the same time, since the website is already set, you could have outlined how many tabs/text is going to be translated, and how much time you expect it will take to translate. Regarding the translation of the NFT projects, it should have been outlined what type (example) of NFT project you have in mind \u2013 visiting your website, there were also NFT Games, which definitely have more content, than an NFT project where you translate only e.g. attributes of each NFT in the particular series. The budget requested is 7500 USD, but no expected time spent, or hourly rate is disclosed, thus, it is hard to tell whether it will be enough or no. If you plan to have at least 2 projects till the end of Q1 2023, then I would assume the budget is adjusted to that. Saying you do not know the demand is decreasing the feasibility, because you admit it might not be enough. The team is consisting from 10 members (if counting correctly), with vast bio provided + linked in profiles. Besides that, website looks very nice and working (even tough there is not much content I would say), thus I am sure they are capable of having the website running.
