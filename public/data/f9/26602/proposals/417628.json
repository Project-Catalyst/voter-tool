It is very justified because the project is relevant and should be financed. Generally speaking, Bangladesh is a very fertile country for us to implement Cardano's technologies, and this is argued through several statements: 1) the number of people living in the country is gigantic (165 million); 2) it is a place that faces several economic challenges, social inequality and poverty being real problems and that hit this population in full - and one of Cardano's most holistic goals is precisely to make the world a better place for everyone, reducing differences 3) there is a large part of the population that is young, according to the proponents about 30% of people in the country are under 30 years old, that is, the age group is quite suitable for us to teach these people to work with technology , changing their realities and also generating profits for Cardano. The project then suggests that some face-to-face workshops be held, in order to teach the fundamental concepts about Cardano (such as what is blockchain, what are cryptocurrencies, what is Cardano and etc). The main objective of these workshops is to educate people to work with the NFT and art sector, and more specifically work with The Art Suite NFT platform. The proponents have other proposals also aimed at this same project, so here we would have a complement of this idea, from what I understand. A very positive point of this project is that a member of the team is native and resides in Bangladesh, which would facilitate the realization of the workshops and facilitate the selection of future students, people who would potentially be interested and dedicated to Cardano's knowledge. and the universe of CNFTs. My only comment on the impact of the proposal would be the following: I would like more details to be presented about the workshops themselves. What topics would be covered, how many meetings would they be, where they would be, how many people are expected for each event, how these people will be invited to participate, how to capture their attention\u2026 that is, how would the target audience be educated to work on The Art Suit NFT? Who would the \u201cteachers\u201d be and what teaching approach would they work with, so that people who have never heard of blockchain can absorb the content in the simplest way possible? I believe it would be important for such details to have been passed on. However, I believe the proposal will bring considerable benefits to Cardano, if funded; we know that with the instruction of these people, the number of active members in the community would grow, more CNFts projects would be started, more active tokens minted on our blockchain\u2026 that is, what is sought in the challenge would certainly be achieved.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Speaking in terms of the script, the information is passed on a little unevenly. For example, we know exactly how long the first two phases would last (phase one would last from week 1 to 8, and phase 2 from week 9 to 26). But in relation to phase 3, no notion of temporality is passed, we do not know how long the proposed activities would last (the monitoring and evaluation of the course, the preparation of reports, participation in public forums, etc.). Another comment would be that: it would be more interesting if the level of specificity of the activities was better described. For example, in phase 1: what criteria would be used to define the location and select a teacher? How would candidates be activated? How would the course material be created? I believe that it would be interesting for materials released by IOG itself to serve as a basis for their creation, but some details such as the topics that would have to be studied should have already been defined, in my opinion; so that we would have a better understanding of what this course would be, after all, how the didactic objectives would be achieved. It would be important to have details regarding the execution of the course, the second phase is very long (25 weeks, which represents more than 6 months); we would need to understand what would be done, how, when, by whom and why. In other words, the way the script is presented, our degree of understanding of it is quite limited. Speaking of costs, the total order ($18,750) is broken down in a very understandable way, but I think more detail on the parts would be interesting, so that we have even more understanding of how the money would be used. For example, how would the teacher act? How many hours per week would he work (part-time or full-time?); How can we assess that the value would be fair if we don't know exactly the extent of the contents being taught? Why would marketing and communications cost $500 a month, what would be produced in those parts? How would the monitoring processes take place? It is said that some learning reports would be made after the course, but would they be extensive, in print, online? Why does this part cost more than marketing itself? The understanding we have on the use of funding is ok, but it could be even better if we provide some additional information. Finally, speaking of the team that makes up the project, this part is quite satisfactory because we have a great degree of detail about those involved. We know their names, linkedin profiles, professional resumes, etc.; my only suggestion is that everyone had their roles in the project already well defined, some do and some don't. For example, all of this can be seen in Nazmul's description: \u201cGraduated from Daffodil International University. Enthusiastic about history, finance, sociology & technology. Worked on various startups. In 2020 I met Alfred Moesker. I was introduced to Cardano and I was totally overwhelmed by the philosophy behind the project and the welcoming community (\u2026)\u201d. That said, I like the feasibility of the design, but some improvements are needed.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "When we think about auditability of progress, we are told that \u201cparticipatory monitoring and evaluation will be carried out from beginning to end of the pilot project\u201d; like this? What exactly would this monitoring be, how would it be built? In relation to the performance of students in the course, how will the assessment of learning be carried out, what will these questionnaires look like? It would be very positive if the proponents had attached an example of a questionnaire of the scope of the proposal, so that we have a better understanding of what is planned to be done to verify the degree of success of the studies. They state that \u201cwe will explore the best tools and devices for use in the workshops based on available needs and infrastructure, and aim to measure and receive feedback using tools such as google forms and have publicly accessible information that we will share through The Art Suite website\u201d; what tools would these be? It would be important to have a sense of what is being suggested and how this would relate to the practical development of the proposal. Therefore, I think that the auditability suggested for monitoring the phases is quite valid, but it could be better explored, with more in-depth details, to make it really ideal. An even better way to find out about this would be, first, through better monitoring of the schedule, and for that it would be necessary to deepen the roadmap. Talking now about final results, this part is very good, almost perfect, in my opinion. I say this because proponents suggest various ways in which success would be perceived. In general, it would be \u201cwhen local educators, students and a Cardano community are alive and well in a school center and center in Bangladesh\u201d; where in these centers \u201cstudents are inspired, empowered, empowered to create and work in the Blockchain4Good and Cardano ecosystem, having been informed of new livelihood opportunities and, in turn, transformed in their lives.\u201d To measure whether this has been achieved, some suggestions are to look at the number of \u201cstudents who have successfully completed the pilot course and workshops + students who are satisfied that the learning objectives have been successfully met + students who find employment/internships in the blockchain industry and crypto within 6 months of completion of the pilot project\u201d, in addition to the learning reports that would be formulated. There are also other indicators that say more about the consequences of the project for Cardano itself, such as the number of open Cardano wallets and CNFT projects generated from this initiative. Proponents also provide what would be the vision of success at 6 and 12 month intervals. The only thing that remained pending would be how all this information would reach the Cardano community. Would a survey be generated and presented in Townhall? In general, I think the proposal is highly auditable.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 7, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3093, "q0": "This proposal fully meets the challenge, as it educates, teaches practical skills, facilitates and empowers everyone to participate in the Cardano community and the digital economy, especially is in Bangladesh, the 9th most populous city in the world.

Along with those who are enthusiastic and committed to pursuing further opportunities, they will be working or interning at The Art Suite NFT platform.

As a result, the amount of funding for the project will serve many purposes, making it easier for the project to succeed.\nWhen this proposal is successfully implemented, it adds value to the Cardano ecosystem in the country, creating a launch pad that can be used for many similar projects in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, as a grassroots movement whose aspirations and new-found connections help them grow into a resilient, interconnected, and increasingly decentralized community of Cardano.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team involved here is certainly qualified to implement the proposal well; we know who they are, their background profiles and previous experiences, as well as their Twitter, LinkedIn profiles where we can dig into each of them in more detail.\nI was very impressed with the detailed budget breakdown, with each item being very clear and detailed. The project was implemented in 6 months with sufficient basic costs to implement, with a total budget of $18,750 funded to hire the venue, teachers and training for 6 months.\nThe proponent has not given the next orientation step after the project is completed, because with the human resources trained after these 6 months, the most beneficiaries are the teachers, who create this proposal because students with the knowledge they learn plus learn more about technology.

Other very positive aspects in the proposal is the fact that some succesful students will be recruited to work in their start-up, which would work as an excelent motivator, and their reference to a similar initiative executed in Ethipia, which may help proposal to leverage their lessons learned and not to start from scratch.\nHowever, proposal could ellaborate more on how this workshops would work (frequency, size of the audience, syllabus, teaching methods,  practical projects, etc) and how to reach and engage the students intially, which would involve a target audice that could be better defined here and a proper marketing strategy. This information would help to assess project full potential and effectiveness.\nTaking it all into account, I agree that this project is generally impactful and addresses the challenge but the scope could still be better ellaborated, specially in the course strucutre and engagement, so my rate is 4.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There's a general time but, as the scope of the course seems to be a bit open at this point, there's not much details on the activities in it and their timings, which makes it hard to evaluate if its sensible or not.

It's good they show the total value by month and seem to cover most of the required costs (including marketing, venue rental, etc).\nAs for the team, there are 6 people committed with background in art, communication and innovation. These people are also somehow related to other Cardano initatives, which is a much desirable experience here.

What we are trying to find during this challenge is to favor Bangladesh and Cardano at the identical time.

It is very interesting to see how the people propose the content in the workshops and solutions. What is the novelty and appropriateness of solutions? The problem and feasibility of the project are clarified. Bangladesh, through the knowledge, and the content within the course can make the most of the opportunities of the Cardano ecosystem. As stated here by the proponents, it answers some difficulties regarding membership in Cardano. Starting with the very fact that the majority are completely unaware of what Cardano and Catalyst are. Then we have got a roadblock, which makes it difficult for everybody who doesn't have English to attend community meetings. In short, it is a source of catalyst for new members. Creating opportunities for natives of the country can take pleasure in the utilization positions generated by Cardano. Whether by participating as Catalyst project team members or perhaps developing your Dapps, acquiring Ada, learning to delegate, buying NFTs... and clearly, the Cardano ecosystem should benefit moreover. As new participants join Catalyst, the numbers of Ada holders are going to be added; new digital wallets are going to be created; more people transacting on our blockchain; with this, we can increase investments in our Dapps; children within the technology area are going to be motivated to be told about our technologies, who will become Plutus pioneers. In short, the gains are many. However, I would like more clarity on how these face-to-face meetings will take place. Where will they take place? What topics will be addressed? Who will be responsible for each part? Another important thing to know here: How many people will be in each meeting? How do they attract participants, as apparently blockchain technology and Cardano are still little-known subjects in the country.

I believe it will be interesting if we get direct feedback from the participating students, and from those who have trained through the school/hub activities. However, how often will this information be updated? Would online and collaborative tools are created. The relationship between the proponent, their mission, and the Cardano community needs to be established. Regarding success, the author first talks about the individual success of the project \"when local educators, learners, and a Cardano community is alive and active in a hub and school center in Bangladesh.\" And especially the success related to Cardano \"learners are inspired, enabled, empowered to create and work in the Blockchain4Good and Cardano ecosystem, having been made aware of the new livelihood opportunities and in turn have their lives transformed.\" However, how do be aware of all this happening, and how this information is tracked. To demonstrate that such effects actually occur the proponent needs to provide ways to verify such a scenario. Therefore, I think audibility is good, but it can still be qualitatively more detailed and varied.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3196", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11293, "q0": "This project aims to bring Cardano to Bangladesh. Bangladesh is the 9th most populous in the world, its economy is consistently among the fastest-growing in the 21st century, it is a good time to introduce blockchain and Cardano to Bangladesh. The team offers a very helpful solution, through Group Education Workshops that facilitate and empower people to participate in the Cardano community and the digital economy, and access internships at The Art Suite NFT Platform. This is quite an interesting solution and clearly shows how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem. The proposed key indicators and goals match the challenge. They increase the number of active participants in the ecosystem, increase the number of wallet openers, and increase the number of Stake Pools and Stake Pool, Operators. The team also foresees risks and challenges and offers solutions. This proposal can scale to address future challenges.\t  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The information provided by the proposal is quite complete and detailed. The Proposing Team has the experience and qualifications necessary to successfully implement this proposal. The budget also seems reasonable, very clearly broken down into identifiable items. The required amount for the group is $ 18,750, divided among the tasks of Project management, hiring Teachers, renting locations, and marketing communications,... The budget is relatively reasonable for 1 project to be implemented. Within 6 months, the amount of content created was quite large. The proposed implementation timeline is clearly outlined and broken down into specific sections. Work will be carried out in phases, Phase 1 (Weeks 1-week 8): Decide on the location, hire teachers, and create course materials, Phase 2 (Weeks 9 to 26): Run the course, and phase 3: Course monitoring and evaluation.

Bangladesh is a country with a large population of more than 165+ million people and its capital is the 9th most populous city in the world, so this is a fertile ground for us to plant the human element of ideas, educate about Blockchain knowledge, facilitate and empower everyone to join the Cardano community, in addition, according to a study, more than 60% of Bangladesh's population is under 30 years old, and this is the aging labor, is young and has a lot of positive energy.\nYour solution is to host live workshops that will initially teach blockchain technology, the Cardano blockchain, NFT, and the art and livelihood opportunities in the digital economy, such as projects. Catalyst project, after the course, is a form of reward or job opportunity at your The Art Suite NFT platform, thus opening up a lot of career opportunities for young people who love technology and Blockchain.\nI also hope that your project will be successful and resonate strongly in Dhaka, thereby creating a wave of other successful projects and for the followers to have more faith in the company.

Are you students here?\nNext to the budget section, I see that the funds are allocated to the items clearly and coherently, but there is the project management part that I still do not understand very well, who will this manager be paid, and what work do they do on this project, how many teachers do you plan to hire? If it's specific then I think it's very good.\nBut anyway, I hope the project succeeds, and you've done your best in balancing the accounting with the right amount of work.\nThe information about the team members described in the proposal is complete, and their experiences indicate that the team is in complete control and capable of succeeding with these project plans.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I think it will be difficult for the community to audit the success of the project because you have not given a specific number to call the success of the project.\nIn my opinion, you should set a specific number for each goal after a certain period of time, it will be easier to quantify the success of a project.\nFor example, the course will be approximately 50 students.\n3 excellent students will be recruited into your group to work, the number of newly registered students for the next course is 90, ...\nAnd the information about KPIs and targets needs to be reported to the community, so you should update to public service so that the community can click on it to see and track progress. your project.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3616", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Educational workshops teaching practical skills, enabling and empowering people to join the Cardano community and digital economy, and access internships at The Art Suite NFT Platform.", "experience": "The Art Suite was created in December 2021.\nOperational in January 2022, we created a working product in a short time, and we are successfully onboarding artists, selling NFTs + supporting a social impact project in Bangladesh.\nTeam Hotel Ginebra BCN, operator stakepool HOTEL."}
