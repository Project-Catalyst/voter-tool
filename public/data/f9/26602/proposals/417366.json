The proposed solution is **to make videos that will indtroduce the Cardano ecosystem to Indonesian via YouTube.** While I do agree that there is definitely a lack of awareness towards the Cardano ecosystem in Indonesia and using videos to educate masses through social media can be a way to addresses this problem, I am in disagreement with the point of reference of the proposer. Which is that \u201cIndonesian are already aware about blockchain, but not Cardano\u201d. The thing is, blockchain in general, not just Cardano. is still a underexplored sector of interest in Indonesia. For example, the majority of young adults in Indonesia have just now learned about stocks and index funds, not even mentioning the older demographics that are only interested in properties. This brings me to the next point of the proposal having a clash between the idea of making educational videos about blockchain (with focus on Cardano) and promotional videos about Cardano. Some of the content that are planned by the proposer are aligned with the mission of introducing more people to blockchain/Cardano with topics such as Intro to Blockchain Cardano, Cardano Wallet, Project Catalyst however some of the topics, to me, seems not very beginner friendly like Cardano token and NFTs, which does promote Cardano to people that are aware of the blockchain ecosystem but doesn\u2019t really address the problem that a lot of Indonesian still doesn\u2019t know about the blockchain ecosystem in general. Overall, while I do agree that the proposal can spread awareness of Cardano to Indonesian that are already aware of the blockchain ecosystem, I don\u2019t agree with the proposal gaining the outreach to introduce more Indonesian to the blockchain ecosystem.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer has the experience as a YouTube content creator making videos on financial and such topics, which are relevant skills that are needed to implement this project and the relevant links have been provided in this proposal. \n\nThe proposer has provided a break down for the budget of this proposal (9810 USD). However, I have some disagreements with how it has been laid out. First, I would\u2019ve liked more explanations on how the operational cost came to be, a budget of 300 USD per month was requested for rent and utilities. Since it wasn\u2019t elaborated more, I\u2019m assuming the proposer meant the cost for renting a recording studio and this rate doesn\u2019t seem to line up with the usual rate in Indonesia. After doing a non-exhaustive search on the internet for a usual recording studio fee in a big city (Jakarta), it cost around 200.000 IDR per hour (~14 USD per hour). Assuming, each recording session for a 10 minutes YT video takes around 2 hours at the very most, it would cost 28 USD per recording session and with 4 videos a month, it would cost around 112 USD per month for renting the recording studio. That means there\u2019s a gap of 188 USD for utility cost but the utility cost itself wasn\u2019t broken down any further. Regarding the marketing budget, 300 USD per month was requested for marketing via short videos that will be shared on TikTok, IG Reels, and YT Shorts. However, the proposer didn\u2019t elaborate further on the marketing cost allocation (i.e. the quantity and length of the short videos being promoted? will it be promoted on another content creator\u2019s platform and how much is the incentive, etc.). I\u2019d have liked if there were more details regarding these aspects. \n\nThe roadmap provided in the proposal is adequate for explaining the weekly video release schedule for each month. However, it lacks details on the production cycle for each video, such as the scheduling (total hours) for script writing (initial draft, revision, final draft), recording, video editing (initial draft, revision, final draft), adding in subtitle, as well as making blogs and short videos. Without these details, I find it hard to judge the feasibility and sustainability of the video production cycle. \n\nBased on these points, I am in neither agreement nor disagreement with the feasibility aspect of this project since the key aspects such as budget allocation and production cycle lacks some important details", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In terms of tracking, this project can be tracked easily via the proposer\u2019s YT channel, where all the videos will be posted. The KPIs chosen by the proposer is the number and growth of average viewers on each video every month. The metrics chosen by the proposer is a good and relevant way of measuring the outreach the project have. However, I\u2019d have liked if the proposer included other metric such as the like/dislike ratio of each video as a measurement on the quality and overall reception of the video. As we know, the dislike count has been taken off YT for public views but it can still be seen by the video creator so I\u2019d have liked if the proposer had planned to give a report that can be seen and tracked publicly, to track these metrics. Additionally, after 6 months, the targeted average views per video is 2000 views per video which seems low, especially considering the budget requested for this project.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3408", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1122, "q0": "The proposal aligns with the objectives of the challenge.

Therefore, I quite support the group's approach to this proposal.\n\nWith a Youtube channel with 48,000 subscribers people, this is a pretty good number, and if this number of subscribers can access Cardano-related videos, it will help expand the brand for Cardano in the Indonesian market.\n\nThe content that the proposal is aiming for, such as conveying knowledge about Cardano related to Wallet, tokens, NFT, SPO, Catalyst, in my opinion, is extremely basic and necessary information for those who are new to learning. about Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the detailed plan to produce these videos, I have not seen you guys clearly state, that we need to have specific timelines, achieved results, and criteria to evaluate the quality of the work, it will help. make your project more convincing.\n\nYou have a budget proposal for the proposal of $9810 for 6 months, with details of each item.

First, the problem statement the proposer brings up is \"... to bring more mass adoption to Indonesia, where people are already aware of blockchain but lack awareness of Cardano and its ecosystem.\" However, this is not true; many Indonesians are not yet aware of blockchain. While this might be an opportunity, unfortunately, the older generation still thinks gold and property are the only investments. Meanwhile, the younger generation has just started learning about stocks and mutual funds. To combat this, we need more introductory content. This leads me to my second point: the topics the proponent would upload are not well-targeted for mainstream Indonesians. For example, someone new might be interested in learning how to liquidate ADA into their bank accounts but not in new NFT or token projects. I suggest the proposer teaches the basic concepts of blockchain and the Cardano ecosystem more. What I mean by this is, instead of spending two videos each month talking about NFT and Token projects, use them to talk more about Cardano usecases, about how POS works, about what Cardano is trying to solve, and about why Cardano exists when Bitcoin and Ethereum are already there. NFT, native tokens, SPOs, are way too advanced for people who are just getting into the crypto space.\n\nOverall, while the proposal spreads awareness and targets Indonesians, I have to disagree that it would reach many people in the long run. However, I am really excited about the proposer\u2019s initiative to use popular social media platforms and influencers to promote Cardano.

Credits where it's due: the proposer provides us with the timeline (six months) and they have broken down the budget into identifiable items.

However, the operational aspect seems to heavily rely on just one member, as I don\u2019t see the other two members having relevant experience in writing scripts, hosting videos, or editing them. More on the budget: I'd like to see a detailed explanation of what operational costs and miscellaneous are actually used for, as well as the distinction between the two. The merchandise item seems a bit excessive. I can find many giveaway packages for half the requested price online, and more importantly, I don\u2019t think they are that desirable. If it\u2019s going to be used to attract people getting into Cardano, then why not just give them 30 USD worth of ADA? That way, they are directly involved with the Cardano ecosystem.

The metric used is the number of views each video receives, with the proposer aiming for a 100\u20132000 audience by the end of the timeline. However, I find these numbers to be unrealistic and pessimistic. It's unrealistic because a video series usually gets a lot of views upfront and starts to dwindle as it progresses. pessimistic because there is no reason the proposer shouldn\u2019t set a high target. The funding is already provided and I am sure the proposer is excited to share a lot of things about the future of Cardano, so placing 2000 viewers as the highest milestone would only hold back the proposer's motivation.

So, in this respect, if this proposal gets funded, TikTok and Instagram Reels should be just the additional promotional short videos that describe and link to the main videos on YouTube.\n\nAbout the impact of giving peer-to-peer advertising in regard to investing in Cardano through testimony. We should be aware that Cardano at this stage is not a blockchain that will make people get rich in a quick way.

All the links and videos given are mostly testimonial advertisements regarding some investments the proposer is currently taking part of on startups and fintech companies\n\nSecondly, the plan. The team randomly jumps from making a video that explains blockchain and Cardano on week 1 to the NFT project on week 2, then to the Token project on week 3, and to the Project Catalyst on week 4.  If the team wants to present a light and popular style of short marketing videos, why bother to present these very technical aspects in Cardano development when there is nobody in the team that has the ability for doing so. Besides, these types of videos can be found all over the internet already.\n\nIn my opinion, the videos should be made in chronological order, starting from introduction to Cardano blockchain, and then moving to wallet creation, how to get ADA and delegate to a stake pool, how to make transactions, and so forth.\n\nIt would be much better in terms of educational short videos if the team focuses on 1 or 2 aspects that will create a broad yet specific audience. Focusing on recent updates and providing information of what NFT to mint every week on Cardano for instance, would make each of the videos unique and more interesting to watch.\n\nThirdly, the budget breakdown. Although the proposed budget looks reasonable. I noticed there are several components that should be excluded. We all know there are a few video editor softwares with the capability to provide subtitles that we can download or use on the internet for free, and stationaries are not necessary.\nAnd, although the proposal mentions a way to mitigate the risk due to any circumstances such as hiring a free-lancer, it is not allocated in the budget breakdown.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I quote from the proposal's impact section: \n\"We see that Andre Tuwan YouTube channel has a high level of engagement with viewers...\", and \"We want to use this channel to help the Cardano community promote apps, tokens, NFT, and other ecosystems to Indonesians.\" - This means that there will be no new Youtube channel made in regard to this campaign, thus making the auditability of the KPI next to impossible.\n\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_3214", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11771, "q0": "The \u201cYouTube educational video in Bahasa\u201d recommendation has a good link to the challenge setting.

The purpose is to promote Cardano to the Indonesian community, where people know about blockchain but lack awareness about Cardano. Personally, I think the solution of using influencers and an already existing audience to introduce Cardano is interesting. This can save time and money on marketing communications and still achieve your goals. This approach has been chosen by many industries and brands to increase public awareness. However, what I am concerned about is that a large number of the Channel's available audience may not be interested, not interested in learning about blockchain. This is also related to one of the risks of the solution which is a lack of interaction due to too few people viewing blockchain and Cardano content. This has become even more difficult in the context of the cryptocurrency's price drop that has lasted for months. Therefore, I suggest the team consider adding activities to encourage community and increase interaction on the Channel.
