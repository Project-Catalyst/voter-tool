Therefore, creating a support channel for people is very necessary and encouraging. Like any other proposal, this proposal is dedicated to growing the Cardano community on Telegram for the special grow, here is Vietnamese. That is a good idea because  Vietnam is not an English-speaking country so it's tough for people who want to get to know, keep updated and analyze Cardano technology.

For example, Telegram channel \"Cardano Vietnam Official\" with more than 1800 members exchanging and discussing projects on Cardano.

With the current demand of Vietnamese people to learn this issue is high specifically according to Finder, the use of cryptocurrency in Vietnam (among respondents) is 41%, of which 20% have bought Bitcoin and 17% of NFT holders, Cardano needs an additional reliable, fast and timely information channel that responds to timely and in-depth news about Cardano - a suitable place for community development. Please present the problem clearly and convincingly. The specific solution of the proposal is to build Tre Viet's Telegram channel to become a trusted address of the Vietnamese community in supporting project information on the Cardano ecosystem.

To solve the problem, your solution is Tu Viet Channel providing better quality information, closer to the community, in charge of the self-research team, with continuous support from community care staff, respond quickly and promptly .. The second risk the group mentioned is due to bot spam channels, users provide untested information and solutions, you research and develop the management and control team regularly administer and remove junk information, information unrelated to Cardano and projects on the Cardano platform. All information posted on the Telegram channel needs to be analyzed clearly. The final risk due to the nature of Telegram, the amount of messages will be very large, important information can be difficult to find. Communities may miss out on important information because they may not be able to read all the messages. Ban has come up with a solution to build a website that aggregates important information. Everyone can easily check the important information of the project.

As far as I know, Vietnam is a country that is currently ranked 2rd in the world in terms of the prevalence of cryptocurrencies, this number has not stopped but is growing in the future. I completely agree with the author's way of posing the problem when stating that the Vietnamese blockchain, especially the Cardano-loving community, needs a reliable place to discuss, update, look up and analyze information, Timely technical support on all projects on Cardano. This proposal is born to partly solve the goal of the challenge to develop the Cardano ecosystem in East Asia and especially in Vietnam.\nI find the unique and outstanding feature of the proposal is that the author group in many development community channels today on the application such as facebook, tiktok, twitter... chose telegram because this application is gradually being used by people. It is mostly used by individuals who participate in the financial market because of the benefits it brings such as simple, light, fast interface, sync messages everywhere, no flickering, no dependencies depending on other infrastructure, high safety and security, the ability to search and transfer information files quickly, can create groups of up to 200,000 people or create channels to broadcast content to an unlimited number of audiences term. I think this is also a huge difference when the authors know how to choose the most optimal platform, which is their strength to build this proposal.\nIn Vietnam, I find it very necessary to develop an in-depth knowledge channel about the Cardano ecosystem. The solutions proposed by the team have largely satisfied me, and I believe in helping me solve the major problems encountered when learning about this community such as technical problems for people newly joined, there are many high-quality market analyses, reviews, comments, information on new projects and valuable shares about wallets and information security.

Furthermore, Tre Viet channel shows how to take steps to participate in projects or get rewards from projects that will be a great help to those who are participating or intend to participate in the projects in Cardano ecosystem. In addition, Tre Viet channel also provides a variety of bots to the community for free which make it easy for the members to follow fluctuations of Cardano.

Beside being a member of Tre Viet team, Project Executive Mr. Lam Nguyen is also a member of FIMI translation team, a famous team in charge of translating documents about Cardano blockchain in Vietnam. As a result, it is not difficult for Tre Viet team to research, evaluate and then convey to the Vietnamese Cardano Community.

It is even more necessary for the community to know the true value of Cardano. Based on the target metrics set by the challenge, I feel that the proposed problem is well suited for this challenge.

I am also a marketer myself, in my experience, with this plan alone, you can use an important factor to attract users, that is to use bots. Because now the bot supports the user community very well. And especially, I have experienced the bot to look up your balance fluctuations on telegram, I realized that the bot is very effective. So you can use bots as a method to reach more users in the community. And can use promotional campaigns related to in-depth research in the Cardano ecosystem, especially the community that uses a lot of bots related to token prices, ISPO information, price fluctuations ADA or volatility of whale wallets... I look forward to having you complete it. At the same time, the feasibility of the proposal is highly appreciated because it is based on the team, the team is experienced, and people.

Cardano-based project. , Tre Viet channel is a place for technical support such as a decentralized exchange wallet, showing how to take steps to participate in projects or receive rewards, etc. solutions that will solve challenges help remove technical barriers for newcomers, build a website that aggregates information about projects and shares valuables such as wallets and security for the community to easily easy search.

The progress of the project is easy to check and track by the community , such as the first month of proposed implementation ? announced support staff and intensive research team , implemented a marketing campaign to promote ,, etc. February and March was very detailed , I liked the roadmap of the project . Talk about the project's budget the theme the project requires in the amount of 9950$ that amount matches what the scheme works. the budget is divided into sections to know what to spend and is very reasonable, so the community can see how and how much is spent with the progress of the project, I appreciate it when the project theme can provide contingency cost for the project , through which the project topic has prepared a very good scenario for this project , i like this project .

The beauty of this project, unlike many other community channel-building projects, is that it only focuses on Cardano, so it is quite selective and also very beneficial for Cardano. Of course, there is probably also a more limited number of participants.\nIn addition, this project is proposed by Tre Viet, a team of reputable investors in Vietnam, often sharing knowledge and investment opportunities, so the possibility of success in attracting participants Telegram channel is also positive. Moreover, they are also committed to making tools and bots for users to easily look up market information, and ask and answer questions about Cardano knowledge as well as Cardano projects, so it should be easy to attract investors. because it is clear that they benefit from joining this channel of Tre Viet. At the same time, because on this channel Tre Viet also focuses on sharing a lot of research on profitability, founders, and the structure of projects on Cardano, it is extremely good for projects on Cardano, helping the projects themselves. The platform attracts a large number of investors, like a promotion channel. One fact to be concerned about is that Telegram is not a very friendly platform for people in East Asia, they all have their own social networking platforms, so it will also be difficult for Tre Viet. Only recently, this platform is gradually becoming more familiar to financial investors.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This is a not too complicated project, so I personally think it is completely feasible both in terms of products as well as plans to attract participants. I believe this will be the channel that many investors will join because they find their interests there. Considering the background of the project people, it is easy to see that the team has experience and expertise in technology as well as engineering, and has a deep and long enough understanding of Cardano. At the same time, they have also created their own Youtube channel sharing experience, knowledge, and information about the Cardano platform such as the Empowa project, which proves that they are capable of taking care of the community, and producing content. content that attracts as well as understands the needs of Cardano investors and participants. The next plus point is that this is not a project that has not been started but has been tested, according to my research, the numbers are also relatively good with about 1000 participants, which also shows the effort. Team effort and contribution made in promoting Cardano to newcomers. But the problem here is that the project wants to spread to East Asia, not just their country Vietnam. So they need more English content to attract, not just Vietnamese. This problem I think is not too difficult if there is financial help from Fund 9. This project also mentions some challenges when building a Telegram channel because as I said before Telegram is a social network. There are a lot of virtual accounts and spam that make users hesitate to use them regularly. The implementation team has come up with a solution with 2 admins who regularly delete it, but if the number is too much, it is also relatively risky for the project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The plan and goal of each part can be clearly seen in this project so it is quite clear, specific and also relatively reasonable. The KPI is obvious when accessing the team's Telegram channel directly, so it's not difficult to see the actual number of participants. KPIs to measure the development of the project such as the number of users, the number of messages, the frequency of using bots are reasonable, easy to check and evaluate objectively. Reasonable costs, all expenses are clearly explained and consistent with the proposed solution.
