This is a great idea, easy to bring to life. The fact that you have implemented when funded by Catalyst in Fund 7, I have tracked and understood its impact and feasibility. In this Fund 9 proposal, you have identified an existing problem that new/sponsored proposals have difficulty communicating directly with the community. Thereby, I understand that Cardano Catalyst TV acts as a television bridge to transmit proposed information to the community (5-minute video), Cardano Catalyst TV's video is also educational about relevant knowledge. related to the Cardano ecosystem (Cardano blockchain, NFTs, smart contracts, etc...which are evident in the proposals). As such, the proposal has added value to the Cardano ecosystem, which is fully scalable and solves future challenges. If properly invested and deployed, Cardano Catalyst TV can completely become a famous TV channel of the Cardano community with world scale and stature. I completely agree with this proposal, especially its impact on the East Asian community and the Cardano ecosystem. I vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Through the proposal, we see that the proponent is already working in the Cardano ecosystem (Cardano Catalyst TV host, Eastern town hall moderator, etc..) so you have experience available. In this area, another element of feasibility is that the material you present in your proposal (videos) makes the feasibility of the proposal clear. Equally important when it comes to proposal writers is the disclosure of their identities via social media. You did this by quoting Linkedin's link. In terms of budget, it has been divided into sections with quite reasonable prices with the target to be achieved. I only have 2 small questions: do you intend to spend the extra budget on marketing the Cardano Catalyst TV channel? If you do strong propaganda, many people will know about Cardano Catalyst TV. And then it will continue to increase the value of the Cardano ecosystem in the community, and the number of likes & views will increase. And if you haven't been funded by Catalyst in Fund 9, will you continue to make good videos? Those are my 2 small questions. In another criterion, you have clearly stated the plan and how to implement the proposal. This makes the feasibility of the proposal demonstrated. Regarding human resources, I know that you also participated in other proposals in Fund 9, so does this affect the quality of Cardano Catalyst TV's work? And another possible risk is that when you have personal problems that cannot be implemented, who will be the one to act on your behalf? The remaining risks in your proposal are very reasonable, I agree. So, I agree with showing the feasibility of the proposal, and it would be much better if you could further clarify the questions I posed. I vote 4 stars.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "You've shown the roadmap and milestones across each fund. To me, this is acceptable. I would like to present another opinion to clarify the roadmap and milestones, that is, you can attach the roadmap and milestones to work with the time of the months of the year. If doing so, it is very convenient for the PA community to evaluate the auditability and transparency of the proposal. They will know very well the progress of the work when compared with the date stated. Although there are no KPIs yet, I am satisfied with the 4 success measures, and the key performance indicators you have listed. I am impressed with your analysis in answering the question: \"What does the success of this project look like?\". It is true and thereby shows your quite deep understanding and skill when developing this proposal. I think if you add KPIs, it's great. Throughout the proposal, a problem has been clearly described by you, easy to understand, and a solution to solve the problem exists. I was just wondering, is there anyone else working on this proposal besides you, or are you going to get help from the community? Just now was my question and positive comments on the auditability of the proposal. I wish Cardano Catalyst TV will last forever with the development of Cardano in the future.

On the other side, the community gets up-to-date with proposal insights with more details in-depth, graphic images, background musics and subtitle explanations within 5 minutes.

The resume of the proposer and the information about the Marketing Agency are provided clearly and transparently. Moreover, this proposal builds on the previous funded proposal in Fund 7 so their ability and experience in project implementation is nothing to worry about. Another great point is that the proposal gives a very specific development roadmap of the project and the budget division is very clear for each item. The proponent even set aside 10% for the reserve fund. This is a good move to limit unnecessary risks that make the project short of budget, such as ADA slippage or additional costs incurred during implementation. Good job!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Fortunately, all the metrics and KPIs of the project will be measured. In my opinion, this project is easy to track because of two reasons.

This is a complementary idea and a continuation of the \u201cCardano Catalyst TV\u201d proposal that was funded at Fund 7. The solution the team continues to pursue is to create short videos (5 minutes each) that introduce briefs idea of a proposal submitted at Fund 9 and Fund 10. At Fund 9, the team is expected to select 30 proposals to make an introductory video. The purpose is to help these proposals introduce themselves, communicate and connect with the community through concept videos. Video outreach is a great way to increase public awareness, marketing effectiveness, and response, the team argues. This also helps to overcome the limitation that many people do not have much time to read the proposed documents. I totally agree. However, my concern is that the team did not specify when these videos will be published at each funding round. Since the purpose of the idea is to create a communication bridge between the proponent and the community, I personally think that the idea video should be released before the community conducts voting for the idea. This leads to risks, difficulty contacting the proponent, difficulty in accessing the full information of the proposal before the idea is finalized and submitted to Catalyst. If waiting for the idea to complete, the time it takes for the team to produce videos is very short, which may affect the completion schedule of 30 videos per Fund as expected by the team. Since this is a follow-up to the proposal that was funded at Fund 7, I would expect the team to provide a detailed report on the results of the work. Unfortunately this was not implemented by the team. The community needs to consider and compare the achieved success with KPIs that the team have been committed.

The group also mentioned promoting these videos on platforms: YouTube, Twitter, voting engine, Ideascale, Facebook. However, specific information related to this promotion and marketing plan is not provided. In terms of budget, the cost categories given by the group in my opinion are reasonable, clear and detailed. About the team, Mie Tran is the one who received the community's approval at Fund 7, so I believe she has the capacity and experience to successfully implement the solution.

The team provided concise, specific KPIs: there were 30 successfully uploaded videos per fund, each with at least 100 views, 1 more Asian member joined Catalyst.

This proposal will remove the problem that new and sponsored proposals don't have the source or platform to properly communicate with the community if they have a new idea or want to update their proposal progress community.\nThe outstanding and unique point of the proposal is when it converts ideas and plans from boring words on paper into unique videos. A short 5-minute video with a proposal's body/idea summary visual illustrations, and caption explanations to help educate and self-introduce the proposed ideas to the community.\nI completely agree with the argument of the author's solution to this proposal. Concept videos will be a great way for proponents to connect with a deeper community, a platform with contact information where viewers can communicate, comment, and ask questions. Videos will be known to the global public of their projects and on social networks such as Youtube, Telegram, Twitter and voting tools, ... Personally, I have many years of experience working in the industry media and television. For me in Vietnam, the use of videos and clips for the purpose of advertising, marketing and communicating with the community is no longer a new job, but it cannot be denied that at the present time it is still a A leading effective communication method in the media market that greatly changes public perception, a highly effective marketing communication channel.\nI will give this proposal impact 4 points as it is not a new proposal but just an idea that complements previous funded proposals.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan table of the proposal has been built with clear contents for 2 funds, fund 9 and fund 10, I can see the construction of detailed and reasonable tasks, set plans and specific tasks and very obvious. However, for me in terms of time, if I define a fund as 3 months, the plan table that needs to be divided into tasks to be done by week/month will be clearer instead of the current timeline according to the fund. \nThe suggested budget portion of $10560, which is 4.2% of the challenge's total budget, is a perfectly reasonable number, however I find the budget to also need to split usage by week/month and interpret it in detail more detailed. For example, each video needs to use how many employees, how many days, how much is the unit price of a specific tool to create a video. When a detailed budget construction is given, the better the use of costs and persuasion to sponsors will be.\nThe authors also identified two main risks of the proposal: it can be difficult to contact proponents to ask for ideas and to follow up with proponents on a regular basis to see how the proposal develops how can be a big challenge. I think the solutions to reduce the risk have also been given by the author group to be reasonable, but I think the best solution here is to have regular interaction and connection between the author group and the researchers propose to build a close relationship, this will greatly help in the working process and reduce risks, helping the project have a higher success rate.\nThis is an extension to the proposals that have successfully raised capital from previous funds, so I have complete confidence in the author's ability to implement this project. I have watched the demo video on youtube, twitter or the author's community sites are provided such as linkedin, telegram... The author is a person with competence, expertise, education and experience that has been verified at different sites previous funding round.\nI will give 3 points to the feasibility of this proposal due to the lack of detailed information in the planning and budgeting sections.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I find this project completely auditable, but for me, the audit only stops at the general level of every 3 months, lacks continuity and rigor.

In addition, for a project, there should be public and transparent monthly reports on the implementation of the plan implementation and budget usage so that the community can easily track the proposal.\nKPIs of the project I saw that the author team gave 4 main indicators as a measure of success, which are views per video, play rate, feedback and comments, and social shares. For me, these 4 indicators are relatively detailed and complete, but they lack specific numbers to measure for these 4 indicators. In addition, the author team has provided a demo video of the project to help the community refer to, monitor and visualize the content that the proposal is building.\nThe project is considered successful when it meets the criteria of successfully uploading 30 videos per funding round with the hope of getting at least 100 views per video, which has helped the project to market its proposal succeed and increase their presence on most social channels, add another Asian member to the Catalyst project, strengthen the connection between the proponents and the community, and collaborate with the many available channels of Cardano Ecosystem.\nAs said in the previous section, this is a supplementary idea to the proposal that was funded at fund 7, currently this project is not profitable and only serves to spread Catalyst to a larger part of the community.
