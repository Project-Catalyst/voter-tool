This will bring and increase the participation of the Cardano community with East Asian residents. It is quite an ambitious project and a big challenge as in the future they will be targeting financial institutions, corporates, and Private Equity and Venture Capital Fund managers to name a few to be delegators in the East Asia SPO Alliance. There will be potential of increasing the number of Stake Pools and SPOs based in East Asia if the team able to pull together great SPOs. Therefore, this project will be able to scale significantly around the Asia. Furthermore, the team are around the world with different time zones for this project and this will promote decentralization. The team have stated several risks in carrying out this project and their solution is reasonable with dividing the workload among the team members around the globe.

The team have outlined their timeline for this proposal. The team wants to establish panels to evaluate \u201cproof-of-soul\u201d for community projects and verify SPOs securities within a month which I think it is too fast. The team will also be working with other SPOs from previous F6 and F7 across the world with different time zones. To be on the safe side, the team can have a slightly longer timeframe at early stage for the project to be successful. However, the whole project takes a 12-month window to complete. The team can produce a Gantt Chart on how they are allocating their time to execute this project. The team will be publishing open-source documents on how peer review happens for projects and stake pools. This is good as it promotes the ethos of Cardano and cryptocurrency. The team have broken down their budget for this project. However, I think budget requested is not enough because 1) this is a 12-months project which requires a lot of resources 2) working with people in the Cardano ecosystem with different time zones 3) The team members are co-founders of other projects which takes up their time and energy 4) possibility that they tend to increase their manpower to execute this project, which may need to pay them for working on this project 5) sustainability, security and honesty of the joined SPOs Alliance.

Suggestions to the team is to have a consistent update (weekly/bi-weekly/monthly) to the community on their progress using blogs, Town Halls, and AMAs in Twitter or Discord. Furthermore, the team can add a matrix in their Google sheet about the SPOs that joined. Matrix that has the mission and how trustful those SPOs are.

Mission-oriented teams are also at the frontier of paradigm shift in breaking down legacy systems and financial steering methods to solve local and global problems. Single operating SPOs everywhere are struggling, they don't attract more delegates to their team, so it becomes more economically difficult to operate the Pool and not feasible for many People.

That gives confidence to the proposal to succeed when it is funded.\nI see the proponent has made very clear arguments about the risks in the implementation process and measures to limit the risks when implementing to make the project successful. The risks identified by the proposal include management work and the amount of diversity among team members when they are in multiple countries with different time zones, and consistent communication and meetings will lead to success. work for the project.
