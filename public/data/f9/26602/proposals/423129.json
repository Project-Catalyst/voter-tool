Reducing language barriers is quite important when we have a popularity ambition.\n\nTherefore, this proposal aligns with the challenge objective and ADA\u2019s aim.\n\n\nThe proposal\u2019s goal is ti reach the maximum of people as possible, which aligns with the challenge objective.\n\nIn order to be more scalable, it\u2019ll be necessary to hire more translators, since it is a mechanical job, the human is the bottleneck.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal lacks a bit of organization. There is no previous selection of content that will be translated, which might be a problem due to the possibility of choosing a content that people are not interested or a dense material etc, creating a huge risk to its success.\n\nThe budget is well defined. It gives idea of how much material it\u2019s possible to translate with the asked budget. \n \nThe risks were exposed and with the actions to mitigate with is good to analyze its feasibility possibility. However, there is a content poor choice risk, since the team will define which content will be translated. Having few peoples deciding about the content might have a wrong interpretation of the community needs reducing the engagement and its success.\n\n\nThe team is experienced in the translating world and content communication, which is mandatory to this proposal. It was provided LinkedIn links.\n\n\nBeing a purely mechanical proposal, in order to scale it is necessary to have lots of translators, making it possible to increase the rate and quantity of videos.\n\nThat being said, it is probable that the proposal will be done and, if the risks were managed correctly there is a high probability of success.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "YT content publication makes it possible to know and verify if the promised content was done, however it is missing a way to verify the making and progress. A way to mitigate it is creating a instagram profile, e.g., to show the making of and progress.

The proposers have given a clear and complete roadmap with good goals that I think it can be achieved in the given timeframe.

The proposer\u00a0claims that there are\u00a0over 30 million people who are able to speak Khmer all over the world, which is a significant quantity. The proposal will make it simpler for the Khmer-speaking community to access Cardano information by translating documents and creating content videos for Khmer speakers. Additionally, the proposal will open the door for onboarding a large number of new individuals into the community who have very different points of view.\nEven though the proposal includes statistics on the number of Khmer speakers, I believe that it should also include further research on the degree to which Khmer speakers comprehend blockchain technology. Creating movies about blockchain technology should take precedence over posting content regarding the Cardano ecosystem if there is a lack of awareness about blockchain technology. A more significant and favorable effect on the community will result from this.\nIn general, the objectives of the project are aligned with the difficulty of the task.

The proposers\u00a0have previous experience working for the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, in addition to more than three decades of expertise translating official documents for the Ministry of Languages. In addition to that, they have experience in the field of software development. Because of these credentials, I have faith that the applicants will be able to translate documents and produce content videos that are appropriate for the Khmer-speaking population. In addition, the breakdown of the budget is very well thought out, and the costs have been broken down into detail such as translation, a social media campaign, and a contingency charge.\nHaving said that, there are a few points of information that, in my opinion, need further elaboration. Firstly, I'd like to get a better knowledge of the core topic covered in each video so that the community can make an accurate determination as to whether or not the audience will have a fundamental comprehension of the Cardano ecosystem. Second, there is a lack of information that is readily available concerning the attempt at marketing to attract an audience.\nThe viability of the plan will be improved with the addition of more detailed information.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In order to facilitate more accurate tracking of progress, proposer provides a detailed roadmap that details the monthly milestones that need to be reached.\nIn terms of key performance indicators\u00a0and metrics, there are a few measures that I believe should be introduced.

Yes, it does open the door for Khmer-native speakers to Cardano, but that language is such a small percentage of the world, funds could ideally more optimized to grow and outreach other areas with more efficacy.

There is some concern about the rate at which they plan to have material translated (one video per 3 days), but given the scale and amount of content available, this probably is doable.

Comparing to Tamil proposal, here the proposer did not disclose how many people speak Khmer, and according to google, it is approx. 18,5 mil., which is 4 time less than Tamil proposal. It is obvious that the audience will be much smaller thus the impact of the proposal will end up being smaller as well. The proposer also states, that having such videos will provide education to those who speak Khmer, will result in onboarding this community to the crypto space. Overall, I agree with the problem statement \u2013 to have more content in different language in order to bring more people to ecosystem. Nevertheless, I am lacking more supporting data of the solution, because we can not determine whether having Khmer content will automatically lead to the onboarding. (since I remember that such proposals were already set in the previous fund \u2013 different translations \u2013 proposer could have provided these data to support the estimated impact.) Key metrics stated in the proposal such as number of views and likes are aligned to the solution of the proposal and we will be able to evaluate the impact retrospectively. It is also important to state, that the proposal contains some inaccuracies \u2013 khmer is spoken in Cambodia (as google say), yet in some parts of the proposal, the proposer kept paragraphs mentioning Laos community, or Tamil community.

If the goal would be 18-20 it would seem more reasonable. Despite this large deviation, it does not decrease the feasibility to have at least 10 videos, but I find it incorrect set. The videos will be taken from official IOHK channels, so the source of videos is clear. The budget is set to 11 150 USD, whereas it is divided into 2 250/ month for videos, and when respecting 10 videos after 3 months, it is 750 USD/video. The proposer states, that the rate for word is 0,15 USD, but since the content of the videos is already pre-determined (taken from IOHK channels) this part could have been more detailed e.g. video 1, duration 10 min, 400 usd\u2026.etc. I know it would require more thorough analysis, but since there were many proposals as such from the same proposer, assuming translating similar content in different languages, having one analysis could have been performed. Another part of budget is 2 500 for social media campaign and 2 000 contingency fee. To be honest, I completely disagree with contingency based on market volatility. As far as I know, the ADA received could be transferred to a stable coin in case of need, or even for fiat currencies on any exchange, which would lead to preserving the amount. Maybe I am overlooking something, but it does not seem \u201cneeded\u201d. The team is composed from 4 members, with vast bio provided and linked in profiles. I find these somewhat less relevant, since it is mentioned that master translators will be still hired. These profiles could have been disclosed instead (or just a representative). To conclude, because some parts of the proposal I find slightly misleading, overextended or not explained fully, I am decreasing one star down.

I agree, but for us to have better confidence about what will be done, it would be necessary for us to know the exact contents of these videos. One of the points cited as obstacles is: \u201cIt takes a long time to convert ADA into local currency as it is completely dependent on Binance\u2019s P2P market\u201d.
