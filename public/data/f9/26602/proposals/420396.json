One additional note, the protocol uses the monte carlo tree search algorithm for maintaining price stability. monte carlo is great if the input assumptions are gresat. however, a 10 year  or 5 year average of dollar / gold price marked up by 10% is not a convincing model. the past bull market past the 2007-2008 financial crisis itself lasted for a little more than 10 years now. the fundamentals of the project is not sound to me personally, having done statistics myself, though i am no economist. \n\ni cannot convince myself that this project will not face issues like terra over the long term, and it is likely to not achieve the impact it wishes to achieve, thus i will only rate this a 2. however, the vision to help the unbanked in asia is commendable.
