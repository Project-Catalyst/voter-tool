The main audience here is social enterprises in Vietnam, at first when I read the proposal, I found the idea to be macro-sized but gradually realized that it would have a specific impact on many people in the society. society, not just people working in the business field. The proposal identifies the problem to be solved through business, enhancing social impact via the Cardano blockchain. This adds value to the Cardano ecosystem, and it can scale to the challenge in the future (provided the proposal works in practice). I found the proposal well-written and organized, with clear methodological intent. If successful, it will be a premise for continuing to build a community to promote the adoption of the Cardano blockchain in the region. I understand that this proposal helps struggling social enterprises and investors find each other - based on great trust. This is a very good job, beneficial for both parties and society in general. When I read about the specific action idea of \u200b\u200bthe team, I find that a very good way to do it is through education to improve knowledge and wisdom. I fully endorse this set of ideas, given its impactful overview - I vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Through the proposal, the team consists of 3 members with experience in the field: Cardano blockchain, communication, and strategy. These experiences are suitable for carrying out the project. Not only that, but the members also publicize their identities through social networks (Linkined). This is very convenient to demonstrate the transparency and feasibility of the proposal. However, I have a question about the resources to implement the proposal: When the workload is very large, with the number of members of 3 people and the staff supporting the team, will they be able to handle and complete the work? ? What if the number of people required to execute exceeds the number of people you have planned? My suggestion is that the team can use the help of dedicated community members to work together. This not only completes the job well but also increases interactivity and spreads and advertises the proposal in the large community. But to do so, the team needs to balance finances and allocate the budget appropriately. Your current budget allocation is quite granular with work hours calculated. I completely agree with this. Can you detail the mechanism by which Stake pool owners donate % of profits to social enterprises? Or will that be made clear at the Open ISPO proposal implementation seminars? I acknowledge that the challenges and risks associated with the implementation you have outlined are entirely true to the current state of social enterprise and blockchain. In my opinion, the feasibility of this proposal is quite clear, the ideas I have mentioned are for reference purposes so that the team can implement the proposal more perfectly. I vote 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I like the way you mentioned the roadmap and the planned milestones. Specifically, it is associated with the month of a year. It is very convenient for the community to monitor and evaluate. This is also a great way to demonstrate transparency and auditability. The proposal is quite detailed and professional, proving that you have invested a lot of attention. Taking a closer look at transparency, do social enterprises and ADA owners tie their interests together by contract? Is it a smart contract or a traditional contract? If there is a contract between two subjects, do you think about the role of legal in the contract? Are contracts made between social enterprises and ADA owners legally recognized? My advice is that the team should carefully study the law before applying the proposal in practice. Because as far as I know, the legal system does not have specific regulations on cryptocurrencies and blockchain in real life. With the KPIs stated by the team, I find it reasonable (provided it exists within the legal framework). The rest of the proposal is a clear and understandable problem description.

This is a proposal in my opinion that is quite humane and has a lot of value for society\n\nThe team's solution is to use the SPO mechanism to deduct a certain percentage of the ADA obtained through staking to transfer to social enterprises. This is a fairly sustainable solution because as originally designed, the SPO will receive an average of 5% ADA per year, and this is stable over the lifetime of the Cardano Blockchain. Therefore, this can be a stable source of finance that social enterprises can rely on.\n\nEspecially the social enterprises chosen by the project are related to issues such as women, children, and mental health. These are vulnerable people and need to be supported by social enterprises. So if the project is put into operation, I believe it will make a huge impact.

A successful project will help social enterprises feel secure about funding for development, ADA owners will feel secure to contribute to trusted businesses, and also help the ADA ecosystem to develop more, more decentralized, practical applications.\nThe project is aimed at ADA holders who are staking in pools with a large amount of ADA, switching to staking in smaller pools, in order to optimize rewards. However, the probability of closing the block in small pools is lower, the reward is also less, can you explain more clearly the arguments to convince ADA holders to move? And what is the percentage of reward contribution to social enterprises? I can't seem to find that information in the proposal, hope the team can help.\nAnd does the project have a method for measuring how much ADA is under-optimized? How to know who owns the ADA and how to approach it so that both parties are comfortable?

At the same time, the ADA price fluctuates continuously, with high frequency and intensity, what plan does the project have to limit this drawback? Please share for me and the community to know.\nI am really impressed with the experience and competence of the team members. Everything is very suitable for project implementation. I see that the project calculates the required budget by working hours, each hour is 50 $, a fairly high-income figure in Vietnam, so the total budget is 30,500 $, accounting for ~ 12.2% of the total amount of the Challenge. Not to mention the things that have not been listed such as conference venue rental, incidental fees\u2026 In total, funding will account for a large proportion of the Challenge.
