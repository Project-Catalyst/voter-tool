As the interest continues to grow, is paramount that we remove any language barriers.", "f6_no_assessments": 14, "f6_rating": 3.2142857142857144, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1663, "q0": "In terms of impact, the proposal is perfect and meets the objectives of this challenge very well. We seek to fund projects that benefit both Asia and Cardano; and we know that one of the biggest problems faced in this context is the language barrier. Thinking about solving this, the creators of the game Flooftopia are suggesting to create a version of the game translated into Chinese, where both the issue of building the NPCs (Build-An-NFT) and the story itself of the game would be translated. This would definitely boost the game's adoption in the country in question. We know how popular NFT games are, and I believe that the purpose of this game is very different from the others, as the gameplay is adventure, world discovery, village construction, character evolution, etc.; ie a kind of RPG, I would say. Another differential point of this game is that it is suitable for all ages, that is, it is neither focused on a child audience nor on an adult audience, which would greatly increase the range of people who would be attracted to the project, and consequently introduced to Cardano. Proponents provide us with data that reinforce the importance of carrying out such a translation: \u201cWith more than 1.3 billion speakers (16% of the world's population), Chinese is the most spoken language globally. However, most NFT and/or game projects on Cardano represent a language barrier for Chinese users, as the vast majority of them are based in North America and Europe.\u201d In fact, both blockchain technology is more developed in these locations, as well as more specific approaches such as the creation of games, and especially games with these characteristics. I believe that with Flooftopia's translation, many goals of the challenge will be achieved, such as increasing the participation of the Cardano community in East Asia and also increasing active wallets (from what I understand the game would be free, but certainly some features and options would be paid - maybe to acquire a CNFT or to buy accessories for the doll, maybe some map elements, etc). That said, I believe the proposal deserves top marks in terms of impact. My only observation would be regarding the following excerpt: \u201cWe have many translator connections who are ready to provide the services, but funding is needed to keep these individuals employed by Flooftopia\u201d. It would be important for proponents to make it more explicit which connections these would be, how translators would be hired, etc., as I will comment in more detail in the following topic, on feasibility. In my view, all the main KPIs of the challenge would be met here, some of them being: \u201cThe number of proposals originating from East Asian participants in Project Catalyst + The quantity and quality of funded teams originating from East Asian + The observed impact of funded projects (meeting their KPIs) + Did we increase the participation of the Cardano community and Catalyst teams with East Asian residents?\u201d. In addition, one of the KPIs of the dApps challenge would also be met, as an existing integration (the game) would be improved and expanded to new audiences: \u201cIntegrations with other existing services, products, and protocols that improve the end-user experience whether that's giving the user more options or making something easier to use that benefits the wider ecosystem\u201d.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In my view, the way the information is presented, the proposal is not very viable, and I will argue why. Talking about the script first: in Q1 the actions of \u201chire a Chinese translator / translate Flooftopia website and coining functionality / start translating in-game dialogue\u201d would be done. How long would each activity take? Proponents claim they already have connections regarding translation, so probably hiring a Chinese translator wouldn't take that long. But we would need to know, for example, how many days he or she would be working on it, what their work routine would be like, how many hours a day, how the translation review would be carried out\u2026 In relation to the fourth quarter of the year, the missions would be translated and dialogues from the NPCs, that is, maybe what would be translated in the third quarter would be the platform and in the fourth the game itself? It would have been important if more details had been provided regarding the translation process in practice, how things would happen in everyday work. Regarding funding, I am a little concerned when they state that \u201cit is difficult to provide a detailed budget breakdown for this proposal as it will depend on how much dialogue the Flooftopia game has\u201d. In this case, we still don't know the exact amount of content to be translated? So how did they establish that the amount to be charged would be 7500 dollars? This amount would correspond to 6 months of work, as described in the script, which would correspond to the monthly payment of 1250 dollars. It is a high value, so we would need to know if the translator would dedicate himself full-time or part-time to the work, so that we have a more solid notion if what is asked is in fact fair. Regarding the volume to be translated, this also raises some doubt, since it may not have content for 6 months of full-time work - what would it look like, in that case? Would the remaining funds be used for another part of the project? Finally, by analyzing the team, we have a lot of information about the team members, those who work on the game, in one way or another. We know their names, CVs (in a very detailed way), what their areas of expertise are, if they have any relationship with Cardano (and if so, how)... However, the most important part would be to get to know the translator himself, who would be responsible for most of the work on this particular proposal. It would be necessary to understand if you are a person trained in the area, if you have previous experience with game translation, if you know something about Cardano (this is not mandatory, but it would be a differential). Unfortunately, not so much trust is passed as we don't know who would be chosen. With that, I think this topic is not necessarily bad; is ok but needs some significant changes.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Proponents say it is difficult to measure progress by roadmap, as changes and unforeseen events are very likely to happen. I agree with this statement, but I still think it is necessary for us to have some kind of monitoring of the translator's daily work. In my view, it would be interesting if the team defined the expectation of content that would be translated in 1 month, and at the end of this interval, a meeting could be held with the translator to keep us updated on what is being done. Was it possible to work as much as was planned, was there an impasse? The bridge between the translator and the rest of the game's development team remained firm during the month, was there a member of the team that helped the translator with specific doubts, referring to the particularities of the game? In my view, it is as important as measuring KPIs, knowing such information. They state that \u201cwe could use a more milestone-based approach to the ultimate goal of connecting the Chinese-speaking community with the rest of the Cardano Ecosystem in the NFT space.\u201d With this, they point out a series of KPIs that would be measured to measure progress, such as the number of Chinese-speaking users of the game, newly engaged users who previously did not play Flooftopia due to language differences, user satisfaction level speaking Chinese\u2026 Regarding this last metric, how would the measurement be made? Perhaps a quick satisfaction survey could be created, which would appear in the interface of the game itself, for this type of player (Chinese speaker) to report the presence of an error or suggest improvements, for example. I believe that the auditability of progress is good, even if not perfect. Turning now to the success scenario, this can be summarized as introducing Flooftopoia to the Chinese community more consistently, \u201cattracting more East Asian users who may have been discouraged from entering the CNFT gaming space due to language barriers / having a A solid number of users who have benefited from our language integration features would be a big indicator of success as we expand our impact on the community.\u201d I think the definition of success is quite adequate, what could be done was a better clarification of how this scenario would be perceived and proven. In my view, it would be valid if the proponents did a final survey, in order to demonstrate the increase in users in East Asia, the level of satisfaction, how this all impacted our blockchain, how many new wallets were created, how these new players would be discovering the cryptographic universe from Flooftopia and so on. For the aforementioned reasons, I evaluate the project's auditability as good, but not perfect.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 7, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1916, "q0": "Although the idea of translating any projects into non - English in East Asia is always a good idea, I do not see the proposer sharing the supporting data, such as how much the NFT-gaming user base in East Asia vs in the Western, etc and its relation with English proficiency in each country/language. With more and more projects in Cardano build by the western (English) team, I think we need more global solutions rather than using our Catalyst funds for each project to translate into another language.

Its aim is to integrate and engage Chinese speakers in this game, creating interconnection and value to Chinese community and ADA, which, theoretically, conforms the challenge objectives.\n\nThe real impact here is the problem. The MMO games are a well know by the need of cooperation among the players. Therefore, there are two possibilities here:\n1 \u2013 Creating a dedicated Chinese server: This was not mentioned, therefore I\u2019ll not consider this option; and\n2 \u2013 Having an international server: This is a problem to the proposal. Having a need to cooperate in the game in order to evolve, it\u2019s quite impossible to eliminate the language barrier by simply translating the NPC, quest etc. \n\nThat being said, I must say that having only an international server the translation won\u2019t be sufficient to generate engage and integrate Chinese community to ADA and the game itself.\n\nMore than that, Crypto is prohibited in China, which may be a problem to adopt this game. There are some countries which the Chinese live as well, however, this accounts to less than 4% of its community (counting people living in US which might speak English and, therefore, this project won\u2019t apply) (https://www.worlddata.info/languages/chinese.php).\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team is well defined and the proof was given.

It\u2019s not detailed, at least, and there is no part of the budget associated with this.\n\nThe budget is quite simple. It\u2019s being asked USD 7500 to translate content, not specifying how much it\u2019ll do (could be just the website, which is the priority on the list supplied, website + 1 or 2 NPC etc).

It should be added on the website, or create a place that the text is shown and people can criticize it (translation).\n\nThe KPI seems fair but there are no metrics, no aimed numbers (few thousand gamers in 1 year, few thousand players from Macau, X from hong kong etc), X NFT created in 1 year etc. Showing what you expect is good to verify the ambition and effort. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2298", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 1, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2414, "q0": "We have that the proposal in question addresses a game that has previously participated in Catalyst, which makes us wonder how this project is going and whether or not it has continued in its production.

In this way, we can see that the proposal in question has the possibility of causing an increase in the visibility of the Cardano ecosystem and thus is aligned with the objectives of the challenge in which it finds itself. The budget being requested for the translation also seems fair, considering the benefits that can be translated, given that a large part of the world's population speaks Chinese. However, it is also worth mentioning that the eventual non-success of this game would cause this proposal (and other similar ones) to end up not having the expected effect.

In the budget detailing section, it was explained that it is not possible to estimate the expenditure accurately, as it depends on the amount of dialogues present. However, we observed that the professionals involved are closely related to the production of the game, so it seems that it would be possible to provide some approximation on what would be the maximum amount of dialogues present in the game, consequently indicating what the expected cost ceiling would be. Regarding the project team, once again, they have excellent technical requirements. We were able to find experiences of these professionals in several areas that are complementary to the development of a successful game, such as marketing and narrative design.

This proposal is intended to expand and serve an audience in the East Asian market, so it fits well with the challenging setting posed.

Moreover, to translate languages \u200b\u200bfor each market, the game must have a large community in each language, which the new publisher should consider.

The estimated budget for funding in each submission is 7500 USD; combined, this is a significant amount. Currently, the new Flooftopia Project is in the early stages, and it is not necessary to apply for a fund for translation.

Thus, by suggesting that Chinese translation begin in Q3 of 2022, the timetable is ideal since alpha testing will be finished in Q4. Having said that, I would like it if the proposer provided a ballpark figure for the number of prospective users their Chinese translation might reach.

I am aware that the proposer could immediately conduct a survey or poll among their community to gather this data (as was already indicated in their success metrics section), but as of right now, the absence of information makes it difficult to assess how crucial it is to reach a Chinese-speaking audience. However, given that they are situated in America, it is also not a terrible idea to get in touch with as many users as you can. The fact that so many items will need to be translated\u2014including their website, their paper, the character dialogues, in-game guides, etc.\u2014makes me inclined toward accepting this idea.

It is not really useful to keep track of how many X words have already been translated from Y words when it comes to translation. It is considerably more beneficial to keep track of which tasks\u2014such as character dialogues, game menus, etc.\u2014have been accomplished.

The hourly salary could also be included in the proposal. The budget seems sufficient to me to translate everything. The intention is to take Flooftopia to a point of sustainability. It might be useful to come back for future funding to translate the game into other languages. A plan has been included stating what will be translated Q3 and Q4. This plan is certainly realistic to carry out everything on time. The roadmap with milestones describes what and how everything will happen. The main thing will be not to exceed this budget. The main risk is that financing must be provided in order to pay the translator. These translations are certainly achievable and will have a positive impact on the game.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A roadmap with clear milestones is included in the proposal. Work will be done in two quarters. In these two quarters, a translator will be appointed to translate the website and the game. The KPIs are included and are clearly measurable. It is good that these statistics will be easily traceable through surveys and polls among the target audience of Flooftopia. The petitioner has clearly described the language barriers to involving people from East Asia in CNFT gaming projects. Translating Flooftopia could be a first step towards better integration of these games built on the Cardano ecosystem. The project can be followed up well by the community,\nThe roadmap is the same as the 3 other proposals submitted. These different translations can then be done simultaneously.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2940", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10138, "q0": "This can happen. When the proposed team is having the idea of \u200b\u200ba billion-people market. When providing accessibility for CNFT game projects in East Asia, specifically China.

Set the premise to reach more Chinese to join the team game. The author's explanation is accompanied by specific examples and has strong arguments to complete this idea. By accelerating the reciprocal relationship between East Asia and the rest of the Cardano Ecosystem. By integrating Chinese into the Flooftopia project, the project will be able to attract users that were previously inaccessible due to language differences.\n\n   The idea team is also aware of the costs involved.

With this, I think the team can complete the idea on time and achieve high results.\n\n  But there is a note about the team's budget explanation. Can you explain each item using capital would be better?.

This helps to accurately measure the impact of the proposal on the best Chinese community. The project also highlights the positive effects of the proposed activity as well as the benefits this idea brings to the Cardano Ecosystem in the NFT space.

As stated by the author, chinese speaking communities are a very large market that would really benefit the caardano ecosystem with their participation. Flooftopia is an interesting game with many features that would teach users a lot about the world of NFTs and the cardano ecosystem as a whole. The many uses of cardano features within the game will be a great introduction to new crypto enthusiasts. As flooftopia is still in development, it is hard to know if the quality of the end project will be attractive enough to appeal to a lot of chinese users. But as it currently stands, the information provided on flooftopia is already very interesting to learn about NFTs and the different cardano features. I believe regardless of the success of the flooftopia game, translation into chinese will benefit growth and inclusivity of cardano in east asia.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As stated previously, the scope of chinese speakers that will join the cardano community through flooftopia is an unknown variable, as the flooftopia game is still in development itself. There should be no technical difficulties in translation, but the budget is vague, as the authors don't know the amount of content that will be translated. The budget seems arbitrary because of that. I think the team needs to plan for a more specific amount of content to be translated, and make amore appropriate budget with that. If it is still too early to have at least a general idea of content, then the team needs to focus on finishing flooftopia development before thinking of translating into any language. For these reasons, I think it is unwise to ask for funding at this stage, and they will most likely have to come back for funding later, so I cannot give them a very high feasiblity rating. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The progress of this project is hard to audit. The authors currently do not know the amountof content that will be needed to translate. It is hard for the cardano community to know if the requested funds were successfully used for translation.

The key metrics and goal are align with the outlined challenge settings and able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I think it is important to have a team already with detailed budget. It could be adjusted later, but it is not wise to put a number without details. There are so many expenses that could be listed down, like project managers working hours, how many translator that the proposer want to start with, the pay rate for each translator, etc. I think every translation project need to have a PIC for this task, so that this person can lead the process of the project from time to time and update it in a trackable platform by the community. In timeline detailed plan, the proposer need to have more detail timeline. How many months this translation will finished and it was written that the proposer will only hire a translator at Q3, I think it is too risky to have just one translator to translate flooftopia and too high budget ($7.500) for one translator only. I think in translation process in the game translation, the team need to have some people who can check the translation result from the translator. These people will make sure that the translation is correct and can be understood by the players in the future.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The Metrics/ KPIs should be about the translation process for now. It is not about the user or the player for the game. Metrics/ KPIs that was written at this proposal can be fit after the game launched in the future.

It is not about the game adoption yet for now. I think the team could also add github or any open platform to report the progress of the translation, so that our community can track and see the translation progress from time to time.

To remove the language barrier for players the team came up with the solution to provide Chinese language integration to attract more Chinese users, thus expanding the impact of the game and the Cardano Ecosystem. It's not an idea with a strong creative ethos, but it certainly fits the challenge's propositions. The author plans to provide Chinese language integration for both Build-An-NFT functionality and the game itself to expand the target audience. With the team's Chinese integration into the Flooftopia project, they will be able to attract users that were previously inaccessible due to language differences. But I find this solution very vague, I think this proposal should go into detail explaining how to integrate the language into the game?, How long does it take to translate from English to Chinese? , Who will translate the dialogue in the game?... I think this lack of specificity will become a very significant problem for the project to become viable.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "When I read about the information of the people working on the project, I found the project very feasible. I believe in the experience of the group, the information of the members provided through LinkedIn is clear and detailed. But I didn't appreciate the detailed budget breakdown and roadmap part of the proposal. I think the proponent should come up with a more detailed plan to deal with the work leads, which will affect the audit process of the project. The implementation of the project should be divided into more specific timelines corresponding to the goals achieved, the team should divide the work progress by a week or at least by month. Quarterly progress will be very general and elusive. For example: In the third quarter of 2022, what month of the quarter does the team propose to hire a Chinese interpreter? What Number of interpreters?, Translate the Flooftopia website and mint function for how long?... I think the more specific a roadmap of tasks associated with time is, the easier it is for the community to track and evaluate the feasibility of the project. The group budget analysis is also very general, and difficult to evaluate. The budget requested by the team is $7500 to pay for the Chinese translation work. But I think the team should go into the cost analysis for each sub-item. For example, how much does it cost for 1 hour of translation? or does the team pay the cost of translating by day/month or by in-game dialogue?. In my opinion, the team should add information to the roadmap and budget to make the proposal more feasible.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In the proposal, I see no mention of a roadmap with milestones and timeframes for achievement. The team only provides metrics that can be measured through the number of Flooftopia users from Chinese-speaking communities, the number of new users joining Flooftopia who have not previously joined, and the level of user satisfaction. Flooftopia. They measure these quantities through surveys and polls. I think it is very difficult for the community to check the progress of the project. As for success metrics, it would be better if the success metrics include measurable goals, such as having 300+ users or more than 70% of users satisfied with the product (from survey ). Quantitative numbers will make your proposal a lot better.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3235", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14788, "q0": "Because this proposal has almost the same content as the other 3 proposals of the team in the same challenge (99% similarity). So this assessment of mine can be close to my assessments for those 3 proposals.\n\n- Developing NFT games and translating them into Chinese could be a way for Chinese speakers who don't speak English to participate in Game Flooftopia while also participating in Cardano (Chinese is the language with the most number of users in the world). But there are a few issues with the impact of this proposal.\n1. This is a game that is still in development. The gameplay of the game is still not clearly defined. So it is difficult to know if this is an NFT game that can attract community participation or not.\n2. The project has not yet built or developed the community and has no product, so the impact of the proposal is difficult to determine.\n3. The majority of people who can access NFT games and participate in NFT games are young people. Young people in China today, English is not a problem for them. Recently, the NFT games on the market only have English language, but I have not seen any problems with players. A lot of players in China do not know English but can still play NFT games because the features in the game are usually not too difficult to understand.\n4. In my opinion, translating a game into Chinese won't bring as much value as focusing on creating a great product. Take Axie Infinity as an example, Axie Infinity does not build games in many languages \u200b\u200b(only English) but the development of Axie Infinity in Asian countries recently is very large. So translating the game into Chinese can't have too much of an impact on Cardano's growth in East Asia.\n\n- To show the impact of the proposal better, I have some advice:\n1. This NFT game needs to be completed and published in mainnet before translating it into other languages. The team also needs to have a significant amount of people involved in the game and include that information in the proposal to demonstrate the proposal's ability to have a big impact. If the team has completed the game and has a large enough community, translating the game into other languages \u200b\u200bcan prove to be an impact on the community.\n2. Proposer needs to clarify who the players of this project are in order to analyze if they have language problems. How many people know only Chinese but don't know English? Do players really have difficulty in the game if they do not know English? Is there a way to design the game interface so that people who don't know English can still play the game?\n3. Proposer should also state how the proposal will help develop Cardano in East Asia. How many people will create new wallets? How many people buy and sell NFT on the game? What is the achievable trading volume?", "q0r": 2, "q1": "- The detailed plan of the proposal is very sketchy. Proposer only gives a quarterly plan but no specific implementation tasks. Job descriptions for each team member are also not mentioned in the detailed plan.\n- The team has many proposals in this fund but also does not explain how the team will implement all these proposals.\n- Budget breakdown of the project is also not shown in detail. The team also doesn't really know what their workload is to calculate the cost.\n- Information of team members is listed very specifically and linkedin is attached. This is a proposal to translate English to Chinese. But I don't see any team members with Chinese translation experience.\n- The project is still in the development stage, there is no mainnet or testnet version yet. So it will be difficult to translate the game into Chinese when the game is not finished\n\n- To improve the feasibility of the proposal, I have some advice for the proposer:\n1. Proposer should submit this proposal after the project's game has been completed or the mainnet is available. Because if there is no game but the team wants to translate the game, it is difficult to prove the possibility of the proposal's success\n2. The detailed plan needs to be more specific. What are the specific tasks that need to be done? What is the monthly plan? What is the job of each member with relevant experience? After completing the translation, what is the marketing plan for the Japanese market?\n3. Proposer needs to determine exactly how many words need to be translated in the game. Because translation costs will usually be calculated on the number of words translated. If the team hires a translator, what is the monthly cost for that person? How many hours a day do they work?\n4. The members who directly implement this proposal need to have detailed information about their experience to prove the team's ability to implement this proposal.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "- The team measures the proposal process with the following metrics:\nThe number of users of Flooftopia originated from Japanese-speaking communities.\nThe number of users newly engaged in Flooftopia that were not previously engaged due to language differences.\nThe level of satisfaction among Flooftopia users\u2019 experience with the Build-An-NFT process and the game in Japanese.\n- These metrics can be measured by surveys and polls in the game. But these are metrics that can be measured after the project's game is released, not the project's progress.\n- The above metrics are also only used to measure the results of the proposal implementation and marketing results, but cannot be used to measure the project's progress.\n- To measure the project's progress, the team needs to provide a way to measure the progress of the team's translation work such as: The first month will complete translating new player instructions, the second month will complete the dialogue translation in games, ...... and how to test and measure those work results.\n- Therefore, this proposal is very difficult to audit the process of the proposal", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_4100", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Flooftopia will provide Chinese language integration to engage more Chinese users (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, etc), thereby broadening the impact of the game and the Cardano Ecosystem.", "experience": "Coding: Dirk\nGame Programmer: Simon\nArt: Christian\nStory: Chris\nMarketing: Conward\nGame Design: Alex\n2D-3D Artist/Animator: Oleg\nLighting Artist: Lena\nStrategic Advisor: Marcin\n(Additional Team Detail Below)"}
