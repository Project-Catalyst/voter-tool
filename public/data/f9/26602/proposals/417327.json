They will also update the Japanese translations previously implemented for Flint and Yoroi wallets.\n\nThe impact of translating these wallets into Japanese, means making them available to a greater user base, who at the moment have little choice regarding which wallet they can use. Basically, it will allow more Japanese community members to use these wallets comfortably. \n\nThe presenters have years of experience in creating translations related to Cardano and blockchain technology an have previously already translated the Yoroi and Flint wallets into Japanese.\n\nThey have already started communicating with the wallet developers for their cooperation in the implementation of the translated materials which shows their determination and commitment to the success of this project. In the event that one of these parties is unable or unwilling to implement a language toggle (which is unlikely as they have worked with them in the past) they will create guide documents with the translated text to be used as reference by the users and make it available on their own depository.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As the presenters have already implemented similar projects in the past, they have laid out a clear step by step timeline for this proposal. The budget could perhaps be broken down a bit more with a few morel details but seems reasonable in terms of what needs to be done, cost and how long it takes to do it . \n\nThe team is more than qualified to undertake and complete the project as they have been working on Japanese translations for the Cardano ecosystem for over 5 years. They have translated and provided support for multiple Wallets, including Yoroi and Flint.\nI think listing who the team members are, on the proposal directly or on their website, would bring a better sense of legitimacy and confidence for voters who are unfamiliar with their prior work.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The timeline and milestones for the project have been presented in an explicit manner. The team will update the progress of the translation and implementation of the specific wallets on their website, so it should be very easy to audit for the KPIs. Any community member or verifying auditor can check the progression and execution of the project as it develops.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2207", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4038, "q0": "This is a simple yet extremely necessary and well-structured proposal. Japanese speaking users that don't fully understand English have a hard time using Cardano wallets, such a basic and essential tool, as they don't possess Japanese translation or when they do those translations are not very accurate. The proposal is to provide Japanese translations for Nami and Eternl wallets, and to update the Japanese translations previously implemented for Flint and Yoroi wallet. This will open the doors and bring more people from Japan to the Cardano environment. As a side effect, at a later time, there will be more stake pool operators based in Japan and more proposals coming from there. In other words, the goals of the proposal strongly align with the ones from the campaign.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers are part of the L10NMODE team led by Leo King. They provide a link to their website, a short description of Leo's experiences but no LinkedIn links or any equivalents. Their website provides little information as well but the fact that they have already translated the Flint and Yoroi wallets is utterly relevant and it is a remarkably desirable experience. It is not clear from the proposal, however, who exactly will be participating in this project. In addition, the budget is broken down into two major costs, the translation and update of the four wallets mentioned previously, which account for USD 3700 and the assistance of the wallets' teams in implementing the texts, which accounts for USD 1500. This sums up to USD 5200 which is pretty reasonable, however in the requested funds section they claimed USD 6200 (which I believe was a typo). Moreover, the timetable provided is realistic and the duration of each stage is in line with the amount of work of that phase. Finally, the team did a pretty good job at describing its main risk and offering a mitigating solution. It could be that the parties are unable or unwilling to implement the Japanese texts. To cope with that, first the team will offer cooperation to achieve their objective, but if that doesn't work, they will construct a Japanese guide document that users can refer to while using the English interface.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap provided is very clear and straightforward. The team divides the plan in four steps, which are basically connecting to the relevant parties, translating the texts, implementing the translations and reviewing and fixing bugs. Each phase has apparent and reasonable time horizons. Additionally, the proposer does not precisely define KPIs. Instead, they basically claim progress can be measured by the achievement of the milestones. As a suggestion they could have defined rate of wallet creation in Japan after their translations are in place and usage of the Cardano wallets by Japanese speaking people as metrics of success. Moreover, by describing the burden of not being able to set up wallets because of language barriers the proposal gave an understandable description of the targeted problem. Furthermore, they opportunely stated they will regularly post updates of the project on their website (http://lionmode.io), which is great for auditability.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2513", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4441, "q0": "Loved this idea! Since the eastern hemisphere have lots of non-English speakers, it would be great if some Cardano's light wallet can be translate to some most used language in our community. In this proposal, proposer want to translate to Japanese language. (Mostly) We all know that Japan had strong Cardano's community, with this kind of work it surely will attract more Japanese users to choose Cardano's light wallet options.\n\nGreat thing in this proposal: Proposal are aware of some risk of their work like \"the first parties is unable or unwilling to quickly implement the Japanese text and there is no option for us to directly apply the text to their Github repository.\" And they have a solution (back up plan) about this risk. Nice!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Really love how they explain what will the team do in their timeline. All of detail information about what kind of works will they do is already well-explained.\nSince the team members are not exposed in the proposal, the only way to check is from their website. Sadly there's nothing about them in the website too. I guess it is about privacy thing (don't want to get doxxed).\n\nAnd for the budget I think there's some thing to clarify again as Proposer broken down the budget in total of $5,200 but the requested fund is $6,200. There's $1,000 difference in there. I guess the $1,000 over budget will be use for Contingency Budget. But again, please double check it, maybe the proposer forget to add that.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Since the purpose of this proposal are translating 4 most downloaded Cardano's light wallet in Japan, that's the only success metric in the proposal.

In light of this, the \u201cJapanese support for wallet\u201d project is a promising initiative with so much potential in advancing user participation from the Japanese community and also increasing the holders of the Cardano coin. The prepositions from this scripts is to make available  Japanese translations for Nami and Eternl wallets, and also update the Japanese translations implemented for Flint and Yoroi wallet. The core scope of this project is a clear intent to onboard more people from the Japanese community through this initiative and also project the Cardano ecosystem as a more inclusive community. Aside that, this project could serve as a reference point to enter other economies or communities with language differences but assures a large audience. Apart from that, I am also impressed with the team's anticipation of the challenge likely to be faced with this project and the solutions offered. Ideally, this project requires some level of partnership and networking with key stakeholders, therefore I am impress the proponent captures this in the solution to the expected risk. Additionally, the proposer clearly points out the target population of the project but fail to indicate how to market the project to the Japanese community upon completion.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer cites an estimated cost of $3700 for full English-to-Japanese translation of Eternl and Nami as well as completion, revision, and updating of the English-to-Japanese translations items like Flint and Yoroi. However I prefer a breakdown of the cost for full English-to-Japanese translation of Eternl and Nami. Definitely the translation of these including Flint and Yoroi wallet comes at a different cost. For the purpose of future reference by other developers, I wish the team provides a separate cost for each item. This would clear all doubt on any transparency issues. Aside that, there are some inclusion needed at the budget section. Based on the work of the team, an administrative cost, marketing cost(if the team consider it necessary to advertise the project) and team cost is needed here. Therefore I prefer a refined version, consistent with these concerns. Much can\u2019t be said of the team experience, because the team has already established its brand with the execution of its previous  project as indicated in the scripts. Aside that, the profile of the team from the link provided looks very comprehensive and very detailed. The team\u2019s track record with previous projects within the catalyst space confirms their capacity to execute this project. Worth noting is the roadmap for the project, a well defined approach to the activities required for the project's completion. The roadmap provides thorough description of what needs to happen within specific timeframe along the roadmap to project execution. However, like I  said at the impact section, the provision of marketing strategy would help communicate or bring much awareness to the Japanese community on the introduction of this project. Hence I suggest the team include a marketing strategy with a marketing expert along with a budget for it.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditability \nThe milestone presented here, as cited within the feasibility and the auditability section \u2014 \"full English-to-Japanese translation of Eternl and Nami , completion, revision, and updating of the English-to-Japanese translations for Flint and Yoroi\u201d, are all relevant information in measuring the progress and success of the project. However, considering the whole expected success of the project \u2014 ensuring each of the 4 target light wallets has complete and accurate Japanese support, and the wallets are actually downloaded and used by the Japanese community. I would recommend a more accurate KPIs to measure the progress and success of the project after it's launch. In this regard, we could look at, the number of downloads, the volume of transactions on the platform and the feedback from the use of the platform. These are both quantitative and qualitative metrics that provides a more accurate and definite results in determining the progress and success of the project. Other than these observations on the auditability, I am satisfied with the mechanism to ensure that all information on the progress and success of the project are made available to the community\u2013that\u2019s to update them on their website.

Next, the budget section and the introduction of team members are also provided very superficially. We know $3700 for the English to Japanese translation.
