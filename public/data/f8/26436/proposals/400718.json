To name those few are Harmony with their Horizon bridge, Solana with Wormhole, Gnosis Chain with OmniBridge, and maybe NEAR with their Rainbow bridges or Octopus Network later. NFT is one of the highest-valued sectors in crypto with tons of potential use-cases. It is a sub-industry within crypto space that probably be most responsible and contributing to making general population aware about cyrpto in the last 2 years. I believe being able to bridge ERC-721/ERC-1155 to Milkomeda will bring myriad of values to Cardano ecosystem. NFT projects in other chains will want to leverage various Cardano\u2019s advantages of being relatively low-cost and economical to perform transactions, while also being secured and safe. Interoperability is one of the biggest themes in crypto and we have seen interoperability-focused chains like Cosmos, Harmony, or NEAR enjoying high growth in value and adoption these past months. I trust that Cardano needs to be in the game and secure a good portion of this bridging niche. If this proposal is successfully voted for implementation, I think this will be one of the highest returning Catalyst funds invested by the community in the past few funds.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Long time Cardano community members have known dcSpark and its team as a trusted and delivering developers. They have given us both essential and complementary infrastructures to our blockchain from the very beginning until the present day. Considering their accomplishment in Milkomeda, I have little doubt about their technical ability to resolve the challenges they will meet while trying to deliver this proposal. Budget is well within range and very reasonable when contemplating the values this proposal can bring and share to Cardano ecosystem. The planned timeline shall also be well within reach and projecting the result within 2022 is highly desirable. The reason I cannot rate higher on this particular aspect is due to the lack of description regarding the dcSpark representatives who will lead the implementation of this proposal. I also suggest some extra details on the technical side and some educating information will give more conviction to people towards supporting this proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Roadmap is clear and acceptable with key objectives that need to be achieved being stated. However key metrics and indicators are lacking which will make evaluation somewhat tough. I suggest dcSpark to consider surveying the Cardano developer communities to gauge the level of interest and enthusiasm of the bridging solution. Maybe they can also give us a kind of projection on the number of NFT projects migrating to or arising in Milkomeda during the first 6 or 12 months, willing testnet participants, or committed partnering entities to develop the solution. This will give the community clearer representation on what to expect and elevating the chance of being chosen for implementation.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_943", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2660, "q0": "This would be absolutely game changing for the Cardano Blockchain.

I do worry about the native tokens from the Ether chain not playing nice with the Cardano block chain. The problem seems very broad considering the grand scope of total NFTs in the ether chain space. The fact that you have not started researching ideas worries me a little, but because of the previous fact I stated I believe in your vision.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I would like to see this project broadcast over the social media space in addition to the above stated milestones as progress.

One of these is Milkomeda, the Cardano sidechain, which will allow ERC20 token conversion from Ethereum to Cardano. dcSpark now intends to broaden these capabilities to also include not just tokens from Ethereum, but also NFT\u2019s, via ERC721 or ERC1155 conversion.\nThe proposers do not explicitly say how this proposal benefits the Cardano ecosystem, but it is easy to see how allowing people to move their assets, including NFT\u2019s from Ethereum with its insane gas prices to Cardano could be a huge boost to our ecosystem. \nAs a recommendation to the proposers: it would be worth mentioning the benefits of the proposal explicitly, for the benefit of voters and CA\u2019s and to avoid being given a low score because of the missing information as per the CA guide. \nThe proposers outlined as a risk that there may be some fundamental technical limitations to what can be ported from Ethereum to Cardano, but these need to be explored first before it can be stated definitely that something cannot be done about it.\nTo reiterate, this proposal aims to expand Cardano\u2019s cross chain capabilities with Ethereum, so this proposal definitely addresses the challenge effectively. Score: 5.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have provided a timeline which includes the broader scope of Milkomeda\u2019s conversion functionalities and the bottom line is that by the end of Q3 of 2022, we should have the capacity to bring NFT\u2019s to Cardano from Ethereum, which sounds feasible, given that the ERC20 converter will go live in about a month. \nThe budget is broken down into 3 separate parts, for a total of 20000 USD. To be honest, for the benefit this project will bring and the possible hurdles to finishing it, I feel like 20k is a very low sum, but of course I do not know the details of what needs to be done on top of the work that\u2019s already been completed so far.\nRegarding the team, as mentioned in the beginning, the people behind this proposal are a company called dcSpark which is well known in the Cardano ecosystem. As a recommendation, I think it would be useful to always share a link to your site (https://www.dcspark.io/) so that voters can easily see who you are and maybe to list a few of your achievements, just to make it more convincing. It would also be worthwhile to assign a person of contact for the Catalyst proposal, mention them in the proposal itself and share a social media account, so anyone from the community can reach out and contact them at any time.\nTo sum up, I believe this proposal is highly likely to be implemented successfully. Score: 5.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The Auditability section unfortunately offers very little information, leaving us to fill in the gaps, which is not ideal. It\u2019s mentioned that progress can be tracked by checking that the items in the timeline are implemented accordingly, but what the community wants to see here are specific key progress indicators. To make sure you cover this, you can set simple trackable targets such as: 3 (for example) commits per week in the project\u2019s github (which will be announced via social channels), monthly updates on the proposal\u2019s progress etc. \nSuccess is defined broadly as well: \u201cmany projects released on Milkomeda and Cardano that depend on bridging ERC721/ERC1155 assets across chains\u2026\u201d. Unfortunately \u201cmany\u201d is not a clear term and people might take issue with the lack of clear targets here, so my recommendation is that you set a few, even if they are just very rough estimations. If you have any information about any NFT project planning to cross once this bridge is done for example, share that as a target.\nDue to the missing targets that I mentioned, I can only give a score of 4, but I am quite certain that the community can work with dcSpark to obtain the necessary information if the proposal is funded.\nKeep up the good work!", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_546", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10020, "q0": "Many NFT artist are well established in ETH or other blockchain based on ERC-721 / 1155 simply due to being first in the market. However the trend and growth of Cardano cNFT are growing. There is potential to consider many NFTs migrating to Cardano for the available marketplaces and community. \nIn addition once the metaverse worlds grow in popularity and portals are identified to help bring avatars and personal items into multiple metaverse, the need to transport any assets from one blockchain to the other safely with a secure method to lock the original and issue a secured single copy that is based on a trustless smart-contract bridge between the 2 blockchains. \nI foresee the impact to be a postiive cross-chain initiative and fits well in the challenge described.
