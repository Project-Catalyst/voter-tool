Catalyst has its own rules and learning curve that could be smoothed out by ambassadors. Since the proposer is intending to coordinate these efforts, we could probably do with a little more information about how the program will be managed, and how collaborative efforts will be handled. Will it be handled like sales team contractors? Can anyone bring in a bounty, or do they have to be vetted through the coordination process?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "My concern with the project as proposed is with the team formation process. A finder's fee model would seem to lend itself better to open solicitation from community members who may happen to have connections to projects on other chains. If we're putting together teams of specific individuals, what will the \"hiring\" criteria be? And what's the ideal number of people to assign to the task given that there are only 10 slots, so to speak? The project notes the risk of hyper-competition, but what about maintaining morale for the \"slower\" headhunters. Does everyone give up after 10? Is it banked and carried over to the future in case funds are refreshed? How do you keep those people around? Volunteer enthusiasm can cover some of the gaps, but it shouldn't be counted upon.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "With the sales contractor-like model being proposed here, it's worth considering why marketers are generally paid in closed sales and not points of contact, or for bringing someone to the floor for a demonstration. It's easy to game that system. Points of contact are great, but they're not easy to audit. Proposals submitted to Catalyst are great, but they don't tell us anything about the quality of who is submitting, or if the projects are legitimate. There's potential here, but there's still a little too much abstraction.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1251", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "This was really good feedback.

I found this problem, suitable to solve future challenges. And if it can be scaled up, that's great. in the solution section. the group's solutions are, to coordinate the actions of active Catalyst members, who are also \"one foot in another chain. I find the solution the group has come up with to address the issues of the challenge. However, the solution gives a very sketchy idea, not convincing to the community. The solution has not provided any specific research evidence, I hope there will be a report. A more complete solution report, on the part of risk management proposed by the group, has mentioned potential risks but has not yet outlined plans to specifically address those risks. In addition, I would like to add In addition, the team must find more ways to communicate better advertising.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "In the description provide a detailed plan and timeline. The proposed group has raised issues but has not given specific timelines. There is no plan to complete the mentioned work. The project progress has not yet outlined a plan for the community to monitor and monitor. I hope the team focuses on researching to give a more detailed report. with a budget of less than 5% of the full challenge budget and already divided into four categories, I think it also doesn't make sense because the budget hasn't been spent above any actual amount, with the team Currently there is a member who has not been assigned a specific task, although the experience is good, has verified his identity with an intellectual property certificate, has a reference link, but I think only 1 member is too few. compared to the workload, hope the team will come up with a more complete report for the project", "q1r": 2, "q2": "In the description, measure the progress and development of the project.

That will increase the persuasion to the community. project success. not clearly stated and no specific results to be achieved. The success of the project is not yet related to the challenge. More specifically, the new project is stopping at the idea, but has never been tested, in terms of capital because this is an enhancement project for the following fund's project, so it has not been funded. Although all the presentation is a bit sketchy but this is also a good idea.

Catalyst is channeling $400k into cross-chain collaborations on Fund 8 and if passed, Fund 9 will dedicate $900k into this effort. This may motivate protocols to send a proposal for expansion on to Cardano, only IF they know about it. In that sense, networking and outreach could aid in getting the word out. One of the metrics to measure in this Challenge is \"Number of proposals including participants from other blockchain communities\" and this proposal, if successful, would increase the number of proposals for Fund 9.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer, Tomi Astikainen, is one of the starters for this Fund 8 Challenge. We can see that this Challenge has already ushered in other protocols like KILT, a parachain on Kusama, to send their proposal to Catalyst. This information could be shared in the section on team members to display his effectiveness in delivery.\n\nMoving on to the proposal itself, as the proposed solution to the lack of education problem is to \"coordinate the efforts and incentivize the needed actions\", I find it hard to see how the incentive structure effectively solves the problem. What if more than 10 proposals are submitted by other chains/protocols? How would the $1,000 be used for coordination efforts? As there are only 3 actions(coordination of efforts through Telegram group, encouraging and educating people to reach out, reporting on chains/communities contacted), is the $1,000 also a token of appreciation? Or is it meant for education material, strategic plans,etc? More elucidation on the budgeting aspects would help the proposal. The proposal also seems to lack an implementable plan on how best to approach a project or chain.

It seems like the proposer is projecting 10 proposals from other chains. Including this would be helpful. It is possible to track the progress of the program as it will be done on Telegram. This openness would be amazing for the community. An After Townhall event and a final report would also be helpful for Catalyst members, but could possibly be unnoticed by outsiders. As the problem looking to be solved is the lack of education, this could hinder the success of the program.
