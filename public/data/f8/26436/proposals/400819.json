The name seems to fit within Cardano's community: Cohort, Catalyst, Guild, etc. I could not tell if it meant the produced reports would be freely available, or require additional funds to reach (eg paywall) as is often the case with scientific research journals.  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal reflects the Fund's own model which I take to be a good sign that it can offer feedback into this process, which seems to have need for it; however, as it is so new it could be more helpful to have enumerated specific areas of focus as there is so much going on just figuring out might be a proposal in itself (and necessary for such a proposal as this to succeed in the first place, unfortunately). Such as it is, even though it represents an ideal representation of how to achieve the desired effect, there's so much proposed as objectives it is not clear if it could all be done (dilineating scoped tasks sets may help) by so few (no offense, this is really concise proposal with clearly good reasoning), or that the output would be useful to Catalyst as only research papers and not also in more palatable forms easier for more people to read (including multi-language support). ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "*Check the end of the previous assessment for some discussion of auditability. Other than that, by integrating with UN Sustainable Development Goals criteria not only is auditability improved but new ways for other proposals to improve their own audibility is included. Specifically if such metrics could be quantisized and provided as a part of the Guild formation to serve as an example for other proposals and the ecosystem could be helpful.

This proposal is judged partly through its individual merits, and partly through the way it fits into the wider Research Guild framework. My assessment takes into account aspects common across all proposals (the network\u2019s organizational aspects, competency, research approach, workload, or similar reporting mechanisms and budget logic). You shall therefore find common parts across these proposals and parts specific to each proposal.\n\nKey takeaway: spot on problem identification, perfect alignment with the challenge, tremendous potential for added value for Cardano if the report is shared with the community and thoroughly digested by future proposers before designing cross-chain solutions. \n\nThis proposal aims to deliver a 20-50 pages report on cross-chain collaboration, focusing on the challenges and solutions across blockchains and within Cardano and Project Catalyst. Having in mind Cardano\u2019s research-driven ethos, there are incredibly valuable insights that such a community-driven research would bring for future projects, for instance (1) removing guesswork, (2) identifying knowledge gaps, (3) challenging false assumptions or (4) offering off the shelf SWOT material. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Key takeaway: A solid academic-oriented team behind the proposal, a clear plan and recruitment process for the actual researchers and a reasonable timeline for completion. Good value for money.\n\nThe plan. The core team consists of 3 PhD / PhD candidates from Auckland University, Renmin University respectively University of Osnabr\u00fcck, all currently undergoing blockchain-oriented activities. They would NOT conduct the research themselves, but instead they would extend invitations to their networks of academic and professional colleagues to participate in the actual research. Perhaps the standout of the team is the wide-net that they can cast within their own respective networks when searching for viable research candidates. They would subsequently undergo a recruitment / selection process based on received resumes / review of academic work published / blockchain experience. The actual work itself would be undertaken by this collective of independent researchers onboarded as above. \n\nBudget talk. 20% of the budget would go towards building the research network (research identification, outreach, project management, support, designing reporting templates, etc.). 80% of the budget would go to creating tailored research projects following a loosely based pathway which makes sense considering the knowledge-building capacity of the project. Payment for individual researchers would follow a determined base hourly rate, based on the average of online surveys already undertaken. There are extensive figures offered in the proposal, but the key figure to remember is the overall base pay of USD 32/hour and US 60/hour for highly specialized work.\n\nThe team estimates that the report will take four months to complete: from May 2022 until August 2022. There is a detailed project roadmap outlined in the proposal, with great granularity down to weeks necessary for each intermediary step.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Key takeaway: very clear roadmap and extensive KPI list, great verification potential and clear communication channels for work undertaken.\n\nThis work will be delivered in the form of a public report with key research insights and recommendations that can be implemented by the community immediately, or pursued through future Project Catalyst funding proposals.\n\nThe project team will approach auditability in three ways: (1) establishing a set of project indicators, (2) engaging in internal peer review processes for each deliverable and (3) engaging in Project Catalyst community advisor review processes. \n\nSuccess would be measured 20% through the success of establishing a research network and 80% on the report itself. The KPI list for both items above is extensive and quite possibly very challenging to implement in practice, but they are definitely an excellent starting point.
