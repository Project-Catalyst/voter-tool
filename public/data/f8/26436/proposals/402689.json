At best a coin flip.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The biggest flaw here is that the roadmap doesn't include a timeline with target dates. In the end, either the pool will exist or it won't.

To take funds from Catalyst to finance a mechanism that is ultimately remunerative almost exclusively for the stake pool operator is not in line with the overall purpose of the Catalyst funding mechanism. \n\nErgo can simply be bought on an exchange - there is no real added utility to the Cardano ecosystem by allowing staking rewards to be paid out in Ergo. This sort of mechanism would appeal only to a very small and specific cohort of ADA holders. \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "It is very feasible to accomplish this task.

In the solution section, the proposer writes only 2 lines to describe the idea for his proposal. So I went to the proposer's website to find more information. Overall, the proposal offers a model similar to current ISPO operations on Cardano. The difference here is that users will stake their ADA into the proposer's pool and use the staking rewards to exchange for ERG coins. This proposal only fit a small part of the challege's criteria. The proposal will open the door to better exchange between ADA and ERG. Those who want to own ERG but dont want to buy in the market or dont want to lost transfer fee to buy ERG at CEX exchanges and then transfer to their wallet, that's is great thing of proposal . But It's just a one-way expansion from Cardano to Ergo, the proposer needs more solutions in the opposite direction. ERG holders who want to exchange ERG for ADA will do so through the proposer's Dapps. The risk of this proposition lies in determining the ADA/ERG conversion rate at the end of each epoch. To avoid risks and transparency in the exchange rate, the proposer needs to develop additional solutions on price determination (Oracles).

If this has not been clarified, 12 weeks to complete the proposal would be inadequate.\nFunding requests will be breakdown for development activities.

However, the proposer needs to provide more ways to track the exchange and withdrawal from ADA to ERG.\nSuccessful proposal when ADA holders want to own ERG through redeeming stake rewards. I'd love to see this success, but in the fair measure, it will be difficult to determine what the success of the proposal will be.
