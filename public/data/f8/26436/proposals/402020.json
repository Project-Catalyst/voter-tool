People openly seeking education (using the proposed website) and wanting to learn from one another (engaging in the proposed discord group) have the potential to create strong bonds even when they come from different chains. \nBlockchain courses are indeed chain-specific. Having a platform that provides multi-chain courses will benefit up and coming developers and the community members. Developers will be able to better understand how other chains works and will be in a better position to create better cross chain dapps. The community that take these courses will also have a better understanding of other chains and they may be more likely to build bridges when engaging with members form other chains. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The budget is pretty straightforward and sensible with the main the main portion (43%) going to the instructors for the creation of lessons. This makes sense since this initiative is all about teaching and they will need teachers to teach. A minor drawback relating to the budget is that the proposer used a rounded amount in the \u201cRequested funds in USD\u201d part instead of the actual amount. Because of this, the funds requested does not equal the budget breakdown. I would recommend that since they have an accounting guy (Raymond Visser) onboard, he is involved in the budgeting process to provide pertinent accuracy. This is to avoid possible negative remarks on the proposal. \nThere are reference links to all of the team members and they are multi-skilled. There skills include accounting, education and IT. All of them are involved in the Cardano community in some way, either by creating music NFTs, Cardano articles on Medium or being a team member on a Cardano project.  \nThe team has already created a sleek website. They have on-boarded first instructors. One the instructors is none other than Bucky Roberts from the thenewboston(https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston) who has 2.6 million subscribers and 4,442 videos at this time of writing. Getting him on board is huge for this initiative as not only does he have a massive following but he is also an excellent educator.

The virtual teaching source they plan to use, themeum.com, has excellent reviews from Trustpilot (4.6 from 61 reviewers, https://www.trustpilot.com/review/themeum.com). \nRegarding their crypto-friendly platform on discord, I have a suggestion regarding some channels channels:\n#bitcoin2cardano\n#polkadot2cardano\n#xblockchain2yblockchain\nBasically the idea is to have groups for people from blockchain X who want to learn blockchain Y.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1602", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 1, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5946, "q0": "The proposer has identified a problem and a solution to the problem and the proposal seems to fot into the challenge brief for some sort of education. It will be more interesting if one of its goals will focus on the interaction between 2 or more communities from different blockchains.

My opinion is that a marketing specialist is required for taking care of promoting activities and some people for administrative tasks.\n\nThe budget is broken down into identifiable items and seems reasonable to achieve the set goals. (it is not clear if additional funding is required)\nIn my opinion the proposer has not considered some challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation (being a free for all service how it will be sustained? Sponsored courses have some limitations as they are promoted on their native platforms mostly.) Another aspect to be taken into consideration, data protection (GDPR and other constrains) - how people are protected?\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There are KPI/metrics defined to measure the success of the proposal.
