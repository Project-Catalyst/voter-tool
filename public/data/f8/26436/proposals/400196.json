Some characteristics to be monitored would be the temperature of the drinks, the storage conditions, the traceability of the location of the wines from their manufacture until they reach the final consumer, the imitation of the product (that is, if it is an original wine or a copy and etc). The problem pointed out by the proponent is that in the same production, different bottles of wine have different flavors, so wine connoisseurs could have more control over all the variables involved in the production, storage, transport and sale of wine bottles. This proposal would also be interesting for wineries, as they would also have better control over the units they would store and sell. It's an interesting idea, the wine market is really strong, but I have some observations to make. I think the target audience for this campaign would be a little limited, because generally those who consume more expensive and special wines are a portion of the richer and more mature population. In other words, young people are generally not that appreciative of wine, to the point of wanting to handle all the information about a specific bottle they are consuming. And it is usually young people who use blockchain technologies. I don't want to generalize or base my opinion on prejudices, but I'm starting from the observations I've made so far, both regarding the most active cryptographic community (young people) and consumers of more special wines (older people with greater purchasing power). I believe a fully monitored bottle of wine would not be cheap. In conclusion, I think the audience that would consume these wines would really be these richest people and who probably don't have as much familiarity with blockchain, so I think it would be important for the proponent to explain very well about what Dapp would be like in terms of experience. of user. It would need to be intuitive, with a well-studied UI/UX design, so that the target audience of the wine market that is probably not so used to blockchain could learn relatively quickly and simply the technologies that would involve Dapp. I think it would also be interesting for the proponent to tell us where this project would be launched in the first place, I believe in Europe or the United States, where the population has better purchasing power and also where blockchain technology is already more widespread. I think the idea can be very promising for Cardano, in fact it is original and it is a very large market (of wines), but this user experience issue should have been better explained, for what I said that probably who would consume these wines would be the typical profile of a person active in the cryptographic world (I'm not saying that this is a rule, but just a probability). If this issue had been explained, I think we would have a lot of security on how this project would be beneficial for Cardano, how a Dapp would be created that would attract new members to our community, increasing the number of transactions on our blockchain and the volume of Ada in circulation, for example. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I found the activities described in the script to be somewhat superficial. The temporal division is very satisfactory, the proponent defines in weeks what will be developed, if the activities were better detailed I would find this part of the proposal ideal. For example, the \u201cMarket and Stakeholder Research - 2 weeks\u201d; How would this market research be done? Would stakeholders also be surveyed? How would they be contacted? What would be the research methodology? What kind of results are they looking for? In this other part \u201cDefining DApp borders - 2 weeks;\u201d I would like to know what are Dapp borders and how they will be defined (who will define them and from what concepts). In other words, I cannot have a good view of the process because I believe that the activities reported are still very vague, so in my opinion it is necessary for the proponent to detail them better. Now talking about the budget division, the amount of 35 thousand dollars asked is quite high considering that only one phase will be covered with this fund. How many phases will there be and how much money would it be necessary to invest for them to be completed? The explanations of the parties are also superficial, for example, the project manager is asked for 10 thousand dollars, but we do not know what tasks he would do to manage this proposal, nor if he would work every day of the week on this project, if his workload would be full or partial; that is, we were unable to define the value of your working hour, so it is not possible to ascertain whether the requested value is fair or in excess. The same doubts are pending for the sales representative and the designer, we only know the total amount that is requested but not how many hours they will work. So I think it would have been better if the bidder had explained this information more carefully. About the team, we only know the name and role of the professionals involved (eg Stefan Vlaev - CEO); we don't have a resume attached, we don't know examples of past work, nor how they relate to Cardano, whether they are active members of the community or not... All this information is necessary, even if they have attached linkedin profiles, a little explanation should have been made available in the proposal itself. Therefore, I think that all topics (budget, roadmap and team) only provide the basics for us to have a general sense of the project's feasibility, I do not agree that this information has been provided with the appropriate level of detail. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The information provided about the process audit is, in my view, final metrics, and doesn't really fit in with monitoring the Dapp build itself. A few things we do know is that the proponent intends for around 100K users to be on Dapp during the first year, for it to gather a revenue of $100K and for the trusted information to be on the blockchain for a period of 5 years. But notice how this all says about a post-Dapp release moment? How can we follow the production of Dapp itself, the activities that would be carried out by the designer, the programmer, the project manager? I think it's necessary for the proponent to rethink this particular topic so that it outlines measurable ways for us to track the entire Dapp development process. I think the most appropriate and straightforward way to do this is by reporting, I usually suggest they are monthly, but as the proponent breaks down temporality into weeks on impact, it would be great if the reports were weekly as well. They could contain a small summary of the activities that were carried out that week by the professionals, that is, if they properly fulfilled their working hours and did what was promised; it would also be important that these reports contain the partial results, the small goals achieved each week, for example. They could be made available to the Cardano community through any of our means of communication such as telegram and discord. Now talking about final results, unfortunately the proponent copied and pasted the same KPIs mentioned for the measurement of progress, so this part is quite inadequate, since we don't have new metrics to follow to understand if what was desired was achieved. Two things would need to be analyzed here: both the success of Dapp itself, which can be seen by the metrics established by the proponent, and the impact of all this for the Cardano ecosystem. In what explicit ways did this project help to expand our blockchain, was a new audience introduced to Cardano technologies, did these people somehow get involved with our blockchain by becoming active members of the community? Even if it's just the first phase of the project, it would be essential for us to understand how all this affected Cardano, so we could verify if the direct objectives of the challenge were really addressed. Therefore, I think auditability is inadequate, we only know ways to track results (and not the work of professionals involved in building Dapp); and we have no thought-out way to see how success was achieved in relation to Cardano. I suggest that the proponent re-evaluate this topic, giving us more detail. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1399, "q0": "This proposal found its way into the cross-chain collaboration category without good reason.

The Challenge Overview states the possible directions for proposals in this challenge and it is clear that by \"cross-chain collaboration\" some attempt to connect Cardano to other chains is meant. This proposal mentions Cardano exactly twice, both in the two sentences related to how it addresses the challenge. Both sentences mention that adoption for Cardano would grow with new users in the wine market. It does not suggest that other blockchains already active there would be integrated or collaborations with other dApps or integrations in the wine market sought out. I cannot rule out that this proposal was meant for B2B/B2C or DApps categories, but it does not even attempt to describe its relevance to this particular challenge.
