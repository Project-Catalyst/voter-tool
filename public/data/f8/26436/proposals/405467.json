Team have submitted 19 proposals that are all related to the addition of support for various blockchains to Adatar.me. These proposals are very similar in their structure and vision. As a result, the assessments for this set of proposals will also be similar.]\n\nAs explained in the campaign brief of this challenge setting, multi-chain adoption is a necessary issue that the future blockchains will have to address. Long and tedious addresses have been a topic (and issue?) within the blockchain domain for a long time. Long addresses are hard to handle, easy to misspell and there are multiple variants of malware that swaps the receiving address when a user copy pastes an address during a transaction. These are a few of the arguments as to why the functionality in the solution is needed.\nBy providing this alias solution to Fantom we also increase the possibility of their community discovering Cardano and Project Catalyst. This might also lead to an increased amount of new member on-boarded to the community.\nThe team behind the proposal is doing a good job proving that their solution hold a strong coupling to the goals set in the campaign. In terms of impact, the proposed solution proves impactful to a strong degree within cross-chain collaboration. In line with the arguments mentioned above, this proposal is rated 5-stars in terms of impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Loxe Inc. team consists of experienced members that have been involved within the Cardano and Catalyst ecosystem for a long time. They have already delivered the foundation of the Adatar.me platform from a previous funding round. Their credibility is unquestionable and the proposal is deemed feasible to the highest degree. However, the proposal acknowledges the project as a low-risk project where much of the solution is already built and it's only a question of connecting the backend to their platform. It would be interesting if the proposers reflected a bit on the technical challenges of integrating Fantom into the Adatar.me platform. In the current state of the proposal, the complexity is regarded identical between all blockchains. \n\nThis proposal is assessed individually, so the following reflections does not affect the score of this individual proposal but they are still worth mentioning.\nThere is a total of 19 related proposals submitted, that is around 150k dollars if all proposals were to be funded and that would equal over 35% of the total funding for the challenge. It is good to have that number in the back of the mind while voting in order to estimate the collection of proposals against other proposals that requests bigger sums of funding. \nAlso, it is mentioned that the integration will take one full month of work to complete. The proposers have acknowledged this in their estimate of delivery but there is a big difference of workload if only a few vs. all proposals got funded. In the latter case, 19 months of work will have to be performed until the end of Q4. This question could be interesting to expand further upon.\nTo sum it all, the proposal is regarded as highly feasible and receives a score of 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The milestones for measuring the progress is sufficient enough and it is deemed not necessary to report on a more detailed level given the scope, complexity and risk of the proposal. The success is partly defined by organic adoption by the Fantom community. It would however be interesting to have real numbers estimated together with this metric. As mentioned in the proposal, it is not a big challenge to measure the actual number of transaction made through the adatar.me platform. The wording of \"organic adoption by its community\" is rather vague and passive, indicating that even the tiniest adoption of the platform is considered a success. A more ambitious goal with real numbers would be preferable so that the community can follow up the success of the project more easily. Therefore, the score given in terms of auditability is 4 stars.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_139", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 4, "ng": 6, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1689, "q0": "Please note that the proposers, Loxe Inc. have submitted over 15 similar proposals aiming to extend the adatar.me platform to a variety of different blockchains. Therefore, parts of my reviews of these proposals will be a general assessment of these similar proposals. However, the reviews will be customized to the relevant blockchain discussed. \n\nI give the proposers a five star rating on impact as the solution clearly aligns with the KPIs and goals of the challenge, aiming to implement cardano based solutions to other blockchains. Today's FTM transaction technology requires a long and complex wallet-address which makes payments and transactions exhausting to complete. Providing an avatar based solution could greatly impact the accessibility of blockchain transactions. It would however be interesting to discuss how the proposers would ensure adaptation of the adatar.me solution by FTM users that might be biased towards FTM based technology.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I give the feasibility of this proposal a four star rating. Seeing that the proposers have already received funding and successfully implemented a project from Fund 6, I find it very realistic that they would be able to complete this project. Furthermore the team consists of five established team members with long and relevant experience within the field which strengthens their credibility. The proposers also include a realistic view of the project timeline, taking into consideration the uncertainty of the number of their proposals that will get approved and how this could affect the time needed for completion. In order to receive a five star rating I would recommend the proposers to discuss the complexity of implementing a backend solution for the specific coin, in this case FTM . Will it be more challenging to develop a solution for the FTM blockchain than it was for ADA? Additionally I would recommend the team to give a more detailed budget and roadmap that breaks down what the development process would look like. Lastly, it would be good to give further reflections regarding what happens if all of the Loxe Inc. proposals in Fund 8 gets approved. How would this impact delivery times and would you be able to complete several projects parallel to each other?\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I give the audibility of the proposed project a three star rating as the reader is given only two explicit milestones to measure the progress of the project: when the extension launches in testnet and once it is launched in the mainnet. In order to achieve a higher rating I would recommend the proposers to break down the project into smaller milestones that could be communicated to the Cardano community along the way, allowing for greater transparency.  Furthermore I recommend that the proposers take a closer look at detailed KPIs of success when the extension is fully implemented in order to measure the actual value provided by adatar.me. Examples of this could be X numbers of users registering their FTM wallet to adatar.me, X% growth in transactions using the adatar.me solution or numbers of FTM transactions conducted using adatar.me avatars. This would ensure that the Loxe Inc. team could provide data regarding the actual adaptation of their solution.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1403", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 2, "ng": 6, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4196, "q0": "The idea of \u200b\u200bthe project is beneficial.

More technical information regarding the FTM-specific implementation might have been useful, as well as how the front end will look. I have rated only 2 stars here as there is nothing in the current project that shows how they plan to introduce and market the tool to the Fantom community, what are the existing wallet solutions and how adatar.me is a better solution than what currently exists. There is also no market research to show that there is a demand for this integration by the FTM community. A project can't be a success without adoption, and I only can fully advise backing a project if there is a strong marketing plan that comes with it - otherwise, we would be at risk of funding an integration that will have minimal use.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The information provided is not sufficient to audit the success of this FTM integration. The project is missing some important KPIs, in regards to the number of Fantom users to be reached to promote the app, the number of active FTM users expected after 1 month, 3 months, a year, the expected number of uses of the FTM integration (number of payments made) per month. Not having these KPIs in place means the success of this proposal is solely based on the technical completion of the integration rather than the commercial/community success of linking Cardano to the FTM community. I would advise (1) to increase the reach, adoption, and usage of the current app within the Cardano community, (2) build and present a marketing plan for extending the app to other communities, including a marketing budget and commercial KPIs, (3) not doing all blockchain at once but focus on the ones that are the most interesting first, and once success is achieved, work on the others.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_314", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6558, "q0": "The problem identified in this proposal (poor UX in crypto wallets due to non human readable addressess) makes sense and is an issue that has been continuously discussed in the crypto community for a few years now. The common use of non human readable addresses causes strangeness and insecurity in less tech savvy users, so solutions that move in this direction are positive. The proposed solution is within the scope of the challenge. \n\nThere is no clear articulation on how this proposal will add value to the Cardano blockchain. Considering that the proposed solution doesn't require on-chain code at this time, there is no clear indication on how the Cardano blockchain will be used. I clearly see that creating a model that allows the use of custom and \"human readable\" addresses for Fantom blockchain would bring great value to the Fantom ecosystem (increasing the ease of mass adoption) but there is no clear retribution to the Cardano community in addition to a possible increase in the prestige of Cardano and Catalyst for the recognition of joint development. \n\nAn item/risk that would be important to judge the potential impact of this proposal would be to know the competition of similar projects supporting FTM addressess as well, as this would indicate the space for the development of a solution and the demand. Unstoppable Domains for example supports FTM addresses and would be a potential competitor https://unstoppabledomains.com/\n\nThere are no metrics/targets that could facilitate impact assessment evaluation. I would recommend including metrics/KPIs that could more clearly indicate the impact of this proposal on the Cardano and Catalyst communities. \n\n**This proposal used a template due to the similarity between them. The team explained the reason for using the templates. The only significant change between the proposals is the target blockchain. Because of this, I will use standard assessments, modifying only the different points between them, which can cause similarity alerts in the assessment.**", "q0r": 3, "q1": "This is a proposal for the expansion of Adatar. The project was funded in F6, aims to deliver human readable addresses on Cardano, mainnet lauched in Feb 2022, is in full development and is offering support in several Cardano wallets. \n\nThe team described experiences relevant to the development of the proposal and there is evidence of their expertise on the website www.loxeinc.com \n\nThe budget will be completely used to pay developers. The value defined for the payment of developers for 1 month of work is compatible with market values. It would be important to have an hourly estimate for the development stages, testing and implementation of the FTM extension to understand more clearly if the budget is appropriate, but considering the deliverables of this proposal, the amount is reasonable. \n\nThere is a forecast for the integration of adatar.me to FTM to take 1 month, but due to the large number of parallel proposals proposed by the team there is uncertainty about when the project will be delivered, which made the team define the launch of adatar.me FTM extension testnet at the beginning of Q4(2022) and the mainnet at the end of Q4(2022). From what I can understand, if the team gets funding for many proposals, there will be a considerable backlog, which increases the uncertainty about the roadmap. \n\nNo significant risks were identified for the development of the project. As the integration of adatar.me will not require on chain code, the complexity of the proposal decreases as it facilitates the integration with different blockchains. \n\n**This proposal used a template due to the similarity between them.

There are no metrics/KPIs, which undermines the performance evaluation capability of this proposal. \n\nConsidering that the deliverable of the proposal is the creation of human readable addresses, I would recommend that the team include metrics that could assess the use of the service by Fantom users, as this would be an easily verifiable metric and a good indicator of success/auditability.

Here, we seek to finance projects that can establish some relationship between Cardano and other blockchains, in this case, the blockchain to work on would be the A Fantom (FTM) platform. The Adatar.me project seeks to replace long and complicated addresses with short and simple names. The problem at hand is that pretty much every time cryptocurrency holders want to make a transaction, they need to send 1 coin first to make sure the destination address is correct, so the transaction fee ends up being paid twice, unnecessarily. If the addresses were our names or some codename chosen by us, we would have much more security in carrying out these transactions, it would not be necessary to make a test shipment and the respective fees would be paid only once. In other words, the project is extremely relevant and I believe that all cryptocurrency users, whether on Cardano or another blockchain, will be interested in participating in it, in my view there is no doubt about the positive impact that this application will generate. Therefore, the goals of helping to establish good business and a good relationship with other blockchains will undoubtedly be achieved, which in the end will undoubtedly help Cardano to become more and more respected and widely used. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I think the proponents could have given more details about the project development process, we know that this is an expansion to something that already exists (address simplification is already being worked on for our blockchain), however it would be interesting that they could expose to the readers of the proposal some activities necessary for the evolution of this project. They state that the expansion will start at the beginning of the 4th quarter of the year and finish at the end of that same quarter. What would happen in month 1, and 2, and 3? In my view, the script gives us an overview of what will happen, but not as specific as I would like. Now talking about the budget division, this part is very simple to understand. The asking price is $8,000, which is the equivalent of a full-time software engineer's salary or half a salary for two part-time engineers - I really don't think there's more to explore here. The understanding of how the requested money will be used is complete. Now, talking about the team, this part is impeccable, they are very qualified and well-known professionals within the Cardano community, the Loxe Inc group. The company develops some projects using Cardano's blockchain technology, such as the Win Win platform (conflict moderation outside the court system); we know in practice that they are competent and highly prepared professionals. In addition, they also attach a good description about each one, so that we can individually understand more about their careers and previous work. Therefore, the feasibility of the project is very high, my only suggestion is really to explain the script better. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Regarding auditability, the proponents explain very succinctly how the project can be audited both in terms of the process and the final results. Speaking of process, we know that the desired milestones are \u201cthe launch of the adatar.me FTM extension on testnet and mainnet at the beginning and end of Q4 2022\u201d; and the end result would be the extension of the \u201cadatar.me and organic adoption by your community\u201d project. I think these are good ways to monitor the project, but I will make some suggestions for this process to become even better explored. In the process part, I believe that the team will meet with the IOG coordinators monthly in order to present the partial results, I think that the contents discussed at that moment could also be accessible to members of the Cardano community, as a closer way to keep track of what has been done in the month. Regarding the final results, it would be very interesting if the team carried out a small study of how this application contributed to the better performance of FTM blockchain transactions, if the number of fees paid decreased, if people also became interested in Cardano, a since this technology was developed by a company that operates mostly on our blockchain, and so on. That is, quantitative and qualitative data that make this perception of success more measurable.

It allows the Cardano community to vote and fund those it deems necessary and views as worthwhile investments and voters can choose to allocate funds to as many as they want. Having said that, my concern is that the average voter will only discover and know of the existence of maybe 3 or 4 proposals as it stands because the existence of the entire proposal set isn\u2019t clearly and transparently pointed out to them. \n\nI really wish that the team had taken the time to make this point clear and to provide context. As this is more than a simple assessment of a proposal and is in fact the assessment for the entire proposal set I want to take the time to provide the voters with some context about the selected blockchains. Of course, I can\u2019t go into detail about each project, but I want to at least include one data point for quick comparison - their ranking by market cap. I know that\u2019s not always the most relevant metric, but it can serve as an indication of a blockchain\u2019s popularity:\n\nThe list will have the following structure:\n\nRank by Market Cap - Project Ticker (name) - Market Cap Value (in billion dollars on https://www.coingecko.com on 2022.03.24)\n\n\t\u2022\t1 - BTC - $818B\n\t\u2022\t2 - ETH - $365B\n\t\u2022\t6 - XRP - $40B\n\t\u2022\t9 - SOL- $31B\n\t\u2022\t10 - DOT - $22B\n\t\u2022\t11 - AVAX - $22B\n\t\u2022\t12 - DOGE - $18B\n\t\u2022\t15 - SHIB - $13B\n\t\u2022\t20 - LTC - $8B\n\t\u2022\t22 - ATOM - $8B\n\t\u2022\t24 - LINK - $7B\n\t\u2022\t28 - ETC - $5B\n\t\u2022\t29 - ALGO - $5B\n\t\u2022\t36 - EGLD - $4.2B\n\t\u2022\t38 - MANA - $3.9B\n\t\u2022\t43 - FTM (this proposal) - $3.3B\n\t\u2022\t48 - XTZ - $3B\n\t\u2022\t60 - IOTA (MIOTA) - $2.1B\n\nThe prospect of porting a Cardano native project to multiple chains is one with a lot of potential in theory, and it definitely addresses the objectives of this challenge and I hope this effort will help the Cardano community decide which ones the treasury should invest in.\n\nIf this proposal actually manages to attract a sufficiently large part of the FTM community and actually use a product that has its origins on Cardano, thus exposing them to the Cardano ecosystem, the impact on the ecosystem could be huge. However, I have some reservations about that prospect actually happening based on the contents of this proposal, which I will outline throughout this assessment.\n\nMy main concern is regarding the potential impact of the adatar.me project as a whole is related to its potential for adoption, first and foremost by the Cardano community, something that I view as necessary for it to be adopted by users of other chains. I have visited the adatar.me website and I've discovered that only 96 users have signed up and only 76 adatars have been created so far (at the time of writing). I find these numbers to be low considering that the project has received the exposure of being a successfully funded Project Catalyst initiative, as the proposal mentions. This is somewhat concerning and may be a signal of the project not gaining traction and being met with disinterest by the community. To put these numbers into perspective, the adahandle project, a project very similar in scope, and which only recently fully launched already has tens of thousands of users and close to 100,000 handle NFTs minted (91,290 NFTs minted under the policy ID at the time of writing).\n\nDiversity in the ecosystem is a good thing and should definitely be encouraged, but it only matters if the \u201cother options\u201d actually gain some traction and manage to attract a user base. The \u201cAdatar.me - Growth Acceleration\u201d https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404995 proposal, submitted by the team in the Miscellaneous Challenge, is for marketing the project, but after reading that proposal I was left with the impression that marketing and promotion is an afterthought for the team.\n\nHowever, the team is competent, and from their past engagements with the community I know they are dedicated to the Cardano mission. Because of this, I\u2019m awarding +1 to my Impact score as a reflection of the hope that they will find solutions to these problems and try to be more transparent with their proposals in the future.\n\nSide Note: \nIn addition to the 18 Adatar.me for [INSERT BLOCKCHAIN] proposals requesting $144,000, Loxe, the team behind the avatar.me project has posted an additional 5 proposals to 3 different challenges, requesting an additional $207,000 in funding for the adatar.me project. Personally, I don\u2019t view this as a problem in itself, I just consider that the voting community should have been made aware of this.\n\nF8: DApps and Integrations:\nAdatar.me to NFT - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/405209\nAdatar.me Address Book - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/405041\n\nF8: Open Source Development Ecosystem:\nOpen API for Adatar.me - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/405179\nAdatar.me Website Widget - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/405027\n\nF8: Miscellaneous Challenge:\nAdatar.me - Growth Acceleration - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404995 ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Adatar.me for FTM is part of a set of 18 (+1 duplicate) functionally identical proposals that aim to enable the adatar.me project to integrate with different blockchains. Each proposal is for a different blockchain.\n\nThe roadmap is rather sparse and I would have definitely liked to see a bit more details about the engineering part of it, to make me feel that the team has a good understanding of the project(s) they are embarking on.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t necessarily find fault with the approach of submitting identical proposals for dealing with very similar tasks, that have only a single different parameter, for example, translations into multiple languages of the same content, or as is the case here porting the same application to multiple blockchains, I do think it\u2019s a problem that the volume of work for each one is estimated to be exactly the same. Even if the developers won\u2019t be interacting with the blockchains themselves, but with the wallets for these blockchains, as they mention in the proposal, still every wallet and every blockchain is different, built with different technology, or with different approaches and on different principles. If this estimate is an average I would have liked to see that mentioned in the proposals.\n\nThe budget breakdown is just one line, but that is perfectly ok in this case since the whole budget of $8000 is intended to go towards the salary for one month of one developer. That\u2019s roughly $50/hour assuming a 40 hour workweek - that\u2019s not a detail included in the proposal, but I think it should have been.\n\nThe budget requested for porting the Adatar.me solution to a single blockchain is low, but feasible, at $8000, however, the budget for all the 18 proposals (not counting the LTC duplicate) adds up to $144,000 out of the total challenge budget of $400,000. I don\u2019t view this as a problem in itself, however, I wish the Loxe team would have been more transparent about this and made the info readily available in the proposal. That would have assured that the voters have a complete picture of what they are voting for.\n\nAs I\u2019ve said, the proposals are identical, and a 1 month development time is given for each, but what will happen if all 18 or a large percentage of the proposals will be funded? Will they be done in sequence, meaning that it will take approximately 18 months to deliver the whole set? If this is the case what will determine the order of the sequence? In any case, that could mean the deliverables for this proposal(s) will be ready on mainnet at a much later date than the estimated Q4 2022. The proposals do mention that \u201cother members of our team may be pulled into this work if needed\u201d, but what will that mean for the actual development of the project? Is the team large enough, or will extra team members be hired? Most likely the team has some thoughts around this, and how they plan to execute, but I can only base my assessment on what\u2019s in the text of the proposal(s), and unfortunately, the proposals are very light on details regarding this, and my feasibility score reflects this issue.\n\nA very good description of the team members involved with the development of this project is provided in the proposal, however since links to professional profiles (LinkedIn) or examples of other relevant previous work are not provided in the proposal, I had no way of verifying the claims around credentials and experience.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Adatar.me for FTM is part of a set of 18 (+1 duplicate) functionally identical proposals that aim to enable the adatar.me project to integrate with different blockchains.

Then, there are 19 proposals with similar content were submitted to the same campaign. But if other projects make proposals to request funds for every their small milestones like what you have done. Our Catalyst community will have an extremely large number of proposals. The CAs and vCAs will have to spend a lot of time to assess these proposals; The CA bonus base budget for each proposal will be broken down; The voting community also doesn't know which of your proposals to vote for.  My suggestion is to focus on 1 proposal to request a bigger total budget, and a broken-down budget to add separately blockchain. This will limit the dispersion of resources of the Catalyst community, and your Adatar project will be highly valued in the minds of CAs and voters. I strongly believe in that because you have succeeded with the previous proposal in Fund 6. \n\nAbout the budget, the $8.000 salary for 1 full-time (or 2 part-time) software engineer(s) is acceptable. It is the average salary for a software engineer in the US. But I have a question: Will you need 1 full-time engineer to integrate into the FTM blockchain only or will need several engineers to integrate into other blockchains? My understanding is this is an iterative work, almost their work follows a process, it is similar to Cardano blockchain, needs only 1 or a few engineer(s) can complete these tasks. Furthermore, because this is a continuation of a funded project, part of the cost of integrating onto the FTM or another blockchain is covered in the previously funded proposal ($84.000). Because of this reason, I will not rate the full stars. \n\nThe team has 5 people, who are experienced engineers, who have worked together for a long time in Loxe company. We can easily communicate with them through the profile links attached on their company website https://loxeinc.com/#team.

It could be argued that, as this project already exists on Cardano, implementing it in other chain is somehow linking both chains.
