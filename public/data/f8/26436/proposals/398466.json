This is something that is really important within the ecosystem due to the high influence on interoperability. There are many people that would love to see these 2 blockchains connect and help each other to build and excel in the space. There is currently a challenge of igniting the flame and actually following through with this idea. The team has given a great approach to what the challenge is and how they are going to address it. For this reason, I give it 4 out of 5 stars. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team is very experienced in these different ecosystems and have a willingness to help connect these different communities. This will allow for new people to get introduced to blockchain technology. The team has already shown their expertise in their individual careers and are now taking a project that could potentially increase the amount of capital in these different blockchain ecosystems. The team has slight concern that there is a possibility that these ecosystems will be harder to connect than they would want. This proposal is to kickstart ideas and start brainstorming on what will be the best way to start finding the connecting pieces. For this reason, I give this proposal a 4 out of 5 stars.

The timeline is a realistic one, with engagement and reports by June and cross chain technical frameworks by the end of the year.

In order to progress forward, we need to encourage collaboration to build the future of decentralized networks together. This proposal fits perfectly within that challenge.
