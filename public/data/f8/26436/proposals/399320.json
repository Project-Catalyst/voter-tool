With PBC, they try to consult with expert that impacted by blockchain technologies. However, I\u2019m still feel vagued by the lack of a concrete example of what kind of work they do to integrate the expert into the Cardano ecosystem. Also, the potential risks stated are just only Covid-19 which is not enough, they need to find more risks associated with the project itself. For example, what if the marketing doesn't work well, or membership does not increase significantly.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team provides roadmaps and milestones. However, many points stated aren\u2019t measurable and thus cannot be tracked easily by the community. For example, what kind of marketing the team will do each month? How many members at each month before reaching 1000 members at month 6? The proposal has a list of names of the team, but I can't get further information from some members by searching on the internet. It would be helpful if they provide a LinkedIn profile for each team member so the community could verify the experience and track record the team has. The budget isn\u2019t outlined and broken down into details. For example, how much cost does each event needs? What kind of educational platform will be used and at what cost? How much money need to pay an engineer to create a website? and how much to pay for the server/domain hosting?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal has its metrics and succes indicators.

Personally, I quite love this idea since it brings a lot of advantages to the Cardano Ecosystem.

Besides, it will break down silos in the industry and allow the communication necessary to further develop U.S. blockchain technology.

It description fits into the types of proposals expected: \"Common research, education, outreach and innovation projects with other chains and communities (e.g. podcasts, hackathons, webinars, communication hubs, educational resources)\"\nThe problem that is trying to solve is clear and aligned with the challenge objectives of interoperability and promoting cross-chain projects and initiatives. I do agree that the organization proposed can breakdown silos and help to drive a more wide perspective on collaboration on many blockchains.\nBut I see a weakness in the proposal, as it shows not deep understanding of how Cardano operates (as when it is offering memberships to PABC to \"Cardano members\", without specifying wether that will be IOG, Catalyst, Emurgo, Foundation or all of them?). Outcome's KPIs are wide and general, with only 1 time based (An ongoing educational series featuring various industry topics. After the first 90 days, we would like to see a minimum attendance of 50 members).\nIf the proposal is approved by the community I suggest to get a deep down immersion in Cardano and Catalyst and produce stronger KPIs to measure Outcomes and seek for a better alignment to the Challenge and Cardano's objectives.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal team lead is the president of the PABC and has extensive experience in Public affairs and Business Development, and one person within the PABC site seems to have extensive experience with Blockchains, but there are no links provided to validate the rest of the team stated in the proposal.

One risk was stated and addressed.\nThe timeline and milestones are too general, such as a website to drive engagement and promotional and educational activities and a platform to reach 500 members first and 1000 later, and the opening of three US states, but no detailed explanation about how this activities will be done, how many and who will do it (the mentioned team will not be enough to carry out them). e.g. Creating an educational platform will take far more time that the indicated one, even using an existing platform and adapt it could take longer than the indicated timeframe. \nThe requested budget details are also expressed in general terms (2500 for a website, 10.000 for Marketing, 20.000 events budget and educational platform) which does not allow for an objective assessment on feasibility.\nI suggest to reduce the scope of the proposal for let's say 3/4 months, explaining what type of site, with specifics, is the one that will be build, how it will support the engagement of new members, what type of campaign, how often, how much and addressing which type of audience in which channels will be done, so it can be analyzed and assessed properly. Also with this it will be possible to better understand how this project is planned and how it will be executed to reach its goals, and wether the requested budget is in line to the type and length of activities.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal do provide a definition of success:\n- An ongoing educational series featuring various industry topics.

More information would be needed beyond stating the use of an educational platform or attending events and also what specific areas they are looking to help get acceptance from the wider population / governors on (e.g. proof of stake, DeFi usage etc).

A better metric would be to have a certain action that they are trying to drive when attending the event. This could be memberships, follows, sharing of information handouts, connections etc. Or it could involve covering a certain topic and answering questions to a certain number of people.

The inclusive aspect is there from the start together with interesting ideas like approaching experts in fields impacted by blockchain technology.
