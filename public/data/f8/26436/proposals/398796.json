With this proposal they are asking for funding to share InfinitySwap tech with Cardano for testing and feedback and to share InfinitySwap smart contract with auditing firm in parallel. \n\nI am not convinced that there is a good fit of the proposal (and the step 1 proposal) with the challenge. Since Ferrum is unsure that there is a potential to be integrated with Cardano, a primary step would be for Ferrum to pay a closer look at their current and future services and development plans and come up with viable avenues for integration. This argument gains even more weight when considered at the same time with the fuzzy budget logic that renders the project highly unfeasible in my opinion. \n\nThis project would be a step-2 in a wider project in which step 1 is also subjected to funding in this round - therefore it is highly unlikely at this stage that there is even a need for this step 2, without having first a confirmation of funding for the initial step. Considering that we are dealing with an unnecessary project, at least at this stage (too early and depending on another project's funding), 2 stars are appropriate.

Rephrasing the argument, for me it sounds more like \u201cwe are not entirely sure that there is a business case to be made here, but if you fund us we shall make an effort\u201d.  \n\nThere are two additional red flags. Firstly, Ferrum has launched three proposals in this funding round (this one plus two Service MS proposals), all of them with a high degree of similarity and overlapping scope, making it very difficult for the Cardano community to differentiate each proposal\u2019s added value, should all of them be funded. I highly urge the team to consider the great benefits of scope, scale and budget brought by a merging of their four proposals. These red flags combined render the proposal highly infeasible in my opinion.

As the Cardano brand is built around security and interoperability, it is crucial that these cross chain solutions are built with the highest security guarantees possible. If this proposed solution can mitigate the risks and exploits that have plagued other blockchains, then it will allow the general public to trust the Cardano ecosystem and interact with these cross chain interoperability platforms.

This proposal is one of three almost identical proposals that asks for a lot of money without a proper justification. The proposal does not really manage to bring across its impact or added value, for the reason of not sounding credible. While it proposes an apparently new mechanisms of decentralized exchange, it does not really convince, because of the lack of technical explanation of the proposed concept. Since the proposal is not really convincing, it cannot be attributed to have a positive impact towards the Cardano ecosystem. Neither does it adress scalability.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposers do not really bring across their self-acclaimed competencies, as they fail to explain the technical implementation of their proposal (and their general implementation plan is pretty short as well).

The contents of all three proposals differ only in proposal's detailed plan, budget requested and implementation roadmap. So my assessments may be the same on some points!!!Proposal for creating a cross-chain bridge connecting Ferrum network projects on other chains to Cardano. I went to check about Ferrum network via coinmarketcap and checked on-chain activity now. Ferrum is working on the ETH, Avalanche, Polygon, and BSC blockchains. Reference link (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ferrum-network/, https://snowtrace.io/token/0xE5CAeF4Af8780E59Df925470b050Fb23C43CA68C, https://bscscan.com/token/0xa719b8ab7ea7af0ddb4358719a34631/ token/0xe5caef4af8780e59df925470b050fb23c43ca68c). So this proposal fits the 2 criteria posed by the challenge New technical implementations connecting Cardano to other blockchains and vice versa (SDKs, APIs, bridges etc) and Already successful projects expanding from other chains to Cardano. A cross-chain bridge project is also a good solution to the problem of aggregating and leveraging the liquidity of Cardano assets with other chains. Currently, Cardano's Erc20 converter is not officially operational, so projects like Ferrum are essential and will have a very good impact on Cardano if it can be successfully implemented. The risk of cross-chain bridge projects is always safety and security to avoid Assets loss problems. Although the technical solution to solve the problems was not clearly described, neither in the proposal nor other sources of information when I checked the information about Ferrum. The proposer also outlined this issue in the proposal, but I would like to analyst further in another section.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal's detailed plan includes two milestones and it's the middle milestones of whole project (5 milestones). 1st. Share InfinitySwap tech with Cardano for testing and incorporate their feedback.\nShare InfinitySwap smart contract with auditing firm in parallel to above step\nCardano team will test InfinitySwap and provide their feedback / report bugs (if any). The feedback provided by Cardano will be reviewed by Ferrum team. Ferrum team will implement the mutually agreed upon feedback and share with Cardano to approve and sign off the milestone. 2nd. Build, audit smart contract and deploy a Dapp that will allow swaps among Cardano and other blockchains. This detailed plan does not give a specific timeline. The detailed plan of the proposal is quite risky. 1. in my opinion, milestone 3 just can implement after milestone 1 was completed and succeeded. The safety and security issues of cross-chain bridges as stated by the proposer are resolved and the Cardano core team and projects accepted. It is possible that Ferrum succeeds in this, but in the detailed plan without giving a specific timeline, it will be difficult to determine the feasibility. 2. Milestone 2 will depend quite a lot on milestone 1. If milestone 1 is really successful and has little risk, then the 2nd is feasible. However, if the implementation of integration and cross-chain bridge construction is too risky or unsuccessful. So the 2nd will be difficult to implement or implement but has a very high risk. To make the proposal more feasible, I suggest that the Proposal should provide a detailed plan for milestone 1 in advance to determine the level of risk and feasibility of the project.\n3. If the proposal for 1st and 2nd milestones ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398794) will not be funded so this proposal might be not implement.\nThe proposal's funding allocation will be entirely devoted to covering research and programming costs, and the total requested funding is $50,000. However, the proposer has not given details of allocating funds to specific jobs, spending on what timelines. The proposer should at least give a fund allocation for each milestone, milestone 2 allocates funds for each implementation of the integration between Cardano and each other blockchain. The project implementation team is actually quite difficult to find, because the proposal also does not provide evidence of the capacity and experience of the proposal implementation team as described by the proposer. To find information for this section, I also searched for related information about Ferrum, Infinityswap. In general, Ferrum is an experienced team that has been involved in building similar projects since 2019. However, to be more specific, I have not been able to find it because in the project website (https://ferrum.network/ ) is also not enough information to verify, in the website there is information about the project team, connecting the Metamask wallet to Dapps deployed on the ETH, BSC, Polygon ... whitepaper or detailed documents about the solution. the solution of infinityswap also i have not found.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "To measure and track the progress of the proposal, the proposer offers a solution that is to provide a project progress tracking board Jira. Monthly technical and financial reports will also be provided by the proposer for inspection. Project success will be difficult to mesure as this proposal scope covers only the middle phase of the entire project and if the proposal to implement milestone 1-2 will not be funded then this proposal might not be implement. However, I think the whole project will be very successful and help a lot for Cardano's Defi ecosystem if the typical problems of a cross-chain bridge project are safety and security are solved.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_683", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9733, "q0": "InfinitySwap is a multi-chain aggregator that does not use the normal lock/burn approach to cross chain interoperability of tokens and instead is a 2 way bridge LP system.

The potential impact from this proposal is based on the impact of the initial proposal for milestones 1 and 2 that create the working version of this project. The proposal team provide a break down of the different tasks that are involved with the proposal. A budget breakdown is not provided.  \n\nThe team focusses on the security issues for this proposal which are relevant here as this is where they intend to do the mainnet deployment.

A small bullet point plan is provided. No budget break down is provided. It is clear from the sources provided that the team have a history working in the blockchain industry creating solutions across different blockchain systems. Their YouTube channel helps provide further evidence of the interactions between multiple different clients from their previous work.\n\nThe team clearly have experience in other blockchain systems but it is not well articulated on what experience they have within Cardano. They do not mention any Haskell experience nor any Plutus experience. The team also doesn't highlight whether they have or will be completed the Plutus Pioneers or some other creditable education course to learn about Plutus. Any of this information would have been useful to provide any confidence the team is taking the right steps to be able to feasibly execute this proposal and fully understand the implications of developing using Plutus and in the extended UTXO development environment.\n\nThe specific area around feasibility for this specific proposal is around the feedback and iteration of the first version and a mainnet release of the project. The risk on feasibility for this proposal is that it is dependent on the first milestones which themselves have the same team that have not articulated their existing skill set in Cardano development. This proposal as a result is far higher risk in terms of feasibility as it's unknown how well the team will do with the initial execution.

Most notably it would have been good to understand the amount of people from Cardano they would receive feedback from and what are the demographics and type of user they would be targeting if that was necessary. The quality of this feedback will determine what the mainnet version will include so being able to audit whether this process was effective is an important factor. Another area is what would the users be testing, just the overall interface and functionality or would they be asked to do any functional testing? Some examples of the coverage for the smart contract audits would also be good to understand.\n\nThe team states that success will look like - 'product is deployed to production and we are seeing substantial transaction volumes and assets listed on the aggregator.' This is relevant for this milestone which focusses on the mainnet deployment of the project. However it is not a fully well suited outcome as the next milestone looks to incorporate audit feedback so at this stage it is not sensible for the team to state that they want to be seeing substantial volumes going through the smart contracts when they at this stage may not have incorporated auditing feedback.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_758", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "InfinitySwap reimagines the architecture & OpSec best practices providing the fastest, most secure & feature complete solution on the market", "experience": "With over 100 partners & an additional 150 clients, Ferrum has proven to be one of the most trusted & reputable Blockchain as a Service companies in the space.
