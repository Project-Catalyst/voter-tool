I think it is essential to promote an academic study on this topic, and I recognize several positive points in this proposal. The first of them is that the team that would form the event would be multidisciplinary, as the proponents claim, formed by experts from various areas, artists, developers of different blockchains, such as Cardano, Ethereum and others; where the challenge's objectives would be directly supported, there would be an exchange of knowledge between professionals belonging to our community and also to communities from other blokchains. And this fair challenge seeks just that, the integration between Cardano and other cryptographic ecosystems, in order to popularize our blockchain and make it more respected, improving its development with blockchains, so that project teams can help each other, exchange experienced, so that ideas that worked for other blockchains can be adapted to Cardano's characteristics and so on. All this would happen here in these events, only if the focus was on NFTs, the representatives of the blockchains would not fail to exchange experiences, as is sought in the challenge. Other positives are that we know exactly where this academic conference would be held (at the University of Oxford, called OxBAT: Oxford Blockchain, Art, Technology) and what topics would be covered in the 3-day event (NFTs, their artistic value and blockchains as a new medium for art; implications for the 'traditional' art market; NFT spaces on different blockchains; the influence of NFTs and blockchain technology on society). Some more details, such as how the target audience would be captivated to participate in the events, could also have been provided. However, I think the impact of the proposal will be maximum, I notice that many proposals that suggest holding events are very stuck in the theoretical part, but these proponents have already started the explanation giving us specifications and details on how everything would be put into practice. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal script is very good. The proponents explain what activities would be carried out each month, explaining in great detail and at a good length what would have to be done. I don't have criticisms about this, I usually suggest what they've already done, which is a monthly division of time and that each month it is very detailed which activities will have to be performed and how, and this is very well supported here. Talking about funding, a total of 8320 is requested, which in my opinion is a very fair value for the dimension, complexity and impact that this proposal will generate. The way this money would be used is very simple, the proponents will only allocate it for their time organizing the event (and explain that they will work once a week with it, detailing the amount of total hours dedicated to the project and also how much their work - 20 dollars, which I found to be a very affordable price compared to the amount asked by other professionals). I don't think we have such a complete view of how much specific parts would cost, such as marketing, space rent (if paid, as it would be at a university), if there would be slides to be produced (design costs graphic (e.g. diagramming and etc), if there would be a networking moment in which a snack would be served, if there would be other workers in these events responsible for the production itself (light, sound, cleaning, etc). I would have preferred that the proponents had given all this information in a more direct way than dividing the amount in half, with half for each as remuneration for the organization of the events. Organization encompasses many things, and we don't know how much each would cost individually. Finally, speaking of the proponents and the rest of the team (students), little information is provided about them. We only know their names and main academic/professional assignments. It would be better if they included a short script, so that we could get to know their previous work better and how they relate to Cardano, that is, if they have already developed projects within our ecosystem, if they are active members and so on. It would also be positive if they had attached their linkedin profiles. So I think the feasibility is ok, not bad, but some points (budget and team presentation) should have been more detailed. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proponents report really interesting ways to monitor the development of the project, which are the holding of weekly meetings and deadlines to be met. But enough detail was lacking here so that we could solidly understand how these two forms of auditing will come to fruition. First, speaking of weekly meetings, will the team address both the tasks that needed to be carried out in that time interval, in order to verify if they were, in fact, accomplished, and in the correct way? Will the partial results also be analyzed, that is, the verification of whether the small targets were achieved? And what would it be like for the Cardano community to stay abreast of what was discussed at these meetings? Will their results be made available in some way to our community members? Speaking of these deadlines, the proponents claim that they will participate in external financing processes and therefore will have deadlines to meet, which will be a reason why they will remain \u201cin line\u201d; it would be interesting for them to explain what other funding they are trying and what dates they intend to use to guide themselves. Regarding the final results, finally, they set very clear objectives to be met (strong concept covering and reflecting the diversity of the NFT space, speakers and guests from different blockchains and research fields, etc.). However, I think they lacked a little focus on our ecosystem. How will this project have positive consequences for Cardano, above the study of NFTs and the benefit of other blockchains? How can we measure if, indeed, new people have been added to our community, the number of CNFTs being minted and marketed has increased? Would new CAs, vCAs, proponents emerge from these events? People who invested in Cardano's technologies, in different ways? Nor is it very clear how all this knowledge will be taken to all members of our community. I think that a final report should be prepared, along with a short video presentation that summarizes both the process and the partial and final results of this project. This video could be made available on youtube, and the link sent to our discord and telegram channels, for example. How this information would be shared is at the discretion of the team, this was just a suggestion. Anyway, unfortunately I found this the most superficial part of the proposal, it's not bad, but it doesn't fully cover what we need to know in the safe monitoring of this proposal. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 4, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 915, "q0": "Thoroughly well done at addressing challenge, scope, and resolution. \n\nI could not tell if this would be hosted virtually, be only in person or have video uploaded afterwards.

However, there is still a small risk here, that costs such as transportation, hotel, and the cost of renting a conference room are not listed by the proposer. The proposer also stated that some funds will be funded externally. But to minimize the risk, the proposer should request more fund and allocate it as risk management fund.\nThe core team of proposal that 5 people all related to the University of Oxford.
