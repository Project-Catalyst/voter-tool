If the Cardano community is going to fund research and development, it should be for open source initiatives that can benefit the entire community. The long term vision for Cardano should be to avoid creating (funding) siloed blockchain teams that use open source funding initiatives to gain an unfair advantage within for profit organizations. Despite these concerns, I believe this is an excellent proposal that is well written, and the outcome will provide value to the Cardano Community and Catalyst community.

The proposal here was submitted by Wolfram Blockchain Labs (WBL) with the aim of helping to experiment with these new inter-chain connections by developing programmable functions for connecting Cardano to other chains. There is a solid basis already for this proposal as WBL states it has Integrated UTXO (think Bitcoin/Litecoin) and account-based (think Ethereum and EOS) blockchains into the Wolfram Language already. The team states it is ready to to begin working on cross chain experimentation immediately. Three key parts of the proposal to keep in mind (i) research (ii) experimentation and (iii)  \"Proof of Concept\" oracle framework. Impact-wise all three are key, but the third one already gives us a glimmer of a new world as the team expects to be able to enable sharing Cardano blockchain data through oracles. This proposal is not only about bringing Cardano to other blockchains, but also bringing a well-known team from Wolfram into our wider ecosystem. I'd say there is no doubt about the alignment, this is a new approach and new team willing to look at these critical issues from a grounds up approach. The team sees potential for scaling, if the first principles approach is implemented. Great. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind the proposal is impressive and has at its fingertips the collective experience of Wolfram Blockchain Labs and Wolfram Language and its blockchain function. One really important aspect of the proposal is that the team intends to priortize specific use cases and then experiment on them. However, it will not be done in a vaccuum but will be tightly intertwined with collecting research externally by utlizing community generated inputs.  The nine-month timeline sounds to be at a quite nice pace for a research/experimentation and demonstration package. It would have been nice to find our from the team whether they have also applied for additional funding from other blockchain projects keen to promote interoperatability as this could help to make this wider initiative more sustainable and valuable - through a greater cross-chain awareness of the potentials for cross-chain collaboration based on the findings of this project. In essence, I expect this proposal to generate new and valuable insight into new pathways and identifying value prospects for establishing ties between blockchains. The interaction phase aims to educate Catalyst community of what occurred over the three phases. The $75,000 budget has been broken down into Team Costs - $50,000 USD to be spent on two teams (technical and research),$20,000 for hardware and $5,000 for marketing. The teams competencies are available and documented on WBL page (https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/stephen26/Published/Cloud%20Notebook%20-%20Cross-chain.nb) What I think could be improved is that the Outreach effort is focused primarily on the the Cardano and larger decentralized community. I think that there must be opportunities for WBL to promote, communicate and evangelize its findings inside the wider Wolfram Research and Wolfram ecosystem, as well as potentially to corporate partners that could benefit from the new know-how. There might be room for a new proposal there in the future...\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Straight into KPIs. I like their presentation and the division into KPI Technical Deliverables vs KPI of Performance or Community Seminars. The KPI Technical Deliverables are extensive and incisive for the Discovery stage, the experimentation KPIs seem adequate - but somehow is there room for quality and performance parameters? The Experimental Implementation KPIs will be exciting to see, of course we can't see the future. The research and education results will be delivered in the form of a complete report from internal partners and external community members, while a valuable result will be the Proof-of-Concept using oracle system on Cardano for a cross-chain (simple use case). Most exciting potentially is the \"Defined program for attracting additional blockchain ecosystems to work on cross-chain use cases inside Cardano\". It would have been good to have more information on this last deliverable - what does a \"Program\" in this case entail? Will it be a Wolfram Program for implementation or a collection of ideas? With an important organization such as WBL, I do not expected auditability problems. One thing that will facilitate Auditability is the inbuilt component for collecting Catalyst Community feedback. It remained unclear to me whether the Smart Contract Templates will be open-sourced or available for reuse by the Cardano community? Will this proposed library of templates - to connect different blockchains to Cardano - be of exclusive use for WBL and its customers? The team states that at the end of each phase it will will have regular communications with the Catalyst and extended Cardano community, although this segment lacks feedback about the definite modes of communication and the planned tempo and formats of this communication. The interactions are proposed in the form of blogs, videos and other services. Yet, as this is an integral part of the success of this proposal, I feel a two-way communication plan should have been fleshed out in more detail, hence a 4. Probably bi-weekly progress updates for this 9-month long proposal would be a good choice. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_35", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10924, "q0": "I think the proposal has everything to do with what is sought in the challenge: the interaction between Cardano and other blockchains. The company Wolfram Research, according to what is said in the scope of the proposal, already has a lot of experience and integrates several blockchains. They intend to develop programmable functions and connect, through experimentation, NFTs, tokens, carrying out transactions and smart contracts between Cardano and other blockchains, according to them. I found the whole to be very well explained, the process would be divided into 3 parts - research, cross chair experimentation and Wolfram cross chair framework. Each part is very detailed. Despite being a very technical proposal, it is possible to understand what will be done, as the actions are explained in an accessible way. Therefore, I believe that the impact can be maximum if everything is done in the planned way.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility is ok, and it can improve in some points. Regarding the roadmap, it is detailed what activities would be carried out, but the problem is that the time periods informed are very extensive. For example, in the trial phase, it would take 6 months. What would happen at home one of them, exactly? As much as the phases are well explained, this lack of temporal specificity compromises our understanding of the whole. Talking about the budget, the asking amount is high and it is divided into two parts. Same thing with the script. It's given a good breakdown, but we don't know within those parts how much each thing would cost. If this had been defined, we would certainly understand the monetary use better. The team is very well presented, we know in detail the areas of expertise of each professional and also their CVs, but I wish the linkedin profiles had been provided as well. I think this would increase confidence in the information passed, as we could prove what is said.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Certainly, the auditability of the process is well considered. It is said what would be measured in each phase of the project and also how the conclusions of the proposed items would be. Reports, meetings and demonstrations would be made so that all this information would be disseminated to the Cardano community, from what I understand, but it is not clear how often these things would be done or the communication channel that would be used. That's my only suggestion for this part. Talking about the final results, unlike most proposals, here we have a concern about how the project would affect Cardano, beyond the success of what is done itself. Again, it would need to be clearer how the Cardano community would know about all this. Due to the more complex nature of the proposal, my suggestion is that a final meeting be held, displaying the results in a simple and direct way.

I think this solution will be of great benefit to the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind the proposal shows that they are incredibly competent, not just by the work they have already done, but also by the good project plan: A detailed implementation plan has been laid out that splits the projects into identifiable phases and sub-steps and the budget has been explained by a good, reasonable rationale.

To anyone with a broad spectrum of interest, Wolfram is known to sit at the forefront of many technological advances which is why IOG has partnered with the group particularly to provide Cardano with Oracles. Its discoveries and applications, though not widely used, are avant garde.
