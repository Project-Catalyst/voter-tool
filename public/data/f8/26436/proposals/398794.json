With this proposal they are asking for funding to analyze the scope of a potential integration of Cardano with InfinitySwap, including details about Bridge Pool setup. Following this initial effort, this might (or not) materialize into high potential areas to be later on built / integrated. The team would also determine if an integration with Cardano can support cross-chain decentralized solutions.  \n\nI am not convinced that there is a good fit of the proposal with the challenge. Since Ferrum is unsure that there is a potential to be integrated with Cardano, a primary step would be for Ferrum to pay a closer look at their current and future services and development plans and come up with viable avenues for integration. This argument gains even more weight when considered at the same time with the fuzzy budget logic that renders the project highly unfeasible in my opinion. Unclear potential, so 3 stars I think are appropriate.  ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team behind Ferrum seems very strong, and they have made an excellent effort into presenting themselves. \n\nFrom a budgetary point of view, this proposal is unique, unfortunately, since it has used absolutely no figures whatsoever. The entire budget section is simply an argument as to why granting the funds is necessary in order for Ferrum \u201cto be able to justify prioritizing this integration [...]  cognizant of their backlog\u201d. Rephrasing the argument, for me it sounds more like \u201cwe are not entirely sure that there is a business case to be made here, but if you fund us we shall make an effort\u201d.  \n\nThere are two additional red flags. Firstly, Ferrum has launched four proposals in this funding round, all of them with a high degree of similarity and overlapping scope, making it very difficult for the Cardano community to differentiate each proposal\u2019s added value, should all of them be funded. I highly urge the team to consider the great benefits of scope, scale and budget brought by a merging of their four proposals. These red flags combined render the proposal highly infeasible in my opinion. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The team uses SCRUM and runs 2 week sprints. They promise an open sourced Jira board to track the progress of each task and they also promise to to provide Progress reports and financial reports every month.

This proposal is one of three almost identical proposals that asks for a lot of money without a proper justification. The proposal does not really manage to bring across its impact or added value, for the reason of not sounding credible. While it proposes an apparently new mechanisms of decentralized exchange, it does not really convince, because of the lack of technical explanation of the proposed concept. Since the proposal is not really convincing, it cannot be attributed to have a positive impact towards the Cardano ecosystem. Neither does it adress scalability.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposers do not really bring across their self-acclaimed competencies, as they fail to explain the technical implementation of their proposal (and their general implementation plan is pretty short as well). In addition to this, they have no justification for the very high budget whatsoever and it is not diversified.

The contents of all three proposals differ only in proposal's detailed plan, budget requested and implementation roadmap. So my assessments may be the same on some points!!!Proposal for creating a cross-chain bridge connecting Ferrum network projects on other chains to Cardano. I went to check about Ferrum network via coinmarketcap and checked on-chain activity now. Ferrum is working on the ETH, Avalanche, Polygon, and BSC blockchains. Reference link (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ferrum-network/, https://snowtrace.io/token/0xE5CAeF4Af8780E59Df925470b050Fb23C43CA68C, https://bscscan.com/token/0xa719b8ab7ea7af0ddb4358719a34631/ token/0xe5caef4af8780e59df925470b050fb23c43ca68c). So this proposal fits the 2 criteria posed by the challenge New technical implementations connecting Cardano to other blockchains and vice versa (SDKs, APIs, bridges etc) and Already successful projects expanding from other chains to Cardano. A cross-chain bridge project is also a good solution to the problem of aggregating and leveraging the liquidity of Cardano assets with other chains. Currently, Cardano's Erc20 converter is not officially operational, so projects like Ferrum are essential and will have a very good impact on Cardano if it can be successfully implemented. The risk of cross-chain bridge projects is always safety and security to avoid Assets loss problems. Although the technical solution to solve the problems was not clearly described, neither in the proposal nor other sources of information when I checked the information about Ferrum. The proposer also outlined this issue in the proposal, but I would like to analyst further in another section.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal's detailed plan includes two milestones.\n1st. Integrate Infinityswap with Cardano, cooperate with DEX projects on Cardano like Sundaeswap..etc to test the project's effectiveness.\n2nd. Build and deploy a shell app that will allow swaps among Cardano and other blockchains.\nThis detailed plan does not give a specific timeline, only 2nd milestones are expected to be implemented after the 1st milestone 60 days. The detailed plan of the proposal is quite risky.\n1. Safety and security issues of cross-chain bridges as stated by the propoSer. Solving this problem is not easy, as evidenced by the fact that in 2021 billions of dollars have been lost via cross-chain bridge protocols. In fact, the Ferreum network is only deployed on chains using EVM, so it is difficult to determine how feasible it is to integrate with Defi projects on Cardano. It is possible that Ferrum succeeds in this, but in the detailed plan without giving a specific timeline, it will be difficult to determine the feasibility.\n2. Milestone 2 will depend quite a lot on milestone 1. If milestone 1 is really successful and has little risk, then the 2nd is feasible. However, if the implementation of integration and cross-chain bridge construction is too risky or unsuccessful. So the 2nd will be difficult to implement or implement but has a very high risk.\nTo make the proposal more feasible, I suggest that the Proposal should provide a detailed plan for milestone 1 in advance to determine the level of risk and feasibility of the project.\nThe proposal's funding allocation will be entirely devoted to covering research and programming costs, and the total requested funding is $150,000. However, the proposer has not given details of allocating funds to specific jobs, spending on what timelines. The proposer should at least give a fund allocation for each milestone, milestone 2 allocates funds for each implementation of the integration between Cardano and each other blockchain.\nThe project implementation team is actually quite difficult to find, because the proposal also does not provide evidence of the capacity and experience of the proposal implementation team as described by the proposer. To find information for this section, I also searched for related information about Ferrum, Infinityswap. In general, Ferrum is an experienced team that has been involved in building similar projects since 2019. However, to be more specific, I have not been able to find it because in the project website (https://ferrum.network/ ) is also not enough information to verify, in the website there is information about the project team, connecting the Metamask wallet to Dapps deployed on the ETH, BSC, Polygon ... whitepaper or detailed documents about the solution. the solution of infinityswap also i have not found. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "To measure and track the progress of the proposal, the proposer offers a solution that is to provide a project progress tracking board Jira. Monthly technical and financial reports will also be provided by the proposer for inspection. Project success will be difficult to mesure as this proposal scope covers only the initial phase of the entire project. However, I think the project will be very successful and help a lot for Cardano's Defi ecosystem if the typical problems of a cross-chain bridge project are safety and security are solved.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_683", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 3, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9732, "q0": "InfinitySwap is a multi-chain aggregator that does not use the normal lock/burn approach to cross chain interoperability of tokens and instead is a 2 way bridge LP system.

This proposal is the first and second milestone for this project in which they will scope out the work and create an initial shell token bridge between the chains the Ferrum team supports. The team only provides a timeline of the 2nd milestone being delivered within 60 days of completion of the first milestone. This proposal being the first of the set of milestones represents the bigger opportunity for the team to showcase an initial implementation that could provide impact to the ecosystem. The subsequent milestones are dependent on these initial milestones being executed effectively. The team only mention security issues as the main issues for this proposal.

Their YouTube channel helps provide further evidence of the interactions between multiple different clients from their previous work. A document is provided in the attachments that breaks down the plan for this work in more depth. \n\nThe specific area around feasibility for this proposal is around the plan and execution of the basic swap functionality. Although the team clearly have experience in other blockchain systems it is not well articulated on what experience they have within Cardano. They do not mention any Haskell experience nor any Plutus experience. The team also doesn't highlight whether they have or will be completed the Plutus Pioneers or some other creditable education course to learn about Plutus. Any of this information would have been useful to provide any confidence the team is taking the right steps to be able to feasibly execute this proposal and fully understand the implications of developing using Plutus and in the extended UTXO development environment.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal team outline that they intend to provide both progress and financial reports to cover the execution of the proposal and where the funding was used. This is useful to understand how effectively the team performs and utilises the funds. What is not covered here is what parts of the codebase will be open source if any as that will be another area that is beneficial for the community to be able to audit as well as learn from.\n\nSpecifically for this milestone of the project the team could have added some more specific KPIs that they are looking to achieve for this initial version of the swap functionality. What type of performance or cost should apply? Is this the same or better than other integrations into other chains? They may not deploy a production version of the solution at this stage however how will they test the scalability of their solution to see if it meets the criteria needed for a usable solution? \n\nThe team states that success will look like - 'product is deployed to production and we are seeing substantial transaction volumes and assets listed on the aggregator.' This is not the right outcome for this proposal as in milestones 3-4 the proposal team intend to get to mainnet.
