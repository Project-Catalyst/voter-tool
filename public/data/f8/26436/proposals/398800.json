This problem is also one which is within the scope of the challenge, which focuses on encouraging interoperability and cross chain collaboration, toward a multi-chain future. \n\nThe solution is one that will offer great benefit to the Cardano ecosystem, as 'projects building on Cardano would not need to worry about losing nuances embedded in their token contracts such as reflection (RFI), dividend, or burn mechanisms.'\n\nWhile this is a fantastic solution, the KPIs don't specifically match the entirety of proposal as it appears that the overall project has been split into milestones, and divided between challenges. It is worth noting however that the KPIs do align with the challenge itself, focused on secure interoperability- however, this proposal is milestone 5 (and the final milestone).", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers have a solid track record and an established and growing team, with 100 partners, 150 clients and prior grants from Algorand, Pocket Network and Casper. \n\nIt is clear as to what the team and delivery requirements would be, and whilst this is Milestone 5, the roadmap for delivery from scoping to launch is clear, and based on experience, there is evidence that the team can most likely deliver successfully. \n\nDue to the project being sub-divided, the timeline is not entirely clear, but the overall architecture and process has been explained. \n\nThe budget has not been clearly broken down, and this may also be due to the milestones being divided across challenges. \n\nThe proposing team has identified potential risks, primarily around security breaches, and have proposed mitigations by way of the implementation of architectural and OpSec security measures to ensure the security of the protocol, which includes Node architecture and related infrastructure updates.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This project would be easily auditable on completion, however, the sub-division of the project into different milestones across different challenges  resulted in a loss of a clear timeline and roadmap, despite the overall roadmap being logical.

This proposal is one of three almost identical proposals that asks for a lot of money without a proper justification. The proposal does not really manage to bring across its impact or added value, for the reason of not sounding credible. While it proposes an apparently new mechanisms of decentralized exchange, it does not really convince, because of the lack of technical explanation of the proposed concept. Since the proposal is not really convincing, it cannot be attributed to have a positive impact towards the Cardano ecosystem. Neither does it adress scalability.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposers do not really bring across their self-acclaimed competencies, as they fail to explain the technical implementation of their proposal (and their general implementation plan is pretty short as well). In addition to this, they have no justification for the very high budget whatsoever and it is not diversified. Finally, it is pretty apparent that all of the proposals from those proposers are all praised by the same random accounts that have no other interactions on ideascale.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The auditability criteria are not very satisfying, as only some reports are promised, but no proper milestones or KPIs are set up.

The contents of all three proposals differ only in proposal's detailed plan, budget requested and implementation roadmap. So my assessments may be the same on some points!!!Proposal for creating a cross-chain bridge connecting Ferrum network projects on other chains to Cardano. I went to check about Ferrum network via coinmarketcap and checked on-chain activity now. Ferrum is working on the ETH, Avalanche, Polygon, and BSC blockchains. Reference link (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ferrum-network/, https://snowtrace.io/token/0xE5CAeF4Af8780E59Df925470b050Fb23C43CA68C, https://bscscan.com/token/0xa719b8ab7ea7af0ddb4358719a34631/ token/0xe5caef4af8780e59df925470b050fb23c43ca68c). So this proposal fits the 2 criteria posed by the challenge New technical implementations connecting Cardano to other blockchains and vice versa (SDKs, APIs, bridges etc) and Already successful projects expanding from other chains to Cardano. A cross-chain bridge project is also a good solution to the problem of aggregating and leveraging the liquidity of Cardano assets with other chains. Currently, Cardano's Erc20 converter is not officially operational, so projects like Ferrum are essential and will have a very good impact on Cardano if it can be successfully implemented. The risk of cross-chain bridge projects is always safety and security to avoid Assets loss problems. Although the technical solution to solve the problems was not clearly described, neither in the proposal nor other sources of information when I checked the information about Ferrum. The proposer also outlined this issue in the proposal, but I would like to analyst further in another section.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal's detailed plan Is the plan for implementing the last milestone of the whole project (5 milestone) The detailed plan of this proposal is the most risky of the three proposals. According to the plan of the whole project milestones 5 will complete the audit and launch the mainnet on Carano. This plan is only possible when all the first 4 milestones of the project are completed. In the case that 1 of the 4 milestones has not been completed or 1 of the 2 proposals  for milestones 1-4 will not be funded (No1:https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398794, No2: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398796). Then this plan is impossible or the risk will be very high.\nThe proposal's funding allocation will be entirely devoted to covering research and programming costs, and the total requested funding is $100,000. However, the proposer has not given details of allocating funds to specific jobs, spending on what timelines. The proposer should at least give a fund allocation for each job, . The project implementation team is actually quite difficult to find, because the proposal also does not provide evidence of the capacity and experience of the proposal implementation team as described by the proposer. To find information for this section, I also searched for related information about Ferrum, Infinityswap. In general, Ferrum is an experienced team that has been involved in building similar projects since 2019. However, to be more specific, I have not been able to find it because in the project website (https://ferrum.network/ ) is also not enough information to verify, in the website there is information about the project team, connecting the Metamask wallet to Dapps deployed on the ETH, BSC, Polygon ... whitepaper or detailed documents about the solution. the solution of infinityswap also i have not found.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "To measure and track the progress of the proposal, the proposer offers a solution that is to provide a project progress tracking board Jira. Monthly technical and financial reports will also be provided by the proposer for inspection. Project success will be difficult to mesure as this proposal scope covers only the last phase of the entire project. However, I think the project will be very successful and help a lot for Cardano's Defi ecosystem if the typical problems of a cross-chain bridge project are safety and security are solved.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_683", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9734, "q0": "InfinitySwap is a multi-chain aggregator that does not use the normal lock/burn approach to cross chain interoperability of tokens and instead is a 2 way bridge LP system. By offering a new way for the community to interact with assets across different chains it can increase the interoperability and use cases within the Cardano ecosystem. As a new technical implementation to help with interoperability this proposal aligns with the challenge. This proposal is the fifth milestone in the group of Ferrum proposals. On the feasibility they mention the deliverables of  just integrating the feedback of the audit. This makes it unclear on exactly what will get done for this proposal as the audit response is unknown. This makes it difficult to know what will be delivered and thus difficult to assess whether this will have a high impact for the Cardano ecosystem. The team have also copied the risks from other proposals into this one which shows a lack of understanding of the actual risks for this specific proposal. An easy risk to cover in this proposal is how there may not be much feedback from the audit in terms of things to change. If that was the case then what will the team do with the funds? Return them or use them elsewhere? Without informing the community this the proposal team is not fully informing the community to make well informed funding decisions.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "A number of team members are listed on the proposal, the website also provides further information by offering their LinkedIn profiles. A small bullet point plan is provided. No budget break down is provided. It is clear from the sources provided that the team have a history working in the blockchain industry creating solutions across different blockchain systems. Their YouTube channel helps provide further evidence of the interactions between multiple different clients from their previous work. A document is provided in the attachments that breaks down the plan for this work in more depth. \n\nThey do not mention any Haskell experience nor any Plutus experience. The team also doesn't highlight whether they have or will be completed the Plutus Pioneers or some other creditable education course to learn about Plutus. Any of this information would have been useful to provide any confidence the team is taking the right steps to be able to feasibly execute this proposal and fully understand the implications of developing using Plutus and in the extended UTXO development environment.\n\nSpecifically for this proposal there are 4 different milestones that are required before this proposal can be executed. This puts a large risk on this proposal being feasible as there are many unknowns at this stage. The largest of the unknowns is whether the team is effectively able to develop an initial version using Plutus based upon their expereince. Once this is known the confidence for this proposal that is derived from the previous milestones can be increased. Due to this is will make sense for the proposal team to resubmit this proposal when the community has more information regarding their ability to execute as that is a pre-requisite for this proposal being feasible.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal outlines the management process they use to mange their work and intend to make that open sourced for the community to be able to audit. This is useful for some of the auditing side of the proposal. It would have been useful to have more information regarding KPIs for this project and the size of the market they are trying to address - or at least some indication. How much asset value or users could this proposal impact? How will that be tracked? Are there certain clients already that would integrate and use this solution and then metrics could be extrapolated out of? Secondly it would have been good to link your GitHub repository which has been found here - https://github.com/orgs/ferrumnet and then also made it more clear on what will be open source and the timeline for the community to be able to audit the progress and code publicly before any significant volume is added. The proposal is not as clear as it should be in regard to the milestones that exist between this proposal and other submitted proposals. The milestones are mentioned in each of the proposals. This not being really clear on the proposal could easily mislead assessors into thinking more of the proposal information was being executed for the budget requested.
