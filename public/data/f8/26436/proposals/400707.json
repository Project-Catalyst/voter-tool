There is a strong synergy between Cardano and DESO chain and the ADA-DESO Templates to Test Projects will be the right step towards more cross chain integration of projects between these 2 chains in future.  The DESO team will base their first user-case from their funded proposal F6: Cooperative Local-a social web app that integrates blockchain tools like NFTs, DAOs, and social tokens and enhances the scaling of consolidated dApps. According to the proposal timeline, they will deliver their first integration DESO and Cardano (repository integration) by end 2022. They notice a few challenges that could happen should they not be funded in fund 8 as there could be a competition from ADA-social dapps. However, their mission lasts even without funding and they will continue working on technical design of the cross-chain. It just shows that this proposal is dedicative to have impact to Cardano ecosystem and the  ADA-DESO templates to test projects proposal is part of their strategic plan to integrate features between chains.\n\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind DESO is already a funded team from fund 6: Corporative Local. The DESO team information is clear. The team already started its research phase and inter-ecosystem collaboration so in a way the project is already underway despite not knowing the result of fund 8 yet. Their credibility is very good as their smart city initiative is backed by Chilean government.  For the budget, they haven't broken down cost into working hours. Considering their traction, the project is very likely to  be completed. The requested budget looks reasonable enough considering all tasks involved in each step. The key metrics for development, initiative and market fit are very detailed and  defined that we can see if the project looks feasible enough.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal features (ADA-DESO template to test projects) could be useful for Catalyst projects who plan to use Tokens, DAO or NFTs and face barriers to do testing. The roadmap is very well designed and the milestones are provided. The proposal is aligned with description of challenge which is to create collaboration between Cardano and other blockchains. Provided that their proposal is funded, the impact between these 2 chains with ADA-DESO templates to test projects would facilitate the integration between chains to be much smoother with more team members both from DESO and Cardano working together and making this work.

It does not just adress the challenge it is posted in, but due to its open source character also goes beyond into the related challenge. Cross-chain compatibility is an important aspect that seems to be adressed appropriately by this proposal, will most likely be very beneficial to the Cardano ecosystem and its scalability as it has some potential to rake of network load.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A team that has already successfully delivered a proposal in my opinion already has some credibility just because of this fact. In addition to this, they have presented a very detailed implementation plan that for the most part seems sensible and is supplemented by a sufficiently detailed budget. A pretty good contingency plan was made as well that teies to identify many hurdles and fixes to them. The only grain of sand is that the team has not aquired a cardano developer, which might pose some risk (just consider the many proposals posted in each fund, many of which are also looking for devs). Still, if this risk is mitigated, I see an overall feasible project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The clear problem and solution descriptions put the proposal into a sufficient framework of what is to be expected as deliverables.

The integration of DESO and Cardano communities could provide a path to better social applications or easier testing of certain ideas. The team are using their own use case from working on cooperative local to inform them of the usage of DESO to build out the templates. It is not clear which use case would be more important from the social aspects of what DESO offers or the ability to test ideas as outlined in the proposal. It would be good to have more clarity on the exact use cases that benefit Cardano in more detail and to be more specific. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team have provided a detailed monthly roadmap with bullet point items. For the roles that are involved a budget is provided based on the monthly rate. Some of these rates, such as for a Cardano developer are fairly low at $2,000 a month. This makes it difficult to know in reality whether this proposal will be feasible against that budget range. The team provide a breakdown of the members involved with most of them having a LinkedIn profile to help verify their backgrounds. It already appears that within the team they have some of the technical expertise required for this proposal which gives some confidence that the proposal is feasible.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal defines a set of KPIs in regard to the development of the project and interactions with different stakeholders as well as some metrics in regard to the implementations usage. The metrics are fairly high level and don't add much detail. It would have been good to go in more depth on more specifics of what use cases or behaviour they would like to see from users interacting with this system. It would also be interesting to have any comparative data between other ecosystems in DESO to help determine whether this integration is as effective as other initiatives.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_758", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10241, "q0": "This idea seems like a very different one that all other considering the cross-chain collaboration challenge.  Bring together Cardano\u2019s ADA operability into DESO social web-app template it is estimated by the proposer that at least 25% of Cardano Catalyst Proposals into the Era of Voltaire will be able to build and test their solutions in a fast and cheap manner, aiming possible networks effects that could scale them at two ecosystems. Building such a bridge is absolutely within the cross-chain collaboration challenge and from my point of view is a proposal that will be able to address many more future challenges. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposing team provided their background, as well as LinkedIn profiles to verify what has been stated in the proposal. As they are the manager and tech lead of the project, it's very likely that the team will be well prepared to lead this project to be successful. Also, the skills presented and required for the team are well stated and it seems to be enough to develop the platform. The roadmap is very detailed and provides clarity on what will be developed with month, and it seems realistic to what it being proposed. The budget seems appropriate, even though i don't absolutely understand why you refer to the USD and the dollars to be funded by Fund8, as something different. The proposing team presents a very good and detailed analysis of the proposal risks and challenges, and suggests possible mitigations in a good manner and most of them make sense, although some are difficult to assess beforehand. Based on all this information, I believe that this proposal is highly feasible.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As far as auditability is concerned, the team achieved excellent results. There has been a clear explanation of the key milestones, indicating milestones with brief descriptions, so that the community is aware of both what will happen and when. \nThe success metrics are quite bold, which indicates the level of motivation and confidence the teams have in themselves. Consequently, in light of my previously described reasoning, I strongly believe that the community will have the necessary elements for auditing.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_861", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Open-source web-templates built on CARDANO-DESO to offer its projects customizable Tools/UI to test solutions easy, cheap, fast and massive.", "experience": "We are an operating start-up funded by F6 that will launch in Q1 a web-app to tokenize localities on emerging countries, using DESO Blockchain as a Beta, but aiming CARDANO-integration for its end-solution.
