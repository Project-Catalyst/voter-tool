This is beneficial where teams might want to own funds together and only send them once all the team members agree to it (rather than have only 1 of them have the keys and the discretion of what to do with the funds). This addresses the challenge by \"Developing common tools, frameworks, core infrastructures, or proof of concepts\"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers are part of the ADAO and have illustrative careers in academia and successful blockchain entrepreneurs, including working with Liquidlabs and Mlabs. However no linkedin profile are provide and no other links are provided to verify their claims. Searching on linked for the first member in the list yields 8 results. There is a link to a github repo provided in the proposal which contains a bootstrapped Next Js framework and after looking inside the code, it holds the code for the cardano-serialization-lib which is a well know Cardano library with multisig capabilities (I did not test if the multisig only works on scripts or on wallet address as well). There is no reference to this library in the proposal and no mention of a related \"CIP 1854 - Multi-signatures HD Wallets\". The budget includes 4k for hosting and server costs which is overly generous given that a Contabo most expensive VPS with 32gb ram runs at around $350 per year. Also no breakdown of how the 5k towards research and development will be allocated to different tasks. The proposal is very focused credentials of the and an appetizing deliverable, but very little on this will actually be achieved and how much of this has already been deliver by for example the cardano-serialization-lib (developed by Emurgo)", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It is not clear from the proposal how the deliverable will be tested. The statement on how progress will be measure is \"All code can be found in the ADAOcommunity GitHub. https://github.com/ADAOcommunity\".

Which the community has been asking about this, I\u2019ve noticed on twitter post comments and have heard people asking for information on it in twitter spaces.

Thank you for adding the members and a brief introduction of who they are and their skillsets, makes it easier to see who is on the project from the Cardano community and being able to see what each individual brings to the project.

For the non-tech people reading this review a multisignature wallet is a cripto wallet that requires multiple signatures to sign any transaction before it's made valid. This is often the case for organizations that have a common account and daos that require all partisipants to sign a transaction before it's valid and executed. A single user can benefit from this wallet as well if he or she requires extra level of security. Overall the impact from this proposal would be notisable for daos and users requiring extra safety and security and most of all pease of mind.\nThe proposal lacks a bit of information like metrics and any KPIs so that's a bit disapointing. Future challenges are mentioned, but unfortunately there are no solutions or methodology mentioned to overcome the problems posed.

I searched for them by name in google and linkedin and although I found people with the same names, I couldn't match the names with the skills listed in the proposal and because no links are provided in the proposal I couldn't verify them. The budget is mentioned but the could have been a better breakdown of costs because a lot of the budget items are just mentioned, but no reasoning or hourly rates are given to calculate or hours that have to be worked, just a number mentioned so I couldn't verify if the sum is reasonable or not, because I couldn't compare the hourly rate with other poposals and guidelines provided by project catalyst.\nBoth factors bring down the feasibility.
