As I mentioned, there is no specific deadline, perhaps because the idea is for this project to continue indefinitely.. I love the \"Idea Fest\" - \"A place to find collaborators and partners, a place to meet the teams behind projects and proposals and a place to showcase your ideas to the Community\". The team has thought deeply about all the proposals and it is clear that a lot of time has been spent on implementation, not just for the funding. There is a detailed breakdown of the budget - we can see that the most expensive parts are \"Management\" and \"Architecture\", perhaps because they required more members with technical background. I also enter in https://discord.gg/9pbRF2PfcU and everything inside is well structured and has a lot of information and articles.\nI don't think I have anything more to add - from now on I can say that I am voting for this performance to be part of F8", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposers are well familiar and fully committed to the Cardano ecosystem.

Scaling might be an issue for them, because lack of resources, so you can help in this department and reward their work.\nI agree that there's no need for metrics KPIs and such, because this is volunteer work they've been doing because they think it's important and will continue doing for a 'long long time'.
