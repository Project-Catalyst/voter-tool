I like the idea to be able to recover my wallet via simple CLI tool. The proposal is in the right challenge settings creating open source project for the communitys use. The KPIs are relevant to the challenge they're faced with and the level of detail about the technical implementation is admirable. There is no sense to discuss scaling of the project because the CLI will run locally on every user machine. The proposal says that the tools provided can be extended by others or integrated into existing portfolios. This will be great for all developers in the community. As a developer I don't have any concerns about this proposal and I urge people to vote for this.\n\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposals are people with planty of experience. I found Dylan Crocker linkedin profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylan-andrew-crocker/ and look likes both of them have the skills to provide the promised solution. The plan and timeline are not as detailed as I want them to be. There are too abstract for a one-year project.\nIn Q3 they will only create a CLI prototype. But if we calculate their working hours - for a quarter (approximately 12 weeks) they will work between 120-192 hours. This is about a month's full-time paid work, which is very suitable for a working prototype integrated with an external API (Blockforst.io).\nIn Q4 they are going to implement the initial decrypting of the private keys, deriving child keys, and searching for funds contained under the addresses. Here we could have the following break down, for example: \n1. implementing the decrypting algorithm - 5 weeks.  \n    1. research - 1 week\n    2. development - 2 weeks\n    3. creating unit tests - 1 week\n    4. testing - 1 week\n2. deriving child keys - 3 weeks and etc.\nFor Q1 2023, the meaning of \"extensive testing\" can be described. Will an automated test be created or does it only include manual testing?\nQ2 2023- There is no need for further explanation of the documentation and tutorial videos. It is good that the proposals will take so much time to create quality documentation and lessons.\nIn addition, both members of the team are very reliable with previous experience related to the ecosystem and the successful completion of a project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Traceability will be quite easy. Also after Q3 it will be possible for everyone to test the CLI on their own machine (the product will not be tested, but it should be almost ready). There is a previous proposal link that includes a Github repo that anyone can use to glimpse progress and performance. Unfortunately, there is no clear roadmap with the main stages and time horizons set out in the proposal but the description of the target problem is very clear. There is no list of possible problems, but this is not required, as development has not yet begun and the proposals are not very familiar with existing code, projects, APIs, etc. IMO the most important KPI is mentioned - \"allows users to enter an encrypted private key and password, which will then be able to recover funds under this private key and move them to a new wall.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1367", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 3, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2321, "q0": "\u201cThe problem was identified as a significant one.

Unlike other programs that cater to business or student consumers, this project prioritizes Cardano users. The issue presented here demonstrates that a large number of consumers are dissatisfied with their inability to restore their prior wallets and simply move to another wallet due to limited functionality. By creating an open-source CLI tool, users can get their old coins back and move them to a new wallet. A feature that Cardano wallet users will undoubtedly appreciate. It not only increases wallet quality, but also assists past quitters in returning to the Cardano system to recover what was lost. However, it appears that the risks and solutions they suggest are still unclear in order to execute a huge project with a substantial influence on the Cardano ecosystem. So conducting further study to determine the hazards that lie ahead, as well as the best way to mitigate the risks.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "To be honest, the proposer did an excellent job of assessing the feasibility part of this idea, and I absolutely agree with what has been stated. The proposal shows the aim for each quarter, and the expected sum for the year includes the engineers' hourly salaries. Particularly if, in other projects, two persons for a working group appear to be relatively little, two people for a working group appear to be quite adequate here. Since December 2019, they have all been Cardano stake pool operators and are well-versed in the ecosystem. Even yet, both members of the team have fought to successfully retrieve cash for Cardano community members who had lost access to their funds. An illustration of how the project will undoubtedly succeed. Overall, I had a good time commenting on this project and wish them the best of luck in the future.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I have nothing to criticize or add to this part of the project. It looks short, but it is full of essential information that the auditability part requires.

This is an open-source development project and the references are accessible, so it can be concluded that this project perfectly fits the Challenge key metrics. The author did a great job in describing the operation and core features of the CLI tool and gave an illustrative example for the reader to imagine.

In general, the plan is clearly presented, the timelines are appropriately divided to ensure the feasible implementation of the stated objectives. The budget is allocated on an hourly basis, which means based on the total number of hours worked by members, this is necessary so that donors can easily compare projects to assess whether the budget is properly allocated or not? However, the proposer is still estimating the budget without giving a specific number, which will affect the auditability of the project. The two key project members both have a significant educational background, work background, significant work experience relevant to the project area they are looking to develop, and both members are active activity in the Cardano community and had successfully funded a project before.

It is not clear how those interested in the project can monitor the project's activities, the author should provide the community with some tools/environment so that the community can access information about the project like GitHub, social networking, etc. The next is that there is no actual KPI, timeline, or roadmap to measure project success, which leaves the community unable to determine if a project is worth funding. Although I strongly support the core idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal, the lack of information makes the auditability of this project very low, it is also difficult for the community to fully evaluate the project.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1724", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7101, "q0": "The purpose of this proposal is to provide the everyday user with the ability to recover and move inaccessible funds. If a user has only a private key and a password, but no mnemonic (hense you can't recover your wallet normally) you wouldn't be able to use your regular wallet. This has happened to me (a developer) and I can vouch for the process and stress that it might cause you. It cost me quite a bit of time to learn what I had to do, then set it up on the testnet and then finally recover my wallet. I would really embrace such a simple solution the authors of the proposal are ofering.\nThis is the right challenge setting for this proposal and open source tools are the way to go. The community will be able to contribute and the work of many is always better than the work of one. Maintaining such a solution is also important and that's the reason why I think this proposal is important and will have an immence impact. You always think you don't need tools such as these right up until the moment you do. This will bring a better open source ecosystem and will bring the quality up.\nAs a developer I really like the seeming simplicity of this proposal, considering the knowledge you need to have to realize it. Overall an impactfull proposal for a small group of people, but with amazing impact for them no doubt.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers didn't add links to their proposal, but I recognised their names from another proposals they have in this challenge and they're legit and have all the listed skill and more on top of them. In short, they'll have no problems implementing such a solution and the only thing they do need is funding and time. They know the work they need between them and the time it will take them to offer the ready tooling with open doors for integration with a UI later on maybe.\nThe budget is reasonable standing between 30-45$/hour. \nThe roamap and milestones leave some things to be desired though. There's a really birds eye view of the roadmap and there are no concrete task breakdowns which is a bit disapointing for an otherwise decent proposal. My advise would be to have a breakdown of tasks and an estimated time for each one in hours. When you combine that with an hourly rate, you have your budget. I don't like the range given for the hourly rate and I find it strange. most of the proposals in this category have proffessionals working on them as well, and a thing about a proffesional is he knows what he's worth.\nThere's a plan for implementation, but I couldn't say if it's sensible or not because there's a lack of details and description as I mentioned. I'd have to deffer to the knowledge of the proposers which I see is vast. As a developer I think this is a solid and feasible solution even though the caveats mentioned. I'd suggest to the proposers to polish their proposal skills to up the possiblity of funding.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This will be an opensource project which means a repository, which means access for anyone interested in looking at the 5 promised commits a month. Alongside that there's a sensible description of the problem and I'm really glad the authors mentioned there are already such cases. The proposed solution is not ideal for non tech people, because the CLI is not really userfriendly unless your user is a software engineer, but nonetheless it's much easier to use than the alternative.\nThe proposers have a good idea of the end result and have some metrics, although the commits per month metric is not ideal to measure adoption for example of their CLI so I'd recommend they work on the metrics for the next proposal I'm sure they'll have.
