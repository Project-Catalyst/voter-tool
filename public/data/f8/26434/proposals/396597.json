As a developer myself I really like the idea and I would gladly take part in such a venture. I also really like the idea of having an option to not only get a payment in the form of ADA, but in the future in NFTs as well. These NFTs could give you different perks and utility.\nThis is really missing in the Cardano ecosystem up to this moment, because there are a lot of developers that I know that would gladly take part full time if they could be financially free while doing it. The insentives platform is the last missing piece for me that will open the door for many open source projects of any kind.\nThe key metrics could be better, although IMO as a developer they're quite realistic as they are right now. The definition of success is a bit vague and could be better specified although I realize that might be the scary part. Scaling the platform is also something the proposers have thought about which is a good sign since a lot of other proposals seem to skip this essential part of growth. I think this proposals fits right in the challenge settings and will give a change to developers to make some money while sharpening their skillset.\nIt's also commendable that the authors are gradually building on top of their previous idea funded in fund 5 where they tokenize github pull requests (translation \"changes in code\" for non tech oriented people).\nAs a developer I don't see anything missing in this proposal, because from a technical stand point it all seems clear. Good luck to you and I hope you get funded this round as well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the evidence links etc. there are some linkedin profiles mentioned in the proposal, but I'm not sure the owners have hired the 2 developers mentioned in the proposal yet. The sallary seems feasible. It's really cool that all the money will be used to develop the platform, and this is the right way to go IMHO so Kudos on the creators of the platform. It's a matter of finding the right people to create the platform now.\nThe budget is otlined clearly and seems reasonable in relation to the work that needs to be done and the amount of time, because 3 months is a lot of time for activly developing something. It's good they have the number of people and the abilities skillset figured out as well as the payment plan. It's not everything but it's a start. The roadmap seems legit considering the work that needs to be done on the platform. \nThe authors have considered a challenge they might have in the form of finding resources although to be honest I'm not sure if they're talking about people to work for them, finding people to visit their platform or finding funds. In that regart the proposal might have been a bit more clear.\nHaving said that the description of the problem and the solution are explained well enough for anyone to understand. Overall I really like the idea and I would consider the proposal even more feasible if there were better definitions of success, because the current ones are a bit vague, but are definitely headed in the right direction.\nI love the energy of the proposers toward the people in the comments, that shows that there is interest and they would be able to find developers to do the necessary work to make this platform a reallity. The authors are really open for colaboration with other community members. This is what open source projects are all about \u2013 colaboration!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Considering this would be an open source project, I'm a bit disapointing there is no linked github repository or another platform for open sourced development. It's a really negligible effor to create the repository where you plan doing the work, and just linking the empty repository in this proposal would have been enough for me to say that the project is auditable and tracable. Having said that, the proposers do have a telegram channel and a twitter as well as a github repository, although it's empty. I really like the idea of engaging people though your platform so you can involve them in your project even more.\nThere's a clear problem and a somewhat clear solution to the problem. The authors are really headed in a great direction with all the talk of colaboration and marketing strategies like incentivizing developers for registrations on their platform. I really like that authors seem to try and be as transparent as possible so they bring a community together behind the project, which I can see happening in the near future. \nOverall the project seems feasabile and auditable although there are some small kinks to be flattened out here and there.

The author has clearly explained the technical side, the core features, and how the platform works. They had a successful proposal at Fund5, so I believe they have a good grasp of how to present a project. I think the general recommendation that meets the Challenge KPIs is to post the number of people contributing to the Cardano ecosystem, more specifically is foster developers to contribute to open-source projects and create more opportunities for open source developers to earn an additional passive income, gain unique valuable skills and experience when contributing to open source projects. I realize they still haven't come up with a solution to the risk they are referring to as need more resources to come in, guide, and help them push this project. This makes readers doubt the feasibility of the project. Overall the core idea is very good, synchronized with the KPIs of the Challenge, but the lack of resources to develop the project is a huge risk, they need to come up with a plan to solve this problem as soon as possible. I will give this part 4 stars.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "They present the plan by stating what they have done and what will be done without a specific roadmap. I think they should present the project development plan in barem which is how many phases the project is divided into, what will be done in each phase, after each phase what part of the product will be completed, when will the product be completed? whether there is a testing phase or not. As for the budget, I suggest they add 3 months of total developer working hours, what activities and resources are the marketing plan needed? Furthermore, I see a disparity between the cost for the items ($9k/3 months for developers + $5k in marketing costs = $14k) and the total budget ($23k), which reduces auditability and transparency of the project. Regarding personnel, although they have provided Linkedin so that readers can verify the members' identities, I encourage them to have a brief biographical summary of the position + work experience. + educational background + knowledge + previous projects of each member. They mentioned that a company in Vietnam will also cooperate in this project, I wish they could provide information about this company (website address for example). I will give this part 3 stars", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The KPIs they set are to get at least 20 companies or open-source projects to use platform at average at least 1 transaction each at least and they call it a success at this phase, but they don't provide information on how long this phase lasts, so it is difficult for the community to track the progress and development of the project. At the same time, I also want them to better explain the difference in the budget, complete the budget and personnel plan to increase the auditability of the project. I like their proposal, it would be a pity if the quality of the project was affected by a few minor errors in the presentation.
