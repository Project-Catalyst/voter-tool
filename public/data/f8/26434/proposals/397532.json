By creating and making smart contract templates, backend and frontend available to the Cardano NFT creator community, any project that wants to implement a swap service in the future for their specific communities will be able to do it much easier, faster and at a much lower cost than having to develop their own solutions from scratch, and also the challenge is the lack of available and qualified Haskell/Plutus developers, but I hope they will overcome these challenges with ease. Proposers highly recommended. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The authors perfectly explain What will be done, the main phases of the project. To me, this is an ideal example of how to present the actual part of a proposal, because I observe that authors are often interested in exposing the phases that make up the entire project, but don't go into detail about them, explaining exactly what should make up what happens in each. As for the financial amount, we know how much money will come to each stage of the project, which is extremely necessary, but it is very positive to find here the same details of the item analyzed earlier . I believe this is a very important detail to this proposal, as it also seeks to reach an underutilized audience for the Cardano ecosystem, so it will be necessary to have an understanding of how the idea can work. able to achieve them, the implementation plan, will be recorded and submitted through the Catalyst Monthly Report form.. Regarding the team that made up the project, they are certainly capable and successful for this project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The group exposes here exactly what it intends to achieve, and also what it seeks as the months go by, exercising possible control of the community. Since it is a project that already has a prototype, it will be interesting to see how this product will turn into its beta and later into its final version the authors will also be able to show these results. to several groups of experts in the community, to provide further security on what is being worked on. However, I believe everything is in agreement with the ability to monitor the progress of the project, this idea is just an addition that will make the script even more reliable.

Their explanation of the impact is thoughtful and able to speak to everyone. The KPIs are also consistent with those of the challenge. As this project is a new initiative and moreover with a certain ambition, it is easy to see the possibility of this initiative to address future challenges, in particular by the precision of the team: \u201cAs a result of the project , new connections are formed between members of the Cardano open source community, potentially leading to further fruitful collaboration\u201d.

The fact that this proposal is submitted under the umbrella of the NFT guild is also a plus. Many links are provided and illustrate the explanations. The budget is well detailed, as well as the plan, with the different phases of implementation. The advantage of this proposal is that the technical aspects are approached in an understandable way, which shows the ability of the team to communicate their skills and their attention to be understood.
