The identified problem and solution are a good fit for the goals of the challenge. This proposal provides open source information which is beneficial to the catalyst community but also continues on previous work and evaluates SDG alignment of proposals which is a feature already integrated into catalyst. As such it is important to analyze the results from that feature to gain any benefits from it. The overview of existing solutions is also listed as an aim of the challenge. In terms of value beyond the evaluation of a catalyst feature, having information on the sustainable development goals (SDG) of proposals fits well with the values of the Cardano community. I have been involved in the community since 2017 and  in my opinion Cardano has always had an altruistic leaning which is a very positive thing to have and is a strong motivator for community growth. Now I'm sure that not everyone shares these goals as something important but for those who prefer talking about profit then the report that this project aims to generate and make available would be very valuable to the ecosystem in terms of generating a positive image. Major investment firms and large private investors around the world now look to SDGs as a major asset when choosing where to invest. From any way you choose to look at it the $9000 requested in this case is small compared to the return on investment. The KPIs for the challenge make sense since they involve producing information that is open source and help in the evaluation of a current feature as mentioned earlier. I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This team is well known to the catalyst community and has worked and produced results on several other funded proposals. The team has all the required skills and experience needed to complete the proposal as written. The skills and expertise of the team can be verified through the links provided in the proposal. The budget for this proposal is clearly identified and broken down into individual costs. Those costs are reasonable. There are timeframes identified for the completion of all elements in the roadmap. There is a good understanding of the risks associated with this proposal and it is good to see that the team understands where the challenges will be when conducting their work and have thought of ways to deal with those challenges. Given this team's experience and record on previous proposals along with everything else listed above I strongly agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal provides a clear roadmap with reasonable timeframes for the completion of all parts of the proposal. The KPIs are very simple to audit since they are primarily reports and information that will be shared publicly. The team has already shared such documents and reports in previous challenges and provided examples so we already know what the sharing would look like. The KPIs presented make sense to fulfill the aim of the proposal and the connected aims of the broader challenge.

As a CA, I would always like to see the funding process to become as accurate as possible. This will help make sure that the proposals that are reaching the voting stage are well written and have a solid team looking to help the Cardano ecosystem. Cardano AIM has been great at helping implement SDG's into this process. The team realizes that this requires some analysis and team efforts to find the most productive method. I think that this could greatly impact the funding process and to help the right proposers have a chance of receiving funds. For this reason, I give this proposal a 4 out of 5 stars for this category. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has given a great amount of detail in regards to their team members.
