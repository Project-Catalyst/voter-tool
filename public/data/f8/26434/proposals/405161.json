From what I understood, the ambassadors guild main job is to coordinate actions and operations, but it's not mentioned what dose actions and operations are. Another mentioned task is the maintenance of crucial community communication platforms and hubs, but unfortunately they're not mentioned as well. Maybe they meant discord and telegram, but I might be mistaken. From what I understand they help the community grow in some way, so that would mean this is truly the right challenge setting for their proposal.\nHelping the community grow and giving back is one of the challenge settings, so they fit right into that category. I personaly didn't know for the existance of an ambasadors guild. The mentioned provided items mentioned in the impact statement were:\n* providing services listed in the feasibility section so I'll elaborate there\n* motivating people\n* coordinate actions - didn't find out what exactly is being coordinated\n* maintenance of communication platforms and hubs - no examples are given so I coudln't verify\nI didn't find a metric measuring the provided services or other items listed by the guild so it's hard for me as a CA to find the possible impact they mightt have as after some research, I still don't know the specific value provided. Maybe this is something missing in the ecosystem, but as a developer myself I tent to be more pragmatic and search for specific details which I wasn't able to find. As a suggestion I'd say that this proposal would have made a lot more sense to me if the authros provided an example of a project start to end and list their specific contributions to it or another example that let's their contribution shine. A couple of diferent examples would be best. This would enable me to evaluate their value to the ecosystem and list specific pros and cons as I see them. Overall I'm not sure about the impact this proposal is going to have.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers have provided a link to look at all the team members on this address https://ambassadors-guild.io/ but unfortunately it didn't work when I opened it. Fortunately I found a repository with the same link: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/ambassadors-guild but it also was empty except for a Readme file so I wasn't able to verify the listed skillsets and didn't find the team members.\nI like the initiative taken, to try and structure a process to streamline the community effort. The large list of activities is great, but a little too vague except for the Content Creation, although a list of these already done podcasts, interviews and articles would have been nice and I would have been happy to read some to help me evaluate the effort. The Advice and Consulting item I really hoped had an example with it, because after watching both the videos of the ledger integration here: https://cardano-ambassadors-guild.gitbook.io/ambassadors-guild/proposals/project-catalyst/fund-7/ledger-live-integration-proposal I couldn't see the ambassadors in action so I figure the help happens behind the curtains, and that's all and good but I can't understand something I can't read of see or is not mentioned anywhere. The ledger team had a product owner Roman Beyon-Grataroli that dealt with the coordination and I didn't get the reference about the ambassadors being coordinators to build the ledger live cardano integration so an example here would be nice as well.\nI'm not mentioning the project management, accounting and secretary, because those are roles that bring value to the ambassadors project itself and not directly involved with supporting the proposers. That's not to say I don't think them necessary, I just wanted to make the distinction between added value to the proposers and community (the core business of the ambassadors) and the Bureaucratic Roles as they are named.\nThe budget breakdown could use a bit more breaking down, because I couldn't find an hourly rate or research being done for the marketing and PR tools or platforms that are to be used or what timeframe would the funds be used in. As a CA I've seen 50+ proposals and the project catalyst budget guide so I have a good idea of the hourly rates and I usually calculate them to check if they're valid, but unfortunately for the listed reasons I couldn't do that here.\nOverall this proposal left me with quite a lot unanswered questions, and I hope they read my assessments with the constructive criticism it was intended with. I really hope you polish your proposal and come back next funding round with the same idea in a more detailed and example filled version of the proposal. Good luck!", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I think there will be no problem with the tracability for anyone that wants to track the progress, by checking out the linked gitbook. I would suggest to focus more on explainin and measuring what you bring to the table or listing commendations or reviews by the proposers and projects you've helped. I think this would boost your credability way higher because I would give me the confidence I need to assess positively. I'm sure there's a need for the services you can provide but you need to also think about representing them in an understandable way to the voters. Examples and reviews I believe are a great way to do that.\nWhen I read the success definition, I noticed there isn't any metrics that would measure the value brought to the cardano community like positive reviews received or current projects or number of community events created and such.\nOverall I think there's no problem with the auditability of this proposal and as long as you're active in the telegram discord and you have a site where you share information and progress reports, you're in the green.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 4, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The idea in this proposal is great, to further incentivize the Cardano Ambassadors when working towards improving the Cardano community. The establishment of this Guild will provide coordination and operations to continue and self sustainable. The impact would be great considering the Cardano Ambassador role is very important to engage with the community; e.g doing community events, engaging in a local community, etc. Hence, will grow user awareness for Cardano ecosystem. However, it should mention how the operation will work and conduct, as not only telling us that it will create a functional treasury for Cardano Ambassadors Guild, and somehow it will be well used.

Providing roadmap is important since it will show that the proposer knows what will be done, the timeline, and goals. Otherwise, it will be just a \u201cwishful\u201d proposal, where it will only outline the people needed and the objective set, but don\u2019t have the actual plan on how to achieve those. The budget is also too general, consider breaking it down even more for each allocation category. E.g Content Creation, explain how the $4000 is used, maybe number of social media post, poster, design, etc. A decent example would be like this proposal from Eastern Catalyst School, that outline their budget detail in each allocation category (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/405311).

The team clearly explains the impact of this initiative within the community, which is concrete and has already proven its worth, this proposal being only a way of perpetuating this initiative by allowing its evolution, by the fact that its members can be remunerated for their contribution and leave volunteering.\nBy explaining the different ways in which The Ambassadors Guild provides ongoing community engagement, the impact is further justified and linked to the challenge KPIs.

I read up on Cardano Ambassadors and learned that the Cardano Foundation Ambassador Program does have a Rewards system. It rolled out in 2020 but no new news can be found. Was it discarded? Was it because it had poor ROI or just too little participation? If the proposer knows more about this, filling in the 'history book' on the Ambassador program could also help voters/readers decide on the idea. The idea of a treasury for rewarding Ambassadors is a good one -- but to make sure it delivers maximum impact, the proposal should include some more details. Who is eligible for Ambassador role? Is it a new role or the one based on Cardano Foundation's? Does any action result in rewards or will there be KPIs needed to be met? etc.etc. Some of these suggestions could help strengthen the proposal.
