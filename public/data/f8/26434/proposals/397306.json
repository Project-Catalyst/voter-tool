Reps are professionals doing work, devoting time and should be compensated for Feb-April 2022 properly", "f6_no_assessments": 3, "f6_rating": 2.555555555555556, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 6208, "q0": "Unfortunately, I think that the impact of this proposal will be negative as it might potentially undermine the legitimacy of some processes inside Project Catalyst. The proposer wants to compensate already elected members of the Catalyst Circle version 3 (CCv3) by retroactively approving changes to the terms of their engagement - by modifying the post from an essentially semi-voluntary engagement ($1k USD per person for a 3 month term) to a fully compensated professional engagement with a USD3,00/month compensation for each month. This is a nine-fold increase for a 3-month period, from $1k USD per person for a 3 month term to $9k USD per person to a 3 month term.\n\nThe proposal comes from a CCv3 member, who has a direct interest in increasing the compensation, which is a legitimate aspiration, but the impact of it is in my view negative. \n\nThe idea to compensate future Catalyst Circle members in CCv4 and beyond is a more than valid idea, but this specific proposal aims to modify the terms retroactively. \n\nThe elections for CCv3 took place under the presumption that it would be a semi voluntary role ($1,000 for an entire three-month period) and it can be inferred that many competent candidates did not apply because it was a semi-voluntary position. \n\nNow, after the election, the proposer (himself a CCv3 member) wishes to change the terms - by introducing a comparably high monthly salary of USD3,000. \n\nHad the conditions been such before the election, then the current CCv3 body might not have been elected - because other possibly more competent candidates might have stood in the elections. Introducing 9-times higher retroactive salaries for semi-volunteer bodies, seems like a bad precedent and I believe could have a negative impact on Project Catalyst - as agreed compensation guidelines would be changed by the very people who are supposed to promote respect for the agreed guidelines. \n\nI am confused about the validity of the Problem statement. Namely, the problem statement reads \"The F7 proposal for CCv3 is too low.\"  \nIf the F7 proposal for CCv3 was too low for some CCv3 members, then those CCv3 members should have not participated in the CCv3 elections under those terms - and should have waited for terms that would suit them possibly in CCv4 or later. \n\nChanging the rules as we go retroactively, could have a negative impact on the Challenge in my view. \n\nSuccess in this challenge is defined as: \"A growing number of experts join forces to build collaboratively on community owned infrastructure, tooling, standards, libraries and docs\". The CCv3 has already been formed and is working. This proposal will not grow the number of experts as the CCv3 elections have been completed and the volunteers have already been elected. \n\nThe title of the proposal may suggest the wrong impression, in my view. The proposal is entitled: \"CCv3 members are professionals too\". In fact, CCv3 members are semi-volunteers with a limited compensation for their engagement - and they were elected under those very terms. The elections were not held under the slogan \"CCv3 members are professionals too\".\n\nWhat is true is that CCv4 members might be professionals and elections to that effect may take place. However, CCv3 members are not professionals - as those were the agreed election terms. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "I disagree that given the experience and the plan, this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nThe elections for CCv3 members were not held by calling in professionals, rather they were held with the aim of attracting volunteers - with the  $1k USD per person compensation for a 3 month term. The proposal aims to change this post festum to $3k USD per person per month of their term. \nHence, even if we now retroactively change the terms of engagement - it is too late to obtain possibly better professionals for CCv3 membership - unless the current CCv3 team resigns and allows for a new election in which more professionals can stand for the position of CCv3 membership.\n\nJust paying someone elected as a semi-volunteer ( $1k USD per person for a 3 month term) will not ensure the feasibility of \"obtaining professionals\" - as is suggested in the title of the proposal \"CCv3 members are professionals too\". Namely, we cannot change the CCv3 composition now. \n\nThe detailed plan included reveals the original plan for non-professional CCv3 members and this proposal just intends to use the same plan and compensate CCv3 members. \n\nA. Now that the CCv3 members were elected as semi-volunteers, the proposal wishes to forget the semi-volunteer status and pay them as professionals (although professionals who would not participate in the elections without full-time compensation were not allowed to take part).\n\nThis seems to be the essence of the plan ... and the proposed detailed plan and timeline for delivering the solution under the Feasibility section of the proposal - is essentially the same obligations and activities that the CCv3 members agreed to - without USD3,000 monthly compensation. The activities of the CCv3 stay the same, the experience stay the same, the membership stays the same, the CCv3 roadmap stays the same - so there is no impact on the activities of the CCv3 circle, as the members already agreed to do all the activities. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I disagree that the auditability part of the proposal refers to this specific proposal directly. \n\nThe auditability segment reads like a list of CCv3 chores, tasks, meetings and other activities that have been agreed to by the CCv3 members when they took part in the elections. This has already been agreed and is not conditional on this proposal as the CCv3 members have previously agreed to be compensated with USD1,000 for the entire 3 month period. \n\nThe auditability of this proposal would effectively involve checking whether the transfer of USD3,000/month has been made to each CCv3 member - if this proposal is approved.\n\nI do not think that this proposal will advance any of the key metrics for this challenge \"Open Source Development Ecosystem\":\n\n- increase the number and the quality of Cardano Open Source projects\n\n- increase the number of contributors\n\n- increase of open source tools and frameworks from the community for the community (dog-fooding)\n\nWhy? \n\nThe number and quality of OpenSource projects will not necessarily increase, as the CCv3 agreed to pursue the activities that lay ahead of the CCv3 with the earlier semi-volunteer compensation model. In fact, by increasing compensation to USD3,000/month, arguably we have lost the ability to select and pay better CCv3 members - who were not able to stand in the elections, because of the semi-volunteer model. \n\nThe number of contributors stays the same - five members of CCv3\n\nThere will be no additional funding for open source tools and frameworks from the community for the community (dog-fooding), compared to a situation without this proposal. \n\nFinally, I want to be clear the problems stemming from this proposal - are not about increasing CC member compensation. I support it for future CCv4 and others. However, doing so retroactively for CCv3 by a CCv3 member - may harm the impact, feasibility and auditability of the entire structure of Catalyst - as it introduces a dangerous precedent of changing financing rules retroactively - even after an earlier proposal has been approved and elections took place based on that. \n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_35", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 7062, "q0": "The idea is to pay for the work the Catalyst Circle members are doing, which is a great idea, since being a ca and a vca for the last 3 funds, I'm sure they're doing all things listed in the proposal and I have no doubt they have a significant impact over the community and the growth of the whole cardano ecosystem. To be honest I didn't know the CC members didn't get payed at all and I always assumed they had some sort of funding I didn't know about. Considering they do no less work for the community, I wouldn't put this proposal any lower than any other proposal in this category. \nThe proposal is in line with the challenge settings since it gives back to the community and improves the process for everyone involved. I've took advante of several of the mentioned perks provided by the CC members without even knowing it and this leads me to believe others have as well. After all it's only fair to being payed after you've done a job. The fact they're enjoyng their work so much they've done part of it for free proves only they can be trusted and they are doing their best to move things forward and evolve.\nThe many key metrics and deffinition of success is valid. They are sure to be able to address future challenges, since they've done it for some time now and have the experience or have gained it along the way.\nOverall I aprove of this proposal and do believe the the impact they've had on the community and environment is evident.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "These are known members of the community and I know or have heard/read most of their names, so i don't question their credibility or skills necessary to do the work that needs doing. Even so, I've managed to verify all their credentials and can attest to their listed skillset. This brings credability to the project and improves how feasible it is. I also really like the idea of a control structure to audit the work of the CC members, which I believe is a sturdy hierarchy that has proven to work over time. \nThe budget for the proposal seems reasonable considering the work they're doing and it's keeping with the recommended funding guidelines by project catalyst formed by the community as I'm sure they're well aware of. There's a realistic timeframe for the work, but again they've already proven they can work in the timeboundaries set by the current workflow and manage their time well enough. There's a speciffic roadmap of the work that get's done, and it helped me understand all the work that gets done behind the scenes and I urdge anyone reading this to have a look for themselves to educate themselves and get a better understanding of how much work is put in for the ecosystem to evolve to the state it is at right now.\nAll the challenges and risks are mostly related to govenrnance and not giving too much power to one individual, but after reading this proposal and understanding the constraints and constant feedback and community power, I really don't see that happening for this or any other project.\nA feasible proposal, with sensible funding and proven people to push the progress forward.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability section is quite large, and here I found one of the first tools that were generated based on the efforts of the community in combination with the CC members. I've used these Catalyst-Circle gitbook many times to check what's the progress in governance playbook mostly. This is one of the most auditable projects I've seen. It has a whole team of other known community members auditing them so I wouldn't be worried at all about that.\nThe problem of not getting payed is more than clear for anyone, as well as the solution which is .. give the people their money!
