From my understanding, this project aims to build a plugin for websites to easily accept ADA as a payment method. I believe that this can bring a lot of benefits for both buyers and sellers since all the trades can be done in once specific currency, the ADA. In addition to that, it will also increase acknowledgement of Cardano when the plugin tool is displayed to the Wordpress economy. Mentioning the Lido Nation, I think that this is a great community where newcomers can find information and articles to help them fully understand the Cardano ecosystem and resulting in increasing the number of participants joining in. The team also has clear statements on how they get motivated by the ambition of expanding the ecosystem and show their value once the project is funded and delivered. They have identified the risk and already taken some action to solve it. By offering a collaboration with winners in fund 7, i think that they have brought their reliability into another level.

I like the idea that every member of the team can be able to cover many aspects such as engineering, writing and editing contents, designing, etc. Though this is a new team, I still can feel their ambition in providing educational articles and helpful plugins for the community. I strongly agree that this project will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The given key metrics are clear and understandable which help voters and the community easily audit the development of the project.

First, I would like to commend the team on how to present the project, no category is left out here, all the information provided is of a high reference value, in line with the requirements of each topic, logical, and easy to understand. The proposer presented the core features, operation, the technical terminology of the product, and analyzed the positive effects of the project on the Cardano ecosystem (increase the number and the quality of Cardano Open Source projects, increase the number of contributors, increase of open source tools and frameworks from the community for the community). Risks and solutions are also mentioned by them, I see a great similarity between their recommendations and Challenge KPIs, so I will give 5 stars in this section.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I believe that their team can completely run the project and are ready to do it anytime. A plantable provides an extremely detailed solution, full of information about milestones, main activities and goals to be achieved, release time of Beta version and official version is also provided. The budget is split on an hourly basis, making it easy for investors to compare with the budgets of other projects to determine their budget is reasonable or not. They worked hard to create a budget table with all the necessary information such as the main items to be paid, the number of hours worked, the budget paid for each item. Regarding the personnel involved in the project, they introduced the basic information about their team, summarized the biographies of the members, provided Linkedin for further reference, and verified the information they provided about the project personnel. I can see that their team has a deep understanding of Blockchain technology and Cardano platform, the core members have multi-disciplinary knowledge, skills, and work experience that can ensure the project is run well and efficient operation. I have found all the information I want to find in this section, no questions asked here.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This is the perfect project presentation I've been looking for. Fortunately, in this section, they have brought up two core pieces of information that many proposers often overlook. The first is a way for the community to access information about the progress and development of the project, measuring the success of the project (Github), the second is a roadmap including milestones (1 month, 4 months, 9 months, and 12 months) and specific KPIs that they commit to achieving at each stage (community project manually onboarded, community projects onboarded, community projects using the plugin). Also, I think they should include user experience in a KPIs section and build channels where users can give feedback on the usage experience and quality of the product.

First of all, the impact for innovation and adoption is VERY tangible. This gives exposure to 455 million WordPress sites that draw in their own audiences across a variety of different genres and industries. It also appeals specifically to the web developer community through Laravel. These kinds of openly accessible applications are what will drive forward organic adoption. I also like the 90% adoption goal, which is extremely ambitious. Also, the potential partnerships with reputable partnerships would add a lot of credibility to the project and the asking budget is not unreasonable for the impact potential. These are the primary factors that lead me to my end score. The additional details on value, motivation and methodology are just bonus details that give a more thorough understanding of what and how the product is being built. Great start! ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This section is almost perfect, as far as specific things that I look for in this section of proposals. First, The roadmap looks great. Timeline based milestones with reasonable expectations about what could is planned to be accomplished. I wouldn't mind a little more detail on estimated hours to complete each task but that's not a necessary feature for me. Second, I look at the development team to determine if they appear to have the sufficient experience/talent to accomplish what they plan to do. For which the answer is a resounding \"YES!\" They've got plenty of software engineering experience and they've got someone that has formal studies in Spanish, which makes me think that there's pretty good potential for wider accessibility of this app right out of the gate. The budget looks great too but falls a little bit short on details for me. The hourly rate of $65/hr for core developers is a bit on the higher end, which does make sense for the level of experience brought to the table. However, most catalyst proposals I see range around $30-$35/hr because it's supposed to be startup money and not high-level corporate budget money. I'll give it a pass but it would also be nice to know how many hours are planned for each development task. The budget for email/phone support seems a little low to me for a $12k yearly salary for (I assume) one person. Still, this is a nice feature that could help this product see decent success. Overall, I think it's a solid answer of feasibility that only leaves me with a few questions here and there. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Based on comments regarding the previous proposal for this idea, this auditability section seems like a substantial upgrade. GitHub is nice but it would be nicer if we got a direct link for their GitHub page for public accountatability. I do also find it moderately concerning that there is no budget allocated for marketing in order to fuel the possibility for these goals to be accomplished. This section isn't very thorough but it at least provides one or two points to measure success in terms of usability. I'm just not entirely sure success is likely or appropriately auditable without proper marketing. This would be a great opportunity to provide social media links.

That's a great idea that would bring lots of new users to the cardano ecosytesm so I'd call that a success on the impact front. The proposers have made a statistic that shows onesidedly that there's a market to take advantage of and utilize. The proposal is in line with the challenge setting considering they will be building a fully open source php SDK to be used in a variance of different ways (as an Out of the box package for wordpress and larvel as well as standalone).\nThis solution is driven and I really like the mention of a setup wizzard making this really user friendly and running with defaults that enables easy usage. Another thing that I really like as a developer is the part about not using third party APIs for querying the cardano blockchain as the authors of the proposal are running their own node and have been funded in previous funds as well.\nI don't see anything missing in the impact portion of the proposal and am faily certain that this approach is good for bringing new blood to the ecosystem in the form of regular users, artists and anyone that can make and NFT and sell it as well as create any other kind of valuable content and accept contributions for it through different platforms integratin the aforementioned SDK.\nConsidering the size of the team, and their experience, I don't think overcoming the mentioned challenges would stop them from executing the proposal. Overall this will surely have a positive impact.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer have linked their profiles where I was able to verify their skillset and credibility so I have no worries about them having the technical or project management abilities to complete this project. They already have a plethora of technical frameworks running. Besides that they are stake pool operators that means they are a valuable part of the community as is. The proposal has a decent idea on what specific number of members will be necessary to bring this project to a successful end as well as the abilities they must posses. There was something about onboarding artists as well, which is a really forward looking idea and I do appreciate the presance of such details in their feasibility plan.\nAs a developer myself I do think the proposed timetable is relevant and the milestones are well put together and paced. I would have liked to see a bit more information and maybe a link for the mentioned github account. It seems like a really low hanging fruit to create an empty github repository that will give the followers of the proposal a singular place to follow the technical side of things. I do realize there's a whole site where information can be posted, but for more technical people like myself a github repository link is always a preferred option.\nOverall I really believe this is a feasible proposal and I really hope it gets funded in this round so these creators can keep on building and developing the ecosystem in a decentralized manner.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I think more could have done for the auditability of this project. As I previously mentioned a github link is missing. I found the lidonation repository: https://github.com/lidonation and I really hope after reading this review the proposers create a repo for the SDK where I'll be sure to follow and watch their progress as I'm sure many interested voters will do.\nThe roadmap looks good and is broken down into general deliverables, which is great and easy to follow and progress check. The KPIs do ahve concrete estimated numbers and actual goals, which is rare unfortunately for many other proopsals, so kudos for realizing how to create them properly. \nThere's a clear problem statement that describes the context very well and a solution statement to match and light the way. I'd recommend for the proposer to read their proposal a potential voter and see what questions arise. How can I connect with them? Is it easy to give them feedback? I believe this will bring to a better auditability. Overall it's an audittable project no doubt, although there are some few things to polish still.
