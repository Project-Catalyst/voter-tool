This will essentially become a searchlight for the people that needs to know Cardano and the projects and/or general knowledge about the latest happening in Cardano.

That is how far the proposer went with details on the budget. The proposal can be improved much if they can lay out a clear breakdown of the incentives system for the proposers.\n\nFortunately, the team\u2019s experiences is a great start to at least capable of handling the coming streamers. Some of the team members are active on multiple regular events in Cardano/Project Catalyst.\n\nThe timeline is rather acceptable though not going any deeper than showing potential monthly targets. More details weekly on what is targeted to be done will definitely improve the appearance of this proposal.\n\nChallenges are spotted by the proposer, mainly on the contributors/streamers that are actually interested in the program.

This proposal looks like a giant marketing campaign to evolve and grow the cardan open source developer ecosystem and I personately love it.\nThe identified problem with the open source community is partly that it's so decentralized that it's sometimes hard to bring everyone together and talk in a convenient time for everyone because there are participants all around the globe. I deffinitely feal any participant wanting to take part in some discussion will have a chance to do so in a 48 hours stream. It's a creatively impactfull idea worth chasing.\nThe key ketrics mentioned are valid for what the organizers are trying to do and they've do a terrific job of explaining the benefits deriving from such events in detail in the proposal. As a developer, I'd gladly take part of such events and watch streams which I can take part of. I'm really interested in what streamers they would invaite to take part of this marketing and community building work.\nThe proposal will add something missing to the current ecosystem and it's possibility to take part in any free time you can. I think it's a great proposal and I hope you get voted in! Good luck!\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There are plenty of team members presented in the proposal that I managed to verify and check their credentials and skillset which matches IMHO the necessary drive you need to have to organize such massive events. The team members have experience tracking the cardano treasury as well as organizing byweekly events for the cardano community already which makes this proposal the logical next step in their evolution as community leaders.\nI really like there's a collaboration and attack on multiple fronts to make such events possible. In fact there are several different proposals planning to work towards the same goal. \nI agree with the main challenge noted by the proposers, namely finding streamers to take part in the event. I'd suggest to contact youtube tech and investment youtubers who seem to always be open to contribute and take part of interviews and simmilar events. Maybe an interview on select number of already funded project could be the point of contact with some of these streamers.\nThere's a realistic timetable to organize the events and a considerate budget breakdown that looks really reasonable and the cost / value ration seems to be optimal. Not too much technical aspects for this proposal and as a developer myself I'd refrain from commenting on marketing strategies and will deffer that judgement to better people than I.\nOverall I don't see any issue with this proposal and it looks feasible and probable to be honest. Good luck!\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This is one of the proposal with most public interraction and one of the larger communities so I don't think auditability would be an issue considering they're partnering with the treasury fund. The results will be more than obvious when the 48 hour streaming starts and discussions begin. I do wander if this would have such a positive effect on the people outside the cardano community looking in, but I'll be glad to find out. \nThe problem statement had me a bit confused at the begining, because I thought there were already streams happening, but after I read through the whole proposal I understood the idea behind the plan. The solution seems really legit and it would be a fair step forward for the growth.\nOverall an auditable interesting proposal. I'll be tuning into!\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7248, "q0": "This project proposes to create Catalyst events to facilitate proposer exposure, via livestreams of an extended period of time (48 hours). The purpose of this would of course be to address the fact that proposers don\u2019t have the necessary venues available to reach voters and convince them to support their projects. \nThe aim is to create what the proposers call the Catalyst Streaming Guild, which is one piece of 3 that aim to increase proposer outreach (via other proposals). This sounds like a good idea to me, because we currently have Idea Fest every once in a while and proposers also present their work during weekly townhalls, but we can always do with more events, especially if they are dedicated to proposers. The benefit of doing this would be increasing a proposer\u2019s confidence they can gain the trust of the community, thus encouraging them to take a chance with Catalyst and add their proposals here.\nThe proposers were not very clear in the risk section here, listing several actions, like \u201cAttracting Streamers willing to take an interest in Catalyst Events.\u201d or \u201cCoordinating Guild Access to Guild Stream\u201d. These are not risks in my opinion, they are to do items. A risk would have been for example \u201cno streamers willing to take interest in Catalyst events will be found\u201d.\nRegardless, increasing the popularity of Project Catalyst with live streams hosted by popular people in the space sounds to me like a very good idea and I agree this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.

Both of them seem to me to have the necessary skills to complete this proposal successfully. Score: 5.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For Auditability, the proposers mentioned that the management of the finances will be done transparently, by the Treasury Guild (a Catalyst Swarm initiative, aiming to make sure that proposals make good use of their funds and that this is made visible to the community: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/399116).  The proposers also give a list of items to be tracked, such as number of help events, number of event participants etc, but I need to point out that we should see targets here for them to be proper Key Progress Indicators. The idea is to have estimations on what will be done for each item, so we can know what progress is made in relation to that target, if it\u2019s reached or not etc.\nRegarding how success looks like, the statement we have from the proposers is a bit vague in my opinion: \u201cSuccess is quantified by active community collaboration and participation in bi-weekly meetings followed by transparency in developed incentive mechanisms.\u201d. What do we define as \u201cactive community collaboration and participation\u201d? 5 people? 10? 20? I think it\u2019s important, once again, to set a clear target for what success means. At the moment, I feel it\u2019s a bit too interpretable. \nRegardless, while more planning could have gone towards the Auditability of this proposal, I feel that as a whole it\u2019s a good idea with a decent chance to succeed and if it does, the whole community will know about it.
