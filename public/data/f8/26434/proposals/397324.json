Connection with existing structures and frameworks is time consuming.", "f6_no_assessments": 5, "f6_rating": 4.533333333333333, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"q0": "The proposal is excellent and aligns very well with the specific objectives of the challenge. It is about evolving a tool that \u201cseeks to integrate the Human Rights Index adjusted to the UN's planetary pressures. This will facilitate the means for proposers to integrate the relevant objectives and KPIs, helping to measure and track the impact that the proposal seeks to achieve.\u201d The AIM group is already known in the Cardano community for developing essential tools for the work of CAs and vCAs (the CA tool and vCA tool), and now they are proposing the evolution of a tool to help proposers to better align their ideas and projects with human development indices. This directly relates to the challenge objectives because it addresses the topic of \u201cdeveloping common tools, frameworks, core infrastructure or proof of concepts\u201d extremely clearly. In other words, the impact here will be maximum for what we are looking for, this tool will certainly contribute to the increase in the quality of the work of the proponents who often know how to explain the technical part of their projects but get lost when it comes to a more human. In other words, as the proponents would say, it is necessary that Catalyst projects (in addition to obviously benefiting Cardano, working towards its wide adoption) can go beyond our community, helping those who really need it and working on solving problems. economic, social, environmental and other problems. After all, Cardano's principles are sustainability and favoring a fairer and better environment for all. And I believe that this is also the core of this proposal. Proposers intend to expand on something that already exists, adhering to the principles already explained here (on the human development index) and will also conduct research in order to better understand a good proposal structure, comparing with what has already been funded so far. Therefore, the impact grade will be maximum. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the proposal is very high. We know that the team is competent, as they say, as they have already been financed many times so far and delivered the projects responsibly. About the present project, we know what will be done and when, in a very detailed way. The explanation of the activities is dense, that is, the proponents undertake to attach extensive explanations full of details, so that we can understand very solidly the development process of this project. I think my only suggestion here would be for part of the temporality: the proponents claim that the activities mentioned will be developed from May to August of this year. It would be even better if we knew exactly what would happen in each of these months, with that our visualization of the process would be even more unraveled. I think it's good the way it is, just a suggestion to make it even better. Speaking now of the budget, the amount requested is high but felt with the complexity of the proposal; this is a highly qualified group that would dedicate a lot of time to this project, promoting the evolution of an existing tool and carrying out research on the area being worked on. We know how the money would be divided into small parts, and each of them is well explained, it is said how many hours of work for example would be dedicated to the frontend, backend and API update development parts. In other words, we have a very precise vision of where that money would go. Talking now about the AIM group, as I already mentioned, trust is already passed from the moment we know about their previous work. In addition, very detailed descriptions are attached about each of the professionals involved, we know their names, professional CVs (including links to tools they have already developed) and their linkedin profiles. In this way, 100% confidence in the team is passed. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability of the process can be measured, according to the bidders, by the number of users who use the tool and also who share their experiences (eg a bidder who used the technology, was financed and gave feedback to the AIM group). I think these are great ways to see in practice how the desired results are being achieved; I would also like to suggest that the proponents prepare monthly reports, containing updates on the work routine of each of the mentioned months (May, April and etc) and that this document be shared with the entire Cardano community. I imagine that the team will have regular meetings with the IOG coordinators, as is the standard, but in my view the entire Cardano community would have to be able to follow the development of the project as well. Turning now to the final results, the proponents state that the success scenario would be the sum of the previously reported KPIs as well as \u201cthe education and inspiration provided to community members using the proponent tool and those receiving funding on Catalyst and in other sources\u201d. I think that all this information, compiled, could be presented at some Town Hall meeting, it would really be an inspiring demonstration of how, with the right organization and structure, the proponents were successful in funding their projects and with that they were able to work towards the achieving your goals. In other words, I think it would be very interesting to get together some proponents and the AIM team to explain (in short, a 10-15 minute presentation would be adequate in my opinion) how the whole process of developing this proposal went and how these proponents were helped and where they are today, how they are executing their projects. Finally, I think the proposal is highly auditable, it is enough for the proponents to make all the metrics and KPIs established by them reach easy access to the Cardano community. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal seeks to expand the set of tools available on https://cardanocataly.st by adding the \"planetary pressures adjusted UN Human Development Index\" and produce research on how Project Catalyst is financing projects and their impact on UN SDGs, UN Human Rights, and UN HDI . The website is a good set of tools, but lacks some organization, I would therefore give priority to organizing the material on the page rather than expanding functionality any further. The page is actively used by Community Advisors, but as a first time user it is not straight forward to find your way around. As for the alignment to the key metrics for the metrics: I have reservations it would increase the number and quality of Cardano Open source projects or increase the number of contributors as this is an add-on to the existing Catalyst process that seeks to add information to an already initiated proposals about a standard without justifying the benefits of having that standard in the first place and why it is relevant. It would however increased the number of open source tools, but I doubt that it would do so in a clear and meaningful way as it adds information to existing proposals.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal is to analyze data from Fund9 (rather than the current Fund8), then in another location it is stated that it will be used during Fund9. There is ambiguity of what the deliverable actually is.

This seems to be an interesting and beneficial topic, but the project plan for which has not been well thought out nor articulated.\n\nThe key deliverable from the project is \"1) Collating all into an article/slideshow for public benefit ready for publication in August 2022\", but it does not detail what will be the structure of this deliverable which makes it ambiguous and open ended.

As far as today, this tool includes the Sustainable Development Goals and has been used by many proposers in current Fund 8.\nThe tool is open access and open source, which ensures that this proposal is fully aligned with the Fund 8: open source development challenge. This work will benefit to all coming proposers by facilitating their effort to reach a high quality of proposals, as it will be easier to include goal and indicators that are widely known and recognized.

Research will then start by monitoring how the tool is used and what is its impact on funded proposals. \nThere is a little misfit about the requested budget which is 8500USD in the title of the proposal and 9400USD in the budget breakdown (which is well detailed).
