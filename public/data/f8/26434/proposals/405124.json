Being a bit pedantic, the defintions on what launched, on boarded, and users of SUMMON actually entail are lacking slightly. e.g. One touch email listings vs daily users using the entire design & CRM suite.

This proposal directly addresses the challenge question: How can we ensure that the Cardano ecosystem is built on a framework which is owned by the community and equally accessible to all? They address this challenge by providing open source tools for creating Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. This proposal will add value to the cardano ecosystem by providing tools and open source code that can be used by anyone, and will be useful to Cardano holders / users who are building DAO's. The key performance indicators for audit-ability consist mostly of the number of projects onboarded to \"Summon\" and this aligns with the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer appears to have a skilled team of experienced developers who are capable of executing on this proposal. However, as provided in the proposal, they appear to be sudo-anonymous, so it is difficult to do a background check on the team, but there work is available through the @ADAOcommunity twitter account and other online sources such as github and other catalyst proposals on Ideascale. The budget appears to be reasonable and broken down in to achievable tasks, however the team has chosen a popular meme number of 69420 for their total budget, and this makes me question the professional approach of the team and how accurate or serious this budget really is. The budget items that exceed 10's of thousands of dollars only have a single sentence explaining what the funds or for, and little detail about how exactly the funds will be used. For a proposal of this budget the team should consider including more details of the actionable tasks and order of execution, and how the provided funds will be used. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The success or failure of this proposal will be transparent and visible to the community, however no timeline has been provided for when the team expects to complete this work. With no concrete timeline, the project will be difficult to audit, and it is likely the team will try to achieve more funding from catalyst in the future. The proposal could be improved by including specific dates and deadlines for when they team plans to complete the proposed deliverables. With a large budget and team, and ambitious goals, it will be difficult for the community to audit how the granted funds are used, and what the team has delivered. There is no clear description of what the compensation for each member of the team will be, and what they are expected to deliver in exchange for the granted funds. While more and better open source DOA toolkits will benefit the community, It is not clear how these tools will exceed $69,420 in value to the cardano community.

I'm ahead of myself, the idea of the proposal is to enable building tools for decentralized governance and advise them. This is just the proposals we need to have to push in the right direction when it comes to decentralized govenrance, which is a really easy to talk about topic, but really difficult to contribute and pushing development from. The fact it's open source unlike many other solutions and proposals I've seen makes me really happy ADAO has assembled behind.\nThis proposal perfectly aligns with the ideals of the open source development ecosystem challenge, whcih is basically about propoting open source development, because that's the necessary toling we need to have. The open source will long term always be better, because the experience of many people will always outweigh the results few can provide. The project will add immense value to the cardano ecosystem and will enable a more easy and legalized creation of a decentralized units, but legal ones. As a developer I can sit down and have a simple dao running, if you're only looking for the regular functionalities, but having it integrated and registered is something that is beyond my capabilities and skillset. You need a lawyer for that, and this project has it, as well as other team members I haven't even thought about might be necessary, so good on them on really digging into the problem and pushing for a real and most of all practical solution.\nThe key metrics of the project accurately deal with measuring the growth and adoption of this idea and it's future followers and users. As it stands now, I don't see any element missing from this proposal and I'm really glad there's a serious progress in the right direction. Overall I don't have any doubt this proposal will be really impactfull over the cardano, but not only community. Good job, keep doing what you're doing!\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Team members are all listed, along with their skill sets. Some of them I managed to verify by the name, some of them by their work by their nickname, but all of them are legit and will be able to deliver what this proposal has promissed. Given the sensitive topic I understand the reasoning of not all members of the teams going with their real names and letting their work speak for them as they've already done by the looks of it in the github repository. I had a decent look in the github repo of the ADAO and I was really impressed. I'm really a 100% sure as a developer that these people mean business, and maybe I can contribute to some of their open source solutions I found rather interesing.\nThe budget could use a little more work to be honest, because the breakdown is not ideal and when you're publicly asking for any money, I expect you have a good reason and a decent explanation on where the money are going. Specifically the new project on-boarding budget item could use a little more work alongside the public relation and marketing. I'd suggest to not be affrait of telling the voters exactly what reserach did you do to get up to the specific number in both instances. The other two items of the budget brakedown are prety straightforward and I was able to verify the mentioned costs are correct.\nThere's a sensible plan for implementation and a team to follow through with the implementation. Technical aspects are not explained, but that's the beauty of the open source development, you can just go and have a look yourself. The documentation of most projects is good which means it's not impossible to on-board yourself if necessary.\nThe project is definitely in sync with what's already out there, but the problem is: what's out there is not public right now or it's not good enough to use for any general purpose. An excellent and most definitely feasible proposal!\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Dogfooding is a really good way of checking if your project has all the right information and functionalities for it to work properly. Anyone interested in the proposal would have no issue opening up the public github repository and looking through the progress and follow the evolution of this project so I really like how auditable it is. A roadmap with milestones is set in place, although they're a bit generic and I was hoping for a bit more of a breakdown as I did with the budget.\nMetrics are really good and I do believe, based on me experience, that these will be integral in measuring the project adoption, because it's always a game of numbers when it comes to adoption and it's important to have measurements in order to optimize further. The definition of success is really on point as well. There's a clearly defined problem to be solved and a practical and solid solution to it. \nOverall, no problem with auditability, even though some parts could use a little polish.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal does a credible job in effectively addressing the challenge in multiple ways. First, the proposers have developed tools and core infrastructure that is opens sourced and that can be leveraged by developers that are being onboarded to the Cardano ecosystem.

But the most important indication that the team will be successful is that they are already delivering open source solutions to Cardano, and working with some of my favorite projects in doing so, such as Liqwid Labs and Mlabs. The chances for us, the community, to benefit from funding this project seems really high. I wold imagine the proposers would attract and incubate the most promising projects with the community in mind first.

The deficiency existent when it comes to creating DAOs has been mentioned by many members of the whole community and it is nice to see a team investing in this idea. The fact that there was a partnership with team members from projects that have been successful makes me thing that this proposal could have the same amount of impact such as the Liqwid Labs and the Cardano Sounds. The problem statement is with a bit of effort among the challenge setting. I would like to see a bit more about the \"open source\" part of this project as the challenge itself defines. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Congratulations to the team for preparing a well-written description of the skills and experience of the members. However, apart from the description of their skills and experience, i would find relevant and useful some Linkedin profiles, if not their github accounts. It is very interesting to see such as wide variety of team members and different fields that they are specialized in. The budget is outlined clearly and has been broken down into identifiable manners. I would reconsider the whole amount of dollars needed for this project without being a specialist to evaluate whether it is appropriate or not. The only thing i can point out is that is a quite big percentage of the whole challenge budget and maybe that is something the proposer need to rethink a bit for future proposals. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I think that there is no detailed plan here. There is no clear roadmap and there are no milestones to it. There is a description of what is going to happen but there is nowhere mentioned as to when, for how long, how many phases there going to be. That is undoubtedly something that should be fixed and kept in mind for future funds. The key metrics are there but the proposer need to quantify them. How many projects from within Cardano on-boarded to Summon? or how many projects from outside Cardano (cross chain) on-boarded to Summon? Also I would suggest, if possible, to use real numbers, rather than words like \"increase\" when referring to the number of contributors, e.g., in the KPI and Metrics section. \nAn element that adds auditability is the open source nature of the platform. This will allow the community to understand in detail how the project is progressing and in which direction it is heading.
