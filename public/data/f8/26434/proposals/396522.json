A repository of audited smart contracts written in Plutus would be priceless for the entire Cardano ecosystem. And rewarding programmers who create desirable code is laudable.\n\nThis proposal directly answers to the Integrations portion of this challenge and more than adequately answers the following guiding question of this challenge:\n\n*What applications deliver the highest amount of value with the least amount of technical sophistication?\n\nThe proposal identifies a problem of integration and lack of a smart contract Cardano-based repository which needs to be solved, clearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem in time and lays out in minute detail the key metrics and goals of the as aligned with the challenge objectives. And I will write again that remuneration for proficient coders who develop highly desirable smart contracts is a terrific incentive and deserves its plaudits.\n\nHowever I must point out two concerns I have: one, that though the language of the proposal is altruistic and collaborative, it may come to pass that the inherent differences in structure of the dapps that are created on the Cardano blockchain preclude the library from being as relevant as it could be. Just as dapps found and coded different solutions to the concurrency problems of the eUTxO model they encountered in Fall 2021, they may find that the library of smart contracts is not applicable to their dapp due to their chosen structure. Finally, I wanted to highlight that initially the repository being created will be self-serving in that it will contain smart contracts already created by Clear Contracts and MLabs (like CC Bot, Escrow Service, etc.) and may be a way to prevent future DAO creating dapps from forking code to develop competitors (like DAOStack, DAOHaus, Aragon, and Colony are competitors on Eth) without compensation to the original developers. Also, starting with smart contracts using tooling created by Clarity DAO just for Clarity DAO is a very smart first step, and I hope the extent of the project does not stop there.

Further, it is clear and thoughtful and details the steps needed in ascending order to create the smart contract library, with a proper 50 hours allocated to planning and research, which is in my opinion, a good idea.\n\nThe proposal is sensible and lays out the outcomes of the proposal in a clear and well defined manner.\nFinally, Clear Contracts has considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation and will hopefully be able to overcome any obstacles to a full and open collaborative library of smart contracts that is used by many different dapps.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal is clear and its timeline and milestones are well defined.

As well, Clear Contracts (the proposer) understands the problem this would solve and displays genuine understanding of the issues that may hinder collaboration in contributing to and using the library. Starting with Clarity DAO smart contracts is a great first step and hopefully it enables the proposer to anticipate problems that may occur when moving to other different types of smart contracts (not just those using Clarity DAO tooling).\n\nFinally, the only issue I may be concerned about regarding Clarity and Auditability is when the proposer expects the following KPI's to be relevant and what numbers would indicate success:\n\nKPI\u2019s: # of templates used, # of templates created, # of developers contributing, # of projects using templates.\n\nIt may be helpful to assess these at 3-month intervals and stating so would add more color to the project.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_452", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6683, "q0": "As a Senior Developer myself I know that one of the most important Software engineering principles is reusability of the code and this proposal addresses that aspect.
