This might have some negative impact on the scalability of the Cardano ecosystem. I don't think it is in the sense of decentralisation to create the same product multiple times with slight variations.

A contingency plan has been made and some basic technical details are explained. The team is not fully assembled yet and it might be difficult but not impossible to find developers hired for just a few working hours.

This leads me to believe this is a necessary effort that needs to be spent in order to continue the growth and enable other wallets to build on top of this open source effort. Considering this will be an open source project I believe it perfectly aligns with the challenge settings.The challenges mentioned by the proposers are very reasonable and the stpes to metigate the possible problems are entirely doable as well.

They seem to have a clear plan on how to deal with the upcomming challenges and possible growth of their project. The budget could use a bit breaking down. They've meantioned their hourly rate which is more than decent as well as how many hours they plan on spending, which is great. Milestones or separate tasks that will lead to the successful implementation of phase one planed out for fund 8 are missing.

As a suggestion I'd say to the proposers to have a look at other excellent proposals and how they're structured as well as what information they have so as to not leave the voters having more questions thatn answeres after they're done reading.

This means that they would not be usable at that point, unless updated to work with Manifest V3. The proposed solution is to fork the Nami wallet (as it\u2019s open source code) and use it as a basis to develop a new wallet called Lucem (it would have additional features and be Manifest V3 compatible). The proposers argue that this way, Nami wallet will remain functional and in addition to that, we would have a new wallet and a model for other SPO\u2019s to create their own wallets in a similar fashion.\nWhat I fail to understand is if the code that is to be written for Lucem to be Manifest V3 compatible will also be used for Nami, as this is not stated clearly (I understand it will be open source, but it would also have to be adapted to the Nami codebase afterwards). It\u2019s also not mentioned if the creators of the Nami wallet would not take care of this problem themselves (as it stands to reason they would). Next, I\u2019m not entirely sure I see the benefit in people being able to keep copying the Nami wallet and reskinning it. I\u2019m all for multiple options, especially in the crypto space, but when they are fundamentally identical, except they look different, it sounds like a weird idea. Perhaps I\u2019m misunderstanding something, however.\nIn any case, the proposers also argue that as a result of their work here, wallet infrastructure across the ecosystem would become more decentralized and more people would be incentivized to explore this domain, which I agree is likely to lead to innovation and be a boon to Cardano in general.\nI still have a few doubts about the impact as I mentioned above, but overall I agree this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. Score: 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "We are not provided with a timeline per se, but with a deadline for this proposal\u2019s completion in July 2022. Two-three months of work to come up with a new UI, to solve the Manifest V3 problem and get a new wallet approved in the Chrome Webstore sounds about right to me. We also have an extended roadmap for what the proposer plans to do with this project in the next funds, up till fund 11, indicating that this might become another one of the big wallets on Cardano, if the plan is followed through.\nWe don\u2019t really have a budget breakdown (except for an estimation in hours and cost - 110 hours at $35 USD / hour), but I wouldn\u2019t consider that a problem, because the requested amount is very small (3850 USD). Additionally, the plan mentioned that basically the idea is to hire a developer who has experience with web extensions to work on this. If it\u2019s purely development work, that is basically the only task to fulfill. My only concern is that 110 hours is actually around 2 weeks of work (assuming an 8 hour working day) and the deadline is set for July. Assuming the funds are released in May, the proposers would have at least 6 months to work on this, so I don't know why July is set as the deadline. Perhaps the work would be disjointed and I\u2019m nitpicking.\nThe proposers have provided information about themselves and links to their LinkedIn pages and I believe they have the necessary skills to oversee this project (one is a software engineer and the other is an SPO and has project management experience).\nTo sum up, the complexity here is not high and I think it\u2019s highly likely for this proposal to be completed successfully, if funded.

It\u2019s mentioned that progress can be tracked via Github commits, which is obviously true, but as a recommendation to the proposer, it is expected to set targets here, so that the community knows what to expect. For example, 2 commits per week after work starts, a weekly progress update on a social media platform like Twitter, etc. \nSuccess for this proposal is defined as an MVP for the Lucem Wallet being available in the Google Chrome Store in July 2022, which will be easy to track, but I feel like the proposer should have gone a bit further and estimated a target for adoption of their product. After all, what would be the use of having a new wallet (or 10), if no one uses them? I would not consider that a success in itself.\nIn conclusion, I can neither agree, nor disagree that the information provided here will be enough to audit the progress and success of this proposal.

What source confirms this?\n\nRegardless, the proposal is about fork Nami and update manifest to v3, continue development and resubmit to google chrome store. The project will be open source and will allow more people to explore the development of this wallet.\n\nThe definition of success is the delivery of the MVP and acceptance of Lucem Wallet MVP release, on google chrome store in July 2022, which indicates a relevant impact on the challenge.
