The Mining Proposal is intended to focus on actions that will automate Treasury & Governance Consortium projects like Catalyst Circle Admin. This will provide a unique context in which to build a library of action and they will investigate what open source engagement really means for community engagement and communicate this through presentations. presentations and seminars.\nThe impact of the proposal could be huge. However, the part I find hard to wrap my head around is that the success of the suggestions provided is not the first of its kind and how effectively this can fill in the gaps that these types of previously left in the system. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Overall, the proposal is detailed, clear and in many ways gives the impression of transparency and reliability. The step-by-step and topic-based explanation provides an overview that is also Quatifable and thus community verifiable in the KPIS, seems to make sense and remains consistent.

The detailed explanations are appreciable and make it possible to clearly understand the scope of the project.

The idea to incentivize the automated processes to achieve ROI to an extent is a plus. Many proposals talk about producing content for users but do not include the concepts of making them open-source or methods of communicating them to the users through training and collabs but this proposal seems to have addressed those gaps. As some friends of ours mention in the comments, the translation could be a feature that would increase the widespread reach of the project and in turn draw a variety of individuals onto the chain encouraging contributions.

The mix of members in the team is some renowned names in the community be it Stephen, the treasury guild, or catalyst school and hence there lies no suspicion on the capabilities of the team. The experience and expertise they bring are immense. The budget looks very simple and just, amounting to not even 5 figures, the community can trust that no factor has been overestimated and the team is very genuine in their work.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer gives the community assurance to assist in every way possible during the audit process for all aspects be it development or deliverables. The use of GitBook and QADAO adds more credibility to their claim and also assures producing regular reports regarding their progress, budget spending which are good enough to make the audit process trouble-free. The success metrics are etched with careful consideration and are an enhanced subset of the challenge's key metrics. The availability of both quantitative and qualitative metrics can be useful for the community to keep a check over the proposal's implementation and impact.
