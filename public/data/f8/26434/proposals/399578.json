The predicted risks for the project also have solution, but the founder can give more detailed information (ex: the information about project documentation) to improve the proposal.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The detailed timeplan and budget breakdown is written insignificantly. The proposer just give the general outline for two parts, he/she should add more information on schedule. For example, in the part 'a detailed timeline', team can list more particular section in the job 'Implementation of the BIP29 root key derivation from mnemonic phrase'.  On the same way, the part 'detailed budget breakdown' should be given additional information such as the wage per hours. The team member is introduced pretty significantly.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer mentions '5 substantial git commits' as the tool to measure the goal of projects, but they also mentions another test that have no information.

The proposer described the core features, the working principle of their product in technical detail. They also analyzed the impact of the product on the Cardano ecosystem, the impact of the project on the key KPIs that the challenge posed. I appreciate the core idea and the way they present and analyze the proposal, I see the similarity between the proposal and the key metrics of the challenge. They also mentioned that the library is working now with a few basic features and will implement the main features mentioned in the proposal in the future, it would be good if they introduce the current version of the library as a sample product for the reader's reference. Future risks and solutions are also carefully described by the proposer.

The budget analysis is too general, the team has not yet calculated and given specific numbers for the activities + equipment needed to develop the project, which will affect the auditability of the project. I would like to see a budget table with detailed information including total working hours, the number of personnel involved in this project, the role of each employee, salary paid to staff, equipment or software to support the construction of the library and the amount paid for them, and the specific total budget. In terms of personnel, they have 2 key members in the project, they also summarize their biographies and I find that these 2 people have the right knowledge, skills, and working experience for the project field they are pursuing. However, I want them to provide more evidence to verify the information about the personnel they provide (Linkedin, degree photos, information about successful projects they have done before, ...). I will give 3 stars in this part because the information in the two categories budget and personnel is too little, not of the high reference value.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In this section, the information they provide is not KPIs that the community can rely on to track the progress and development of the project, it is more like an announcement of the activities they will do.

To increase the auditability of the project, I would like the team to put more effort into calculating and building a budget breakdown table with specific numbers and a progress report for the community during the period of library construction and development.

This will have an impact over the development community bringing c++ people to the space, and let me tell you those devs are a different breed. They see opportunity in everything and the effort they're willing to put into something they find interesting is amazing. I really belive as a developer myself is that the contribution those kind of people with the right mindset and an SDK or two can do amazing things for the ecosystem.\nSpeed is another thing that goes hand in hand with c++ and performance is important especially when dealing with crypto and finances. Another important topic is a well implemented specification. For the non tech people reading, this means someone can tell you how to do a god job, but someone can always misinterpret what you say and do a bad job anyway. The c++ community is good dealing with standards and specifications.\nThe project is in alignment with the challenge settings and does follow the guidelines set. I see no problem with scaling if there's enough of a community gathered behind this proposal and given this team has several projects I see this happening really soon. \nOverall as a developer I have no concenrs about the impact of this proposal and I do believe it's important to have this proposal funded and implemented.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I came to this project from another proposal they have just as good as this one and I have already managed to check and verify their credentials and skillset mentioned in this proposal. They do checkout and will have no issues working on this library and bringing the project to it's success and constant evolution, necessary for any library.\nThe proposers have a good setup of 2 members, that work very well together from what I can see in the gitlabs they mange and contribute in. A fully open source projects have good documentation and I'd make a suggestion to the authors to start early, because I've worked on several open source projects that were very promising but other devs couldn't get in because of the lack of knowledge and learning gap, which is overcome with docs and examples usually.\nA realistic timetable to do the work is offered and very specific topics will be implemented that will be visible for anyone looking through the gitlab commits. There's a sensible plan for imaplementation spanning for about 6 months, which is reasonable considering the complexity of the task. The budget is reasonable and the work in relation to the requested budget is a bargain to say the least. \nOne thing the authors of the proposal could have done a bit better is to have a better breakdown of taks and the estimated time to do them so their plan and progress is easyer to follow. The team is in sync with what's already been done in the space, and a C++ library is a really good missing piece to the cardano dev ecosystem. \nOverall a valid proposal and a feasible one. Good luck!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The tl; dr; version is this proposal is auditable, no question. Since this is an open source project and there's a linked gitlab repository which has already stated work in it, I'd say this is all that anyone needs to track this project development progress. One thing that might be a small improvement are adoption metrics, because currently the only thing that will be measured by the provided metrics is the technical progress and not the adoption or usability of the library, which is just as important.\nI recognise there's a good description that brings a valid problem to the table and the solution is well thought out. Unit tests are good for development and it's great they're mentioned in the proposal, which is missed in many others and is a way to track the performance of the project making it more auditable.\nThe only suggestion I might have for the proposal as a whole is to bring down the teminlogy down a notch and use a more simple language to explain what you're doing.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9150, "q0": "The proposal has highlighted the opportunity from the current long in service of C++ programming and the available resource that if Cardano could expand to open-source direction.

I believe the project should provide a small portion of the information on how the current risk of open source and why Cardano used Haskell as the primary coding language from the beginning. And the team should also provide the risk of the interoperate between C++ to be a library with the current Haskell. I believe this would significantly impact your project's success and delivery as the open-source approach. \nI rate the impact as four out of five for this proposal.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "With only two sentences for the $10,000 requested proposal in the feasibility, background researcher/PhD and computer science from two of your team members, I believe you should have provided concrete details of how next six months you will spend $10,000. For instance, extract from your feasibility \"Q4 2022: Implement basic transaction (P2P ADA transaction) building and key serialization (CBOR)\". With implement basis transaction, you may need to explain what in this transaction should be contained and how your C++ library will work which Plutus/Haskell in conjunction. With that, it helps the reader to understand further your three months or six months project milestone. For that, I rate 3 out of 5 for feasibility.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Agreeable when explaining information related to coding or the library or some trading secrets, the minimal provide is the better to keep the secret for whatever purpose an intention.

The library can be integrated with another modern C++ project using CMake.\" can be better clearer for the reader, knowing the purpose of this audibility key point in plain English written.
