Plus, there is a lack of accessible crypto-knowlege within those communities\nThe risks are well addressed.

I suggest the proposer to include a LinkedIn profile to verify and a recruitment plan for the project which will also affect the budget.\nIn terms of the budget, I assume of $33400 is quite big for a video course.

To be honest I was waiting for such a proposal to pop up, because the \"youtube\" university is quickly gathering speed in the last couple of years and for good reason. The identified problem is extremely relevant for this stage of the development of the Cardano ecosystem. There needs to be more proposals like this varying in difficulty. I would love to have more advanced tutorials and topics as well, because while reading some of these proposals a lot of things came up that I simply do not understand as a developer and would be really happy to hop on the video tutorial train and learn them in the best way I know how.\nThe proposal is sure to add value to the ecosystem by training a lot of people the basics. It's non commital and you can start watching a youtube tutorial at any time. It also is in alignment with the challenge settings as it will develop the people that will develop the ecosystem in tern. There are a few reasonable challenges mentioned and I really like the honesty of the proposer. I really like the attitude: \"I'm not the best, but I can get it done good!\" Kudos for that! The proposal would add something missing in the ecosystem and that is the newer generation of developers who preffer the video format. Overall an impressive and impactful proposal. Good luck!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I really like the roadmap break up and how well it matches the definition of succes. There are clear milestones to get through and 3 months time is plenty for the topics that were mentioned in the demo video. The timetable for doing all the research, actual work and edditing seems reasonable even though to be perfectly honest I haven't done much video edditing or animations, but I hear there's tools for that. \nThe resources necessary for the success of this proposal are time and desire as well as a bit edditing skills which I believe the author has since he has created more than one edducational video and seems to have some experiecne, which is amazing. The fact he'll be doing the tutorials and edditing himself seems reasonable, since many youtubers are doing exactly that and being successful so there's a precedent.\nThe project seems to be in sync with the environment because I haven't seen another video tutorial proposal for now althrough I would be happy to see some more on different topics. Overall I think it's a credible and reasonable proposal with a good budget and a decent plan for execution. I'd call it not only feasible but probable to happen.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There's a github repo so I'm not worried abot this project being auditable.

I really like the project follows the \"all contributors\" specification which means that all contributions should be autmatically recognised which is a cool detail and shows initiative.\nA clear and understandable problem statement followed by a reasonable and resonating solution. The KPIs seem reasonable and I especially like the view count for checking the adoption of the video tutorial, but I would suggest to add view time as well, because it's more important than the view count.

As a fellow learner, and member of the Token Engineering Commons, it is easier to understand the necessity and the impact of this relatively new field of study. One of the key tools is cadCAD, a modeling platform for token engineering and written Python. Providing an understanding of its importance would take much too long and just, as the proposer, I am still learning. Haskell, currently one of the most important languages in Cardano, will also be discussed and utilized within the tutorials. The benefits are exactly as presented, new entrepreneurs and forward looking community members can benefit greatly from these  proposed instructional videos. So long as the videos are concise, presented in an high-level manner but with enough depth and of sufficient length, the aforementioned group could learn to create markets, economies, and community-governance models on the Cardano blockchain. The proposal certainly meets the challenge setting \u2014 tutorials will be licensed under Creative Commons, and all documentation and related code will be available on Github. The ideas presented here could also increase adoption, engagement and usage of Cardano, the ecosystem as well as Catalyst. Scalability, though not directly addressed, is entirely possible, and can be accomplished either by the originating proposer or any other interested party.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provides a brilliant 3 minute video presumably to convey his youtube skills; well received. The proposer states clearly, as a risk, his current level of knowledge surrounding TE and his continued pursuit of the requisite knowledge; this is both commendable and brave. Nonetheless, the proposers experience and Github repo, as provided, appear enough to complete the project, sans the continuing education  This is also one of a few concerns, however minor they may be. The proposer claims to have contact with certain industry professionals and this may possibly offset some of the hesitation surrounding feasibility. The remaining concerns relate to the budget total and the module length, or specifically the video length; one affects the other. Providing the target length of these modules or the number of videos per module are both highly recommended and listing this information in the module description would have likely led to a higher feasibility rating. Structuring the modules in a way that is reusable is brilliant and efficient. Preparing material, editing, code creation, module production and translation (at least two additional languages) will take a large team to be accomplished in 3 months. This timeline is possible but still a large relatively large undertaking requiring coordination and management.

Just as easy to track will be the video uploads to Youtube. Although not listed by the proposer in this section, there will be mini-websites for each module. This can also be used as another progress metric. Much of the information here is listed elsewhere within the proposal such as the 3 month timeline. Overall, the project is well-defined with slight concerns and addresses the challenge setting without issue. Audit-ability is genuinely easy, as previously stated, by utilizing the provided links.
