This is a very worthwhile endeavor as the Haskell language is foreign to many developers on which the smart contract language - Plutus - is created.

This would increase increase the number of develops willing to build on Cardano and increase the number of other open source tools (and proprietary Dapps).", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The amount of detail on how this would be done is lacking to a great extent. There is no mention of what types of smart contracts would be developed (auctions, AMM, locking / unlocking tokens ...) therefore it is impossible to judge the level of credibility to whether it will be achieved or not. The project splits the delivery in 4 sprints where thee first sprint will be for \"choosing developers with high documentation skills\" and the 2 sprints will be for \"vetting existing repos and auditing the code, documenting\". This lacks in substance of how this will deliver the library of smart contracts.\n\nThere is no breakdown of the budget either of how it will be spent. The linkedin profile of the CTO mentions that he is a Blockchain engineer, but lacks substance of the projects delivered at each of the companies, no mentioned of Haskell or other functional programming experience. Similarly the CEO has blockchain experience from the linkedin profile, but no mention of functional programming. This gives me little comfort that there is a plan in what and how to deliver on the project.

A much better statement would have been to list what categories of smart contracts would be delivered and a test if each one performs according to some pre-agreed criteria.

This one is not particularly specific and asks for a relatively large amount of money in funding. That being said, there is nothing wrong with the idea as it is a good one, and more resources for smart contract templates and actual examples would be very useful for experienced and new Cardano developers alike. In that sense, there is alignment between the proposal's objective and the challenge setting.\nThe possible directions in the Challenge setting mentions common repositories and overviews of existing solutions, so a library of smart contracts does fit nicely with the requirement. \nWhat I am missing from the proposal are details about how this library would be different from others, how the difficulty of making templates useful for specific, complex business problems would be overcome, or what kind of effort would be made by the proposers to not just create a repository but keep it alive and engaged with the community, for example by setting up a Discord community, or incentivizing contributors in the future like some other similar proposals.\nTherefore, impact appears to be neither very high, nor very low, and I think effectiveness in addressing the challenge is average.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team is stretching itself relatively thin, by proposing in a lot of categories and with essentially one key blockchain developer who is also a full-time employee in another company and a freelancer and crypto trader.

As a developer I'm struggling to understand a9s to the \"increasing boilerplate\" as usually it goes another way around and devs try to reduce the boilerplate code. As a developer, I see a couple of different problems with the approach of trying to unify differnt code in one place. The questions that come to my mind is, how will you insentivise all the original developers of the smart contracts move them to your repository? I originally thought you just want to create a repository with links, but then I saw you want to audit the contract and improve them I figured you actually want to contracts to reside in your repository. Even if that happens and you do the audit and improve the contracts and document them, the original smart contracts will continue improving them, while you would not be able to do that, because you'd have too many contracts to maintain which seems unreasonable.\nI think it's a good idea, but the actual practical execution maybe needs a bit more thought put into it. As it stands now, I don't expect a big impact from this proposal, because if you just do a single repository listing all the other you'de bring much more value. The metrics of forked repositories is good, but I don't see an insentive for developers to fork your repository with a snapshot of a smart contract with outdated code rather than the original code continiously developed.\nOverall the impact from this proposal would be limited, because I don't see a reason to use it. Having said that I'd still want to invite you to try again next round after thinking through your proposal and polishing it a bit more. You can look at other proposals in this challenge and take example from them: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396541 \n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Props to the proposers for linking their linked in profiles and the CTO seems to have relevant experience, but I don't see what purpose would the CEO and COO serve in this proposal. I didn't see any explanation on their roles, so for the next proposal it would be a good example to get a into the nuts and bolts of the project and describe in more detail the specific purpose of each team member as is done in most other proposals. You have a team of people already, but you need to educate the voters. It's good that you have a specific budget in mind, but you need to provide a more detailed breakdown of the requested funds. From what I've read in other proposals is standard to list all separate tasks calculated in hours and then when you list your hourly rate you can do a calculation of the sum of hours for each task multiplied by the hourly rate.\nAs a developer the timeline seems a bit unreasonable for the work you're planning to do as it stands right now. Making and audit and writing documentation for a series of different smart contracts you don't quite understand is no small feat and it requires a lot of time and effort and collaboration. This makes be think twice about the timtable of 2 sprints. I assume the sprints are 2 weeks as normal, becuase you haven't specified a time.\nI don't see an explanation on how you're planning to reach your goal, and this would bring greater understanding to your project.\nI see you've listed a possible challenge, but there's no arguments or a section on your plan or thought process of overcoming the aforementioned challenge. it's good to have a list of possible challenges, so you're prepared for what's comming but it's also necessary to have a plan of action once these challenges start poping up.\nOverall for the aforementioned reasons I couldn't say you proposal seems feasible or reasonable. I hope you polish it and come back!\n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "I couldn't find any github repository as mentioned in the proposal. I realize you could do the github repo after you get funded, but making it early makes sense to help any interested parties to follow your progress and creating an empty github repository to link in your proposal takes about 2 minutes so it's a really usefull link to have to show you're serious about the development.\nYou have some mentioned metrics and they are relevant, but I do believe you need to think about more KPIs and metrics as well as the definition of success of your project, because all of them lack good argumentation. The problem statement is a good one and it really shows a current problem in the whoe environment, but I don't see the solution as well thought out for many of the already mentioned reasons. Think about elaborating more on your ideas.\nI'd also suggest to put yourself in the shoes of the voters and critically read through your proposal to see if any questions won't pop up in your mind that you haven't answered in the proposal. \nOverall I'm not sure how auditable the proposal is, for the lack of given links and information as well as other channels for communication.\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "KonmaLabz will document and maintain a repo of all smart contracts which can later be used by developers by either forking or importing.", "experience": "Konma labz a winner in fund 7 where we actively increase developers and infrastructure to bring more developers native to Haskell & Plutus. this library is part of a bigger plan Konma has for Cardano.
