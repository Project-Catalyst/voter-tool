The proposal presented solutions already identified, such as minting new coins and putting them in a specific wallet, introducing useful functions for editing logs. solutions with references complete collection of libraries that help sub-libraries of the proposal. The proposed solution solves challenges such as efficient testing of modular applications, testing tools on other blockchains that have greatly promoted smart contract implementation, and attracted developers. In order to have a successful proposal, there are always challenges and risks that the proposal has taken without giving a specific plan, the team needs to come up with options for the community to see the potential of the project. . Good luck with the project!", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team outlined identified timelines for the proposed work to be completed, the timelines that have been broken down to match the completion schedule, such as building the Plutarch helper functions. 100 hours of engineering, 100 hours of integration with the deployment tools library, 75 hours of general testing, etc. The proposed goals are very specific, but the progress of the project has not been easily checked. Follow up from the community. The budget of the request proposal is stated, but the budget table should be divided to see if it is suitable for the amount spent for each item or period, the proposal needs to provide an additional estimate of the part. budget in case additional funding is required when the project is completed requires a detailed and public explanation. As for the team I trust the experience the proposed team has given Haskell / Plutus engineers at Liqwid Labs , MLabs Haskell engineers who have worked in the industry have an advanced understanding of Plutus and the infrastructure floor related to Plutus. However, the identity of the engineers needs to be submitted by the writer and accompanied by the reference documents, links to the personal page, I believe this is a project that will soon be supported by the community. good luck", "q1r": 3, "q2": "proposed with a summary audit of the audit that measures the progress and development of the project I find the metrics to be defined, the number of commits, the contribution, and the share of the metrics that need to be put in place. In more detail, the project success is clearly described as a result of adding tools that focus on helping developers manage the contract implementation process, increasing the number of commits, contributors. This is a new project so it has not been funded. Hope the community will pay attention so that the project can be funded soon.

The core purpose of the project is to raise funds to improve the functions of the Plutus helper library to help developers optimize time in building, testing, and simulating Cardano smart contracts. I believe that this project will have a positive influence on the development of Cardano, the project will motivate more and more new developers and professionals to participate in the construction of the Cardano infrastructure. Since this is a follow-up to a previously successful and widely used project, I have full confidence that the proposer can successfully carry out this project. In terms of presentation, many technical explanations give an overview of the product structure, core features and how it works, the functions that will be added, not a single piece of information is left out here. The proposer clearly understands the problem he/she is solving as well as the challenges that will arise when solving the problem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal set a goal of completing the project within 3 months of the grant date, although the plan does not clearly outline the main activities that will take place, we can clearly understand their work in the 3-month period through the description of additional functions in the Impact section. They have worked hard to gather a staff consisting of members with considerable work experience and a deep understanding of the project field they are pursuing, ensuring the success of the project. However, to strengthen the project's credibility and verify what they describe, the proposer should provide Linkedin profiles of members, records of previous projects (if any). Unfortunately, they have not provided us with the budget allocation for the project, this is a very serious omission, it greatly affects the quality and auditability of the project. With what they have shown excellently in the previous sections, I hope they will calculate and add enough information to this section soon.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "They have provided us with the project's GitHub link, so anyone in the Cardano community can easily follow the project's development activities. However, due to a lack of budget information, the auditability of the project could not be determined. At the same time, the outline of KPIs to measure project success still lacks specific indicators. I can suggest to them an example of what a specific KPI is like, 1 month after completing the library functions, the proposer sets a goal of 100 library uses, 70 % positive feedback about the library. Overall, I would support this suggestion if they can fix the problems I mentioned.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1724", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal is strongly in sync with the goals of this challenge setting. As a Software Architect/Developer and plutus pioneer (from iteration 2) myself I couldn't agree more that the process of onboarding of new developers on Cardano ecosystem will immensely be improved via such proposals. \n\nThis proposal aims to provide a set of helper functions and data structures in an open source library so that many future developers can just reuse this library instead of reinventing the wheel themselves. In the Software Engineering space, this is a very common practice, and I can not assert it enough that whenever we in our development are faced with some complex business logic we definitely do not want to spend time writing a lot of boilerplate code. First instinct of any experienced developer is to go out and search for solutions that are already out there, resolved by some engineers and made open source so that we could focus on the domain logic of the code rather than spending hours writing  extra code. \n\nI can definitely imagine that the Liqwid team, being one of the first teams who started building on Cardano and already been funded several times in previous funds, see the need for this library more than anyone else. They face these issues and they see that developers/teams who are onboarding will always need these functionalities.\n\nAs they mention that this library plutus-extra is already in use by some of the ecosystem's largest projects. Therefore, I strongly agree that this proposal identifies a significant improvement area in Cardano development space and will significantly lessen the time and efforts for future engineers building on Cardano.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I strongly agree that this proposal is highly feasible to be implemented successfully. The Liqwid labs team that is behind this proposal has expert experience in building on Cardano and have already done a great job by providing a lot of open source tools and libraries which have immensely helped other projects in the ecosystem.\n\nThe budget requirements of $75k given are explained and split well in total hours needed per feature set. The total engineering hours given are ordered in the way these functionalities will be implemented. Based on more than a decade of my experience as a developer I strongly believe this budget is justified. \n\nSince the team has good experience in developing on Plutus, a 3 months timeline is realistic. Given the fact that they will have it pushed as high priority tasks, it is clear from the details in the proposal that teams that are using this library would want this feature as soon as possible. The 6 months timeline is then given to allow changes/updates to the library based on the feedback/requested features from Plutus developer ecosystem.\n\nThe team has also provided the Github repository link to the library, and can be seen that it has 28 forks on github, and it is provided under Apache 2.0 license (already open sourced) so the team already has done a lot of work on the library.\n\nThe proposal clearly explains the functionalities, data structures, and extensions that would become part of this library. Moreover, with respect to risks, proposer has tried to address that the biggest challenge is to dedicate full time resources to help evolve this library into a comprehensive helper library. This will ease the development process for future developers/engineers building on Cardano. \n\nI can therefore see the need  for funding they need through this proposal so that they can spend full time efforts in building and standardizing this library. In conclusion, being a developer myself I strongly agree that the proposed features will be delivered in the provided timeline. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal explains how they track the progress and development of the project currently. Since the library is already there on Github it is easy to see how many clones/forks and issues are being raised on Github. This information is public, and the community could use the same metric to realize the progress of this project. \n\nThe success metric is provided with a 3 and 6 months time frame. Both timelines are easy to track via Github. For example: 30-50% growth in the number of commits and stars/forks/contributors is a good measurement to measure success of such a technical project. \n\nTechnical projects are often difficult to understand by a non-technical user base, but thanks to Github statistics, it is easier for the community to track the progress via these means. Therefore, I strongly agree that this proposal is highly auditable.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_454", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "PAB is the core for the development of SC and is actively being developed by IOG. However, there is a large scope of additional improvements and it is also better if it comes from other sources. In this respect the proposal is addressing an important accept. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Liquid labs and MLabs are being considered as the pioneers in Cardano application development. They are also the Plutuspartners of IOG which would have carried out the due diligence. therefore it is felt that the proposers will be able to complete the project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Plutus is a new language that has to operate in a large constrained space and is written in Haskell which itself has a huge learning curve. The proposal is listing approximately 1000 hours of development in the core Plutus library. The rate seems to be very reasonable and since the development is in opensource it can be monitored by the complete community in a transparent manner.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_46", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "To put it simply the proposers want to create a plutus library that would contain a lot of primitives and an improved testing and development experience for all using the library. For the non tech oriented people, primitives are building blocks of programming, basically like briks everyone uses to make any structure. This is why the proposers mention a couple of times that a lot of big projects are already using their library and that's a good thig. That automatically means, they already have an impact with the community and the development ecosystem. Kudos for that achievement. The implicit way this proposal will add value to the ecosystem is by saving developers precious time in the learning curve so they can deliver more in less time which is exactly what we need at this stage in Dapp development.\nThe key metrics checking sub libraries is a good enough metric to start with IMHO as a developer. The number of commits in github is a bit of a low hanging fruit and I was hoping for something more concrete to realize the progress of the adoption, but it's not in any way a bad indicator.\nThere's thought behind the upcomming challenges for this project, and the manpower is really hard to find, especially for plutus and haskel developer, because they're just starting to learn acording to my experience.\nOverall the impact would and already is happening and good luck to the proposers!\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "No questions here, theres enogh verifiable information put on display, so I was able to verify the mentioned people working on this and they do have the necessary skills to bring this project to fruition, even some might argue that it already is quite progressed as it is now. One or two linkedin links never hurt nobody, so my suggestion if the proposers don't mind sharing their linkedin profiles, so I don't have to search 20 minutes in google to find them to verify these are real people with real skills as I've done.\nThe budget is outlined clearly and is reasonable considering the work that will be put into this library and how many people will be included in the project. I\u2019m a big fan of doing the breakdown per hours and listing horurs necessary for a task as they\u2019ve done. They have and idea of the types of people they need to continue uninterrupted development of the project. There isn't much of a roadmap, more like a couple of bulet points and 3 month progress updates, which could be improved, but from what I saw the project is feasible and offers a realistic timetable to finish.\nThe detailed description technical aspects are something that left me pleasantly surprised, because not too much projects go into that sort of detail when it somes to showing their plans for building libraries, except for the c++ people in this challenge, who are even more verbose.\nOverall a good proposal and it seems feasible to me as a developer. There are some comments and excitement that speaks to me about a future community, which is always good.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Not much to say here, because there is a github repository and anyone interested can visit it and follow along the progress of the library implementation. It's a clearly defined problem and a solution description to match. To audit this proposal would be no problem because it's all public and open source and as far as I understand there's already a mechanism in place in the form of progress report meetings.
