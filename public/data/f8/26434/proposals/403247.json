There is mentioned also the business partner a world-class innovation platform company \"HYPE Innovation''.\nIn order to evolve this Catalyst Collaboration Platform to maximize its utility the proposer also plan to propose other realization step in Catalyst Fund9, Fund10, and Fund11.\nThe budget requested is well described and match with the initiatives and deliverables of the plan.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability here is good, because the author of the proposal outlines some KPIs that serve to monitor the direct results of the platform: number of GitBook metrics and other adoption statistics.\nThe success of this initiative, in my opinion, higly depends on community adoption and there is a need of strong communication and community engagement.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_114", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 1, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 980, "q0": "Building a continuous open-souce collaboration platform not only satisfies the challenge calling, but also directly affects the Cardano ecosystem by encouraging \u201cfully incubated\u201d proposals rather than multiple incomplete ones.  I can see this initiative eliminating some of the multiple proposal problem and giving the community higher quality and more well-focused proposals to vote on during future funds, which would cut down on voter fatigue.  Included list of objectives clarifies what this looks like.\nThere is some dispute that this can be truly open souce as the team is utilizing non-open source platforms to bring this proposal to life.  This calls into question whether this belongs in the Open Source Development Ecosystem challenge.  In the comments, a team member explains that the team will develop a new open source project on top of the \u201ccore\u201d provided by those platforms, but there is no open source license provided as of yet.  Hence, 4 out of 5.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Clear list of deliverables with measurable delivery times.  Team has relevant skills, a range of ages and decades of experience in related areas.  Stated they are searching for one more team member and are being mindful of the geographic location of that individual to make sure there is team representation worldwide.  Team also has realistic plans to involve voices from within (and outside of) the Cardano Community.  This indicates that the open-source platform will truly be available to innovators worldwide.\nThe team reports that they are on-track for 2nd quarter of 2022, independent of Catalyst funding.  If they are on track without being awarded funding in Fund 7, this seems a good indicator that they are driven toward stated goals/objectives.  Budget briefly breaks things down, but I'd like to see more depth to the budget for the amount asked.  Budget is important, so I'm rating a 4 out of 5.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal presents a well outlined, easy to organize evaluation of objectives.

Therefore, I agree, that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. The proposed solution section is extremely detailed and clearly explains the objects, products and their features. Their proposal is \u201cCapture Community Intention \u2013 Collaborate on Producing Community Actions\u201d. Thereby, they determine what role the community plays for each proposal. The author described the collaboration with Hype Innovation to create Hype Innovation Platform. Secondly, the part of challenges and risks is briefly mentioned by the writer. However, from my point of view, the way proposal written could be improved if the author should do a little more analysis so that the community could better monitor and research the project . And if possible, a little summary of the problem solving would also make this section more attractive. For the description of the proposed solution to solve the difficulties, the author only says \u201caddressing the challenge KPIs will follow\u201d. I think it is too short and vague for readers or investors to understand. The proposal should be added some information such as how to increase the number and the quality of Cardano Open Source projects or the number of contributors or open source tools and frameworks from the community for the community.  Finally, an overall well written proposal with possibilities to improve on few points like i mentioned above, hence 3 ratings from my side.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The author provides a linked profile as well as all the necessary experience to cover this implementation and more. Although there is no fixed number of team members, there is room for growth and expansion. Specific people and skills they must have in order to participate in this project are listed as well. This gives the project credibility to invest. The requested budget is 57000 USD and would have been nice to have a breakdown of the actuall costs that are planned in the roadmap. I would reccommend to the proposers of this project to really think about a budget breakdown table. Also, complementing a few more ideas based on the following questions: For example, How should each phase with different tasks be allocated? How is the salary payment for employees? Time-based pay (Hours/ Weekly/ Monthly) or according to the work they do? And is it covered for necessary assets and incidental expenses? Is there a back-up budget? This section can be clearly stated so that the project can be better informed to the community, investors and developers, which is necessary for this implementation and more. Moreover, there is a realistic sensible schedule and milestones to accomplish the work so that everyone and the community can monitor and adjust the plan in a timely manner. The plan was started in February 2022 and is expected to succeed in the next 12 months. I think it's quite reasonable for the project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As I known, usually projects need to find a way to let the community and interested investors a communication channel, and I appreciate the author when mentioning this in the proposal (Open Source Gitbook form). This makes me to believe that communicating the progress of the proposal would be easier and faster, which would beneficial for us to assess auditability. There are no metrics and KPIs, which is a bit disappointed to me. Even though, there is a well-thought-out statement of the targeted problem of verifying a person's job experience, as well as a well-thought-out discussion of the solution. I'm looking forward to seeing their platform and a strategy for delivering it. The project would greatly benefit the cardano community if done with the right level of community inclusion.

This proposal does an excellent job of articulating how resolving this problem would help Cardano's future governance. The early stages in Collaboration are critical, but Catalyst fails to collect the community's goals and talents for developing Catalyst Proposals. The issue that this proposal seeks to solve is critical, and I strongly endorse it. It outlines several parts of the problems and their remedies. As a result, I am convinced that our idea successfully addresses the issue. The solution method has a high potential for positive effect since, as they seek enticing new members for the community and helping them in creating new proposals in the next fund cycle, the KPIs completely match the challenge's suggested KPIs. One of the most notable aims described in this proposal is the use of Cardano and the collaboration with HYPE Innovation to build the platform. In conclusion, I fully agree with the proposers on the problem they have recognized, as well as the remedies and plans they have proposed, with the hope that they will be able to perform an excellent job if they are supported. I give them a 5 out of 5", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has all of the necessary skills to do this job and has supplied a full bio and Linkedin accounts for verification, which suggests two things. 1. The proposers are willing to put their names behind their project. 2. This allows for the verification of the talents specified in the proposal. 3. (Bonus) increases the project's credibility. The concept is clearly divided into practical components, each with what appear to be reasonable deadlines for completion. The budget is also written down in such a way that it indicates how the money will be spent and seems fair and practical in order to achieve the specified goals. One source of concern is that the requested funding only covers the first 12 weeks of a 12-month timeframe. This initiative will require continued funding to continue beyond the first year. This is addressed in the risk analysis section by noting that future financing will be obtained by a team member. Based on the team's member credentials and expertise, this appears to be a very likely success, and it was also listed as an objective inside the proposal milestones. Overall, the plan is precise, reasonable, and clearly defines how it will be carried out, thus I am certain that this idea will be completed effectively", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The plan provided here is fairly detailed. There is a Gitbook page and a Discord server set up, which is beneficial; they can collect input straight from the community if necessary, but it is not required. I appreciate the set of KPIs stated in the proposal language. The KPIs suggested are appropriate and not overly modest. Because they are so important to the project's success, they provide credibility to the work being done. The roadmap and milestones are also included and will be visible to the community that wants to participate. They also correspond to the time frame for acquiring, processing, and applying information. I see a clear definition of a problem and a technical and deep understanding of the proposed solution.
