This is overall a great idea and it will definately benefit the community. As a developer myself I believe it's a good idea to introduce the javascript ecosystem through plugins and other intermediate languages to the cardano ecosystem, because in this way, things won't look that scary for dealing with something entirely new. This proposal is definitely in the correct challenge setting and it could be used as a stepping stone by future developers to bootstrap them into an easy start at least. The one thing I'm not entirely sure about in this proposal is it's scalability. I see there's one guy at the moment planning to start doing all the work. While this is commendible it often leads to inability to cope with the incomming challenges due to lack of time and/or knowledge. In the case of Haskel the author admits he's a beginer in the language, and wouldn't be able to contribute too much there. The proposal deffinitely adds a missing part to the ecosystem and it's really the right way to go to start spreading to different ecosystems like the javascript one which is quite big. A lot of js developers would be happy to try out anything new as long as they can run a couple of known commands like npm install insert_project_name. This leads me to really trust in the impact this project would have. Automatic tooling and bootstraping and making everything easy to use is surely the way to go.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The author of the proposer who plans to be the main contributer as well seems to have all the necessary knowledge to start off with this idea, but he'll need to find a haskel team mate and there's are hard to come by, based on my experience. Other than that I think the proposal is credible and has a good chance to be implemented and for the project to reach the end goal it has set for itself. It's commendable that the project author is so realistic about the things he can and can not do, which is proven by his words searching for help. He's got the number and general work that needs to be done, narrowed down to a general roadmap. The milestones seem understandable and reasonable if a little vague.\nThe timetable is a part of this proposal thatt doesn't inspire confidence, for the lack of detail. A month here, a month there seems like paiting with a broad brush. The budget seems quite reasonable for all that planned work and compared to other proposals in this challenge which are 80$ an hour, it's 37.5$ an hour are really good bargain and the value compared to price is a really good offer to be had.\nI really wished there was a better roadmap that explains the concrete steps and stages of business and development, because that explanation could have brought greater understanding and credability to the project. Other than that small caveat, I really think this project is a good idea for all the reasons I've mentioned. Good luck to the proposer and I hope you get funded!\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is no mention of a telegram or discord or any other formal way of communication and a way for the author to inform anyone of the progress of his proposal if it get's funded. This is a bit of an oversight as is the lack of a github repository link (even if it's empty) to the place people could turn to, checking the development progress. These are really low hanging fruits when it comes to building a community and trust between future followers and possible contributors and it seems like a missed opportinity.\nThere are metrics, but ony mentioned and there's no actual numbers to strive for. Number of commits and contributors is absolutely a good metric to have pointing to success, but if you just have one commit I wouldn't call that reaching the goal for tis project, but the lack of actual estimations and numbers leaves me and probably the voters wandering what is the specific end goal in numbers?\nThe problem and solution statements are clear and understandable and they really tackle a real problem in a way that would positively impact the community. I'd suggest to the proposer to put himself in the shoes of the voter and wander about what be expected information that's currently missing from this proposal and ask the hard questions! \nOverall I'm not sure if the regular voter would be able to easily follow along with the projects' progress because there's a lack of channels for communication.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 4040, "q0": "Through this proposal, I can easily recognise how potential this project is. Identifying the difficulties between using Vite and PureScript in the JavaScript ecosystem and developing a tool, which helps to remove the barrier to create dapps but still ensure the quality of them, is quite a great move. Since developers do not have to struggle in building apps, more contributors will join in the Cardano Haskell projects and enlarge the ecosystem. This also can give out great opportunities for people who want to build plugins for their websites.

PureScript is a language which is similar to Haskell, but that is more accessible to JavaScript developers (it\u2019s a known fact that Haskell is quite difficult and underused and as such, is an entry barrier for newcomers). Even though I have over 7 years of experience in IT, my main expertise is not programming, so take my assessment with a grain of salt, but it seems to me like this person has a very good idea. This plugin that the proposer intends to create is called Vite (https://vitejs.dev) and it will help JavaScript developers transition into PureScript more comfortably (as right now there are no tools to help with this).\nThe impact on the ecosystem would, in my opinion, be considerable. Most of the world\u2019s developers use JavaScript (\u201cAccording to Stack Overflow's 2020 Developer Survey, JavaScript currently stands as the most commonly-used language in the world (69.7%)\u201d). Paving the way for such a large community to start coding on Cardano would have inestimable benefits in the following years.\nAs a risk, the proposer identifies the fact that they may need to write a PureScript library as well to deal with Cardano server-side code, but they seem capable of doing this, so I think it\u2019s fine.\nAs someone with basic JavaScript knowledge, I\u2019m quite excited by this idea and I definitely agree this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. Score: 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "We are provided with a very simple timeline, which estimates that the work on the Vite plugin will be done in 3 months and documentation and the above-mentioned PureScript library would take another 3 months on top of that. I think a bit more work could have been done to break down what\u2019s needed to write the plugin and the library, but it\u2019s really a problem, just would have helped people visualize the process better.\nFor the budget breakdown, we are provided with an estimation of 800 work hours needed on the JavaScript / PureScript side, for 30000 USD total and another 400 hours for Plutus/Haskell work for 15000 USD. This boils down to an hourly rate of 37.5 USD, which is quite modest for a developer. I cannot make a pronouncement on the time estimates as I do not exactly understand the work which must be completed here, but the proposer seems trustworthy to me and Catalyst Funding is only released on a month to month basis, if the proposer delivers, so I think it\u2019s fine.\nThe team will be composed of the proposer, Walker Gusm\u00e3o, who has provided their Github (https://github.com/klarkc), where I can see a lot of activity and a Plutus/Haskell developer, which is yet to be hired. I could not find a LinkedIn page for Gusmao, but I\u2019m willing to trust him based on the Github activity. However, as a recommendation for future proposals: always try to provide a link to a social platform, where people can find some information about you, where they can follow or contact you easily.\nI think that if the proposer manages to find their Haskell developer, this proposal is highly likely to be completed successfully. Score: 5.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For Auditability, in the section for measures of progress, the proposer has provided a few metrics, such as number of plugin and library downloads and number of template downloads, but I would point out to them that these are not a measure of the progress being done here, but rather of the success of the proposal. As measures of progress, the ones you mentioned below qualify (ratio of issues closed to issues opened, number of commits, number of contributors), but only partially. We would have needed these metrics to also have some targets set (for example, you could have set a target for # commits per week, or made a pledge to provide regular updates on some channel of your choosing every # weeks).\nIn regards to what success looks like, the proposer has simply mentioned the completion of the Plugin, the library and a Vite template (which are all valid), but in order to help the community, you could have been a bit more specific here and offered for example a demo of how the plugin works, so that the community can see it in action and see that you\u2019ve succeeded.\nAll this being said, I think this is a very good initiative and I\u2019m willing to cut the proposer some slack, because I\u2019ve worked with developers for years and I know their strong suit isn\u2019t selling themselves. As long as they will be reachable via some public channel, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to audit the progress and success of this proposal.
