There's no shortage of proposals offering marketing services to Cardano projects, so the bigger question is what kinds of sustainable models and infrastructure can the proposers set up to handle the sprawl. Scalability, I believe, is key here. To that end, there are some promising ideas here, like the creation of standardized pitch videos and marketing content libraries. I have some concerns about how much impact the proposal can ultimately have on the ecosystem, however, given that there are only so many proposals the team can directly help.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The core team looks to have the experience necessary to create the materials the proposal hopes to deliver. As the project designates a 4th team member who will be paid $4,000, it might be helpful to disclose who this person will be and their experience. Or if it's a floating position, what types of skill sets will fill it? Will it be a contractor position? Clarity here will be helpful. \n\nThis is the first phase of a project that's planned to continue in Fund 9 and looks to lay the groundwork for future iterations. With that in mind, this proposal appears to be in scope for the three months detailed in its timeline. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Since the creation of the marketing content library factors so heavily into the proposal's timeline, I'm a little surprised that it doesn't factor more heavily into this section of the proposal. While it will certainly look good to have 5 high profile projects receiving direct services from the proposers, I would suggest that it may be more important to demonstrate that Catalyst Swarm has built a solid foundation and toolset that adds value (or can potentially add value) to the Cardano ecosystem as a whole, not just to a few heavy hitters who, let's face it, probably won't have that much trouble with visibility to begin with.

The team will bring value to the proposer that needs help in terms of marketing and increasing visibility. The proposal states the potential risk of the team wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the request from all proposers, however, once the funding is secured they can add a new member to the Catalyst Swarm Marketing & Media Labs. I think the ideas are great but I have a concern they are still doing marketing manually and will always need an additional member to accommodate growing request from the community, thus making the project unscalable.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal has a clear milestone with a roadmap composed of each month from May 2022 to July 2022.

Also, there will be a Swarm GitHub repository so the community can easily track the progress of the project. The indicators for success are also defined, however, some points can be elaborate more in a measurable manner, for example, how many short clip videos are gonna created for the high-profile project? What constitutes high-profile projects? How many social media interactions (likes, retweets, etc) are to be considered successfully increase the visibility of the Catalyst project?", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1342", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3156, "q0": "The proposal helps to marketing ideas on Catalyst to social media using their professional marketing and management skills. As proposer said, community members normally focus on the technical/execution part, but not focus on marketing part, which is equally important as the the execution part. I believe this proposal will add crucial value to spread out Cardano ecosystem. Hence this addresses the issue effectively. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team includes 2 experts in sales and marketing,so are capable of implementing the proposal successfully. \n- For the road-map, milestones and budget, more details should be better to be mentioned. For example, How many videos/short clips will be created in each month? How the budgets are split over months? \n- I personally encourage them to extend their videos not only on YouTube, Twitter, but also Facebook, Tiktok, and other possible media. Because some countries may prefer using Facebook over Twitter, for example.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "it will be possible to audit the proposal based on number of projects receiving direct their services, as well as the number of created content from M&MLabs. \nI also recommend another KPIs which measures the success of their marketing. For example, if their videos are marketed over YouTube, so how many views/comments you will get from these videos?

Most of the proposals lack the professional rigor with which the proposal should be put up.

It's a great idea and it could impact the community in quite the positive way. I'm really interested in this idea because I've seen a lot of amazing proposals through the last three funds, but I feel like they didn't get the proper attention even though some of them got funded. Making people aware is a really integral part of each new project, because you can have the greatest idea and plan for execution, but you need people that care support you as well. In this regard the M&MLabs could be a great boost.\nThe authos really know thay're bringing a positive change towards the better recognition of great ideas. I like the forward looking management and popularization ideas like having an alternative for youtube shorts, but used for marketing and promoting particular projects as well as project catalyst as a whole.\nThe project is aligned with the challenge setting, becuase it would give back to the community and would improve the overall popularization of any project they work with. One of the greatest challenges they could face is reaching a wider audiance because this is ever the battle for views in the 21st century, but I trust the youtube shorts idea is the way to go there.\nI don't see anything missing from the proposal and the idea looks very impactfull so I'd be happy to support it and would deffinitely follow along with it's progress if it gets funded. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Some of the proposers are known names among the community and are very active members of it. They've provided the necessary links to prove their credentials and skillset described and I was able to verify the ones I didn't know and their individual skillset. All the team members are proffecionals in their own fields and bring credibility to the project they're working on. There's a good starting team of people, but as the proposers have noticed, there would be a need for rappid expansion if the project takes off and more and more projects need media representation and support.\nI feel like this project is really good for not relying indefinitely on project catalyst funding and is thinking of being self sufficient by implementing a fee for their servises as I believe is important for each new project to eventually do to be a stable and worthwhile enterprise.\nThere's a realistic timetable to record the first pitch videos and they will be for me the make it or break it part of the whole project, because with marketing you need to have a good first impact. Ofcourse the other main strength is reaching the wider audiance so the choice of a popular platform like youtube that provides you with a revenenew stream while it gives you an opportunity to connect and broadcast your message is an excellent one.\nAll resources necessary to implement the solution like a github repository, the catalyst swarm gitbook and funding are listed and usefull for the end goal. The budget breakdown is simple but well explained as well as in between the recommended budget constraints provided by project catalyst. Salaries as well as project licenses for marketing tools are included.\nOverall I like the proposal and I definitely think it's feasible. Good luck to the proposers!\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There's a github repo and a catalyst swarm site where all interested parties can follow the project updates and the overall progress. The metrics spanning between created marketing content and requests for marketing from catalyst project teams seem reasonable for me, although I'm a developer and I wouldn't presume to know much about how marketing works and what interation would be necessary to reach the end goal. I'm a logical person, and the steps provided seem logical, that's all.\nThere's a clear problem described and it's a problem I've fealt myself followed by a probably and simple solution. \nOverall I think the proposal is auditable withouth a doubt and anyone interested can follow along in one of the many communication channels.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Establishing a Catalyst Swarm Media & Marketing lab to provide professional marketing & media services to projects\u00a0within Catalyst.", "experience": "Marketing and media professionals; serial funded proposers; Start-up founders & consultants; founders & initiators of several projects within Catalyst"}
