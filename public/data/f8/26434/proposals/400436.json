The proposal has interesting ideas but lacks much detailed information that is very important for the project. For example, the proposal does not provide tokenomics or scheme of the learn to earn model, the proposal also does not give information of curriculum they will use or the format of the content they will use. The proposal also does not provide details of the platform they will use for the students. The proposal has provided potential risks of scaling, that is the cost of paying students to learn will increase as more students participated in the learning. However, the team gives some options to overcome those challenges.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal has milestones and a roadmap with a time horizon divided between short, mid, and long term. However, some points on short and midterms need to elaborate further. For example, in the short term, how much content is created, and in what format are they? How many developers are targeted to be on board on midterms? also, the timespan for the mid-term and long term is too long, the midterm alone is composed of 3-12 months. The team provides concise information on how they will use the proposed budget, but many items are not detailed enough. For example, the proposal stated they will use 8K$ for instructor staff, how many staff the team will hire? How long they will work (in relation to salary/hour)? The creation of educational content, the incentive for adoption, and other items also need to break down in detail. The proposal gives concise information of background, and experience for each team member. Most of them also have a LinkedIn profile so the community can easily verify they are giving funds to a legitimate person.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Metrics that are used for tracking progress are clearly defined and measurable as the number of students enrolled, recruiting at least two academic advisors, etc. The indicators of success are defined as the number of students educated through the platform, however, those metrics can be elaborate more with an exact number, for example, more than 200 students completed the courses.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1342", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal is very well structured and written including a brief and concise explanation of the project\u2019s potential impact. The team argues that there are difficulties in accessing education on how to build projects on Cardano in LatAm since few open-source d-edTech Platforms in Spanish. They plan to address this challenge by creating codes for educational platforms in Spanish taking advantage of the \u201clearn to earn\u201d module. I absolutely love the idea of bringing knowledge of Cardano to the young generation but I think it would be clearer if you can provide a little more information on whether the education sessions are free or not since there may be some poor/ low income students who do not have enough chances to get access to the course. Besides, if the intention of this project is aimed at developers and students who might not know about it, a communication plan in order to reach those people is necessary. Furthermore, if the students and developers had already finished the course but they did not build any projects that impact the ecosystem, what solution will be given? There is nothing wrong with the idea and the concept, i just want to know more. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team is already committed and experienced in multiple knowledge areas, which is necessary and will help the project to advance. They also provide Linkedin links to verify their ability to successfully carry out this project. The 36-month timeplan has been clearly divided in two three big terms and included the needed tasks. There is a sensible budget breakdown list and detailed explanations for each amount of money required.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposers have provided sufficient key metrics to audit the progress and the success of the project. There had been a roadmap with milestones and estimated time frames and merged with some KPI info, I think that would increase the quality of the proposal. Besides, I hope that a channel where the community can be able to follow the process and interact with the team would further increase the level of auditability of the project as a whole.

The proposer wants to approve the project to promote Blockchain understanding for students/developers at LatAm and implement contribute back to the d-edTech platform code. I can understand their core idea but not what are the main features and operation of their product, the information is more introductory about their idea rather than a deep analysis of the main product they are trying to develop. For any project related to language, the biggest barrier is the cultural difference, how can they remove this barrier and approach and introduce the platform to the audience they are towards. They also have not clarified issues such as: Is the course completely free or chargeable, are there any entrance criteria for platform subscribers (eg education level, economic condition, etc). I have not seen any similarities between the proposal and the Challenge KPIs, their analysis and information are too general.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "They have built their project development plan with 3 short-term, medium-term, and long-term phases. I also see a plan to roll out the platform for user experience before the final release. For their product, a promotional plan is a very important activity to get students/developers to use and I have not seen any promotion strategy for the platform yet. As for the cost, I would like them to provide more detailed budget allocations for each device, each activity to support the construction of the project, for example, how much is the operating cost, how much is the hardware infrastructure, and how much is the infrastructure? About $8000 instructors staffs, they should detail the number of personnel for this position, their total hours worked. Regarding personnel, they give a rather long list of members, with full biographies and Linkedin of each member. However, there are a few staff members with working knowledge and skills that I don't know can help the project, so I need the proposer to clarify the role of each member in this project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "They do not provide an information channel that the community can access to monitor the progress and development of the project. And there are no specific KPI numbers here either. They should give specific KPI numbers, (for example, after the platform is up and running, after a month the number of students registered to use the platform is 150 people, the number of lesson content is 30). They should also consider platform user feedback as a KPI to measure project success, they can collect user feedback through building an information channel/forum exchange for example. In general, they should build a roadmap according to the structure of milestones, goals/tasks to be accomplished, specific KPIs according to the example I mentioned.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1724", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposers want to create platform targeting spanish students and developers  located in south america and teach them to understand and possibily contribute to the blockchain ecosystem. This implies the impact of the proposal would be limited to spanish speaking users and hopefully would bring in more people to the ecosystem although the language barrier would be somewhat noticable for all the other untranslated resources present.\nThere is a mention of a learn-to-earn approach whch is a rising start in the developer communities, but I can't attest to it efficiancy, because I haven't yet seen it work so I can't offer an argumented oppinion. I think the proposers might have some issue dealing with future challenges, including finding continious funding from outside investors or funds like this, and unfortunately I didn't see any plan for the platform being self sustaining in future.\nAs a developer I have a few concerns about contributions from non english speaking developers. Coding is done in eglish for the most part and the code itself is in english as well. It's just a fact of life, that would mean non english speaking communities will have difficulties contributing to open source code, because the code and cdoe comments are in english and writing variable names and comments in another language is not preferable. As a devleoper whos mother tounge isn't english I can say that from experience. \nOverall I like the proposal and it's impact although limited. It surely is a good first step.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers provide all the necessary links and credentials and I was able to verify they are infact capable of taking up taching possitions and that brings credability to the whole project. I feel the proposal lacks a lot of description and elaboration of different topics. What exactly does it mean for a university to be onboarded? Does it mean to have sudents from it, or to have some business relations hiring students or funding students learning? How will the platform be self sustainable if there's no plan on how to get there? This is not a critique as much as a reflectory advice for the proposers and their future projects.\nOne thing that left me with a terrible impression is the metric measuring number of lines of code written as a measure of progress. Speaking from experience, this specific metric can negatively affect a project instead of making it grow, so my advise for the proposal would be to remove this metric.\nThe budget is lacking detail and there's no breakdown and argumentation of all the mentioned costs. What's the hourly rate, how did you come up with 6k for educational content, why 4k would do for hardware and software infrastructure and not 4.1k or 3.9. It's important to elaborate and show you've done your research because that would lift you and your proposal in the eyes of the voters.\nThe timeline and milestones aren't detailed as well and would benefit from the authors expanding on these topics.\nFor the aforementioned resons I would have to disagree the proposal is feasible, but I'd invite the proposers to polish their proposal and have another go at it in the next funding round with a new and improved solution.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I didn't find any links or resources that would give me a place to follow along with the projects progress. My suggestion would be to have a facebook group, a discord channel or even a twitter account or some other form of a communication channel that would enable followers of your proposal to trace it's progress.The metrics left seem reasonable with the one exception mentioned in the feasibility portion of the review. There's a clear and understandable description of the faced problem, but the explanation and the solution could use a little more work.\nI'd ask the proposers to look at their project throuhgh the eyes of voters that would have to decide if this is feasible or not, if it has all the information that one might be interested in. Overall the project doesn't seem to be auditable for the aforementioned reasons.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Our vision is to create code for a d-edTech Platform in Spanish that will be open-source, and available for others to develop in LatAm", "experience": "Defi Discussions LLC partnership with Techademia, Plutus Pioneers, 20+ of years experience in software engineering, 15+ of years DEVOPS expertise, counseled by Business Advisors, Marketing advisors, and Deans of respected Universities, F4-F7 Project Managers, Access to BoE"}
