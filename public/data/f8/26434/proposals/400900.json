But there is no standard mechanism adopted by the entire chain as the proposer points out. Yes, a standard, viable, dependable mechanism would reduce a lot of redundancy across the chain and there will be standardization that can be improved at a single place going forward. But some application developers would have their own doubts regarding integrating this mechanism and feel their custom implementation would serve them better. Hence I feel a little more details upfront regarding the approach and the technology used by the proposer's team would address the concerns of the application developers to a great extent. All in all, going through the high-level detailing provided by the proposer I have my own doubts regarding how effective it is and how the team proposes to influence others to make use of this.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Taking into account the project already developed and the team is asking for the funds as a token for their hard work and making sure that the community gets their hands on their brainchild, feasibility is not really a concern. The team however asks for $27000, without any details about the number of developers involved in the development and the kind of experience they have. The team mentions to have taken about 270 hours, and that would make around $100 per hour, which looks a little hefty for me as a reader. But since it's a ready-made solution from a trusted team that has delivered many ideas, I will go ahead and score a 4 out of 5 so that the community can get an open-source mechanism that many new applications can make use of if they do not want to write their own mechanism. It sure can reduce a lot of development time and increase the quality of contributions.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The same thing follows in the auditibility field. There is no development pending, hence the only progress available to track is the availability of their code on GitHub which is a simple and straightforward measuring metric. The success metric however is not well defined by the team, they say the availability of the product for others to use will be the success, but to what extent does it meets the challenge's expectations, how do the team propose to draw the attention of other users to their code, how can they make sure that their solution is adopted widely across the chain. Due to the lack of marketing and the effort of the team to reach out to as many people as possible thus meeting some of the challenge's success metrics, I have to make a small deduction in the auditability section. However, the team's assistance to make sure the community ends up with a fruitful deliverable, in the end, will be appreciated greatly.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 5, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 6326, "q0": "This proposal is about making open source an existing piece of infrastructure software to make sure a submitted transaction makes it through when sent to the Cardano blockchain and resubmit it automatically if it does not.\nWhile it's true that this piece of software is important and necessary for any proper wallet or any application that relies on transactions, we lack crucial information on its implementation.\nAt first glance, resubmitting a transaction doesn't seem so complicated that it would take 270 hours of development. The proposers (Five Binaries) could have given more details on how they did it and why it took so long, what were the technical difficulties they had to overcome, etc\u2026\nAn example of the steps implied to resubmit a transaction manually could have been useful so as to understand the complexity involved in automating such a task. For example, does their transaction resubmitter change the TTL (Time To Live) of the transaction and is therefore able to resign the transaction, etc\u2026\nThere is just not enough data to properly assess the impact (how useful it would be) nor to assess if the cost is right so I can only give a mitigated score on this impact criteria, if it were not a proposal from Five Binaries I would only have given 1 star so this is quite lenient.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "From the proposal description it appears that it already exists and they will just clean it up a bit and make it open source within 2 months once funded.

We do not even know the language of this piece of software! As a dev I am frustrated by this proposal.\nGiven that it is Five Binaries which has a long history of successful delivery and that the project is already done and being used successfully within the many services they are already providing there is no doubt concerning the feasibility but they could have made an effort to provide more information into what exactly the community is buying with this proposal.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Auditability here is quite straightforward: release of existing code as open source (Apache license 2.0) on GitHub within 2 months if funded. Five Binaries has a very strong track record since the ITN and authored many proposals successfully in many previous Catalyst funds, their infrastructure is used by many prominent wallets, dApps and core actors (Emurgo, Cardano Foundation, etc...).So no reason to doubt them at all.\nWe can regret the lack of KPIs even if they are obvious for any github project (number of forks, number of other projects using their repository, etc...).\nSince the trust of the proposer is already well established within the community I can only give a 5 stars rating for auditability even if they didn't put a lot of effort in this proposal.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_40", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7242, "q0": "I don\u2019t normally start an assessment like this, but Five Binaries, the team behind this proposal, never ceases to impress me with how simple and practical their proposals are.\nIn this case, they want to build a piece of software that resubmits transactions on-chain when they fail. If anyone has used a DEX lately, they know that when the blockchain is heavily congested, it is possible for their transactions to \u201cexpire\u201d, requiring you to resubmit them manually. This proposal aims to fix that.\nThe positive impact on the ecosystem is easy to understand: with this feature, we get one step closer to a robust financing system where once you submit a transaction, you are assured that your money goes where you want it to go.\nThe proposal definitely addresses the challenge effectively, as this software will be open-source and anyone will be able to use it or contribute to it after it\u2019s released. Score: 5.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have provided an estimation of 270 working hours for completing this software, for a budget of 27000 USD). This means 100 USD/hour, which is slightly less than their normal rate of 100 EUR, from their other proposals. I suspect this was an oversight, but the impact on the proposal, if funded, should be minor.\nThe budget is not broken down into separate parts, but I believe this is because this is a straightforward case of requiring 270 developer hours to write a piece of software. I will also add that they have explained in other proposals that their hourly rate includes infrastructure costs, costs with office rent etc, so this is more thoroughly planned than can be seen at a glance here.\nMy recommendation is only that you repeat what your hourly rate includes in every proposal, to make sure no one is confused by this.\nAs I mentioned in the beginning, the proposers are the team behind the well known Five Binaries company (https://fivebinaries.com/), which has been building infrastructure on Cardano since the beginning of project Catalyst and that recently have implemented native support for Cardano on Trezor hardware wallets: https://blog.trezor.io/trezor-suite-update-march-2022-3e1823fa22d7\nThey have created https://blockfrost.io/ along with a very impressive portfolio of projects funded and delivered from previous Catalyst funds: https://catalyst.fivebinaries.com/. I have no doubt whatsoever that they are capable of completing this proposal successfully. Score: 5.\nI have one recommendation regarding the information about the team, however, and that is that it would have been nice to add a person of contact here along with a LinkedIn profile, to help people associate this project with a human being that can be easily contacted. It might help convince voters to view an otherwise purely technical proposal more favorably.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is not much information to go by in the Auditability section, but, the proposers mentioned they will be providing a Github where progres can of course be tracked via commits. There is also the Catalyst dashboard, where one can find all the materials related to their individual projects.\nI feel it\u2019s important to point out that even though you have a good track record and your accomplishments should be proof enough that your proposals are auditable, it\u2019s still important to add some KPI\u2019s and success metrics to your proposals, since these criteria are actively sought out by CA\u2019s to establish a score. It\u2019s best to avoid the risk of getting downvoted by CA\u2019s who judge proposals solely based on the information provided in them and don\u2019t infer anything from who the proposers are or what their track record is.\nYou can simply add a few targets, like for example 5 commits per week, as a KPI and 2 projects using your software within 1 month of it being released.\nThese being said, I\u2019m certain the progress and success of this proposal will be auditable.
