And the number of python developers is huge, an attempt to lure them onto the Cardano Chain shouldn't be neglected. The development in the Cardano community currently is primarily focused on node and javascript, and hence providing additional support to python developers has to be encouraged to make the chain all the more acceptable and adaptable. The proposer tries to achieve this in a simple yet essential manner, by enriching the python-support the community already provides. The open-source nature of these APIs is clearly an add-on. However, the challenges are something the team has to vary upon, no doubt the team has prior experience, but I feel making these APIs secure and credible is something that has to be given utmost importance and a little information of the same would help the readers and voters in taking the proposer's side.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan laid out by the team is practical considering a 6-month timeline they have set for themselves. The project has only 2 members, both being competent and having had successful funding ventures in the past. The plan looks plain and simple with the required technical details enough to grab the attention of both technical gurus and the business heads. The fund requirement of 10000 looks apt for the considerable amount of effort the team members intend to take. There lies no doubt within the feasibility criteria of the proposal in my opinion and funds asked for being a small amount and the target audience of the proposal being a very effective and important one, I feel on successful implementation, this proposal could bring a huge amount of talents into the ecosystem, thus augmenting to the capabilities of it.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPIs mentioned in the proposal are quite direct and show the proposal moving towards its envisioned destination. The proposer understands the need for technical metrics for the community to audit the development activities and makes the necessary accommodations to include the unit test cases along with the git commits. The proposer also understands the campaign's success criteria and provides the readers with aligned metrics that they can expect the team to reach by the end of their timeline. However, being a fairly new proposal in catalyst, I feel a few more details in the audit section would have sealed the deal for the team considering the community and voters be very conscious of funding new proposals and would need a brief understanding of what they might achieve at the end not just from the development perspective but also from the usability and acceptance point of view. So metrics such as the number of applications leveraging their open-source APIs, number of new contributors,..etc would have helped.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2320, "q0": "Proponents want to build a platform where content creators can interact with their followers in a new, interactive way. The problem statement is lacking, but I have the idea completely and he's a good guy that's up to the challenge I believe in. I believe these types of platforms will become popular in the future. Bringing creators as content creators will bring a lot to the ecosystem. I'm not too sure about extending the project easily as the work is done by a discoverer right now. The Cardano-Tools Python proposal will absolutely add something missing to the ecosystem, namely more content creators and their followers, effective for community growth. Overall, it's a good proposition and I'd love to see it have an impact on the community. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponents give links and a clear reference to their names and skills which I have managed to verify with a bit of googling. From the looks of it, this project involved a substantial team to work on it, and the type and number of team members were set. The budget is clearly outlined and it seems reasonable to the work that needs to be put in for the project to be successful. The timeframe established for all the work seems realistic. There is a very specific plan for all deployments that as a developer I can appreciate. The technologies to be used are all listed and appear legit for the task at hand. There are enough resources for those who claim to successfully build their project from scratch, but I would suggest looking at other open source projects and what they've done to minimize the common work required. There are a number of risks and challenges mentioned as well as best possible solutions to some roadblocks. Overall seems to be a viable project with the good team behind it with their names and titles. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The metrics and KPIs are really granular. One thing I like is that the team has a great definition of success that seems realistic to me as a developer. The roadmap with milestones for technical and non-technical implementation is logical and sequential. Having a clear description of the problem targeted with validating one's work experience and a clear description of the solution, that was well thought out. I really liked the propagandists who looked through the eyes of the future users and saw what they expected of their platform and had a plan to deliver it. Overall, I think the project could be easier to follow if the team had a way to get ongoing feedback from the community as well as let the community know progress.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1477", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4057, "q0": "The proposal clearly and concisely describes how it will address the challenge of expanding and updating the current Cardano-Tools Python library. By including the information on how this project would be directly relevant to the Cardano Ecosystem, the team have shown that they have the ability to ease the limit of previous projects. This will effectively attract more contributors to join in the ecosystem and result in the increase in the number and quality of later Cardano Open Source projects. After all, I believe that this proposal has given a simple and effective solution to the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Though there are only two members of the team, they seem to assemble a very diverse set of skills and experience across a wide range of disciplines and achievements. Having a previous project funded can strengthen the credibility and competence of the team. At the same time, it would be better if some specific reference to the developers mentioned can be provided in order to give voters and the community members more details about their knowledge and skills. The project plan is clearly described and it is expected to happen in the two last quarters of 2022. But I think it would be good to provide more detailed information since such a high cost per hour indicated.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There are five specific indications of the project that could be used by the community to keep track of the progress. In order to help voters visualize the success, I think it would be good to report the number of CLI leadership slot computation/ incremental multi-signature functionality/ mempool query feature instead of just mentioning \u201cnew\u2026..\u201d, which could help the community to verify that everything is on track. In addition, a channel where the community can be able to follow the process and interact with the team would further increase the level of auditability of the project as a whole.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1702", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4304, "q0": "In this proposal, the proposed solutions are presented with a plan, with clear goals and transparent processes. However, I found that for the impact part, the key KPIs for the challenge, if possible, give more specific data instead of just general increase the number and the quality of Cardano Open Source projects, increase the number of contributors to the Cardano ecosystem, increase the amount of open source tools and frameworks. This will help make the proposal clearer and more transparent as well as the proposer\u2019s determination to achieve success for the project. In addition, the team seems quite confident in their knowledge of the tools, although it is still advisable to consider and identify risks or challenges so that a comprehensive assessment and determination can be made based on that they could achieve oriented goals.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has outlined detailed plans such as Wrap new CLI features (leadership schedule, mempool, incremental multi-signature) in the NodeCLI Python object, Wrap additional Cardano wallet back end functionality (CLI and HTTP), Implement additional library unit tests . However, it is not possible to give the most feasible and accurate assessment because the team has not clearly defined the timeline to complete the above tasks. Each job with a corresponding timeline will help the community track the project progress more easily. As for the budget, the team has an estimate of the labor cost that will cost approximately $10,000.00 for the six month effort, but the author should describe more details about the total amount of money that will be spent on which items and criteria, or how much is each person's salary (time-based or workload-based),... The team stated the qualifications and experience of the members involved in the project especially as each of them has experience and reputation in the Cardano community. For example, Dylan Crocker Ph.D. - Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, Engineering professional and Willie Marchetto Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering, they all have over 10 years of work experience and both had a project funding through Catalyst with successful completion. However, I am quite disappointed that the proposal does not have any references or links to their biographies given in the proposal to verify the information and skills of these people.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In this section, the proposal only mentions measuring project progress with a goal of 5 substantial git commits per month but does not clearly state how the goal is and how it can be controlled and evaluated based on that. Can the project be completed on time? Similarly, the risks that will be encountered in the process of developing the project have not yet been estimated, but based on that, reasonable solutions can be proposed and the reliability of the proposal is increased. While the criteria for determining when a project is complete are clearly stated, I hope the writer will clarify the metrics as well as create a link for the community to follow and check out this project in an easier way.

For the non tech oriented readers, an SDK is basically a tool for other developers to use making things easier and a CLI is a command line interface which is just a different sort of tooling.\nWhat I really like in this proposal as a developer myself is the link to the github repo, because I can get all my information from there. I can assure you the authors are woking hard on this tooling and do have the necessary skills to do it. I can tell that even before opening their linked in profiles. This really will bring more python developers to the space, because python devs really like their pluggins and having an SDK for everything they might consider doing in cardano is exactly the way to go!\nThe proposal clearly finds itself in the right category, becing open source and bettering the community by giving back and so forth. This proposal will have impact, although limited to the python community (which is quite big by itself), but considering the cost to value ratio this project sure is a 5/5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Although the proposers haven't offered linkedin profiles, I was able to find one of them on linkedin and he has all the advartised experience and skil set listed in the proposal. This is not as important for me as a developer as the fact they've linked their work in gitlab, which assured me they had all the necessary credentials. Another small sentance that brings credability to this project is the fact they want to refactor to make the code better and more sustainable, keyword being sustainable, because in an open source project eventually many people start working on it, and if you don't have this unicorn of a maintainable code all your efforts up to this point might have been for naught. Refactoring the code is really underestimated and I'm glad they've thought about that and included it in the estimation. And for those of you asking, why didn't they write maintainable code in the first place, I'd respond with the best parents are the ones that don't have children.\nThe budget breakdown is good. There's a rough estimation of hours per month and they listing Q3 and Q4 which is 6 months for 55 hours per month that makes 330 hours. 10000 / 330 is ~30$/h which is reasonable and conservative even as they mention. The necessary resources, mainly time, are mentioned in the proposal and I like the fact they don't expect any challenges in order to complete this project which shows their confidence in their ability, although it's seems a bit naive to me, but that doens't affect the feasability for me one bit.\nOverall this is a feasible and dare I say probable project. Good luck to the proposers.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There's a public gitlab repo so all concerns about the tracability and accountability of the project go out the window. There's a rough roadmap, which could have been a bitt more specific, but is good enough if you want to follow along with the progress. Anyone could look at the commits messages here https://gitlab.com/viper-staking/cardano-tools/-/commits/main which are relatively understandable.\nClear problem statement, followed by a simple solution is what I like to read in proposals and this one has it. Overall my only suggestion for the proposers would be to elaborate on the details in the proposal for the non-tech people as well, because not all voters are developers and although I've tried simplifying this proposal, I'm sure I've missed something. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7516, "q0": "Having proper open source tools and sdk's for speficic languages is key to a healthy develmpent ecosystem.
