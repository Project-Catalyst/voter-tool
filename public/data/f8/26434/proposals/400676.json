Milkomeda have their own Node that opeartors will run and the request is to fund the creation of a docker image for these Nodes so they can be spun up quickly. The main beneficiary of this will Stake Pool Operators on Milkomeda (under 100 in total) and those who wish to interact with this layer 2 blockchain - the target size is dependent on their success. This is a beneficial tool, that will benefit primarily those that use Milkomeda, and if successful is likley to bring over Ethereum devs and users on their chain who will need to use ADA. This will grown the userbase and add an opensource tool.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "dcSpark is operated by alumni of Emurgo, they have built such things as the Yoroi wallet, the cardano-serialization-lib and large parts of the Cardano tech. They also built Milkomeda and already operate Nodes on Milkomeda. The ask at hand would be Dockerise the Node and release it to the public - not a terribly complex thing if they have the Node running already. The budget for this task at 2.5k is very reasonable. The rest of the budget for updating the scripts and supporting companies to migrate is reasonable , but should really change the wording of the proposal to make clear upfront. I have high confidence that they can deliver the docker image, as the Node of Cardano itself has already been dockerised and I use it on regular basis.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The deliverable is a docker image that will either launch or not, it is a binary outcome and therefore easy to test.

This is a good idea, but the impact will be limited because it's already been dobe before several times.\nThe input output organization have a docker container ready to use https://hub.docker.com/r/inputoutput/cardano-node as well as a couple of more people that have open sourced their solution, one of which is this one: https://github.com/abracadaniel/cardano-pool-docker and there are articles like this one: https://viperstaking.com/ada-tools/node-quickstart explaining how to run a node by means of docker in 10 minutes. Because of this, I think your proposal would have little impact on the cardano community.\nBefore making any proposal it's a good idea to do a bit of reserach to see if anyone hasn't implemented it already or in progress of doing it. That's why it's my recommendation to take a look at other proposals in the finilazation phase because you might find a team to join forces with. Keep that in mind for any future projects. Overall it's a good idea, but even so it lacks details.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "I didn't find any credentials or reference links in this proposal and no names or github handles were given, so I couldn't verify the skillset listed in the proposal which brings the credability of the proposal down quite a bit IMHO. I did found an organization dcSpark, which looks simmilar, but I couldn't be sure about the team members without any more information provided in the description of the proposal.\nBudget breakdown could be done better. Instead of having price tags for work you plan on doing which can't be verified or estimated by the CAs and the voters, you can have a breakdown of tasks in hours and then just give your hourly rate and when multiplied those two factors would give you the budget you need. This way you would make it a lot easier on the CAs and anyone reading your proposal to agree with your estimations and vote for your proposal.\nI believe the timetable you had provided was relevant for the work that needed to be done, according to my experience as a developer whos done quite a few docker files. The proposal could have elaborated a bit more on different parts of the proposal like metrics, the need for this development, a milestones breakdown and a roadmap.\nOverall I don't believe this is a feasible proposal for the above reasons alongside the fact there are many docker solutions already out there.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "There's no linked repository like github or gitlab which would allow for anyone to check up on your progress. The definition of success is great, but it's not measurable at all, or at least the impact your work would have had on the ecosystem which is the metrics you need to strive for. Other than that there's a clear and understandable problem statement and an idea for a solution but no actual plan on delivering it or keeping the community in the loop while doing it.\nOverall I can't call this proposal auditable. I urge you to come back next fund with better reserach and a better description of your proposals. Put yourself in the shoes of the voter and think about making the proposal understandable and clear for anyone reading, no matter if he's a software engineer or not.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 2, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7233, "q0": "This is another proposal by the well known company dcSpark which has worked on multiple Cardano projects in the last few years. In this case they propose creating an easy to use docker setup that would allow users and developers to more easily run full Milkomeda (the Cardano sidechain) nodes. The argument for why this is important is that it\u2019s required for many DApps and would help accelerate the DApp creation / migration rate to Milkomeda, thus increasing use of the Cardano blockchain.\nThe proposers outlined as a risk that some people might still choose to use centralized services that run nodes for them, but in my opinion, as long as the solution here is simple, the incentive of being decentralized is greater than just not having to think about this issue, considering we are talking about blockchain users. In the end, I think people will choose to run nodes for themselves, if that\u2019s easy enough (personally for example I like using Daedalus even though it\u2019s quite cumbersome at times).\nI think this proposal addresses the Open Source Development Ecosystem challenge effectively. Score: 5.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have not provided a timeline or roadmap per se, only an estimation of when the work will be done: in Q2 of 2022.\nThe 5000 USD budget is broken down into 3 separate parts: $2500 for writing the docker scripts, $5000 for updating the scripts as Milkomeda evolves and $7500 for helping companies and projects integrate these scripts into their code. This all seems reasonable, but as usual, I would be remiss if I did not point out that we should have a hint of dcSpark\u2019s hourly rate and a rough estimation in hours.\nRegarding the team, as mentioned in the beginning, the people behind this proposal are a company called dcSpark which is well known in the Cardano ecosystem. As a recommendation, I think it would be useful to always share a link to your site (https://www.dcspark.io/) so that voters can easily see who you are and maybe to list a few of your achievements, just to make it more convincing. This proposal in particular will be worked on by Rinor, a devops engineer who\u2019s already had experience with Milkomeda and even previously worked for IOHK. Again I would recommend adding a link to the social media of a person when they are mentioned, especially if they are responsible for the work done in the proposal. If anyone is interested, I think I found his GitHub: https://github.com/rinor.\nI believe this proposal is likely to be implemented successfully.
