In addition, the solution also provides additional risks that the project may face when released.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The new Proposer gives an outline for the work, not a detailed roadmap.

Likewise, the information section of the 'detailed budget breakdown' should include additional information such as activities in the Pr and marketing section.

With these characteristics, the service will substantially aid in transparent and straightforward financial management. But that's all I can see in this part. As for the proposed solution addressing the challenge, I didn't find any useful information or match the requirements of this section. Proposer just once again outlines the features of the service without going into the focus on the requirement of this section which is what it will achieve. In addition, predicting only 1 challenge in the near future makes the project vulnerable to stalling if unexpected circumstances arise. Even the proposer is unable to identify an appropriate remedy for that risk, which will cause the project to face further challenges in the future.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "My satisfaction with this part can be maximized because I can see all the required data appear here.

In addition, how the project intends to spend the money is also provided in great detail. Even the team members are carefully selected to fit the project. And I also don't want to change anything in this section.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Instead of just stating a general, the proposer can use a certain amount or approximate a range for the progress and development portion of the project. Besides, I don't see a specific timeline in this section, so the proposer should review what was mentioned in the previous part to give the most appropriate and accurate timelines. In the end, for the successes they calculate, it is generally quite good and reasonable.
