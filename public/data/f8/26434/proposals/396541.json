The problem statement is clear, as many developers are self taught programmers and do not necessarily hold a formal mathematics background. The summarized solution to the problem in a nutshell will provide a DSL (domain specific language), which is in plain terms a simpler version of providing a bunch of logical statements as close as possible to natural language such as English.\n\nAs a senior developer myself I can see the importance of such a proposal. Blockchain is immutable and Cardano will soon have tens of thousands of dapps running on it. Therefore, it is very important that those dapps are as robust as possible before they go live. \n\nThe solution proposed by this project will essentially allow developers to test their smart contracts against a predefined set of rules (based on their scripts business logic) in a DSL and formally have a testing process prior to mainnet deployment. \n\nAdditionally, it would be also possible to translate these rules then into the code itself, something on the lines of test driven OR feature driven development (a practice widely known in Software Engineering). This will allow developers to have a lot more confidence with their plutus scripts and find issues before they go live. \n\nGreat proposal and Good luck to the team.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is presented by the MLabs, which are well known development firms in the Cardano ecosystem.

The company is also an official IOG (company behind Cardano) plutus partner and holds the right experience needed to build such a DSL spec.The profile links for main developers and delivery manager behind this proposal are given and one can see that they hold the expertise to implement this proposal successfully.\n\nAs a senior developer myself I can see that the budget asked for is devoted entirely to Engineering hours, which in my opinion is the entirety of efforts needed for its successful implementation. The total time is broken very well into individual tasks/milestones, which showcases that the team has very well thought through the engineering efforts that are needed to achieve this proposal. However, it would have been great if hours were also represented in terms of how many months/weeks it will take to finish this. As many voters/community members are more used to looking at weekly/monthly timeframes. \n\nAdditionally, one of the concerns I have is how accurate the DSL would be because a lot of projects will rely on its implementation, however, this is already mentioned in the risks and challenges section. Nevertheless, I can see a lot of improvements and a lot more community (maybe also IOG, as they have already given us Marlowe) support dropping in to improve the development of this DSL.\n\nVery nice proposal and looking forward to its implementation, with or without funding.

The most important metric, however, would be to see how many projects are incorporating this DSL. This will be also available via GitHub and the community will be able to see how many forks/stars/downloads this package will have.\n\nThe success of the project is divided in 3-6-12 months, each of which has major functionality milestones presented. The community therefore will have an opportunity to check upon the short term intermediate progress of the project.  The project also mentions how they will mostly focus on edge cases around the 12 months mark, and as a senior developer myself I can not agree more to this, as the edge cases usually are the most tricky ones and may pop up very late in development life cycle. \n\nThe proposer has identified and presented such cases to the community, which in my opinion, is a representation of how the team has thought through the multiple aspects of the implementation.

To put it clearly, when you're creating a smart contract to send tokens, you never want to send the wrong token. This proposal would give you the tool you need to assert a constant valid state of the application and/or smart contract. It's an amazing idea and very difficult to pull of, but by the looks of it, there will be steady progress if this proposal is voted in. The project falls in perfectly in the bounds of the challenge, enabling future cardano developers to write consistent and secure Dapps.\nThe value added to the Cardano ecosystem would be immence, especially for developers such as myself. Much of the exploits happening on other chains are due to smart \ncontracts falling into an invalid state the developer didn't expect and such tools can help with that as well. I like the goals of the proposal as they strive to help developers grow the skills necessary to make Cardano even more economically competitive.\nI don't see any problem for the proposal to scale for one main reason. Usually tools such as these can be run offline, but it would have been nice for this detail to be mentioned in the proposal. The whole idea of a DSL to test and assert states and properties of the smart contract is not by any means new, but I can't stress enough how necessary the actual implementation is so kudos to the guys developing this. This proposal adds a big chunk missing from the currently available tooling.\nAs a developer I don't have any concerns about this proposal as it seems the authors of the proposal have covered all the bases. The only thing for me to do is vote for them and wish them good luck. I'll definately be following along with their progress.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There are more than enoug evidence provided in the form of skills descriptions, github repositories and profiles of the team members. I was able to find information about each of them and was more than happy with what I found, excluding what was already described in the proposal. I have absolutely no doubt that the listed members would be able to finish the job. More than that the proposers have team ready instead of individuals, which is a small but importand difference when you need to the work.\nThe budget is broken down into hourly rate for each stage of the proposal including the actual development and research before that. The 72000 they request devided by 900 hours to complete the project brings the hourly rate to 80 $/hour which is fair for a task with such difficulty. You might not appreciate what they're trying to do, but beleve me, it's complicated and I'm really happy they have so many mathematically profiled people on the team.\nI wouldn't presume to know if the timetable is relevant or not, because I haven't done such work before and I couldn't estimate properly, but I would defer to their judgement as proffessionals. The one thing I can talk about though is the segregation of tasks to be done till the project is completed, and I really like they have included time for proper research and categorization of the problems they're going to tackle. Furthermore they are aware of the fact, corner cases will pop up, but they keep their eyes on the prize and will strive to cover the general purpose cases before diving to the side. This requires some level of discipline and is comendible.\nThe technical aspects are more then well explained and some part of the proposal is an actual tutorial on how things work and a brief history of the space to give the reader context for the incomming problem. The team has considered their biggest challenge and I really think they're spot on with it, because the general case is not perfect but will help a lot of developers learn and grow while keeping mistakes minimum.\nThe project is in sync with the ecosystem and to be hones I've been wating for such a tool for some time now, so if it's voted in, I'm deffinately using it to learn how to write better smart contracts and Dapps.

Benchmarking is really necessary for tooling such as this, because once developers start relying on you, you need to provide them with the stable ground on which to stand on. In this sense benchmarking performance and common sense scenarios is a really important metric. A metric that I haven't seen before is the documentation, but it really seems like a good one, because (speaking from experience) you can never have too much documentation. The more people ask about how the tooling works, the more documentation should appear in the perfect world. \nAs I already mentioned I really like the roadmap and the specific milestones that are put in. It's clear that a lot of thought was put into them. There's a clear and understandable problem, prefixed with a short history to provide context.
