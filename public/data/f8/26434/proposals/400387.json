The proposal identifies that there is a lot of value in the on-chain data that Cardano will process and as the number of Dapps launching on Cardano are increasing week by week, it is a no-brainer that the on-chain analytics will be of utmost importance for various purposes.\n\nBeing myself in IT industry as an Engineer for over 15 years I have closely followed the big tech giants (e.g. Google, Amazon and Meta) work on data analytics to predict various trends and then build data models, bringing significant profits and steer solutions to not only find solutions to some of the difficult business problems but also identify new business opportunities (especially to the untapped customer areas). \n\nGiven the nature of blockchain the data analytics combined with Cardano may give even better results, because the immutable nature of blockchain brings true data integrity which is usually a big issue when dealing with data analytics on otherwise centralized servers. Therefore, such data analytics on Cardano can be leveraged by various Cardano projects which are looking to find solutions to specific business problems in their business domains.\n\nThe proposal proposes to open source both front end and back end, and hence perfectly aligns with the target for this challenge. The API solution that this proposal proposes will make it very easy for any project/dapp on Cardano to simply build their own AI based or data driven services based on the analytics provided by this API. Finally, with my own development experience I can say that microservices based architecture is a very good candidate to have good scalability with minimal set of changes (if done right), and I hope that team will be able to do so in the right way. Therefore, I strongly agree that this proposal, if implemented successfully, will bring a lot of benefits to the Cardano open source dev ecosystem.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Firstly, I would like to mention that this proposal was approved but because of lack of funding was not able to get funded in the previous round. The budget breakdown is very justified. I have myself designed microservices based architectures for enterprise businesses, and therefore I can easily judge that team knows what they are going to deliver and how much effort they estimate in terms of budget requirements.\n\nThe proposal has provided public links to the main developers/leads who will be driving this project. Since they will use db sync and build up their API layer ground up, I do not really see any need to have smart contract development experience here, which is otherwise lacking on the team side. Also the team does a great job in explaining the architectural details of the proposed solution such as OAuth 2.0 /open id connect for user authorization protecting the API endpoints. \n\nThe timeline is very well represented, and rates of every developer are split into man hours. The timeline is split into 1-3-6-12 months. Each of these timeline presents a good set of descriptions on feature sets that are expected to be released in those months. \n\nI really like that the proposal has considered contingency plans in terms of over budgeting , which addresses one of the challenge settings of having a verifiable plan in case of such situations. Additionally, even though a lesser risk section on marketing for driving adoption is given, in my opinion is NOT a lesser risk when it comes to the impact of this proposal, however, for the scope of completion/feasibility of this project I agree that this would be a comparatively less risk. An overall, very well explained and elaborated proposal, hence I strongly agree.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap of this project is provided in detail. The team has already identified the number of epics for this project, which means they are going to work in an Agile based environment. These epics are further split into features that can be expected per Epic. Also, the team will provide details of their progress on Github, which can then easily be tracked by the community as these features are worked upon and rolled out.\n\nThe time horizon that connects these epics together is also provided, which means that it is already planned out that at the end of the given timeline (1-3-6-12 months) which features from which epic are to be expected. \n\nWhat I also admire is that the team has given a very detailed peek into what actual work in terms of implementation they would be doing at which stage of this project. As a senior developer myself I can assert that this is a very good sign as it explains a lot about the professionalism and technical expertise of the proposal team. I, therefore, fully agree that this proposal is highly auditable. Good luck to the team this time.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_454", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 3, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7755, "q0": "An open-source API layer on top of Cardano would bring a lot of useful information about the blockchain for general masses that are building on Cardano.
