The budget provided is very general and therefore I cannot say whether it is appropriate or not. There aren't more details how the budget is going to be spent, also I'm trying to discover attachment to deep dive the solution.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Only simple KPI metrics are shown (eg- agile metrics). I miss in this area is that the proposer has not mentioned possible difficulties and how to deal with them (e.g. difficulties in adoption of the tools/API\u2026)\nThere are other good proposition DAO on Cardano and the competition is great, so I suggest the proposer to define a distinctive strategy to distinguish from other wallet just in production.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_114", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7098, "q0": "I usually try to give a succinct explanation of the proposal, but for this one It's hard for me to form what exactly is this proposal about. At first I thought is a guide on how to establish a DAO, but there are made distinctions between DAOs and DSOO (decentralized self-organizing organizations) which to be honest I didn't understand. I tried googling the difference but there is not such terminology (DSOO) mentioned anywhere. Then in the 'summarize your solution' section I saw that the temrm Decentralized Autonomous Self-organizing Organizations is used as if DAOs and DSOO are one and the same which contradicts the link left in the proposal. It was always my understanding that Autonomos means self directing and self guiding and it sounds like a synonim of self-organizing.\nI I don't know if this solution would bring value and will be impactfull for the cardano community. There was a mention of subject matter experts, but not the actual subject, because I realized I was looking for an example to help me understand the proposal better, but there wasn't one. As a suggestion to the proposal I'd say to add concreteness to their proopsals and maybe add an example of a DSOO and how it differs from DAOs to help educate the readers like myself and the voters that will be reading their proposal. \nOverall I'm unable to say if this proposal will be impactfull or not.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers have provided the names of the team members, but no links, so I started searching for them one by one on google and linked in. I found a single Ond\u0159ej H\u00e1lek (https://www.linkedin.com/in/halekondrej/?originalSubdomain=cz) who works at a bank and is not a product owner or an architect, so I must have the wrong person, but I couldn't find another. I found a Gert Vilemos although the name in the proposal must be miss spelled because it's written with double 'L' (https://www.linkedin.com/in/gertvillemos/) who matches the description in the proposal, but he's not an expert in DSOO. It says in his description that he believes in the power of self-organizing teams and decentralized organizations, but the term DSOO is not mentioned anywhere, neither does his skills point him as an expert. Brendan McEnroe was the only person matching his listed skills and occupation. Kevin Lee Smith is an extremely common name and so I searched for the founder of Pragmatic framework, but I didn't find this framework at all so I gave up looking. \nOn the budget breakdown: 1 senior consultant for 26 weeks for 2500$ seems not likely as a sallary for a proffecional, especially a contractor. Same goes for the 26 weeks of support by a project coordinator. The rest 30 000$ are meant for contract content providers, but not content subject is mentioned or time of employment and no hourly rate as well so I can't estimate if the wage would be fair or not.\nOne more thing I found strange is the phrasing: 'create a DAO for hosting the community', because usually DAOs are organic and if the need arises a DAO springs up, it's not the other way arround. No one has started DAOs and tried to initiate a community to be hosted by it, so the whole idea is a bit anti-intuitive to me as a developer (maybe I have things backward, so that's just my oppinion). There are a few more things as well, but overall I don't believe this project is feasible, because of the mismatch of the team skills listed and the ones I could verify alongside the lack of detail and information about the project aim and budget breakdown.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "There is no mention of the project being opensource anywhere and in the resource link it states that DSOOs are usually 'operating as standard private corporations with special organizational structure' which is not a thing we want in an open source community so maybe this proposal is in the wrong challenge, and I'd addvise the proposers to look through the other challenge categories and find a better place for their proposal in the next fund with a new and improved proposal.\nI don't understand what would the success of this project look like and where will that success be communicated to the community, because there are no communication channels mentioned. Overall I don't think this proposal is auditable. I urge the authors to look at other proposals like this one: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396541 to better understand what an excellent proposal looks like so they know toward what should they strive.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8110, "q0": "\"Enable Cardano DAO for new users\" proposal fits well within Open Source Development Ecosystem as they try to establishing Decentralized self organising organization (DSOO) that will eventually turn to DAO with knowledge base and consultancy.
