NFT drops is the perfect example for that scenario. Instead of sending each NFT to a particular address one by one, you'd batch all the people you need to send an NFT to and create a single transaction which will cost you linearly less in transaction fees. This means it's a valuable and impactfull idea with real world application and it's a missing piece of the puzzle when it comes to basic building blocks for cardano devs.\nThe most beautiful part is the open source github repository that will be usable by anyone. Some of the project open source only part of their solutions, but that's not the case here, which makes me as a developer really happy to be able to experiment with this tool. This will add great value to the open source world.\nI believe the key metrics are on point and will show not only the technical progress of the project but the user adopion as well. Challenges are mentioned although I wouldn't call them real challenges, and I'm glad if the team thinks the only possible challenge they can face is a second corona virus pandemic. Very brave words!\nThis proposal would add a missing part in the ecosystem and I'd expect for peoiple to start using this solution right away. As a developer, I'd be sure to follow this projects' progress and checkout their solution as soon as possible. Overall I don't have any concerns about this proposal from a developer or usability perspective.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has proven trackrecord and credentials and they were part of solutions that were already funded in previous funds. This along with the provided links to verify their skills all brings credibility to the project at hand and makes the probability of a quick implementation. I love the fact they've pointed to a test transaction that prooves what they're trying to do is possible and are planning to automate the process for other people as well.\nA realistic timetable is presented that spans over two months that seems reasonable for the work necessary to bring this project to fruition. There's a good breakdown of sequential tasks to ensure a constant development, while cheking and verifying the progress made with developers. This approach would enable for every developer to not only see how the automation of batch transactions is done, but to contribute and give back as well to grow the community.\nThe technical aspecs are somewhat explained in a diagram linked in the proposal. I ventured a look and it seems prety straightforward.\nThe budget seems reasonable and the average rate is used for the developers that will be hired. I say average because I've looked at a lot of proposals and 3000$ to 4000$ dollars a month depending on the position is the usual rate I'm talkink about.\nThe project seems to be in sync with what's already been done, and I'd suggest they team up with another proposal as well named: Plutarch: typed eDSL in Haskell, that deals with using an even faster way than Plutus Tx to generate validator scripts.\nOverall I think this proposal is not only feasibly but probably because of the cost / value ratio is so good!\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There's a github repository linked so I don't have much to say, beyond there's no problem with auditability. Anyone interested in the project would be able to see the code progress and releases in the repository.\nKPIs could be better considering the bar is set pretty low. One team using their solution seems to be pretty conservative considering the idea. I'd suggest for more adoption KPIs and as for the metrics they could be a bit more explicit as well. Counting github pull requests and forks is a good start, but there are better metrics of tracking adoption and usability. In that train of thought, a discord channel or a telegram group is a perfect place to gather feedback from real people using your solution.\nHaving said that, the proposal problem and solution statements are clear and understandable and the milestones as well as the timeframe for execution is reasonable.

The open source solution aims to batch / package multiple outgoing transactions thanks to the development of the open source tool for cardano-cli that can can send multiple native assets to multiple addresses. Seems like a no-brainer (logical!) idea that is a win-win for all involved. The open source tool coupled with the significant impact on Cardano means that the proposal is excellently aligned with the Challenge. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers are Plutus Pioneers (1st cohort) and both also professional software engineers with multiple earlier contributions  to the Cardano ecosystem.

This transaction resulted in a 150 x lower fee for a batched transaction. This bodes well for the project. As it is open source following progress and development will be facilitated by tracking the milestones and the open source repository itself. The success metrics also measure adoption after the development, which is commendable. The KPIs lack a time dimension - so that would be good to include if the proposal happens to be resubmitted in Fund 9. Finally, one more issue would be good to analyze (in case of re-submission in Fund 9). How does batching affect efficiency of Cardano's network and what are the estimated benefits in terms of reducing the load? Maybe there is no effect, or maybe the team can measure it as well? How much more efficient are these transactions in terms of block space utilization? \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_35", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10890, "q0": "I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. The proposer wants to provide an open source tool for cardano-cli (a command line interface that provides a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and other important tasks) through which projects/teams/developers will be able to generate batch transactions that can send multiple native assets to multiple addresses. \n\nThis will result into a reduction of transaction fee (especially when there are a lot of addresses that needs to receive different native assets. This solution will allow future and current teams to reuse this open source solution, rather than implementing it on their own (which some projects already do) and hence saving them time and efforts and focus on their business value.

Some teams have already been developing different solutions for batching transactions on Cardano, but here the focus would be on making the code open source and allowing it to have some customizable features, so that different projects/developers can benefit from this implementation.\n\nConsidering Cardano's current moment where the demand for block space is constantly increasing, it is essential that scalability solutions and optimization of space occupied by transactions are encouraged, in order to continue stimulating the development of dapps and avoid bottlenecks that could limit development and use. of the blockchain.\n\nThe proposal mentions aspects that can be improved in the future related to pipelining mechanisms.\n\nThe established deliverables/goals indicate a significant impact for this challenge and for the Cardano development ecosystem, my only recommendation would be to improve the numerical definition of KPIs, as the only targets established were in relation to:\n\n- At least 1 team using the repository for batching transactions on testnet(first month)\n- At least 1 team using the repository for batching transactions on mainnet (third month)\n- \"In 6 months:\nMultiple teams using the repository for batching transactions on mainnet. Other teams extending repository further or collaborating for enhancements.\"\n\nJust one team using the repository for batching on testnet and mainnet is very conservative and would not indicate a significant impact. It is clear that if only one team uses the project and achieves an implementation where several transactions are executed on a recurring basis, there would be a greater impact, but as there is no KPI that establishes the frequency of use or number of transactions executed with the batcher, the impact assessment is a little less positive.\n\nThe definition of multiple teams using the repository after 6 months is vague, if there were three teams using it, could they already be considered multiple? The purpose of the KPI is to establish an objective indicator, so it would be important to have a clearer target so that it is possible to envision the potential for impact.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has adequate expertise to develop the proposal and includes links to the repositories and Linkedin.
