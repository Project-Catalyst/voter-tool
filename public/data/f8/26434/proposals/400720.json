Furthermore, a blueprint will make it easier for the community to track the progress of the project. In the budget section, the plus point is they have shown the main categories and the number of hours worked in each category, however, I have not seen the cost breakdown for each category, and this section looks like a roadmap of project development rather than the budget allocation plan. Regarding personnel, the proposer describes to us some information about the key member of the project, his job, and work experience, it can be seen that this person has a deep understanding of the field of the project they're working on, actively participating in the Cardano community, however, it's difficult to validate what the proposer describes so I'd encourage them to attach a Linkedin profile or something can reinforce their words.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The plus point in this section is that they have provided us with tools/environments so that those interested in the project can track the progress of the project development (GitHub), and they also provide a specific KPI to measure the success of the project is Likes on https://pub.dev/packages/cardano_wallet_sdk exceeding 40.

Flutter is a powerful development framework (backed by Google) as it allows one to write a single application for all platforms (iOS, Android, Web, and also desktops: OSX, Windows and GNU/Linux!). Having an open source flutter Software Development Kit for cardano will be a huge competitive advantage. As a developper, when you choose a platform to develop on, the existence of SDKs and libraries have a lot of weight in your choice, so if one want to develop a universal application leveraging the power of blockchain then Cardano will be in a better position thanks to the existence of this Flutter SDK. Instead of having specialized developper for each platform you can have a single team focusing on what makes your software uniq instead of managing every quirk of every operating system all of this while keeping your maintenance cost very low (no need to recode at each major OS update: you just update your flutter dependency and recompile your app and voil\u00e0!).\nThe 9 minutes video provided within the proposal gives a very good overview of the current status and potential of the project.\nThis SDKs literally will make cardano developpement available for hundreds of millions of devices on the planet.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has already proven his experience in past funds on the same project and is now also part of the Plutus Pioneer 3rd Cohort course. SDKs need to be maintained and to evolve alongside the systems they support. The proposer lowered his budget to ensure funding and plans to request similar amounts in future funds to continue his work on the SDK.\nFor perspective it would have been nice to add a hint to the effective pay/hour provided by previous funds given the total time actually spent on the project, this could help the proposer justify his current and future funding costs.\nThe requested amount of $15k is quite low and this is a one man project so there is no real risk of running out of funds to continue the work (as he said in the comment: this did not prevent him from working on the project after exhausting his initial time estimation).\nThe risks have been considered (mainly wrong time estimation) but nothing he aims at doing is impossible or should contain unmanageable engineering issues.\nThere is only one thing that troubles me in this project: the mentioning of having to reimplement some cryptography in Dart but the lack of auditing. This is truly mandatory for any cryptographic algorithm implementation, as the SDK is still a work in progress that can be dealt with later but it should be mentioned and maybe addressed into a specific proposal. This would reinforce trust and support for the whole project.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The provided KPIs are GitHub commits and likes on pub.dev from other devs using the package. It can seem minimal but it's really the basic for any open source project and library and is sufficient at this stage but more could be added later once the SDK matures, such as:\n- Number of unit tests.\n- Number of independent apps using the package.\n- Number of important projects using the package.\n- Number of external contributions (pull request, issue reporting, etc...), these metrics also prove usage and usefulness.\n\nThe library being in an alpha stage, it's too soon to have production software rely on it but we can see the progress by looking at the changelog on the provided pub.dev link: https://pub.dev/packages/cardano_wallet_sdk/changelog\n\nOn GitHub we can see that the SDK is getting some traction: some issues are reported and being addressed, people have forked the repository and 20 people have added the repo to their favorites to follow its evolution. All of these are good indicators of progress and interest.\n\nA lot remains to be done but given the low budget and very high impact it's a risk well worth taking given the proven commitment of the proposer and the indubitable impact for Cardano\u2019s dev ecosystem..\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_40", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6763, "q0": "Flutter is Google promoted technology that is likely to revolutionize mobile development with Cardano flutter SDK a is a proof of concept which has been developed by the proposer after fund five allotments.

This proposal sure has an impact on all flutter developers that want to get in the cardano ecospace and after I had a look through the sdk 'kicking the tyre' as mentioned in the docs I found the SDK really well done and intuitive to use.\nThis project is in the right category being placed in the open source developer ecosystem, since it gives back to the community in the form of an SDK which is professionally made to say the least. It shows a clear problem being solved by no relying or Rust code to do several tasks not implemented in most SDKs.\nThere are metrics for this proposal upping the numbers of likes in pub.dev which is reasonable, although the goal standing at 20 seems a bit like setting the bar low. This proposal is nonetheless not missing anything and compared to other projects, this has a signifficant advantage of already beeing made and working. The proposer has overcommited on the initial work and has put in more hours than originally planned and now he needs some funding to break even and let me assure you as a dev myself that this guy deserves it, and if we as a comunity can keep him around we will reap the benefits later on.

I found his linked in and I am really impressed of what he's able to do in such a small amount of time. Let me tell you it's impressive. Having seen already 40+ proposals this is one of the better ones because of one simple reason: the work has already been done, and the man is just asking for funding.\nI do appreciate the learning curve he's got with understanding the small funding is more likely to be funded and as each fund has more and more money to give, the projects and their requested funds will be able to grow with it. He has the right idea now to keep the funding requested low, but I urge him to keep around until we're able to afford him.\nThe budget is outlined clearly and the work that needs doing is estimated percicely and the best part is, the work is already done and asking just for retroactive funding, which is not a precedent by any means and others have done it successfuly already. I don't need to talk about the plans for the implementation as it's already done, I just need to point out as a developer, that the proposer is a realy realy experienced guy that brings a lot to the table.\nOverall the challenges he presents not having enough time is the biggest real challenge I see for this project, and I hope this gets funded.\nOverall more than feasible proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I could just end the review by linking the github repository with all the code inside.
