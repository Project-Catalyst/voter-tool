A Cardano youth program focused on transformative education is absent.", "f6_no_assessments": 4, "f6_rating": 4.333333333333333, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"q0": "The proposal aims to address the problem of school systems' lack of blockchain education. This lack of education fails to equip our youth with the necessary skills and knowledge to navigate the future of a global digital economy. The solution the proposal looks to implement is an open source model for an education program called Youth Block. This education model states that it will bring value to the Cardano ecosystem by generating business value by the team's educational model, as well as contributing back to the Cardano community by helping to onboard new users to the ecosystem. \n\nThe proposal is a perfect fit for the challenge of Open Source Development Ecosystem as the proposal is seeking to ensure that current efforts of today benefit the future of the ecosystem. With education as a pillar of the outline challenge, I am giving this section five stars because the proposal has addressed a problem, proposed a solution, and provided key metrics and goals that align with the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has an excellent roadmap broken down into five phases (10-12 months) with each phase having detailed, bullet pointed milestones. I really like the roadmap because the breakdown of what needs to be done and when it needs to be completed by is very clear.\n\nThe budget is broken down by category (project team, marketing, course creation, etc.) with a monetary figure associated with each category. I would like to see more detail with the budget as to how the proposer came to these figures. As of right now it's hard to say if these figures are reasonable because of the lack of detail. Something that could help is an hourly rate that the project team, marketing, etc. are paying themselves.\n\nThe team is comprised of three people, all with associated skills and relevant history included. Along with each project member are their links to LinkedIn for the community to verify work history. I really like how the proposer made it very easy to see who is on the team and links to verify their work. I am giving this section four stars because the detail with the timeline and the team is excellent, I just want to see more detail with the budget--address the budget section and this will be five stars.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer details plans to have dedicated google folders where the team will put presentations and progress reports. The team also plans to open discord and telegram channels for communication. I really like the level of planning to keep the community involved during the development of the proposal, however I would also like to see a plan for how often progress reports are shared--after each milestone, bi-weekly, etc.? This additional detail will close off the what, where, and when of the information sharing.\n\nTo close the proposal, the proposer ends with what success of the proposal looks like. The metrics include, helping increase the number and quality of Cardano open source projects, increase the number of contributors by onboarding the next generation, and increasing the open source tools and frameworks for the community. I think these metrics included are a bit vague and hard for the community to see if an increase in contributors is a direct result of this proposal, so I think these metrics need to be a bit more measurable. An example of something a bit more measurable could look like, \"add X amount of contributors to the ecosystem in X amount of months,\" or \"add X amount of open source tools to the Cardano ecosystem by certain date.\" I am giving this section four stars because I do like to plan for keeping the community in the loop during the development of the proposal, just rewrite the metrics of success to be measurable for the community and this will be a five star section.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1576", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 3, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The overall proposal is really well made. From the bigger project it fits in, youth web 3.0 and digital education to the specific module that is presented here, it is all a solution that fits really well into the challenge. The proposers also put a lot of effort into showing this and also showing the overall use of this project for both the participating youth and the Cardano ecosystem. Also, it is pretty clear that digital education, especially that one open source-related will lead to the creation of many new competent developers this also help with future scalability. This is without a doubt a pretty impactful proposal. The rekation both to the challenge and the SDGs are explained well and credibly.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers are quite transparent about their background (and also already well-known as credible catalyst actors. This assessment can however not just be based on their rep, but also on the proposal presented here. All of the 3 categories (Impact, Feasibility and Auditability) are explained in great detail. The implemtation plan and roadmap are well-made and fine-grained and also contain a decent contingency plan. The budget is diversified (though for the future you could even make it more fine-grained) and seems reasonable to the proposal. Overall, as a person that both knows Catalyst quite well and knows a lot about project management by profession, this seems like a very feasible and credible project plan.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The Problem description is clear, as is the proposed solution. Considering the detail it is explained in, just as the detailed roadmap, milestones, success criteria and metrics, it can be assessed that this proposal is indeed auditable.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_52", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposers want to enable the youth between 18 and 25 years of age to have a direct and open access to the cardano ecosystem and forming a community of their own as well of taking advantage of more experiance proffecionals in the community and learning directly and indirectly from them. I really like the idea of the proposal although there are a lot of questions that come to mind when thinking about the practicallity of it, but I'll discuss those in the feasibility secion. The proposal seems to me like being valid in the category it's put in, because it would create a place and environment for such a youth community to grow and then give back, through development of other open source projects or becomming the mentors they had themselves. I really love the idea and I do think it's worth pursuing. The proposals targets the problem of the current education system which is not ideal and tries to shift to the newer way of doing things - online. Having said that, I struggle to see what more does the Youth Block puts on the table relative to open source courses that other problems like Youtube, khan academy and many other offer.\nAfter reading the whole proposal twice I didn't quite understand what will be the end result after this project is funded besides creating a gitbook with links to other open source projects and a discord server trying to build a community. The proposers say they're going to provide a platofmr to discuss and voice their oppinions but no platform is specified, and I don't see an issue of just using discord as many others have already done for that speciffic reason. Apart from the gitbook I don't see anything else that isn't already available and open source.\nThe biggest benefit I see is trying to educate people of different nationalities and bringing them into the cryptoverse which is commendable and I want to give them credit for that. This I believe is the biggest impact they can have. Colaborating with other form of schools and education platforms also seems like a positive idea.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers have provided relevant links to show their credentials and I verified their individual skills and am absolutely sure they can bring more people on board of the cardano ecosystem although I'm not sure for the exact means of doing that. The phases and their specific milestones or tasks seem really vague to me. In phase 1 - 'Develop a model'. I didn't understand what model are they developing and what purpose would it serve, so I think it needs a bit more elaboration. In phase 2 - 'First entire course creation' - here I was wandering what course would that be so that it doesn't overlap with what's already out there. A course explaining how the block chain works is made many times so it wouldn't bring much value and I'm sure they had something speciffic in mind but unfortunately they haven't mentioned it in the proposal so I really don't know.\nThere's a mention about enabling the youth block community to learn from blockchain proffecionals, but there's no mention of how will they insentivise those proffesionals to actually take part in the first place or how will exactly will things workout. I really liked the idea about mentees becomming mentors over time and this seems the way to move forward considering the growth! \nThe budget is another part of the feasibility section that left me wandering. 15000$ for a project team - is that a sallary for 1 person or 5 so I can calculate the hourly rate and compare it to other projects so I can check if it's expensive or not. 5000$ for marketing, which is great but no mention of speciffic marketing tools and offers that helped them come up with that number. This logic applies for the other items from the budget breakdown as well.\nI feel like the proposers have a real good idea of what they want to achieve and the people to take part in the final result and the vision is absolutely there, but IMHO there's no answer to the question how will they get there.\nThese and more questions left me unsure on the main question I need to answer which is: is this proposal feasible? I really would suggest to the proposers to read their proposal with the eyes of a voter and see if they couldn't provide more specific and concrete information. Good luck!", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I was really hoping for some links to the mentioned future github repositories. Making an empty repository even if it's empty brings a bookmark to anyone interested in the proposal. A link to a discord or telegram would also be helpfull to curious parties. Even so the project could be auditable if the do what they plan on doing. \nThe metrics and KPIs that define the success of the proposal seem reasonable like increasing the number and quality of cardano open source project and number of contributors and such, but there's still no answer of the question 'how exactly?'.\nThe roadmap is present, but the milestones could have been a bit more specific considering. When I started reading the proposal the problem statement really resonated with me, so great work there. On the other side after reading the solution, I dind't exactly understood what the end game is. Are they building a platform? are they building a community? Both? So I was left a bit confused on the solution and if it adressed the problem.\nOverall I was left unsure if this proposal is auditable and it needs more polishing IMHO. Even so I really think there's a lot of potential and hope the proposers come back next funding round with a more concrete solutions to one single concrete problem. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "The comments made by the CA appear to be perhaps due to a lack of sufficient knowledge and understanding of the challenge, target market and sector we wish to propose our solution for.
