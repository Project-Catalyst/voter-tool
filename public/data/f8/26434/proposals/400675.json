Then we will want to strongly consider supporting this proposal. Maybe you are wondering why chain like Solana that just launched its mainnet (mind you it is still in \u201cbeta\u201d) in March 2020 enjoyed such explosive growth? It is because Solana blockchain natively written in Rust, a low-level, general-purpose language with syntax highly similar to C++ but still support concurrent and functional programming. Being highly similar with C/C++ syntax means Rust can benefit from a particularly good chunk of talent pool since C family is the third most popular language commanding at least 15% programmers or coders that can utilize it well. That and with Rust is one of the fastest growing programming languages due to its relatively better performance and security (no wonder it\u2019s the most loved language again 2021). Cardano Rosetta API used by IOG is dependent on this tool if you check the GitHub. Many current Cardano developers are utilizing this SDK as gateway reference and exploration to understand Cardano\u2019s specification better. A prompt update will ensure and maintain the performance of Cardano projects with the most minimal downtime. This proposal is a vital and essential implementation benefiting our developer community with world-class and sustainable development.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Although this proposal is not written in the most explicit way like other proposals, carefully reading it will help you obtain the standard information necessary to assess this aspect. Let me help parse it for voters. Timeline of the first implementation will be one month prior to the hardfork confirmed by IOG as the main organizer of HFC event. As of now, Vasil HFC is scheduled to be in June so we can expect the implementation to start around May and finish by June. A bit sad the budget is not broken down clearly and I am afraid this will cast some doubt in a newer/casual audience (both CA and voter) to give more blessings. Perhaps moving onto the next fund, dcSpark can mention the estimate of engineering/work hours associated with the implementation of this proposal so the general audience can have more clarity thus better understanding in this part of the aspect. Looking at the team, OG Cardano community members will be familiar with Sebs and Rob from their previous Emurgo days and present dcSpark days. To verify what the two people had been done for cardano-serialization-lib repo, copy paste the link in proposal to your web browser of choice and some elementary math and inference will show you both Sebs and Rob from dcSpark are not only two of the top contributors but also accounts for exactly 56% of the commits there from among 27 contributors (some Pareto stuff there). Still the proposer managed to mention some risk but both related to the coordination with external parties from the proposer and will have trivial effect on the final result of this proposal execution.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Keeping up with proposal standards, proposers have adequately mentioned how and what to determine success. To easily check and monitor the implementation of this proposal, regularly visit the Cardano-serialization-lib GitHub for new commits. To more easily check and monitor the implementation of this proposal, please remember when you are using your favorite dApps (e.g. wallet and DEX) smoothly and with no issues around June, it, to some extent, thanks to implementation of this proposal and you had contributed to it by rating this proposal high and voted it. Just consider this kind of tool as public facilities in your neighborhood such as parks, bus stops, etc. You don\u2019t use it all the time or might never be, but your daily life somehow connected to them and people using them to some degree. Maintaining this kind of facility surely needs some resources and please be thankful that we have Catalyst as public fund to support this kind of work and we have the capable people in communities doing it and keeping up from the beginning until now. Still, we will very much appreciate if dcSpark could elaborate future proposal in following Funds so more general audience in Cardano community with less technical knowledge or background can support their proposals to build, improve, and maintain the vital structures in Cardano infrastructure.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_943", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The Cardano-serialization-lib plays an important role for many dApps. If it is not up to date, this can have serious consequences. It is very important that the open source libraries are maintained and managed by people who are familiar with the subject. \n\nIf the lib is not kept up to date, this has a negative impact on the ecosystem. An intact lib, on the other hand, has a positive catalytic effect!\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is already familiar with the lib and working on it. Since things are always very stressful and unpredictable around a hardfork, the vague schedule is understandable, but it is expected that the team will implement their proposed updates in a timely manner. Since the workload is highly variable and depends heavily on external factors, it is understandable that the team does not provide a precise budget plan. \n\nIt is expected that the team will manage to accomplish its tasks and continue to maintain functionality for all.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The success of the project is easy to measure.

I've only heard of the babbage era which we already are in, so I'm sorry to say don't quite understand the purpose of the proposal. I understand some changes would be necessary to the cardano serialization lib but they're not specified so I don't know what would be their impact on the open source environment. My suggestion for the proposers would be to elaborate a bit more on what impact is this proposal serving by explaining in more detail (technical included) their contribution.\nI'm a bit confused as to what changes are necessary since this is not a hardfork, because if it was a hardfork I would be able to find the specification about the changes it will require like for example the alonzo had the block size limit change in it's specification.\nAs a developer, I didn't understand the comment about the last minute changes, because if IOG makes changes last minnute you would have to make the last minute changes as well, there's no way to prepare for unknown changes. If the requirements change last minute and you need to change your result to fit them, I don't see a way to prepare beforehand to do that.\nOverall this proposal left me confused and more questions poped up than were answered, so I'm unable to say if this proposal will have an impact or not.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers don't provide links to their credentials which made it hard to verify they're real contributors and had worked for emurgo as they clamed. I managed to find the dcSpark organization in linkedin and verified Sebastian who has worked for Emurgo, but I couldn't find anyone with the name Rob so unfortunately I weren't able to verify all the team members.\nThere's no mention of how many people would be working on the necessary update or the time they will need. There's no budget breakdown and I'd advise the proposers to have a look at this proposal to get an idea of how to better describe your proposal and do a budget breakdown as well as structure your proposal better, so you're better understood: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396541 This is a proposal I often give as an example from this fund round, because I believe it has all the necessary elements for an excellent proposal.\nThere isn't a timetable, team or much more information that would allow me to comment on the feasibility of the project and like the impact, I'm unable to form an oppinion.\nWhat I managed to be sure of is dcSpark is a real company with some of the mentioned members in this proposals working for them.\nOverall I wouldn't call this a feasible proposal as it lacks a lot of information and it needs more polish. I am urging the proposers to work on this proposal and come back strong for the next funding round! Good luck!", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are no links as to where a voter or any party interested would be able to follow the proggress of the implementation, but I guess you can just look at the github repo containing the cardano serialization lib owned by emurgo and check the progress there. Unfortunately there aren't any other communication channels mentioned.\nI couldn't say the problem statement is clear enough and the solution as I mentioned left me with more questions than answers. I'd ask the authors of the proposers to read their proposal again and pretend they're a voter who doesn't understand the need for what they're offering. I believe this mindset is helpfull when creating a proposal and making it as understandable as possible. Overall I think more effort needs to be put into this proposal in order for it to be better auditable and tell the interested people what to check if they want to verify your progress.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This is a proposal by the well known company dcSpark which has worked on multiple Cardano projects in the last few years, that aims to update an essential library to prepare it for the Babbage hard fork.\nThe proposers do not explicitly say how this proposal benefits the Cardano ecosystem, but based on my experience of over 7 years in the IT industry, I suspect that since this library is used by multiple DApps and wallets, it\u2019s important for their normal functioning. If it were not updated, their development would be slowed down or even blocked until someone solved this issue.\nAs a recommendation to the proposers: it would be good to mention the benefits of the proposal explicitly, for the benefit of voters and CA\u2019s and to avoid being given a low score because of the missing information as per the CA guide. \nThe proposers identified two risks: \nThat the updates to the library depend on what is changed in the hard fork and if IOG makes a last minute change, they would have to do so as well; \nThat this library belongs to EMURGO and changes to it often take weeks to be approved\nBoth of these are out of dcSpark\u2019s control and to try to mitigate them, they try their best to coordinate with the responsible parties to ensure the changes are released in a timely fashion.\nThis is basically an update to an open source library which many people in the ecosystem use, so this proposal addresses the challenge effectively. Score: 5.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers argue a timeline can\u2019t be provided here, as it depends on when IOG announces the hard fork. The rough estimation is that the work would begin 1 month before that, which sounds like it should be enough with 2 people working on it. These are Sebastien and Rob, employees of dcSpark. A link to the library\u2019s Gitbhub is provided and we can see they both are contributors there. As a recommendation here, adding the LinkedIn profiles of the specified people is a bonus, so that voters can easily put a face to the name.\nThe budget is not broken down at all, which would normally be an issue, but in this situation it\u2019s understandable in my opinion, as this will simply be development work to update a piece of code. I do think, however, that it would have been beneficial to add a rough estimation of the number of hours it would take to complete this work, based on previous instances of doing so and then adding the hourly rate Sebastien and Rob will work for. That way, it would be easier to understand the request for a 30000 USD budget.\nTo sum up, dcSpark has been delivering code in the Cardano ecosystem for a long time and I believe this proposal is likely to be implemented successfully, but there is a lot of budget information missing here, so I can score it only 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The Auditability section unfortunately offers almost no information at all, leaving us to fill in the gaps, which is not ideal. It\u2019s said that \u201cprogress will be measured as timely integration of the hard fork changes\u201d, but the essential part here is missing: how can the community check that these changes have been made? \nMy recommendation is that next time you mention here that you will post on your social media accounts when work on updating the library has started (maybe it along with a specific github commit, if applicable). This would work as a key progress indicator and allow the community to see the advancements here. Then, when the updates to the library are done and merged, share a short explanation of what changed, as is normal with semantic versioning.\nTo also make it even clearer for everyone what success looks like, mention that if all the applications that currently use that library continue functioning normally, then this proposal will have been completed successfully.\nAgain, due to the missing information, I can only give a score of 4, as the information here per se is not enough to audit the progress and success of the proposal, but I am quite certain that the community can work with dcSpark to obtain the necessary information if the proposal is funded.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_546", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "dcSpark will make the required changes to cardano-serialization-lib to update it for the Babbage hardfork", "experience": "dcSpark employees Rob and Sebastien are two of the top contributors to the cardano-serialization-lib project and are the original two developers who started the project."}
