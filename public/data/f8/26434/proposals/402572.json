The ability to consume smart contract data as reference input, without having to spend data. transactions, will be a major design upgrade for the Cardano smart contract ecosystem.\nMLabs will use its respected Cardano infrastructure engineering expertise to develop a best practice reference implementation with the Javascript SDK. It will be used to create a Cardano oracle that publishes off-chain data as CIP-31 reference input to an exemplary smart contract that consumes this data on-chain.\nThe Orcfax project will use this design model and the SDK to implement the oracle cardano. Tools and documentation will be a valuable resource in the Cardano open source ecosystem for all developers dealing with off-chain data input to cardano smart contracts.. My expert is in asset management and capital investing, and I'd be happy to contribute more thoughts to the team if the project will ever get underway.\" \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "MLABS clearly has considerable experience in the ecosystem, behind some of the biggest projects on Cardano. It would be even more helpful for the community to evaluate the proposal if MLABS could designate and highlight the relevant experience of this project person. The proposed Budget and Progress are broken down into detailed work blocks. On the technical feasibility front, the proposal explains some of the core technologies and functions for implementation. On the financial/operational front, I would suggest the proposals also include more explicitly, for example, what algorithm should be used to select the asset universe and asset weights; If it will optimize for minimal tracking error or lower risk-return rate; Who will decide the investment strategies and how to choose them. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As I mentioned in the Impact section, I believe that a passive strategy is not necessarily less volatile than the broader market, so the Placement may need some modification.
