The only problem I see is how  the team is going to keep updating and upgrading the solution when Catalyst funding end.

The proposers want to build a foundation of code for marketplaces for other developers to use in order to spin up their own, without solving the same issues all over again, and instead just reusing them. It's a great idea and as a developer myself I love such implementations, because all open source projects usually build on top of other open source projects. If implemented the project would greatly impact everyone in the cardano environment implicity for the users and directly for developers making their own marketplaces. This will bring multiplied value to the ecosystem overtime. This proposal is in the right challenge as the plan is to opensource the solution after there's at least one marketplace running on blace. The authors have done a good job of explaining the challenges they've faced but as they said the PAB should have all the marketpalce features they'd need till the time for development comes. As a developer I'm really excited to reuse code, and learn from it even if I don't plan on spining up a marketplace. I see this project scaling up easily if there's a community behind it and people start building using your solution as the bedrock. Developing tools using common code is only good if the common code is reliable. Overall a good proposal with a good idea and the impact would be fair as well. Good job and I hope this time it gets not only voted in, but funded as well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has provided all the necessary credentials and linkedin profiles and more and they have a central stage place in the https://loxeinc.com site. This bring the feasibility of the whole project up, because when people stand behind an idea and a project with their names and reputation, it means a lot and voters respond to that in my experience as a ca and vca myself.\nThe number and types of people necessary to finish the development of the common base code as well as the skills the need to have is known and present.\nThe budget is a bit steap for the plutus developer, but I don't know the running rate for them is so I deffer to the evaluation of the authors of the proposal. Other than that the budget break down is good, and hourly rates can be calculated and are well within the recommended range by the project catalyst norms.\nI was really hoping for a more detailed technical plan for implementation of the project, because as a developer I'd really be interrested in the architecture of the prject, because depending on what I read, I might want to take part and contribute in a further state of the project when it's open sourced.\nOverall I'd probably repeat myself with the previous fund assesment and say this is a great proposal that surely has a place in the funded projects and I'll be happy to vote for you!\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project development would be really hard to audit if it's open sourced once at least on project is using it, and might be implemented but open sourced after 9 months. That really is an issue for me, because even though in the end it really would be a true open sourced project, up to this point no one will be able to follow along with the progress of the development. This is not ideal and I would urge the proposers to reconsider their position and open source their project from the start.\nThe roadmap and timelines seem good although I think there's a small mistake on the 3 moth MVP which states it will be launched on the mainnet, because I think they meant it will be launched on the testnet instead and after 3 months more on the mainnet.\nKPIs and metrics seem solid and logical which is good enough for me as long as they're kept. Overall I'm not sure how auditable the project would be until it's opensourced so I'd advise to move this project to the developer ecosystem becuase it doesn't seem truly open sourced to me as it stands now.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10595, "q0": "Since this is the third attempt for this proposal to get funded, it has been very refined through many iterations. The problem is addressed accurately and concisely while the solution is elaborated well and in a highly structured manner. I think this is one of the easiest and maybe also one of the most valuable proposals to assess so far. The submission to this challenge is also precise and well-placed. Loxe Inc. also managed to outline the risk and have an appropriate response to it. Therefore, I cannot help but rate this proposal high since the fact that it could not get funded in Fund 6 and Fund 7 meant it needs more visibility to the voter and the community as a whole and can give their full blessings and not being overlooked again.

This proposal gives explicit information on what the key metrics and targets for each respective key milestone are. Although,I trust proposer intended to launch the MVP on testnet after 3 months rather than mainnet (no doubt it was an honest mistake there!). As an open-source solution, the community can conveniently track and check through GitHub such as the number of commits produced periodically. We can also easily monitor Loxe Inc.\u2019s website, teams\u2019 social media, blog posts, etc. Their choice of metrics is also sensible and in accordance with the success of the challenge and Cardano community in general.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_943", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Provide developers with a base layer marketplace functionality, so they can focus on the specifics of their products and services.", "experience": "Loxe Inc.
