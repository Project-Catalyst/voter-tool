I find this part aligns well with the challenge settings because of its versatile application.\nThe team highlights the benefits of integrating blockchain technology into the tool including Transparency, Trackability and Auditability.\nThe team did a great job at providing an example on how the system intended to work. This project is ambitious, but if it succeeds, it will lay a good foundation for furture blockchain integrated business applications", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding Feasibility, there is a timeline described although most detail is about how to prepare for the food delivery such as: establish connection with restaurants, beneficiary location or carbon credits. I suggest the team to provide more information about the development of the application.\nThe team enlists 2 separate budgets. One is $29650 will be used for operational tasks and the other is $20000 for the development. The total sum of budget breakdown exceeds the requested budget which is $31650. Perhaps the team could elaborate more on this part.\nThe team's background and experience are diverse and fit well with the project. However, they need to provide creditable source since it's difficult to verify these information when the team is located in a thirdworld country", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In terms of Auditability, the proposer provided a list of KPIs tracking data of the whole operation. Because the success metrics of the challenge are quite broad and different on case by case basis. In this case, the performance of the operation could be good indicators of a successful project. Therefore, I agree that the metrics the team mentioned are suitable. My only suggestion would be separating KPIs for operational performance and application performance.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1685", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4774, "q0": "This proposal is extremely well-written and informative, which gives a really possible solution to address this problem.

It doesn't match with the section \"Summarize your solution to the problem\".
