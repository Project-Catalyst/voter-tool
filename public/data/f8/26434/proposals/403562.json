Critical community initiatives need faster funding.", "f6_no_assessments": 6, "f6_rating": 4.944444444444445, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1898, "q0": "This proposal effectively highlights an issue closely aligned with the challenge within the Cardano Ecosystem: a lack of incentivized participation and haste within the governance process. Even though the Catalyst environment effectively addresses issues within the community through its multilayered approach to proposal funding, Catalyst Circle provides an additional community-driven medium through which funds can be made available to Cardano Open Source projects and their contributors.\n\nUpholding an open source network through funding mechanisms such as those described by this proposal increases decentralization and ensures security throughout the blockchain (i.e. prevent 51% attacks). Essentially, this would come from an increase to the growth of community-driven tools and frameworks, all of which would cater towards what the community deems necessary.\n\nAs a smart-contract developer and active participant in Catalyst\u2019s Campaign Funnel, I have found the process of pushing out funding to much needed infrastructure, libraries, and docs quite onerous. Catalyst Circle\u2019s community-fronted architecture promotes a globally impactful network through which open source development can be funded and carried out in an auditable and quick manner. However, it is important to note that scalability and sustainability may affect this proposal\u2019s impact if a lack of community participation on a consistent and increasing scale fails to support the proposal\u2019s Problem Sensing and Proposal Submission process.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It is important to first mention that Catalyst Circle is already a project in development that has several deliverables completed prior to having received any funding from Catalyst, which is a testament to its reliable structure and dedicated team.\n\nThe information about the team is well described along with their objectives, and it appropriately aligns with the proposal\u2019s open source approach as all members of the Catalyst Circle are voted in and can be taken out at the discretion of the community. The budget breakdown describes how much each group of the Catalyst Circle\u2019s will receive, and how the money will be allocated to each finance a project that provides a solution to their respective community. For me, however, I find this description to be too vague seeing as there lacks a detailed breakdown of how these finances could be paid out and remunerated within these projects.\n\nDespite this vagueness, I find the requested amount of funding to be appropriate for their three-month iteration of the Catalyst Circle seeing as all funds are being completely allocated to the community and none of the five, elected Circle members. The roadmap for this proposal is well constructed, and a complete transparency between the Catalyst Circle and the community has been achieved. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The problem this proposal is addressing is concisely described. The proposal\u2019s actions have already been very well documented through a variety of documents, videos, and images regarding the Catalyst Circle\u2019s progress through their GitHub, GitBook, and YouTube pages. Additionally, the selected metrics and KPIs are appropriate for measuring the success of the proposal as they measure the number of community members who have been funded by the Catalyst Circle\u2019s framework and the number of governance issues brought up and addressed. Finally, seeing as this proposal is intended to remain a community-driven body, it is understandable that no delivery dates are clearly defined.

Here's what you need to know as a voter: the funding takes too long for some pressing tasks. The catalyst circle people are elected, changing often and accountable. They do not take the decisions just summarizing the problems and putting them up for voting. If implemented the proposal will have a noticable impact on the speed of funding for some problem sensing in the process. These funds will be used to reward community participation in governance and can't be used by the CC members. \nI think this proposal will incentivize the less active members of the community to start contributing for a possible reward if they bring some insight or their input leads to an improved process. The proposal clearly but in a bit more words holds this statement as true. The project is in line with the challenge settings as it will give back to the community which is once of the guiding principles of open source development. As much of the work currently is done on volunteer basis, it's high time for such a proposal to come to life.\nThis is a missing part from the machinery called project catalyst and will make the engine work smoother and with more efficiency. Overall I believe it's an impactfull proposal, because for a relevantly small sum more than even people will be engaged. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I don't think the proposal of such type requires too much digging in the credentials of the people implementing it as the CC members are elected, and people know who they are if they've listened to them in the meetings and read their writen statements. Nonetheless I've gone and verified their skills and credentials anyway and they are capable as well as driven. I like the proposal lists all the number of representatives and CC members to take part in this endeavour.\nThe budget is simple and prety straightforward so nothing to remark on there although I'm not sure how they calculated that 7000 per community will be enough, but for that I deffer to their judgement. I have a suspicion that it's because of the fact the recommended budget per proposals is between 22k and 45k and the 37.5k is somewhere in the middle of that, but that's just an educated guess.\nThere's a really concrete and detailed roadmap for all the things that will be done by this proposal which makes it even more feasible than it already was. The resources used for the implementation of this project are not just listed, but have been proven to work as well, mainly catalyst-swarm gitbook.\nThe project is in sync with what's already done, and what still needs to be done, partly because that's their job in the first place so I'm not worried and I'd vote for this proposal to get the funding it needs. It's realatively small and will have a positive effect. A feasible proposal!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "One thing I'm not worried about is the auditability of the project. The members deal with auditability always and their project would make no exception. Even so there's a group of people that will asses their work nonetheless. This project has all the checkmarks like roadmap with milestones as well as good definition of success being people getting the distributed money from this proposal per valid contribution.\nThe description of the problem is reasonable, because who wants to do work unpaid even if it's a hobby such initiatives might turn into a stable job someday, so that's leading the way. The solution is prety simple but effective and nothing to think about too much. Doing only what's fair.\nOverall this is an auditable proposal so 5/5.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Provide the elected Catalyst Circle with a pool of funds for community-driven, solution-based implementations for community-stated problems.", "experience": "The Catalyst Circle are elected Community Members from the ecosystem, serving a pivotal role in turning Catalyst into the largest decentralized innovation fund in the world."}
