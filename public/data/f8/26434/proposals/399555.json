The plug-in and use feature would certainly come in handy. But I personally feel, there are many loopholes in the proposed idea. The convener makes no statement of how secure and dependable their solution can be, considering the private keys are stored on local storage. How does the team plan to gain the trust of users and how can the businesses leverage this to do secure transactions. The risks on the other hand are very blunt assuming there are far more challenges the team might face during the development of such an open-source secure application. Probably a tad bit more attention given in providing the readers regarding the aforementioned topics might shed more light on their approach.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team put together seems to be very small in size and considering the plan laid out, it's capable enough to pull it through having 20+ years of relevant experience. However, there are other areas that the proposal seems to be lacking in, such as a detailed plan and a possible time-line at which deliverables can be observed. However, the fund requested is about 10k which is a very small chunk of the fund allocated, hence considering the influence a project of this caliber can bring to the ecosystem, in making the payments free of private keys and easy for users who are oblivious to the essence of Cardano or blockchain, I feel the community can throw them a rope and see where the team reaches in their expedition.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Although the project seems intriguing in a unique way, I feel the proposer could have given the community better verifiable metrics than the usual achieving milestone KPIs. The auditability section clearly needs some work and makes sure that the metrics are aligned to the challenge's requirements. The number of users using their tech, number of businesses incorporating their plug-in payment feature, number of monthly users and transactions...etc could have added more insights to the success of the project and made the audit process more straightforward. It's pretty unclear if the milestones set are deliverables or research that brings back the team with evidence for the further funding rounds. With this proposal being a completely new one, the community would expect a long-term view and future plans so that the team can build trust within the community and the voters.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 4054, "q0": "The proposal is well structured and briefly written but still provides enough information on the impact of this project. As I can understand, this tool is quite simple and useful for people who are willing to use the dApp services but have a little trouble with the cryptocurrencies. Sometimes the process of developing mobile apps can be difficult and hard to be delivered successfully. Since developers can get access and change it to meet their application demand, they are motivated to easily build mobile dApps and take time to increase the quality of Cardano Opening Source Projects. After all, I believe that this proposal has given simple and effective solution to the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is a brief and concise timeline for this project. The process mainly happens in May and June and important tasks are provided during this time. They also mentioned a logical and sensible amount of money for the project.

The proposed solution is provided however, it is quite general as the reader could not understand what is the detailed plan, therefore, it could be better if there is more information about the in-app wallet integration library. Moreover, the solution is good but it does not really meet the challenge and the key metrics are not provided in this part, even it is mentioned a little in the proposal but overall it is too short and general. If the key metrics are listed, the reader would easily understand the content of the proposal. The risk of the project better goes straight to the main point as it will show the difficulties and the problems the proposal face.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The timeline and the plan are in the proposal however; it seems not very clear as the time provided in only in May and June so if the timeline is more specific, such as it can be divided into weeks, and days, it would easier to follow the process of the project. The budget plan is quite clear, but it makes me misunderstand the first time I read it so if you could clarify the number more specifically such as the numbers $3000 and $1000 can be explained in more detail. Also, the requested fund is $10000 but the detailed budget plan did not match with the number mentioned before, this feature makes the readers confused so if you have plan of the rest budget, please go into detail and list in the proposal. The team member is relevant to the requirements of the project but if you could mention the name of the members and positions as long as their experience, there would be more evidence to get good points. In case there is any documents or certificates, please plus in the proposal. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The good point is that the number of successfully executed tests. But there is another advantage if the proposal mention how successful the project would be such as any numbers of traffic or the increasing of users and so on because the reader can imagine how is the proposal progress.

In comparison to the existing methods listed in the proposal, it will be extremely convenient. However, it would be fantastic if you could include certain risks for users of this mobile in-app wallet. I believe the security risk is the first consideration for people when deciding whether or not to use a mobile wallet. Because open source software is so widely used, one security flaw might lead to plenty of others, affecting a large number of people. Of course, identifying these risks will take a significant amount of time, and you are concerned that you will not be able to deliver your proposal on time.

I believe you should be more specific in this\u00a0two months about how you plan to spend the budget ($3000) on each task. The budget may be set, but the time appears to be limited, so I am not sure if the time you spend developing and testing the app will be used up or not, and how the budget will change or rise. To summarize, I will need a discussion about the budget's sufficiency ($3000 Plus $1000) in order to make a significant impact.

I do not see any milestones or the road-map you mentioned, so it would be great if you could add them so I can check the project's auditability.
