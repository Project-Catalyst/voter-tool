The generated funds should then be invested in a facility for algaes and some kind of collaboration with other SDG-focused companies. The idea of building an open-source version of ecoisa is a good idea but has no direct benefit for the Cardano-ecosystem. It is correct, that some entities in the Cardano ecosystem could use that version of ecosia, and maybe would, but I don\u2019t understand how that investment would really benefit the Cardano-community. As far as I understand it, the generated funds would mainly flow into the personal algae project of the proposer. I don\u2019t mind the fact, that the proposer would generate income this way, but it also should benefit Cardano to get a high rating in the impact-category. The proposer mentions a possible integration of a \u201ctrack & verify layer via the Cardano ledger\u201d, but this seems not be in the very detailed timeline. He also mentions \u201cgamification with NFT-achievements\u201d, but this is also not in the timeline and there is no further elaboration on the topic. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer has an not an technical background, nonetheless the steps required to develop the oss-variant of ecosia are very detailed. The proposer gives a good timeline and also includes a buffer of 15% to his estimates with looks reasonable at first glance. In my opinion the time to develop the proposed software is still vastly underestimated, but mentions minor details (like the about-us-page). Additionally, there are some things in the timeline which are not understandable e.g.: What exactly is the \u201cseaweed and decarbonization-algorithm and endpoint\u201d? The proposers mention the risk of \u201cattracting not enough prosumers to engage with the search engine\u201d. This is indeed a major risk and there is no solution mentioned to this problem. The proposer has a network and involvement in other projects (which he could use), but I don\u2019t understand how the proposer hopes to generate enough traffic to make the algae production facility sustainable. I would suggest adding a marketing strategy and a marketing budget, or at least a timeline for the marketing to the proposal. According to the roadmap the technical development of the project will be completed in September. He also expects to generate enough income directly after that \u2013 which does not them to be realistic. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In general the proposal is not very understandable and it seems to be a combination between a very technical description and steps of building a very specific thing and on the other side a broad vision about algae and SDG. The interlocking between both parts is hard to understand. From the audibility perspective the checkboxes are all checked (progress publicly visible), but also leaves a bit of confusion e.g. \u201cdaily standups\u201d. In general, the proposal leaves a lot of questions open (search engine integration, inner workings of the ad-model, revenue expected from each ad, required amount to make it sustainable, \u2026), while others (how much time is needed to setup a git repo) are too detailed.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1184", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3475, "q0": "The proposal mentioned  on their aims to solve the biosphere through enhancing the search engine to find fund for tree planting.

So, adding information on it will increase the relevance of this proposal. \nRegarding to how proposed solutions will address the challenge, the proposer already mentioned shortly on how the project contribute to solve the challenges. In addition, how it works particularly in OS is mentioned as well. However, there were no KPIs/Metrics in the solution, so, the proposer can add this information in detailed to make it be understandable. \nAssumption on risks is considered briefly by the proposer.

However, it is better to breakdown more about concreted indicators on how to check the outcome, in both quantitative and qualitative detail.

They are clear on what they need to achieve when the project completes. However, if writing them in more detailed, it will let all readers catch easier. \nThere was no information on whether this proposal is a continuation of a previously funded project or entirely new ones.

The most crucial element for the Impact section is to illustrate the outcome as well as the audience that the project is aimed at. However, I was unable to determine the possible audience they are targeting for. They just introduced Ecosia, a search engine established by a purpose corporation that invests all income with the aim of planting trees and contains several features. Furthermore, the project's ambition to establish a track & verify layer via the Cardano ledger makes it difficult for me to fathom what the ecosystem will have if this project starts construction. The proposer, in particular, has anticipated two significant problems that would have a huge impact on the project's success but for which no solutions are available. To mitigate the danger of not finding enough consumers, the proposer can seek assistance from social networks or media, which is inexpensive and partially solves the problem. Concerning the difficulty of finding developers, the project might attempt the search approach on sites such as Linkedin, where the activities of notable developers in a variety of sectors are engaged.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "A plan implemented in 5 months is given quite specifically and detailed. With 4 stages, I believe just by following what is mentioned here, the project will minimize the delay or failure to meet the deadline. In addition, in general, the budget is quite detailed, calculated by the working day of the employee, but it seems that the way the proposer expresses it is a bit difficult to accurately evaluate. So try including hours or days for each activity to come up with the most appropriate cost. Also, I don't see any associated profiles for the team member descriptions, simply their names and positions. This will cause investors to evaluate whether the staff is suitable for the purpose of the project or not and does not make an impression on the evaluators. Therefore, it is better to add a profile soon or describe a little about the experience or qualifications that the employee has.

Progress is evaluated on a monthly and weekly basis, which is typically in line with what the proposer aims to achieve with this project.

Basically the proposers want to, as far as I understand, to duplicate what ecosia is doing but to make it fully open source. Let me start of by saying that's a great idea and I really hope they make it, but I think the creators of the proposal might be mislead on how ecosia actually works. I'll touch on that in the feasibility section so for now I'll assume that everything is up and running and move on.\nAnother thing that I turned my attention to is the lack of explanation on how exactly will this project be related to the cardano ecosystem. There's only one sentance in the whole project that is \"implementing a track & verify layer via the Cardano ledger is a very nice to have.\", which sounds a bit vague and I really struggle to understand what exactly will be tracked and verified? It really looks like a good idea, but I don't see the relation to the cardano ecosystem and as the proposal stands right now it looks like a regular project looking for funding having nothing to do with cardano.\nThe proposal is missing a few important details like, technical implementation and a team, a large at that to build a platform like ecosia, a detailed realistic roadmap, because the one right now is impossible to deliver by a single developer.\nThe only part that fits in the challenge settings is the fact the project is open source so it's very hard for me to agree with the impact or alignment with the challenge on just one criteria.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I managed to find the linkedin profile of the Aramen CEO UGO LO ROCCO and his credentials and skillset are focused on sales (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ugo-lo-rocco-74810363/). The other mentioned team member \"Dan\" I guess is the submitter of the proposal Dan Verowski who I found on linkedin as well (https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-v-89120511/details/experience/). And a developer who they haven't found yet which is fine.\nDan and Ugo might have missunderstood how ecosia works, because it's based on bing (fact), but it's not a proxy to bing it's a real search engine which is developed over the years of a team of 20+ people and I'm not sure you can just proxy the results by google and bing and call it your own search engine. Having said that, building a search engine on top of bing is no easy task and not a task for a single developer and definitely not for 3 to 6 months.\nI see from the breakdown of the roadmap there's an item that states \"Proxy to external API (Bing or other) simple search | 3\", 3 meaning 3 days. With bing you can pay for what you use, but I don't see anything mentioned in your proposal about starting capital for fuding the searches.\nOverall I think it's a good idea, but it's not really feasible. I wish you all the best and hope you come back with fresh ideas or a subset of what you already have in mind in the next fund.
