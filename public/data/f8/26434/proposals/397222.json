The idea of the proposer is mentioned clearly by how the application works to support the clients, its benefit to customers and beneficiaries identification. The explanation is clear and understandable for all readers to see how relevance of the proposal to address the challenges. \nOne point I would like to deduct from the proposal is the unclear KPIs/ Key metrics to measure the achievements of this project. Although the proposal was explained clearly in how the solution will address the challenges, it is better to add quantitative and qualitative metrics to ensure the suitability of the proposal. \nThe main challenge was mentioned in the proposal, with imagination about things might happened and the deep understanding of the proposer\u2019s strengths. However, it is better to add more information on how they will solve the challenge if it happened through the mentioned hereabove on their strengths.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Tentative human resource was put in the proposal. The function of members was allocated by the proposer. However, in case of such this short information, it will be hard for audience to imagine how this team works with their expertise.

One good point of this proposer is the consideration for not only this project but also in long terms, tentative budget needed is mentioned as well. \nTimeline is considered in the year 2022 and 10-year plan. For quarterly planning, the proposer already thinks about what will be the goals, who they need and how long it will take.

Outcomes for each activities is there, it is not really practical when having no clear target. It lacks of quantitative data, which can make the indicator be stronger and persuasive. The proposer can add more information on not only technical matter but also regarding to number of users and concrete expectation for each period. \nRegarding to the end picture of the project, it was considered well by the proposer. It tends to be achieved when beneficiaries from the proposal as well as from the Cardano ecosystem can gain benefits. In case of the ending picture go beyond the project and contribute strongly to the ecosystem, it will be worth for all people to try the application. \nSo far, there was no information on whether this proposal is a continuation of a previously funded project or entirely new ones.

From my understanding, this project aims to help ADA reward holders receive an amount of fiat from generating their rewards throughout the existence of Cardano from some time period in the past. I believe this project can bring a lot of advantages when it comes to saving taxes and earning more profits. Since it gives holders active controllation of their ADA rewards, they can convert them at any time that they want and earn more money from the price gaps over the years. This can help increase users' experience on Cardano based on its convenience. Having such great utilities in the financial field, it can attract more contributors joining in the ecosystem.

I don't see this having much of an impact on adoption but I do think this is an extremely innovative tool that would increase user experience for all Cardano users across 40 different countries (which I assume also means various languages). The product could pretty reliably be produced because they've done it before for other blockchains. The presentation here looks kind of nice but their website is pretty underwhelming. It's extremely simple and doesn't appear like much work was put into it. In trying to figure out how to use the product they've built on other blockchains, I've found that it appears to require some technical knowledge to implement and utilize it. This is a barrier to entry that decreases the overall impact potential that this product can have. I'm not convinced this is an investment worth $250k. I think that money could be put to much better use elsewhere. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "This roadmap is kind of messy. I'm actually not sure it's really a roadmap. It might be more of an explanation of how their product is implimented. I would like to see dates of when the product would be live, what the marketing strategy is, and how many users they are aiming for. This would give us more tangible goals that can show us how well the money is being spent and what we're getting for it (in terms of product). When we get to the development team's experience, there's not much to point out. I think they have plenty of experience to produce what they propose here. The budget is where I have some problems. I very much appreciate that they laid out what they would be paying their developers per hour. This saves me some time. However, I very much disagree with the planned salaries. They propose $52/hr to match the $43-$55 salaries paid in one of the biggest tech hotspots in the world (California). My problem is that matching corporate salaries backed by $100b+ a year in revenue is inconsistent with Catalyst. The philosophy of Catalyst is supposed to be to \"generate the highest levels of community innovation\" and we \"can achieve significantly more than working on initiatives in a centralized fashion.\" Many other catalyst proposals I've seen aim to pay their developers closer to $30/hour, which I think demonstrates genuine care for driving forward Cardano. While I expect companies to pay their employees what they are appropriately worth, I think that money should be coming from the company's wallet. Catalyst should be aiming to generate the most innovation as efficiently as possible, not to compete with the corporate world. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "When I look at the auditability section of a proposal, I'm looking for how the project is aiming to make a real difference. That impact is more often facilitated by the use of the product, not the completion of a product. A completed ship is of great accomplishment and potential but if there's nobody to sail it, it will float aimlessly into the ocean. That's why I find it important to include post-launch KPIs that are being paid attention to and quantifiable metrics to measure success. I want to see goals for a specific number of users and stats on user activity. That would be a better definition of success.

The major portion of this budgeting is coming for engineering hours, understandably so. The hourly rates are based upon the location where the team is located (in California) which from my own experience as developer I know is standard rates for developers. \n\nThe tech stack used (as can be seen from the github repositories links) along with the flow diagrams linked in the proposal is based on javascript/NodeJs (both APIs and App) which fulfills the feasibility metric of explaining the architecture/tech stack used for this proposal.\n\nThe risk/challenges section covers the details upon the potential challenges of differentiating among the delegator vs block rewards, to which team has already laid out the infrastructure to successfully build and finish this proposal implementation. The additional details of basis accounting and its role in the 21st century is out of context in my opinion, and should have been of the similar format of what risk this detail points to.

This surely is a missing piece in the current cardano ecosystem. I was looking for such a tool 3 or 4 months ago to help me with the accounting part of things, but to no avail. I had to do everything manually. And let me tell you, different exchanges provide very different and unstandardized information about the trades and exchanges you've done let alone the information about the staking you've done if you've done it for example through binance.\nI will be glad to test out this application and continiously use it if it turns out to be all that is described to be. The proposers clearly articulate the value they would bring if this proposal is implemented and I really like the fact they have been developing it for some time now and they are also fighting for legislation because this is the way for cardano to really grow, even when regulated.\nThe key metrics seem legit for this kind of proposal and it's nice that there's a big team to work on this, because it's a lot of work. As a developer myself I'll be curious to follow along with the progress of the implementation. Most of the solution is implemented in javascript and pything which are friendlyer compared to haskel.\nI appreciated the challenges section, becasue the team realizes that the road ahead might be difficult, but are prepared to overcome the hurdles even so and seem to have a good plan of action. I don't see any big part missing in this proposal and seems to be quite well rounded.

The proposers have a clear view of the number and type of people they will need to finish the project and implement the proposal to the fullest.\nBudget has a good breakdown at least regarding the sallaries, but some of the other topics are a bit vague regarding the Marketing costs and the infrastructure plan concerning the used hardware which is a bit of a letdown, because they could have also shown a succinct version of the research they've done there like they've done for the developer salaries.\nAs a developer having seen the project progress in the github repo, I trust the provided timeline is enough to complete the promissed tasks on time. I was itching to read a bit more about the technical implementation, but I suppose reading the code will have to do for now. There are some really interesting resources linked showing the difference in staking and time of addition.\nAs I mentioned valid challenges are considered and valid solutions are provided for each one although there's not much you can do about regulation apart from the legislation they're already doing. \nOverall I really like this proposal and believe it feasible and should be implemented.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The moment I saw a github repository, there's no doubt in my mind the project is auditable, because anyone interested would be able to follow along the progress of the work in the repository as I'm planning on doing if the proposal gets funded.

Number of contributors to the project and some other metrics. \nAs far as KPIs unfortunately I didn't see any specific numbers except deadlines, which is something, but I expected a lot more on that account.
