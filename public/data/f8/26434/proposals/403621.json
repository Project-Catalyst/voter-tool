The assessor suggests a product development workflow will stifle innovation and equality yet fails to give sufficient reasons. A product development workflow can be used in parallel with a messier approach. Catalyst / Cardano contributors benefit from having structured approaches to solving problems. They are not prevented from also doing simpler approaches for areas where that makes sense, and also for other projects making proposals they can also do any approach they see fit. In terms of equality how does having a product development workflow reduce equality? It is hard to agree there is any merit to this statement without sufficient logic or evidence to support it. The assessor states: 'The Open Source Developer Ecosystem is about encouraging experts to collaborate and share their knowledge and by giving more funding to community members already firmly established in the community and funded previously, to get paid for what their peers have been doing for free or as part of small community projects, and be rewarded not just with substantial funding, but also a role to set challenges and define workflows top-down is going in the wrong direction of the spirit of open source collaboration.' The assessor suggests that community members who are already firmly part of the process getting more funding is going in the wrong direction. This is an unfair statement with flawed rationale, anyone doing significant work should be able to apply to receive funding for that work. Stating that other people have been doing anything for free, which even if true, is not good merit for not funding people for doing work that brings value to the ecosystem. The statement is ludicrous and even insulting to the people who are trying to make positive changes to the ecosystem. This proposal and the co-proposers involved does not mean producing a new role where we have any power over the community. This is simply a false statement. We will be proposing solutions for contributors to use that they can from the start and then migrate away from if they so wish. The assessor states: 'but the delivery is misguided and the community should create its central tools by processes other than funding by Voter App'. How is the delivery misguided? When the assessor says 'the community' who are they referring to, the proposers are part of the community and also have clearly stated we will be getting feedback from the community at every stage. Also what processes should we get funding outside of the voting app? If we went straight to IOG for funding this goes against the democratic voting process that we're all trying to help build. The statements made by the assessor here are not factual and does not reflect the reality of what has been proposed. Feasability - The assessor states: '2 relatively inexperienced core members of PACE who are conventional web developers without experience in business processes and complex systems would be qualified to run a 1000 hour project with all these incredibly busy partners and co-proposers'. The statement is untrue, only one of us is a web/mobile developer. Being a developer is highly relevant to this task of product development workflow as this proposal is for solutions that a developer, product or design professional would have used within their profession. Also a 1000 hour project is not large, if 5 people worked 40 hours weeks for 5 weeks that is the entire project completed. The assessor suggests this is a large project which it is not based upon the hours and budget requested. This time breakdown is an example of course and instead those hours would be spread out over multiple months as outlined in the proposal. To suggest this is a highly complex proposal is not accurate for the scope that is highlighted. To say the team doesn't have capacity for this is also not a fair reflection of reality - the proposal team can each spend more or less time on a weekly basis. As well as this naturally some members will have more time spent contributing than others. The assessor states 'examples of what the project is supposed to deliver in practical examples'. The proposal clearly states the outcome will be the analysis that leads to an initial solution for contributors to use when that initiative gets funding. Auditability - The assessor states: 'no reference to earlier milestones and roadmap.' The feasibility section states 980 hours within a 3 month time frame and it is also made clear that it will be available in a public Gitbook similar to the other examples given that will be open source and free to copy. The assessor states: 'It is unclear what is meant by \"6 month term\" as this may blur the line between elected activity of some of the co-proposers in the Catalyst Circle that would be remunerated separately, and the funded proposal which should be structured like a free-wheeling startup with deadlines and milestones, which is sadly omitted, or at least very unclear.' This is an unfair statement as ahead of time the members involved do not have to make a hourly commitment per week as in some weeks they may do more and other do less - the only important part is the proposal that is presented gets executed against the budget that has been provided by the people involved. Just using the hours provided it is clear that this proposal does not mean any member will need to be full time so does not conflict with Catalyst Circle commitments by those involved. The assessor states: 'One can only assume that behind words like \"governance decisions\" and \"product development workflows\" lies concealed a quagmire of Zoom conferences and Miro boards that will not bring structure to Open Source projects as large as the sum of all Project Catalyst projects.' This is an ungrounded and unfair assumption and opinion of the assessor on the outcome of this proposal. Overall the assessor has made multiple unfair and ungrounded statements regarding the proposal, team members involved and availability of those team members to execute this proposal. The assessor has also made false statements that this proposal will stifle innovation and reduce equality which is not the case as the proposals execution doesn't prevent alternative options for contributors and other projects to consider and adopt."}, {"q0": "This proposal aims to establish a product development workflow and governance process that the Catalyst and Cardano contributors can use in the future. This is an extremely challenging objective due to the fact that governance mechanisms are complex, intricate, difficult to analyze, map, understand but most importantly change for the better, and you are always running the risk of unintended consequences. \n\nNevertheless this is a painful but useful process that every emerging governance system has to go through, and I believe that the long term added value of successfully implementing this project greatly outweighs its costs. This project has my full support in terms of impact.  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "You can\u2019t ask for a better team to run this project. All of the people involved are veteran Cardano / Catalyst members with an exquisite mix of competencies between all of them, and I place great trust in their capacity to deliver.

As such it will be one of many resources for the community, designed and created from different point of view. \n\nThe differentiator, the salient point, is that this resource is expected to be created by contributors, chosen by vote, getting paid as full time contributors to work in the Catalyst and Cardano ecosystem. And that will set the work product off from others. Not replace, just differentiate. We are still in early days. Solutions to the objectives we all seek require serious, extended full time thought and effort. Catalyst is already some distance in its march to the future of governance. The right time to produce thoughtful, community driven guidance. Full time, paid effort is necessary.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is one that will be useful for the community.

If I understand correctly by this part of the proposal. \n\n\"\u2018A growing number of experts join forces (selected by vote - not the co-proposers) to build collaboratively on community owned infrastructure, tooling, standards, libraries and docs\u2019.\n\nand \n\n\"The analysis will be shared across the community for feedback to ensure the benefits of it are shared and improved upon as it evolves.

Another benefit will be pushing for all project developments to be public so the teams are accountable infront of the voters that implicitly funded their proposal. Up to this point I've really found that to be the biggest issue while figuring out if a project you've voted for is actually doing development. If the project is open source, for me as a developer the easiest thing to do is go to the github repository and check on the progress, but for some of the other projects I find it more difficult to find a place to track the progress. I'd like to offer my suggestion from the CA perspective that I'd really like for the process to involve a singular place where I can find all funded proposals and a place to track their progress being a discord server link or a project document or an update video. Again as a developer an RSS feed would be prefferable.\nThis proposal is sure to bring a lot of value through structure for the whole environment and I really hope it gets funded. It's perfectly in alignment with the challenge setting working towards the community good and giving back. Also such a process would enable people starting fulltime for cardano projects. The key metrics are on point and I see them as valid for what they're trying to accomplish. This sure is a problem and a sore spot in the curren process, because I had some trouble figuring out the ropes, and these proposers were the people who helped me understand the environment and what might my place in it be.\nI don't have any concerns about this proposal and I don't see anything missing from the proposal. It's really well through out and executed. Good luck, I'll be voting for it!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I didn't have to search for the teams' credentials because I know each one of them since they're beacons in the cardano and catalyst communities. You can see them in almost every town hall and you can follow their success through their already funded proposals in previous funds. They bring a lot of credibility to each new project they take part of and I believe this project wouldn't be any different. \nThe budget breakdown has a lot of merit behind it and there's a clear and understandable hourly rate in keeping with the cardano recommendations and guidelines.\nI especially like the plan for imaplemntation. It's follows logical steps of gathering data and trasforming that data into usefull information and into advice or rules or restricments for the projects ahead to use and hit the ground running. The plan for implementation seems to have a really good cost to value ratio and if I was an investor I'd happily invest in such a venture for the good of the whole environment and development ecosystem. Having developers seeing cardano as a stable and continious work opportunity would bring a lot more people to this space and this project would help reach that state.\nExplanation of the whole project is very detailed and backed up by experience and data, which I do appreciate as a developer.
