The Quadratic Voting Funding element has to do with how donations to a crowdsourced funding platform are \"assembled\" into actual funds for projects.  For example, typically funds are \"matched\" in these protocols...individual donors are matched with large grant donations (perhaps Catalyst in this example) based on community \"voting\".  If a community provides 100 donations of a $1 for a given project, this is considered \"weightier\" than if a single donation of $100 was received.  The end result would be that the \"weightier\" projects are apportioned a larger share of the matching funds, increasing their value, in theory, quadratically to perceived value.  So to start with we can understand this proposal as a crowdfunding DeFi platform with a \"Quadratic Voting Funding\" protocol that we can assume will curate the most valuable projects in the eyes of the voting community.  From there, the proposal is a bit of a dog's breakfast:  DIDs and eLearning are noted as critical infrastructure, but it is unclear what role they play.  In addition it is clear that a DAO will be critical to implementation, though it is implied that this step will come later.  As the DAO establishes the governance of whatever token or DIDs underlies the funding mechanism for the crowdsourcing it perhaps should be rolled out much earlier.  The team did address some of these concerns, and noted that the DID rollout is part of another Fund8 proposal and that they are a key element in preventing Sybil attacks on the Quadratic voting mechanism.  This is a key anticipatory insight, as Sybil attacks are an ongoing bounty within the GitCoin model, which does not have DID infrastructure.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Overlooking the clarity of execution, this is a team that is ideally suited to straddle the ideas presented here.  On the one hand Kenric is a great choice for managing the margins of this endeavor wheer the DID and Quadratic methods reside and keeping it on track, while Ninh is a perfect fit for the networking, positive collaboration component, as evidenced by his onboarding of contributors almost faster than they could volunteer.  The only risk going forward from that perspective is keeping all the different innovations in their lane and working toward a common purpose.  The funding budget is substantial, but is very heavily weighted to the development side with 8 core members assigned to the stack.  There does seem to be an oversight for the line item labeled \"Cardano Gas-fees Budget: $24,000.00\".  Firstly, gas is terminology typically related to Ethereum, not Cardano.  Secondly, devoting an entire quarter of a 100k budget to fees might be reasonable  for Ethereum, but on Cardano, such outlays aren't necessary.  It is, in fact, one of the main reasons to develop on Cardano.  This feels like a line item for an imported proposal from Ethereum, and it should be excised from this proposal, making this proposal far more competitive.  To the degree that all the suggested deliverables are on the roadmap:  Quadratic Voting system, DeFi crowdfunding platform, eLearning integration with Snapbrillia, reputation system with DIDs, and a governance DAO, this project will definitely be a heavy lift, but the team is expansive, and expanding. They indicate that a major part of their project will begin with collaboration and bringing in solutions that are already complete or underway (the DID is an especially low-hanging fruit here, given what is developing elsewhere in Funds 7 and 8), and they were quite noticeable in reaching out to collaborators throughout the proposal process, so there is definitely a possibility for success here.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The milestones, as listed, are all considered open source, and are to committed to Github as they come up, however, the timeline provided in the proposal is very broad, listing a single task for the first 3 months \"Quadratic voting system\".  If collaboration is going to be as large of a commitment as is indicated here, then it would be nice to see what they hope to onboard during that initial timeline.  It doesn't have to be specific solutions, but something is filling up that first quarter, and some idea of what was occurring would be helpful.  It would probably help the proposal team to actually outline what all the steps of creating a Quadratic voting system would be:  how much time for research, how much time to capture what exists and establish cross-pollination and collaboration...what exactly has been delivered when that first phase has been completed?  The second phase, which includes the DeFi rollout and the DAO over the next quarter is laid out a bit clearer, and is where the bulk of the work lies.  At that point I expect the project to come into its own, both in terms of feasibility and auditability, as that should leverage the developer heavy team and take advantage of whatever collaboration they have lined up. This one feels like a slow-starting, hot-finish type of project that has a truly ambitious goal, but may have trouble getting multiple projects into alignment to pull it off.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 5, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Thank you so much for taking the time to review our proposal!

As a developer I can positively assure voters that there's a huge difference between profecionals that have already done something, and another competitor that just has an idea and starts to work toward it's implementation. Both have pros and cons ofcourse, but specifiacally for the cardano ecosystem which is moving steady and safe the big organization is the way to go. Because of reasons beyond skills and manpower, but collaboration and better project time management.\nThe proposal will definitely have an impact over the ecosystem and over the future of the funded proposals, so the proposers did a great job pitching their worth articulating how they could add value to the ecosystem.\nAnother thing that makes me be confident in their ability is the openness for colaboration and experience with such type of funding. I don't see anything missing from this proposal so I'd recommend you giving it a look if you have the time to read it.The only question left to ask is where do I sign up to help with contributions and they have discord and telegram channels for that.

One thing I have as a suggestion is to have a better breakdown of the budget specifically for the gas fees. While 24 000$ is the normal kind of budget for bitcoin and ethereum, I'd argue that it's too much for cardano, where the gas fees are considerably smaller. I do appreciate they have made some calculation based on their previous growth, but I didn't find that calculation anywhere in the provided resources. \nHaving said that all other aspects of the proposal are up to par with the best of them. There's a realistic and reasonable timetable to complete all the work specified in the proposal as well as funding to do it. The technical aspects are more then well explained and described unlike many other proposals which gives them credibility in my eyes. More of the explanation focuses not only on what will be done, but how as well. There's a plethora of technologies already supported and they're proposing to add marlowe and plutus as well, which is great, because the cardano ecosystem will be able to take advantage of what's already implemented in their platform.\nThere's a clear explanation of the problem and the solution offered by this team. The project is in sync with what's already being done and are open for collaboration with similar project so no double work is done if not necessary. Good work and I think this proposal is more than feasible and will probably get made if the proposal is voted in.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I do appreciate the telegram and discord and the information provided on their site, but I really would like to look directly at the development of the code. The only place where github was mentioned was for QuadraticVoting and funding, as well as \"Practical Resume and Credentials\" which sounds like we the developers won't be able to look at the actual implementation of the platform. This is not necessary a bad thing, but it does make me wander if this project wouldn't find a better match in the Developer Ecosystem challenge, but that's not to say it wouldn't be a fit here in the open-source developer ecosystem as well.\nOther than that I think the project will be auditable for anyone willing to follow along with the regulated channels of communication and not look at the actual code of the platform.\nThe roadmap with milestones are well segregated and entirely doable and I really appreciate the effor the team made of doing this proposal like a business plan more than a simple proposal for funding and it shows proffecionalism! \nOverall a more than feasible proposal.

The proposal plans to bring Gitcoin to Cardano, first part of which is Quadratic voting and it is explained well by proposer in the comments section that they are rewriting the implementation from EVM to Cardano (Haskell, plutus, Marlowe). As a senior developer myself, I have used plenty of open source projects both in my personal and professional career. We in the Cardano ecosystem have limited budgets for a variety of challenge areas, out of which (at least at present and until a few years from now) the open source development ecosystem is one of the most important ones. \n\nWe are in high need for a self-sustaining ecosystem where developers/engineers/tech enthusiasts can come over and build. One of the big problems right now is that many good open source projects just are not well maintained because of no good work to reward ratio, an example is that recently an author of well known JS libraries (color/faker.js) decided to push intentionally corrupt code as he was not happy with Fortune 500 companies using his libraries but never receiving any reward for the work that he is done. Clearly, I am not supporting such behavior, but in essence it is frustrating for many good developers who spend countless hours providing free solutions to the problems that most of the engineering teams eventually face. \n\nThis proposal, if funded, will bring in the quadratic voting system (which was initially proposed by Vitalik in Ethereum space) to Cardano, making this system a self-sustaining system where contributors can be rewarded in a transparent and decentralized manner.\n\nThe proposal describes how quadratic funding works in a well articulated manner, with all the public links in place. It also provides links supporting the claims that the demand of engineers is very high but often challenging to find and hire them. In a more remote working friendly world, we really need the ability to remove any location dependencies and bring in the engineers together across the globe. This proposal's successful implementation perfectly aligns with multiple guiding questions of challenge settings, e.g. sustainable ecosystem while engineers can share knowledge and efforts, reusable engineering solutions, and a transparent reward scheme will definitely drive experts to collaborate and share their knowledge. \n\nTherefore full points from my side to the impact of this proposal.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal outlines the team details behind the company Snapbrillia in a detailed fashion. As an Architect/Senior Developer myself I am very confident with the multi dimensional expertise of the proposal team. The links and technical skills of the team are public and I can confirm that they own the experience that would be needed to fulfill this proposal implementation. Other than having technical and leadership expertise, the company also has good dedicated product management, marketing and branding teams. This is very important to fulfill the long term vision of this proposal, as mentioned in the KPI section.  The proposal has clearly laid out the risks associated with implementation of this proposal but given the strong foundations of the team I am very positive that they will keep those risks in mind during the entire implementation phases. \n\nBudget allocation not only clearly mentions why they need 5 web2 and 4 web 3 developers, as they have to hire additional senior developers, but also have done their homework on Cardano gas fee calculations (based on the GitCoin historical data from Ethereum - can be seen in comments on how they reached the gas fee number on Cardano). From my own experience as Senior developer in both Asia and Europe, the developer rates are justified. The timelines are clearly articulated in Q1 and Q2, as explained well by the proposer the testnet for quadratic voting is planned by Q1 on testnet, and mainnet in Q2. The CEO of the proposal team himself has experience from the tech giants such as Google, FB, Amazon and it is clearly visible in the streamlined proposal details.\n\nOne thing although could have been included, if the team thinks that additional funding might be required, and if so then what are their plans to achieve that additional funding ? Usually such proposals tend to be complex and may require more manpower if an unforeseen set of problems pop up during the implementation phase. Nevertheless, given the qualification of the team and experience I am in full agreement that this proposal has a very high probability of being successfully implemented. Hence, I strongly agree.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap and milestones per quarter are split well in terms of what functionalities the community can expect. Furthermore, these milestones are then mapped to how they will fulfill the progress and success of the project.

Moreover, the success of the project will be based on whether the project fulfilled the vision of a transparent and secure quadratic funding platform. This, however, is also linked with the On-chain practical resume and credential service for Decentralized identity solution tied together with Decentralized e-Learning platform, which is another proposal proposed by the same team. \n\nMore often than not, such complex projects require parallel development to fulfill the overall vision of the team. This proposal is exactly that and the outlined KPIs/success metrics are very detailed so in my opinion, the community will have no issues in tracking the progress of this proposal. Last but not the least, the proposer has done a very good job at explaining the goals in the SDG section. These goals are a direct result of an attempt to fix existing issues such as huge pay gaps, gender inequalities, hindrance in innovation. \n\nWith Cardano, for the first time in human history, we have an infrastructure on top of which one can build such platforms that could provide equal opportunity to everyone across the globe, and bringing Quadratic voting to Cardano is one of the most important steps to achieve that vision.

I just be missing the team\u2019s pictures which is provided with a link: the link lead me to a notice \u201cinternal server error\u201d.\nEven though the goals are set quite big, the proposers make us believe the project will be implemented successfully as they mentioned: they have dedicated product, design, growth teams, the support from a committed team and list of partnerships in the development; with the description of the solution which is very reliable clearly and lists of evidence included.\nAbout the financial amount, I think it is split quite fair and understandable as we can see how the money asked would be use.\nAs my comparison about budgets between two proposals of the team, it\u2019s clearly to understand this project has bigger amount of cloud hosting ($10K) than the \u201cMentor-mentee Bounties & eLearning\u201d project ($5K)\n because we have more platforms which need to be built in this project. Thing I missed here is the Cardano Gas-fees here is $24K, which is less than that fees in there ($27K). Why so? This is just a bonus question.\nThe plan is set with two parts and being given in a direct and succint way what is being done in each of parts. They also explained the challenges and risks that they have to solve in future and described in details resources (people, money, time) they need to excute the project successfully. The well-prepared plan and the description budget give us a vision of the project as a whole. Therefore, I give the feasibility with a score of 5.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposers describe very clear what the success looks like and what the KPIs would be. As my reading, they give KPIs in general right above the detailed budget breakdown section and KPI in details right below the SDG subgoals, which allow us to see in the perfect way what the project\u2019s result would be expected and the ambitions of the team. \nWe find easy to track on the project with three products which would be provided by the team thanks to the clear description of the success: the platforms and the On-Chain Practical Resume and Credentials which will be released on Github.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_714", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you so much for taking the time to review our proposal!
