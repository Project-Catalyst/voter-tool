For anyone wandering what blazor is, it's a framework for building interactive client-side web UI with .NET (meaning windows specific development). I like this idea since the cardano tenticles will spread even further and from what it looks like the project is not too much work but it would clearly add value to the open source ecosystem. I could say with absolute certainty that and an open source library falls perfectly inside this challenge. Not too much key, metrics, but on the other hand not too much time for development, so there wouldn't be that big of a need for continuous tracking of the projects' progress.\nI like the challenges, mentioned and the fact they are purely technical, and as a developer myself I can tell, you can allways find your way around thos so nothing to loose sleep over. The proposers have given a solution so the project will continue without an issue if funded.\nCurrently, I don't see anything big missing from the proposal apart maybe from some KPIs like library usage and such, but the bar is a bit lowered there because the funding asked for is lower than average as well and the value to cost ration is a no brainer. Overall I believe this project will be implemented without a hitch and will bring some impact in the .NET sub cardano community.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Team is out of 2 people that have all the necessary skills to finish the project. I've checked their credentials through the links they left in the propsal and managed to verify all things mentioned in the proposal concerning their skillset. Not mutch of a budget to mention and the one they have seems really reasonable if underpayed. I really like how technical both people are and that there aren't project managers and such for a simple library implementation as I've seen done in other proposals.\nThe timetable for completing the work seems reasonable as well and the combination of all the aforementioned things brings a lot of credibility to the project.  I really like this short and straight to the point proposal, and I believe it's just on point. There's nothing superfluous in it.\nThe one thing I was a bit disapointed about is the lack of a linked github repository, because an empty github repository takes all of 2 minutes to make, but if linked in a proposal it gives a place to look for and a bookmark for anyone interested in the proposal for future use and can bookmark it now and check on it after 6 weeks when the proposers say is the aproximate finish date.\nOverall it's feasible and probable proposal and I really think it's a steal for the budget they ask. Good luck!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There will be a github repository so I have no worries about that. Anyone interested in the project will be able to trace the project progress in there. There's somewhat of a roadmap although I wouldn't call it that with one checkpoint in it, more like a statement. The problem statement is simple and well articulated if a bit technical, and the solution is straightforward.\nI'd ask the proposers that I like how brief their proposal is but if a non-technical person reads it, there's less of a chance it get funded, because they wouldn't really know if it's good or not. Keeping this in mind my suggestion for future proposal is to keep all the technical terminology there, but also have one ore two more sentances explaining your project in simpler terms understandable to everyone.

The solution is also clearly described: Build a .NET blazor component. This is a good solution, and it is also in line with the project's mission in the sense that it helps attract more.NET developers, of whom the Cardano community has very few. This is very reasonable because as the diversity of the development tools that exist in the open-source ecosystem grows, the diversity of the developers of the open-source ecosystem also grows", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The skills and the amount of experience of the development team have been pointed out, but the number of developers is a little bit too much (13). The budget request is broken down into different sections and is legitimate. The timetable is also shown but is not every detailed (the steps of developing the tool and the deadline for each step are not shown). Challenges and risks are illustrated, and there is a temporary solution associated with it, which is good. Overall, the only downside of the proposal in terms of feasibility is not having a very detailed plan, like a temporary schedule or how the developers are organized and assigned tasks (I wonder how the team will operate with this large number of developers).
