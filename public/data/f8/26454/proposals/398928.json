What seems unclear though is what makes it sustainable. I would recommend adding some \"lead\" measures (as opposed to lag measures)--the actual drivers of the purchase behavior. Think about the value buyers of the carbon offset verification tokens will see in aligning themselves with the protocol itself long term. For that the protocol should demonstrate some type of legitimacy or worth that would drive buyers to seek out the tokens.

This is a nice project, but I don't think it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem. By financing this project, more people will not suddenly become involved with the blockchain technology that exists. Statistics are included in the proposal. It's about how trees are planted and how they can expand, but there's no mention of how people get closer to Cardano. The vision is to plant more trees instead of attracting people to Cardano. Future challenges are included, but they are not linked to the objective.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Evidence has been provided on the experiences of the makers of this proposal. There is only 1 person in the team who is a blockchain architect. It seems difficult to me to get everything on the Cardano network in this period of time. I think an hourly wage of $75 an hour is a lot. A very limited time frame has been indicated without implementing extensive technical aspects. I think the time frame to implement the proposal is very tight. I would prefer to use a slightly longer time frame and to insert test phases more often. It is not clearly defined what resources are needed to make this proposal run smoothly. I think it's better to raise money through crowdfunding. There are 1200 volunteers who can raise money for the project. The risks are included in the proposal and are linked to the problem statement.

I would work step by step and evaluate each time how everything went.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is a plan of what needs to be done. It says that targeted marketing is going to happen (how). The events will last 3 months (what will happen). KPIs that show how much success the project will have have been established. A good KPI is, for example, donations to plant trees. This KPI allows you to keep track of how popular the project is. The proposal clearly describes how the CO2 problem can be tackled locally by means of blockchain technology.

Blockchain and smart contracts can indeed help to address climate change challenges by carbon credit offsetting and this proposal semes to start from an already established intiative and add blockchain as solution to intermediate this carbon credit exchange, which is good and helps to deliver a fast solution, focused on Cardano capabilities and leveraging existing strucutre outside Cardano competencies (trees reforestation), through partnership. \n\nI also appreciate that known and consolidated protocols will be used, such as Konma Carbon Credit Protocol and for carbon calculations. Important to highlight that this project does addresses in a very directly way the UN SDGs mentioned. One question i had in the beggining of the proposal is why India but this is also explained in the proposal.\n\nThe only problem I see here is scale. In order to asses proposal impact in reduction target, it would be important to know what is its total CO2 equivalent reduction (compensation) potential in a yearly basis. Companies nowadays have targets for net zero emission by 2050 of thousands of kt CO2 eq./year and it would be nice to see how much it can contribute with that. Moreover, it could be interesting to know better who is the main target of this proposal (indivuduals, companies/organizations, governments) and how to communicate with them about the project and the App.\n\n It is mentioned however some numbers regarding number of volunteers and number of trees planted so far.\n\nLast, I dont see any problem in this proposal being allocated in msicellaneous challenge but it could also be in others such as \"grow india, grow cardano\", \"developer exossystem\", \"DApp and integration\" and \"business solution\"", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I liked how timeline is broken down in sprint and the deliverables of each sprint is mentioned. it is really an adequate project to apply an agile approach, as it might be necessary constant modification and iteration in the solution and feedback from stakeholders.\n\nbudget breakdown is fair and broken mainly by hours worked, which make sense. \n\nProject team is formed by 4 people already committed with competencies in enviroment/sustainability and blockchain, which are necessary for such project and linkedin links are provided.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "the metrics proposed are really good.

The proposers listed do not have significant business experience prior to Konma and I cannot agree that I find it highly likely that the project can be carried out successfully. Even though it addresses a relevant problem of our times and may be a good idea in general, the lack of a credible roadmap or concrete business plan are a negative for assessing this project. A lot of references are made to high-level concepts like Kyoto Protocol, climate change and so on, but the claims of 700,000 trees planted and 1200 volunteers cannot be verified, are not backed up by links or attachments, and have failed to convince me personally.\nThe team mentions companies buying carbon offsets from them, but do not demonstrate knowledge of existing competitors or legal status in India, taxation, accreditation etc.\nA lot of time is dedicated to creating and implementing an Oracle without exploring existing Oracle's solutions or explaining why it is so important for green NFTs, or why the Konma Carbon Credit Protocol (KCCP) based on the Kyoto Protocol is a part of the project at all given that the UN Kyoto Protocol has been discontinued and the whole concept would work perfectly without it or the need for oracle feeds.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "In contrast to the long proposal's previous two sections using a lot of broad concepts and marketing speak, Auditability is given very little attention and a few vague possible KPIs are not explained or backed up by targets, figures or a timeline.
