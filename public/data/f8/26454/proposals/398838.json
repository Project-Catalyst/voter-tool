Thus Hindi speakers cannot learn in their native language.

I researched here and saw that Hindi is a widely spoken language in India (70% of the natives speak the language), in that sense, the idea of \u200b\u200btranslating into Hindi several youtube videos from famous channels that talk about Cardano would break the language barrier (the biggest obstacle to democratizing Cardano) for a greater portion of the country's inhabitants. Our objective in this challenge is to work on the development of India, benefiting it, helping it to grow in economic, humanitarian or environmental aspects. In this case, the focus will be on benefiting people, so we are working on the humanitarian aspect. However, this will also reflect economically, because once the target audience of the translations knows Cardano, the job opportunities that our ecosystem offers, such as working as a CA or vCA on Catalyst, or even as a programmer, designer or other much needed roles in projects, will generate income for these people. With this, the objective of benefiting India will certainly be achieved, as its inhabitants will be facilitated to enter the community because, let's face it, most of us are confused by the Cardano ecosystem at first, it's a lot and there is no definitive and accessible guide for everyone in all languages. Therefore, translating into Hindi videos from the main channels that cover teachings about Cardano, such as the IOHK channel, the Emurgo channel and Cardano Foundation, will be a great way to facilitate the access of many Indians to the Cardano community. And with that, obviously the Cardano ecosystem will benefit, as the number of active participants in our community grows, consequently the investment in Ada also increases, new digital wallets are created, new students learn about our technologies and generate the potential for new professionals working on our blockchain, investors turn their attention to our blockchain, understanding its particularities and advantages... In short, the benefits for Cardano would be numerous, if the translations are all done properly and this content is widely disseminated, reaching the public's knowledge target, in addition to being mentored in addition to the presentation of the videos (maybe this is not the responsibility of this team, but it is a necessity). Something I would like to note is that here is the statement that it takes a long time to convert Ada to local currency, but I disagree, I do it for binance in a few minutes, I don't understand why this was put as a problem here. But anyway, on the impact, I agree that the proposal has the potential to bring profound benefits to both India and Cardano, fully achieving the objectives of the challenge. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is presented in great detail, we know who the members of this team are very specifically. Included are their names and very sizable texts about their past experiences, where we can see who is involved with the Cardano ecosystem and who is not. For example, Dimitri Fernando is a person who seems to be quite experienced when it comes to our blockchain, and even if the ideal is for everyone to have some involvement with Cardano, a well-understood person already makes a difference. It's also positive how everyone's social network profiles are attached; these are always welcome to directly understand what has been done in their professional lives so far, as well as being ways to prove what has been said. I wish the roles of each one with this project, specifically, had been better defined, as we know what their area and experience are, but not what exact role they would play here. About the budget, I think this part is average, because the method of charging per words is not simple to be audited, for example. I don't think anyone would have time to count how many words were translated by video, in addition to being an impractical method of monitoring whether what was promised was fulfilled. Therefore, I think that other ways should be established, such as, for example, a definition of the hourly rate for translators. Apart from the price per translated word, the other expenses of this proposal could be better explained, what would the marketing campaign be like, why would it cost 1200 dollars? What is the contingency fee? Finally, speaking of the script, I think that the activities that would be developed each time are described in a very superficial way, we know that content will be generated and disseminated. But how will the team organize itself to make these translations? How many translators would there be, what would their work routines be like? Who would select the videos to be translated, and even what topics would be addressed, in what order and why? I think this part of the proposal needs a lot of depth, a weekly schedule of tasks to be accomplished, for example. So I can't say that feasibility is bad, as important information is provided, but we have things to improve here, without a doubt. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability suggested by the proponent is useful to objectively perceive whether the main goals have been achieved. Regarding the process, he suggests that the content posted on youtube be verified; regarding the final results, things would be perceived through numbers: number of subscribers to the channel, number of comments, number of hours watched... And, of course, the goal is for the Hindi-speaking community to have the possibility to learn about Cardano and become an active part of our community. I think it is already a satisfactory auditable proposal, but it could be better monitored. Some suggestions are that the team give feedback to the Cardano community at the end of each one, it doesn't need to be anything elaborate, a message that contains basic information about whether the work that was planned for that period of time was accomplished, links to the translated videos, the problem score, if any, during the content creation process... Finally, the most appropriate thing is that this general overview was summarized in a report that could be forwarded to some discord group in the Cardano community, for example, that focused on tracking proposals financed from that fund. And in relation to the final results, I think it would be interesting if a closer monitoring of the channel's subscribers was carried out, so that we would know, in addition to how many people are subscribed, who are those who actually watch the videos that are periodically released... their learning process is taking place, what they intend to do with the accompaniment acquired there and so on. I think this information should be collected by the project team, and taken directly to the community in a kind of final report, which clarifies how the project impacted the Hindi-speaking community in an exact way. Thus, I believe that we would have an even more defined notion of monitoring both the process and the final scenario. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 7, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "\n\nThanks for your fair review. if we make it you too are part of what made us succeed.

Currently, there are more than 528 million people worldwide who speak Hindi. It is essential to provide videos and documents translated into Hindi.

I believe the community also appreciates this. The group KPIs are also very complete, but you need to be more specific about the number so that the community can easily measure it. Example: How many new people will watch the videos? How many people through translated videos reach the Cardano community? Through this proposal, how many people will come to start a business with the Cardano ecosystem?

So thank you once again!"}, {"q0": "Please note this assessment should be taken in context of a set of 19 similar proposals by the same proposer in two challenges, Grow India, Grow Cardano and Grow The only real difference between the proposals being the spoken language used (Urdu, Thai, Gujurati, Laotian, etc.). In all other respects they are essential the same. Hence it is almost impossible to write 19 distinct assessments, I have tried to find specific differentiators but have also looked at the package of proposals as a whole as, I believe, this will add greater value to the voter. Looking at this specific proposal for translating videos into Hindi, it largely meets the challenge brief in seeking to broaden the horizons of the Cardano ecosystem. The proposer should be praised for taking the initiative. I would suggest the proposer uses the comments section to explain voters their rationale behind this multi-proposal approach. That should help with transparency and help people make an informed decision. For example: Are they looking for voters to decide on which languages they prefer thus restricting the choice to the existing community. This kind of defeats the purpose of reaching out to new communities. If this is the case I have done a rudimentary research on number of people speaking each language to help the voters make an informed decision. Given more time, an in depth analysis of demographics would be useful showing current literacy levels, access to technology, levels of education, English speakers, etc in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Hindi ranks top by a long way so should be the highest priority? 1.Hindi:615M 2.Bengali:265M 3.Urdu:170M 4.Punjabi:126M 5.Marathi:95M 6.Telugu:93M 7.Tamil:81M 8.Gujarati:61M 9.Kannada:56M 10.Bhojpuri:50M 11.Odia:38M 12.Malayalam:38M 13.Sinhala:17M 14.Nepali :17M 15.Assamese:15M Where the voter needs to pay particular attention is the entirety of the ask. The proposal therefore under assessment are: Grow India, Grow Cardano - 15 Proposals https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404484 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398981 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398980 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398858 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398857 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398856 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398853 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398850 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398847 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398845 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398843 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398842 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398841 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398840 https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398838 ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The contents of feasibility are duplicated across all 19 proposals. In simple terms we are looking at a total ask of $135,900 of which $38,000 (28%) is contingency. At a proposal level that is $7100 budget with $2000 contingency. My project planning head immediately points to the 28% contingency. It is not clear what this is set aside for. A risk of ADA price fluctuation is noted in the proposals, however one of the proposed mitigations for that is a 10% contingency, the other being to sell funds privately to ADA holders. In addition the proposals states \u201cWe have ample resources to complete the project on time and within budget\u2019, once again raising the question on the need for such a large contingency in proportion to the budget? Now looking at what is to be delivered. Each proposal states the YouTube channel will be launched with 6 videos. We have to assume that means 6 videos translated in all 19 languages should they all be funded. After 3 months 10-20 videos (each translated in 19 languages) That gives us 380 translations in total at an average of 4 per day. I have run this by someone with experience in this area and their reaction was \u2018its going to need a considerable team\u2019. So, let\u2019s look at the evidence of a team with the skills to deliver this proposal. The proposer claims to have many years experience in this field but this is impossible to verify based on the evidence (LinkedIn profile) provided. The other key resource (Muthiah) presents as a trilingual translator. Specific languages are not mentioned so very difficult to validate of if they have the skills for this specific proposal Two other individuals are listed, their LinkedIn in profile are well populated but don\u2019t display the skills required to deliver this project. That leave us with the \u201cextensive network of Master translators\u201d. Again no evidence of their existence of previous work exists so impossible to evaluate. I believe the proposer has a lot to offer the ecosystem and can suggest the following: 1. Help the voter understand the need for 19 similar proposals 2. Provide evidence that they have access to the skills required 3. Look at a small scope with a set of languages he or Muthiah are comfortable with. Use this as a POC on both the translation and engagement side. SHOW the community this proposal is growing adoption. 4. Take the learnings (e.g. which types of video are interesting your audience) and if a larger (multi language) proposal is what is required submit it in a future fund leveraging in the economies of scale that will naturally provide on the maintenance of socials, contingency & marketing.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The metrics are sensible in terms of measuring engagement on youtube which is a great basic piece to measure. However to really get to the crux of the challenge we need to see the conversion rates into Cardano and/or Catalyst \u2022 increased interaction between Catalyst and Indian focused projects \u2022 Number of Indian focused Catalyst submissions \u2022 Number of Indian focused dapps/services actually built", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_45", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "\nThis has to be filtered out.  So many reasons..\nCombining into one proposal may make sense to this proposer who may not be from Asia and recognize the huge diversity from state to state or region to region. All languages cannot be done by same people or same social media campaign.  This is why we broke up. Smaller proposals enable people to clearly see we are not here to grab money.   Each language needs its unique Social media campaign to reach people.  We cannot lump everything into one.   \n\nSecondly Why consider the total ask?  The rules state that each proposal has to be considered on its own merit.  Therefore even if  i had a hundred language proposals, if i had a hundred teams of two Master Translators and Two Proofreaders, then it will get the job done. We are doing this for 25 years buddy.   We know exactly how to run a translation project.\n\n\n\nHe goes on\nThe proposer claims to have many years experience in this field but this is impossible to verify based on the evidence (LinkedIn profile) provided. The other key resource (Muthiah) presents as a trilingual translator.\nI have stated as below, we have and use our extensive network of Master Translator Partners.\n\nThe assessor has not read the proposal. It states clearly as follows\nThe number of people required to complete this task has been calculated.  \nWe will be using our inhouse resources as well as obtain our Master Translator Partner network to handle overflow of work to ensure that our deliverables remain on track. They would be brought on board as and when needed and budget would include their costs\n\nI can see clearly that this assessor is merely following the wrong ideas of some CAs to say that the feasibility is not good because they believe I alone  is doing Or Mr Muthiah D is doing,  the translations or this internal team is doing the translation of all the 10 languages.  This is completely WRONG.  As mentioned above we are using our External partners who are Master Translators with many years of experience and qualifications in translating as Native speakers of Tamil both in Sri Lanka and India. So his feasibility assessment is wrong. \n\nHow the budget was calculated has been clearly laid out as follows.. if he claims he has read the other proposals he will know that we are doing 15000 words per project. Each word costs 0.08 for complete translation to voicing. This cost comes to 1200 and into 3 months it is 3600.  Then this language needs its own Social media campaign since the users of one language would not care about social media campaigns in another language. So all languages cannot be lumped together to do one campaign.  The cost of that being 1500..  Then for contingency we have allocated 2000.    \nSome specific statements that are absolute nonsense=\nHowever, because the primary responsibility of this position is to translate text from English to Tamil, the proposer should include more specific information on their translators' expertise in their Master Translator Partner Network.   As stated we have been doing projects for over 25 years. The definition of Master translator if this assessor doesn't understand is a MASTER OF HIS CRAFT.  A SENIOR IN THE INDUSTRY.   Each one will have different qualifications.  As for our specific master translator, he is the ONLY ONE IN SRI LANKA to write for the Mahawamsa which is like the BIBLE OF HISTORY of SRI LANKA for over 4000 years. It has been written from the time of kings.  This is a role that he alone in Sri Lanka has. So this assessor is talking nonsense\nPlease filter him out.\n "}, {"q0": "Comprehension and communication is an indispensable trait for a rapidly expanding project such as Cardano, specially within majority developing-country areas of the world which are of the utmost importance for the mass adoption and spread of Cardano. They are the ones that generate the most visible projects for new members, that generate the first approach and most tangible form of onboarding for new emerging-economy members. For that to occur, the material must be available in the main languages of each region. India has the characteristics of a high inequality region, with a very large population, high percentage of unbanked people and high engagement with new technologies, and Hindi is spoken by over half a billion people worlwide.

This indicates a clear and deep commitment to the Cardano community and its success. The presence of EMURGO India could also provide the opportunity for some synergies to develop with funded proposals and subsequent informative material about Cardano in Hindi.

They also have a network of Translating Partners. I suppose with such experience they are a perfect fit. On the implementation roadmap the proponent said that they will implement it in 3 months. The workload is clear for each month, however I think 120 minutes of video per month is relatively low, if it can be increased it would be better. The requested project funding budget of $7,100 is earmarked for translation (including transcription, dubbing, editing, and publishing), social media, and contingencies. with a translation budget of $0.08 per word. I can judge it as reasonable. In addition, the solution to the project's possible risks includes a contingency cost of about 10% of the total cost. however when interpreting the budget I see $2000 for a corresponding 28.17% reserve.

The same team has submitted functionally identical proposals, each covering a different language, for 15 different languages of the Indian subcontinent. I would like to point out that in this case, this is not necessarily a problem as each proposal covers essentially a different service. The aim of each is to translate a YouTube video every 3 days, in this case into Hindi.\n\nI have meticulously verified the text of all 15 proposals in a text editor that allows for snapshots and comparisons between snapshots (Scrivener), to make sure the text of the proposals is the same. With a few minor exceptions of paragraphs being present in some proposals, but not in others, I can say with confidence that they are functionally identical proposals. As such I will be reviewing the proposals as a proposal group.\n\nGiven India\u2019s importance in the IT world, and especially considering its potential future growth my view is that this group of proposals would represent a very good investment for the Cardano community, and could have a great impact on attracting Indians to the ecosystem.\n\nThe main thing that I think is missing from this proposal group is the fact that they do not reference or acknowledge each other. If they did, the voters would get a much clearer picture of the project\u2019s scope overall and be able to make much more informed decisions as a result. I would advise that in the future, if the proposals are to be resubmitted separately, the proposer should clearly indicate that the proposals are part of a proposal group and perhaps write a paragraph or two about the vision behind the project as a whole and how they plan to implement it, especially since the same people will be responsible for the project management, logistics and implementation of the whole set of proposals.\n\nI can understand the reasoning behind submitting each language translation as a new proposal, so that the Cardano community can choose to fund as many as they think is necessary, and that the project can still go ahead if only a few languages are funded.

While the initiative to make Cardano content accessible in various Indian languages is certainly worthwhile it is up to the Cardano community to decide which to prioritise and fund and hopefully this overview will assist with that.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As mentioned in the Impact section of my assessment of this proposal, \u201cCardano in Hindi\u201d, is part of a group of proposals that aim to translate IOHK YouTube content into 15 Indian languages. As the proposals are functionally identical, my reviews will also be almost the same. However, reviewing a group of 15 proposals took almost the same amount of time as assessing 15 unique proposals, because of the steps described in the Impact section of my assessment. \n\nThe roadmap is very detailed and easy to follow. It makes perfect sense for the projects.\n\nThe budget requested by the team is very reasonable and a portion of it, $2000 out of $7100 is set aside for contingencies, meaning that even if unforeseen situations were to happen the team should be able to deal with them and deliver the product.\n\nAll the 15 proposals promise to \u201cTranslate the entire content of IOHK in stages\u201d, however since that is a monumental task I would have liked to see more indications about their plan of action, and what they plan to start with. The proposals mention applying for future Catalyst funding if the project is to continue. \n\nSince the proposals\u2019 primary focus is translating YouTube videos from the IOG channel, I would advise contacting them and coordinating with IOG on this effort. Especially if multiple proposals will be funded.\n\nThis could result in multiple benefits. For instance, the proposals don\u2019t specify how the translations are to be handled, if they intend to bake them in, hardcode them in the videos, or if they are to be presented as CC (close captions).\nIf the translations are baked in, it would make sense for IOG to provide them with the original video files. This way the team won\u2019t have to download the highly compressed video file from YouTube and upload a video file that has gone through multiple compressions, greatly reducing quality.\nIOG could get access to the text of the translations to be included in its primary videos, if wished, as CC (close captions).\n\nThe description of the team members involved with this project is very detailed and they seem more than competent to get the job done. The included LinkedIn profile links were helpful, however, the LinkedIn profiles were kind of sparse for some of the team members. But, that didn\u2019t constitute a problem since enough info is given in the proposals themselves.\n\nThe roles that the team members mentioned in the proposal will take within the projects are not exactly specified. However, I assume they will be mostly responsible for the project management of the proposals and the translations will be handled by the \u201cMaster Translators\u201d mentioned several times in the proposal. If this is the case, I would have liked to see more details around this and how they plan to recruit. However, given the stated experience of the proposals my level of confidence that they will get the job done is high.\n\nI particularly appreciated that, unlike many other proposers, the team behind this proposal has taken the time to properly identify and address a long list of risks/problems that could occur during the translation process.

However, the initial paragraph does offer some info about what the team hopes to accomplish with this overarching project that spans 15 Catalyst proposals in this round.\nIn the future, I would definitely recommend giving more thought to this section of the proposals and rewriting it.

So many reasons..\nCombining into one proposal may make sense to this proposer who may not be from India and recognize the huge diversity from state to state or region to region. All languages cannot be done by same people or same social media campaign.  This is why we broke up. Smaller proposals enable people to clearly see we are not here to grab money.   Each language needs its unique Social media campaign to reach people.  We cannot lump everything into one. \n\nThe assessor has not read the proposal. It states clearly. \nThe number of people required to complete this task has been calculated.  \nWe will be using our inhouse resources as well as obtain our Master Translator Partner network to handle overflow of work to ensure that our deliverables remain on track. They would be brought on board as and when needed and budget would include their costs\n\nI can see clearly that this assessor is merely following the wrong ideas of some CAs to say that the feasibility is not good because they believe I alone  is doing the translations or this internal team is doing the translation of all the 10 languages.  This is completely WRONG.  As mentioned above we are using our External partners who are Master Translators with many years of experience and qualifications in translating as Native speakers of Tamil both in Sri Lanka and India. So his feasibility assessment is wrong. \n\nHow the budget was calculated has been clearly laid out as follows.. if he claims he has read the other proposals he will know that we are doing 15000 words per project. Each word costs 0.08 for complete translation to voicing. This cost comes to 1200 and into 3 months it is 3600.  Then this language needs its own Social media campaign since the users of one language would not care about social media campaigns in another language. So all languages cannot be lumped together to do one campaign.  The cost of that being 1500..  Then for contingency we have allocated 2000.    \nSome specific statements that are absolute nonsense=\nHowever, because the primary responsibility of this position is to translate text from English to Tamil, the proposer should include more specific information on their translators' expertise in their Master Translator Partner Network.   As stated we have been doing projects for over 25 years. The definition of Master translator if this assessor doesn't understand is a MASTER OF HIS CRAFT.  A SENIOR IN THE INDUSTRY.   Each one will have different qualifications.  As for our specific master translator, he is the ONLY ONE IN SRI LANKA to write for the Mahawamsa which is like the BIBLE OF HISTORY of SRI LANKA for over 4000 years. It has been written from the time of kings.  This is a role that he alone in Sri Lanka has. So this assessor is talking nonsense\n\nHe states \"Normally, the translator don't have much knowledge and experience on cryptocurrencies Cardano ecosystem. \"  We have knowledge of the product. How does the assessor know what knowledge our team has? He is assuming out of complete ignorance.   Who else is he expecting to review their work? Someone from IOG?   This is utter rubbish being talked \nThe assessor has been influenced by IGNORANT GROUP THINK set in place by certain malicious CAs who seek to influence these CAs with rubbish instead of reading the proposal carefully since all facts are stated there.
