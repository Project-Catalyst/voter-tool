We cannot currently meet with most Indian students and professors.", "f6_no_assessments": 7, "f6_rating": 3.9523809523809526, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 7379, "q0": "The proposal undoubtedly aligns with the objectives of the challenge, because it intends to expand a project that already exists (it has already been financed in several funds, including) that consists of teaching about Cardano to university students who are in the area of \u200b\u200btechnology, and with that them about the characteristics, needs, challenges and differentials of our blockchain (let's face it, it's a sea of \u200b\u200bopportunity and what really needs to be taught/disclosed to as many young people interested in innovation). The project has been underway for some time and has already achieved some desired results, however, the language barrier is still present, hindering this knowledge to be disseminated to different audiences. That's where the proposal comes in, they intend to add two professionals to the current team, who speak Kannada and Tamil languages, with the goal of teaching Cardano to university students from Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune. According to the proponent, these areas have many developers and student of computer science in India. In this way, the objectives of the challenge will certainly be achieved, of disseminating knowledge about the Cardano ecosystem to natives of India (so that it benefits them by generating opportunities for education and future employment) while, at the same time, our blockchain technologies become popular. and reach different groups of people, becoming more democratic. I believe it will be a challenge to find professionals who fit the vacancies, that is, who are aligned with the blockchain mission and speak the desired languages, but I believe that with effort and a lot of search this will be possible. And I think the proposal has everything to work out, because, as I said, it's an ongoing project, so we wouldn't be betting from scratch; the team has already shown preparation and determination to fulfill the mission of teaching about Cardano to young university students in the technology area (in my opinion, it is the most important audience to invest in. All people matter, but those who want to work with technology and want to have an innovative career are the key people for Cardano). Therefore, the impact of this proposal, in my view, is undoubtedly the maximum possible. One thing however I would have liked to have seen here: the proponent could have invested in a more detailed explanation of the progress of the project so far. I've already evaluated another proposal from them and remembered what it's about, but CAs who have never had contact with the team can get a little lost. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is good, but it can still improve. Regarding the budget, I think it is very clear, we understand well how the requested money would be used, in fact it is a very simple budget that corresponds only to the salary of the new professionals that will be added to the team. I think the value is compatible with the market and it is very clear why they need this amount of funding, so I have no criticisms on this point. Now speaking of the team members, I think it's almost perfect. We know very well who the professionals involved are, their names, a small history of what they have done so far professionally, how they relate to this project and several ways to get in touch with them are also attached. We have their linkedin profiles, emails, phone numbers... In other words, lots and lots of ways to get in touch with them. This is extremely positive for me, as it demonstrates a lot of transparency and availability on the part of those involved. Now in relation to the students, I think there was a lack of detail. We know that would be \u201c2 Students at the University of Ottawa School of Business\u201d, but we don't have their basic information. We don't know their names, exactly what they study, in short, there is no clarity here about who they are. We know their roles in the project, but this is not possible to generate a complete understanding. Therefore, I would like to include information similar to that provided by the professionals involved, so that we could have an understanding of the team as a whole. Regarding the script, this part gets a little abstract. We know that the professionals to be hired will work for two months and that all knowledge about the project and Cardano will be passed on to them. But I would like a timeline that explains this whole process better. For example: in 2 months of work, the first would be to prepare the team, that is, the current professionals passing on the necessary knowledge to them? The second would be the classes themselves? They would teach remotely, right? Or maybe in person? How many classes would be taught? What is the specific content of each of them? A weekly schedule could be set up, allowing a full understanding of the process. Therefore, I think it is still a very viable proposal, but it could improve both in terms of providing this schedule (with dates included, preferably) and better detailing the students involved. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In my opinion, it is a very auditable proposal. I think this is because the proponent suggests several ways to monitor both the process and the results of this project: through the provision of regular reports to Catalyst, being mandatory that the two new professionals participate at least in the final report (I would like to understand where these reports are released, whether they are in text or video form, for example); they guarantee that payments will be traceable, which creates a lot of confidence in this financial part of the project; they also have an estimated number of students to reach with this project extension (50) and so on. Some suggestions I can make are: they could establish mandatory feedback from students. From what I understand they would receive free classes, it could be a rule, that after the completion of the cycle the students would give a feedback saying how they are using the acquired knowledge, if they are participating in Catalyst, they decided to invest in Ada, they continued to study , specializing more and more... This would be a very simple way to measure success in a qualitative way. Another thing, I would like to understand how this new mode of dissemination (from what I understand is this) would be like on tiktok. How does the team intend to use the most popular social network of the moment to promote their project and our Cardano ecosystem? The proponent cites the difficulty of tracking the results by the students, if this mandatory survey were established, it would certainly help in this regard. Regarding the monitoring of the process, I think they have already ensured well how this monitoring would be done (through the reports). Another thing that I thought about here about how to monitor the results: the new teachers themselves could have a meeting with the community, in order to report how the experience was. Anyway, I think the proposal deserves maximum marks in terms of auditability because they showed a lot of concern in making this part of the project accessible, and also because they already have some experience in Catalyst so I suppose they already know how to give feedback in a safe for the community. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3084, "q0": "By finding 2 local teachers who speak Kannada and Tamil, this project can help local educational institutions in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune explain what Cardano, blockchain technology and further possibilities are with it.

These people already have a lot of experience and together they form a beautiful whole. The advantage is that this is already an ongoing project. The budget is clearly defined. Relatively little budget is needed to get this project started. The assignment is for 2 months. It would be more useful to let the assignment run a little longer so that it is easier to find someone. Contacts have already been made with educational institutions. If successful, additional funding will be required. It is not specified what time frame the new members are given to familiarize themselves. It is good to involve computer science students in the possibilities of the cardano ecosystem. The team has already had success with similar projects, but in other educational institutions.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is the possibility to trace the funds to ensure the coherence of the project. The problem is that a teacher has to be appointed with a passion for Cardano like the creators in this project. The problem is solved if they find the right person who can speak both languages (Kannada and Tamil). More statistics will come as the project evolves.

This difficulty of getting local Indian developers who speak their language shows that the challenge is not well addressed, though the idea is good. Hence my 3 star rating of this category.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers are winners of previous fund 4,6 and 7 and therefore have aan already running project within Catalyst.

The proposers have stated that they assume the 2 people recruited would have computers to work with.

This is quite detailed for successful auditing. The measure of success has also been stated with specifics as : educating students and driving talents to Project Catalyst to become proposers, Stake pool operators, local hub creation, etc.; the continuation of their projects funded in F4, 6 and 7. I think it would have been good for the proposers to list the actual impact of the Funded (4, 6, 7) projects here since they are using it as leverage to make it clear for even first time community advisors to assess effectively.
