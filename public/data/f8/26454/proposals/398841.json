The Challenge mentions 1.4 Billion people of India to reach, 55% of them under 30 therefore tech-aged, and emphasizes the many skilled IT folks, and reaching out to the folks in the 3rd most popular language seems like a massively untapped market. The Challenge mentions that there\u2019s a well-established pool of skills and talent who just need to be made aware of Catalyst and Cardano, and the 337 Million speakers (larger than the entire population of the United States!) of this major world language seem like a prime group to welcome into Cardano and Catalyst. After all, one of the main suggestions of the Challenge was local language websites or socials to attract devs and creating how-to videos, and this project seems to be addressing exactly those points. It\u2019s a pity that Catalyst is not farther along yet, but at this point, this proposal seems like it has great potential to promote awareness, connect with established YouTubers to create buzz, and gather all minds from coders to Catalyst proposers. \n\nThe KPI metrics spelled out in the Challenge suggest increasing interaction between Catalyst and Indian projects, an increase in Indian-focused submissions, and building out dApps and services for the Indian crowd, and making things available in a language more familiar to them seems like the first line to reach that market of one-third-Billion people. This project seems perfectly aligned with the Challenge, hence the high Impact score I am giving it. \n\nAdditionally to all of this, as I look at average costs for similar work to this if it were to be outsourced or hired elsewhere, it appears that the meager $7,100 request (4.7% of the Challenge funding budget) to do the amount of work proposed is considerably cheaper, therefore this is a bargain for Cardano to take up. \n\nEven further, it appears that nearly all UN Sustainable Development Goals, bolstering added impact even beyond the goals set forth in the Catalyst campaign/challenge. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team spelled out in the proposal seem more than capable of making this project a reality.

The plan seems very well thought-through and ready to go into action right away. The project manager\u2019s credentials and decades of experience combined with the decades that the rest of the team has leaves me with zero hesitation that this project will (if voted up) become a reality. More importantly, not only will the project become a reality, but looking at the mentions of likely doing extra work for no extra cost implies and suggests that Catalyst may very likely even get more output delivered than initially planned for, but yet on the same meager funding budget. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "KPIs appear well established and easy to follow or verify.

Views per video, comments, shares, are all easy metrics for anyone to see on YouTube, where the majority of this project will be published. \n\nOnce the team provides to auditors which masters they have chosen from their network to make the project a reality, everything else will be very simple to audit.

In all other respects they are essential the same. Hence it is almost impossible to write 19 distinct assessments, I have tried to find specific differentiators but have also looked at the package of proposals as a whole as, I believe, this will add greater value to the voter. Looking at this specific proposal for translating videos into Bengali, it largely meets the challenge brief in seeking to broaden the horizons of the Cardano ecosystem. The proposer should be praised for taking the initiative. I would suggest the proposer uses the comments section to explain voters their rationale behind this multi-proposal approach. That should help with transparency and help people make an informed decision. For example: Are they looking for voters to decide on which languages they prefer thus restricting the choice to the existing community. This kind of defeats the purpose of reaching out to new communities. If this is the case I have done a rudimentary research on number of people speaking each language to help the voters make an informed decision. Given more time, an in depth analysis of demographics would be useful showing current literacy levels, access to technology, levels of education, English speakers, etc in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Bengali ranks 2nd with a significant number of speakers so should be on the high priority list? 1.Hindi:615M 2.Bengali:265M 3.Urdu:170M 4.Punjabi:126M 5.Marathi:95M 6.Telugu:93M 7.Tamil:81M 8.Gujarati:61M 9.Kannada:56M 10.Bhojpuri:50M 11.Odia:38M 12.Malayalam:38M 13.Sinhala:17M 14.Nepali :17M 15.Assamese:15M Where the voter needs to pay particular attention is the entirety of the ask.

In simple terms we are looking at a total ask of $135,900 of which $38,000 (28%) is contingency. At a proposal level that is $7100 budget with $2000 contingency. My project planning head immediately points to the 28% contingency. It is not clear what this is set aside for. A risk of ADA price fluctuation is noted in the proposals, however one of the proposed mitigations for that is a 10% contingency, the other being to sell funds privately to ADA holders. In addition the proposals states \u201cWe have ample resources to complete the project on time and within budget\u2019, once again raising the question on the need for such a large contingency in proportion to the budget? Now looking at what is to be delivered. Each proposal states the YouTube channel will be launched with 6 videos. We have to assume that means 6 videos translated in all 19 languages should they all be funded. After 3 months 10-20 videos (each translated in 19 languages) That gives us 380 translations in total at an average of 4 per day. I have run this by someone with experience in this area and their reaction was \u2018its going to need a considerable team\u2019. So, let\u2019s look at the evidence of a team with the skills to deliver this proposal. The proposer claims to have many years experience in this field but this is impossible to verify based on the evidence (LinkedIn profile) provided. The other key resource (Muthiah) presents as a trilingual translator. Specific languages are not mentioned so very difficult to validate of if they have the skills for this specific proposal Two other individuals are listed, their LinkedIn in profile are well populated but don\u2019t display the skills required to deliver this project. That leave us with the \u201cextensive network of Master translators\u201d. Again no evidence of their existence of previous work exists so impossible to evaluate. I believe the proposer has a lot to offer the ecosystem and can suggest the following: 1. Help the voter understand the need for 19 similar proposals 2. Provide evidence that they have access to the skills required 3. Look at a small scope with a set of languages he or Muthiah are comfortable with. Use this as a POC on both the translation and engagement side. SHOW the community this proposal is growing adoption. 4. Take the learnings (e.g. which types of video are interesting your audience) and if a larger (multi language) proposal is what is required submit it in a future fund leveraging in the economies of scale that will naturally provide on the maintenance of socials, contingency & marketing.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The metrics are sensible in terms of measuring engagement on youtube which is a great basic piece to measure. However to really get to the crux of the challenge we need to see the conversion rates into Cardano and/or Catalyst \u2022 increased interaction between Catalyst and Indian focused projects \u2022 Number of Indian focused Catalyst submissions \u2022 Number of Indian focused dapps/services actually built", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_45", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "This has to be filtered out.  So many reasons..\nCombining into one proposal may make sense to this proposer who may not be from India and recognize the huge diversity from state to state or region to region. All languages cannot be done by same people or same social media campaign.  This is why we broke up. Smaller proposals enable people to clearly see we are not here to grab money.   Each language needs its unique Social media campaign to reach people.  We cannot lump everything into one.  This assessor clearly if from India is of a tech back ground, knows English and Hindi and thinks everyone in the country speaks Hindi and ENglish as well as he/she does.  This is ignorance, bias and absolute discrimination since he should know that people in other states much prefer their own language to Hindi. \n\nSecondly Why consider the total ask?  The rules state that each proposal has to be considered on its own merit.  Therefore even if  i had a hundred language proposals, if i had a hundred teams of two Master Translators and Two Proofreaders, then it will get the job done. We are doing this for 25 years buddy.   We know exactly how to run a translation project.\n\nHe goes on\nThe proposer claims to have many years experience in this field but this is impossible to verify based on the evidence (LinkedIn profile) provided. The other key resource (Muthiah) presents as a trilingual translator.\nI have stated as below, we have and use our extensive network of Master Translator Partners.\n\nThe assessor has not read the proposal. It states clearly as follows\nThe number of people required to complete this task has been calculated.  \nWe will be using our inhouse resources as well as obtain our Master Translator Partner network to handle overflow of work to ensure that our deliverables remain on track. They would be brought on board as and when needed and budget would include their costs\n\nI can see clearly that this assessor is merely following the wrong ideas of some CAs to say that the feasibility is not good because they believe I alone  is doing Or Mr Muthiah D is doing,  the translations or this internal team is doing the translation of all the 10 languages.  This is completely WRONG.  As mentioned above we are using our External partners who are Master Translators with many years of experience and qualifications in translating as Native speakers of the language both in Sri Lanka and India. So his feasibility assessment is wrong. \n\nHow the budget was calculated has been clearly laid out as follows.. if he claims he has read the other proposals he will know that we are doing 15000 words per project. Each word costs 0.08 for complete translation to voicing. This cost comes to 1200 and into 3 months it is 3600.  Then this language needs its own Social media campaign since the users of one language would not care about social media campaigns in another language. So all languages cannot be lumped together to do one campaign.  The cost of that being 1500..  Then for contingency we have allocated 2000.    \nSome specific statements that are absolute nonsense=\nHowever, because the primary responsibility of this position is to translate text from English to Tamil, the proposer should include more specific information on their translators' expertise in their Master Translator Partner Network.   As stated we have been doing projects for over 25 years. The definition of Master translator if this assessor doesn't understand is a MASTER OF HIS CRAFT.  A SENIOR IN THE INDUSTRY.   Each one will have different qualifications.  As for our specific master translator, he is the ONLY ONE IN SRI LANKA to write for the Mahawamsa which is like the BIBLE OF HISTORY of SRI LANKA for over 4000 years. It has been written from the time of kings.  This is a role that he alone in Sri Lanka has. So this assessor is talking nonsense\n\nThe assessor has been influenced by IGNORANT GROUP THINK set in place by certain malicious CAs who seek to influence these CAs with rubbish instead of reading the proposal carefully since all facts are stated there. IF anything was still unclear I am a CA myself and was easily accessible through the CA chat or my own TG. Therefore please filter this out as its a malicious effort to bring down the proposal through ignorance.\n\nAlso he is completely biased and not seeing the reality as is Language diversity in India based on above mentioned biases.\n\n\n"}, {"id": 7345, "q0": "I think the proposal aligns well with the objectives of the challenge, the idea here is to translate content relevant to the Cardano ecosystem into the Bengali language, spoken in India. The proponent claims that in this region there are many people working in the area of \u200b\u200btechnology, and, at the same time, little content about Cardano in the local language. That is, everything fits. What we are looking for in this challenge is to favor India and Cardano at the same time. India, in the sense that we can take the opportunities of our ecosystem there, through courses brought in, content posted in the local language (as is the idea here), professionalization of people who work with blockchain, in general: creating opportunities for natives of the country can benefit from the employment positions generated by Cardano. Whether by participating as Catalyst project team members or even developing your own Dapps, acquiring Ada, learning to delegate, buying NFTs... In short, using our technologies to your advantage. And obviously, the Cardano ecosystem should benefit as well, one should increase the number of our currency in circulation, invest in minting active tokens on our blockchain, bring Cardano to a new audience that will popularize the blockchain and invest in it. The proposal meets these requirements exactly, because once content is available in the local language of that Indian state, it will be much easier for people there to get involved with Cardano. However, it would be interesting for the proponent to explain a little more what these contents would be, exactly, how it is intended to approach them, how they will be passed on and so on. The issue of themes is not clarified either here or in terms of feasibility, I think it would be an essential factor for us to fully understand what is being promised here. Therefore, I will give it 4, because I believe in the idea and in its potential, but there was a lack of detail to understand how all this will be generated and passed on. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "At first I didn't understand one thing. The proponent says that the intention is to release videos daily, right? And that when launched, the channel would already have 20 videos. If over 3 months (approximately 90 days) this goal was maintained, the minimum available videos should be 20 + 90 = 110... right? Because he states the daily goal and then immediately says that with 3 months the goal is to have 30 to 60 videos on the channel. Anyway, I was confused. From what he says, pre-existing videos will be translated. What videos are these? How could we access them? How can we buy its validity? We have 3 reliable sources: the IOHK channel, as well as the Emurgo and Cardano Foundation Youtube channel. But what about these other sources, how can we be sure about the veracity of the exploited content? Now talking about script, budget and team. The script is good, it makes it clear which activities would be done each month, it is said that the project would be completed in the third month of work, and because it is not such a complex proposal in the sense of having several different things happening at the same time, it is quite understandable how the proposal development process will take place through what is presented to us. Regarding the budget, the requested amount is 7100 USD. This funding is not explained so clearly, some things, like the price of the translation itself, are quite simple to understand, but others, like social media campaign and contingency fee, should be better explained. What would the marketing campaign be? Why would it cost 1500 dollars? Who would work on it, and doing what tasks? What is a contingency fee and why is it more expensive than the marketing campaign itself? I think the budget explanation could improve. And finally, speaking of the team, this part is excellent, almost perfect. We know the names of those involved and we have very extensive explanations about their previous experiences and they also attach their linkedin profiles, so that we can see even more details about their professional careers and verify the information that was said.

However, what remains is to establish a bridge with the Cardano ecosystem, we would need to understand how our community members could audit the proposal in practice. Granted, the videos would be posted on the youtube channel and the translations on the forum, according to the proponents, but that would only allow us to track the partial results, the small goals that were achieved, and not the tasks behind it. According to the nature of the proposal (which is simpler), reports could be made at the end of each month, informing whether the activities planned for that period of time were actually carried out; whether there were problems that month; if all planned videos were posted (it would be great if the links were included in this report); anyway, if everything that was planned actually happened that month. The team could make these more complete reports available on the \u201cProject Catalyst\u201d Telegram channel, for example. And regarding the final results, a meeting could be held in Town Hall after the project is completed, in order to understand if the final results were achieved, showing data that proves this, if Bengali speakers are really participating in the Cardano ecosystem. after the availability of these translations; if so, in what way (it would be amazing if any of these natives could participate in the meeting as well).

I believe the project's roadmap will be on schedule as the author promised. The budget is 7.100 USD, detailed and listed by the author for each category. With the amount listed for each month, I find the budget sufficient to check the progress of the proposal. Suggest an easy way to measure success through the metrics the author has listed. . . It is surprising with the number of years of experience that the group has given, the 4-member group has more than 20 years of experience. I do not doubt the experience of the propagandists, they are all elite members, members that we can follow through social networking sites. With a solid team of experts with good leadership, based on the information provided I think this project will be successful.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "(\"The author writes the proposal in different countries, but the content will mostly be the same, so when I analyze the project there will be similar sentences\"). The measurement indicators are detailed by the author in 3 months of implementation, each month will produce 120 minutes of video. Well-defined KPIs determine the success of the proposal through the number of views, several followers, shares... The author gives great ideas it tackles effectively the challenge, if it is funded I believe the project will be very successful it will have a good impact on making more people aware of Cardano. However, the success of this project is tied to the success of other projects so I think the risk will be multiplied. . . This project is completely new and is waiting for funding.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_649", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "\n\nThanks for your fair review. if we make it you too are part of what made us succeed. So thank you once again!"}, {"id": 8577, "q0": "The intention of  project which is the scope of the \u201cCardano in Bengali\u201d proposal is to translate Cardano related video content, from the IOHK YouTube channel into Bengali. The same team has submitted functionally identical proposals, each covering a different language, for 15 different languages of the Indian subcontinent. I would like to point out that in this case, this is not necessarily a problem as each proposal covers essentially a different service. The aim of each is to translate a YouTube video every 3 days, in this case into Bengali.\n\nI have meticulously verified the text of all 15 proposals in a text editor that allows for snapshots and comparisons between snapshots (Scrivener), to make sure the text of the proposals is the same. With a few minor exceptions of paragraphs being present in some proposals, but not in others, I can say with confidence that they are functionally identical proposals. As such I will be reviewing the proposals as a proposal group.\n\nGiven India\u2019s importance in the IT world, and especially considering its potential future growth my view is that this group of proposals would represent a very good investment for the Cardano community, and could have a great impact on attracting Indians to the ecosystem.\n\nThe main thing that I think is missing from this proposal group is the fact that they do not reference or acknowledge each other. If they did, the voters would get a much clearer picture of the project\u2019s scope overall and be able to make much more informed decisions as a result. I would advise that in the future, if the proposals are to be resubmitted separately, the proposer should clearly indicate that the proposals are part of a proposal group and perhaps write a paragraph or two about the vision behind the project as a whole and how they plan to implement it, especially since the same people will be responsible for the project management, logistics and implementation of the whole set of proposals.\n\nI can understand the reasoning behind submitting each language translation as a new proposal, so that the Cardano community can choose to fund as many as they think is necessary, and that the project can still go ahead if only a few languages are funded. However, I also feel that the average voter, who may only come across 2-3 proposals should have been made aware of the existence of the proposal group. \n\nThe proposers provide the number of speakers for each language in each category, however as the proposals do not reference each other I will make a list of all languages the proposers have submitted proposals for, in order of the number of worldwide speakers:\n\n\t1)\tHindi - 528 million speakers globally\n\t2)\tUrdu - 280 million speakers globally\n\t3)\tBengali - 250 million speakers globally (this proposal)\n\t4)\tPunjabi - 113 million speakers globally\n\t5)\tMarathi - 83 million speakers globally\n\t6)\tTelugu - 83 million speakers globally\n\t7)\tGujarati - 75 million speakers globally\n\t8)\tTamil - 75 million speakers globally\n\t9)\tKannada - 56 million speakers globally\n\t10)\tBhojpuri - 51 million speakers globally\n\t11)\tOdia - 39 million speakers globally\n\t12)\tMalayalam - 39 million speakers globally\n\t13)\tNepali - 25 million speakers globally\n\t14)\tSinhala - 25 million speakers globally\n\t15)\tAssamese - 24 million speakers globally\n\nI have cross-checked these figures with the information provided in the Languages of India Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_India , and for the most part they check out. There are a few small discrepancies, but that is perfectly understandable given the dataset, even the Wikipedia article feature 2 separate lists with slightly varying numbers. Not on the lists in the article are Nepali (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_language) and Sinhala (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhala_language), languages mainly spoken in Nepal and Sri Lanka respectively.\n\nI have also compiled a list of links to all the proposals in the group for easier reference:\n\n\t\u2022\tCardano in Hindi - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398838 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Urdu - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398847 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Bengali (this proposal) - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398841 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Punjabi - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398857 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Marathi -  https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398842 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Telugu - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398843  \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Gujarati - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398845 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Tamil - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398840 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Kannada - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398850 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Bhojpuri - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398981 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Odia - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398853 \n\t\u2022\tMalayalam - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398856 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Nepali - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398858 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Sinhala - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404484 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Assamese - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398980 \n\nThere are a few inconsistencies, meaning the authors failed to update each proposal with the correct language, or, in a few instances, the number of speakers internationally is not consistent within a proposal, however, that is understandable given the number of proposals they had to keep track off.\n\nOverall, even though the proposal itself could definitely use some more work and could have been better written and more refined in a number of areas, the initiative itself is worthwhile and it\u2019s a big plus for the Cardano translation effort that we have access in our community to such well-connected individuals in the translation field that are offering their services at very competitive rates.\n\nThe budget for translating a single language is very reasonable at $7,100, however, all the languages combined add up to almost 3 quarters of the total category budget, $106,500 out of $150,000. While the initiative to make Cardano content accessible in various Indian languages is certainly worthwhile it is up to the Cardano community to decide which to prioritise and fund and hopefully this overview will assist with that.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The Impact section of my assessment of this proposal, \u201cCardano in Bengali\u201d, also notes that is part of a group of proposals that aim to translate IOHK YouTube content into 15 Indian languages. As the proposals are functionally identical, my reviews will also be almost the same. However, reviewing a group of 15 proposals took almost the same amount of time as assessing 15 unique proposals, because of the steps described in the Impact section of my assessment. \n\nThe roadmap is very detailed and easy to follow. It makes perfect sense for the projects.\n\nThe budget requested by the team is very reasonable and a portion of it, $2000 out of $7100 is set aside for contingencies, meaning that even if unforeseen situations were to happen the team should be able to deal with them and deliver the product.\n\nAll the 15 proposals promise to \u201cTranslate the entire content of IOHK in stages\u201d, however since that is a monumental task I would have liked to see more indications about their plan of action, and what they plan to start with. The proposals mention applying for future Catalyst funding\t if the project is to continue. \n\nSince the proposals\u2019 primary focus is translating YouTube videos from the IOG channel, I would advise contacting them and coordinating with IOG on this effort. Especially if multiple proposals will be funded.\n\nThis could result in multiple benefits. For instance, the proposals don\u2019t specify how the translations are to be handled, if they intend to bake them in, hardcode them in the videos, or if they are to be presented as CC (close captions).\nIf the translations are baked in, it would make sense for IOG to provide them with the original video files. This way the team won\u2019t have to download the highly compressed video file from YouTube and upload a video file that has gone through multiple compressions, greatly reducing quality.\nIOG could get access to the text of the translations to be included in its primary videos, if wished, as CC (close captions).\n\nThe description of the team members involved with this project is very detailed and they seem more than competent to get the job done. The included LinkedIn profile links were helpful, however the LinkedIn profiles were kind of sparse for some of the team members. But, that didn\u2019t constitute a problem since enough info is given in the proposals themselves.\n\nThe roles that the team members mentioned in the proposal will take within the projects are not exactly specified. However, I assume they will be mostly responsible for the project management of the proposals and the translations will be handled by the \u201cMaster Translators\u201d mentioned several times in the proposal. If this is the case, I would have liked to see more details around this and how they plan to recruit. However, given the stated experience of the proposals my level of confidence that they will get the job done is high.\n\nI particularly appreciated that, unlike many other proposers, the team behind this proposal has taken the time to properly identify and address a long list of risks/problems that could occur during the translation process. This definitely increases the feasibility of the proposals.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The Impact and Feasibility sections of the review for this proposal, \u201cCardano in Bengali\u201d, also mention the fact that it\u2019s just one in a group of 15 proposals that aim to translate IOHK YouTube content into 15 Indian languages. Bengali, in the case of this proposal.\n\nGiven that translated YouTube videos are the main deliverables to track for this group of 15 proposals the metrics presented in the auditability section should be sufficient to verify the evolution of the projects as they all have to do with engagement on the platform.\n\n As the output of these projects is YouTube videos, the quality of the translations will only be able to be verified by speakers of the 15 languages which the projects aim to produce translations for, but that is beyond the scope of current Catalyst auditability requirements. \n\nThe definitions of success given are more or less a copy/paste of the metrics presented in the initial section of the Auditability part of the proposals and various other parts of the proposal. However, the initial paragraph does offer some info about what the team hopes to accomplish with this overarching project that spans 15 Catalyst proposals in this round.\nIn the future, I would definitely recommend giving more thought to this section of the proposals and rewriting it. For instance, attaching clear values to each of the metrics given would have turned them into milestones/goals; an example: \u201c15000 average views per video\u201d. But, ultimately this doesn\u2019t carry much weight in this case, given the nature of the project and the set of proposals.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_681", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "\n\nThanks for your fair review. if we make it you too are part of what made us succeed.
