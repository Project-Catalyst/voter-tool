This group would be called \u201cCardano India\u201d, and from what I understand it aims to guide the local public in the country about our ecosystem in various ways. I found it very positive as the author explores all the facets that this initiative would have, such as the forum, through which the members of the group would communicate. It would be even more interesting if the bidder determined which platform would be used as a forum. It is also interesting how the larger group would be divided into tribes, as this could increase the chance of greater interaction between the members of the respective tribes, as they would have common interests and areas of activity. The other features presented (voting system, content streaming, peer-to-peer communication, event hosting and course offerings) are also well explained, so we have a very solid understanding of everything that will make up this very multifaceted project. During my reading of the proposal, I thought that there would be many activities, of many natures, being done by many different people, and this would make it difficult to understand what would actually be done on a day-to-day basis at Cardano India. However, the proponent dedicates a topic specifically to explain what would happen there, in \u201cWHAT DOES THE CARDANO INDIA TRIBO DO?\u201d. Soon, my doubts were cleared. It is also super positive as the author of the proposal already makes it clear exactly who would be the target audience of this project, from university students to startup members. Anyway, I think it's a very complete proposal, which meets the challenge's objectives very well and is perfect, at least in terms of impact. In this challenge we are looking for ways to expand the Cardano ecosystem to the inhabitants of India, with the goals of a) benefiting our blockchain, making it more popular, increasing investment in our currency and our applications (Dapps) for example, growing the number of hubs, DAOs, CNFTs in circulation and other ways that we could verify the real adoption of Cardano b) it is also intended that the Indian population benefits from these projects. This can be done through education, that is, we educate the natives about our technologies, giving them the possibility to work with Cardano on technology projects. Even, that they obtain the necessary knowledge to live CAs and VCAs, which generates a very considerable, albeit unstable, extra income. Anyway, I believe this proposal meets all the small goals, deserving the maximum score in impact. \n\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding feasibility, I will start by saying that I will be a little demanding in my analysis due to the fact that the proposal is very ambitious, as I explained, many activities are promised, so it is naturally difficult for all of this to be carried out in the optimally and within ideal timeframes. Regarding the script, I think that the time of 1 month (which would be April) is quite short for something so big to be built, and it is not clear if this would just be the beginning of the realization of the project, if it would still be necessary more work after that April period. However, regarding the explanations about this month, I think that what is provided is very positive, as the exact activities for each week are detailed. In this way, we have a well-completed view of everything that would need to be done for the idea to move from the theoretical field to the practical field (at least in the first month of construction). It's also very positive how the proposer sets out what would be possible to deliver at this point in development, so, as with the impact with setting the goals, we have a very solid understanding of the objectives of the proposal. Now talking about the budget breakdown, this part left a little to be desired in my view. The total amount of $28,700 was actually split into parts. However, each of them should have been better explained. For example, let's guide ourselves on the first part of using the money: \u201cRewards and Incentives for Hosting Hackathons and Competitions - $5,000\u201d. How would these rewards be distributed? How many people would get them? So what approximate value do they intend to set for each reward? In the following part \u201cDeveloping multilingual resources (video, audio, text documents) - $1,000 / language I, and 5 languages \u200b\u200bx $1,000 = $5,000\u201d; why would each language cost 1000 dollars? How much would go to video, and to audio, and to text documents? I think that, really, the first parts of the budget needed more detail so that they could be fully understood. The other parts, which relate to the payment of the professionals involved, are explained in a richer and more detailed way, as the price of each hour of work is informed. Therefore, ideally, the same level of detail would be available for all pieces of the budget. Finally, speaking of the team, I think this part is very good because all the necessary information is provided so that we can understand who we are dealing with. We know the names of the professionals involved, as well as a short summary of their professional assignments and their linkedin profiles. This gives a lot of confidence in the team. Therefore, I think the feasibility is already good, with only a few points to improve. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer defines several ways in which the proposal development process can be followed. For example, through \u201ctribe growth reports\u201d as well as \u201creports on a number of tribe members who apply to become Proponents, Voters and CAs\u201d, in addition to \u201cMember Feedback in the form of polls\u201d. I understand that some of the feedback from members of this community will be picked up and analyzed internally, and that's okay. However, regarding the cited reports, how will they reach the members of the Cardano community? It would be necessary for the proponent to explain exactly on which platform he would make them available (either in the discord or telegram groups of the community, by email, through online applications such as Notion, Miro, Google Docs and several others) and also how often they would be posted. In fact, I believe this is my only observation about the auditability of the process, because the proponent already demonstrates that he will keep the Cardano community up to date, which is the crux of the matter, he just needed to better explain how this would be done. Now talking about the final results, I think that we have numerous ways to audit the success because, during the detailing of the proposal, the proposer informs us of many, many KPIs and possible results to be delivered. Therefore, there is no lack of materials to be used as a guide for auditability. In the final part of the breakdown of his proposal, he explains that the ultimate goal is \u201cto reach people from all parts of India and communicate about blockchain and Cardano in the simplest way\u201d. If he hadn't provided ways in which this could be measured, I would say that his proposed scenario still seems a bit abstract, and therefore more detail would be needed. However, as I've said before, it offers us more objective ways of perceiving this bigger picture. Ultimately, what needs to be established again is how the link between these results and the Cardano community would take place. As it is a very large project with many people participating, I think it would be entirely possible for a select group of Cardano India members to gather all this information and make it accessible to the Cardano community, through one of the several platforms I suggested earlier. . Therefore, I think that, as well as the feasibility, the auditability of the proposal is good, just needing some clarification as to how we could all have access to the audited information. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 5, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1575, "q0": "The problem statement is itself problematic, needing unpacking. Saying there are \u201cno communities in India that are dedicated to Blockchain and Cardano in specific\u201d is both not obviously true and not obviously a problem, for an ecosystem committed to decentralization.  ***********\n\nThe definition of \u201ccommunities\u201d is important to assessing Impact because their argument is that using their platform is essential or highly desirable for groups of people pursuing interest in blockchain and Cardano. However obviously many platforms exist, the platform per se won\u2019t be a decisive factor. They seem to mean, \u201ccommunity-type i.e. social media software\u201d when they say \u201ccommunities.\u201d\nAlso they don\u2019t appear to be creating a platform \u201cdedicated\u201d to Cardano, at least not in the sense IdeaScale is dedicated to Cardano. This group seems to be developing a more general social network program, which is great. But the argument that their platform per se is needed doesn\u2019t hold water. Also, if e.e. their training material unavailable/only available on their platform? That\u2019d be a risk for Cardano. \nAll in all it\u2019s not that clear what the impact would be.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Implied goal is to create \u201can active community in India that is dedicated to Blockchain and Cardano in specific.\u201d So Feasibility needs to be thought of not how their platform could be used to support community, but whether they can create community by virtue of their platform\u2019s awesomeness. \nThey present a number of good ideas about how a platform like theirs could be used for Cardano education and community building. Unfortunately there\u2019s no compelling logic presented as to why and how users will be attracted to their platform, and whether using it per se will create a community around blockchain and Cardano.\nRegarding course offerings, this appears to be an after-thought and therefore unlikely to produce a significant impact. I.e. what topics would they cover, what background do their instructors have and other questions aren\u2019t addressed. Also producing materials in five different languages would require a specialized  team  and workflow in itself, not presented. \n\nLIkely the biggest challenge would be bringing users to their platform; this challenge isn\u2019t addressed at all. On that note, a suggestion to the team would be, \u201cto divide the target group based on accessibility, level of understanding and languages and communicating on different levels over a period of time.\u201d is probably a good idea, perhaps focusing on the segmentation groups they specify in their Intended Audience section.\n\nThe team looks strong in professional abilities and interest and knowledge of blockchain and Cardano.

By establishing this community forum, a community will try to be built. It is difficult to build a community without building a large advertising campaign beforehand. I think that before we can really invest in this project, there must be first enough people present. There are many similar projects that aim to do roughly the same thing.
