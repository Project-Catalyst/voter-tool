In this case, this proposal aligns well with that, as, in the words of the proposer himself, it will \u201ccreate adequate awareness of the benefits of web3 over web2 for people who have no knowledge\u201d. It is about providing a kind of consultancy for developers who are not yet working with technologies relevant to the Cardano ecosystem, providing technical support so that they can launch their MVP at Cardano. I think that this proposal would have a very positive impact and would serve well what the challenge seeks. However, the problem that I identified in this proposal is that it is not explained in a clear and detailed way how this technical support process would take place. There are many things to be done, but they are given to us in a considerably superficial way. We know of some things that would be offered, such as: NFT market offering, custodial and non-custodial wallet, APIs, UI, UX, custom process flows and multi-level access control, etc. However, as much as we know what will be offered, we do not know essential details such as who will do what, that is, which professionals who were mentioned in the part of the team will perform what tasks, we do not know how these consulting sessions would take place. (For example, would individual sessions with each developer be a general meeting with everyone, in which information would be shared equally?). We don't know how long each would be followed, how we could measure the progress of these developers, we don't know exactly what part of the Cardano ecosystem they intend to work on - they might want to become Catalyst proponents, build Dapps, launch CNFTs, in short, there are many possibilities. In summary, I don't think it's very clear what the content of this awareness would be, how it would happen, how we could accompany the benefited developers, what technologies within the web3 universe they would be working with, and so on. In order for the impact of this proposal to become clearer, I would like all these doubts to be clarified. In this way, we could measure much better whether the specific objectives of the challenge would be achieved, that is, whether the natives of India were actually receiving an orientation that would facilitate their entry into the Cardano community; if they would be learning well how to deal, study and work with the technologies that Cardano contains, which could generate opportunities for a fixed and very profitable income in the future. And, if with that, Cardano would also benefit, with new members joining our community, helping the ecosystem to become popular and investing in Ada, creating digital wallets, minting CNFTs and etc. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is a detailed plan here. The schedules are explained in the action, where we could understand which activities would be developing each month. And these activities could be better detailed, containing: what would be done, in how much time, how and by whom, in addition to what smaller goals. Still, it is possible to draw any kind of visualization of the process as described in the proposal. Now talking about the budget, a total amount of 60 thousand dollars is asked, which is explained in a somewhat confusing way. \u201cProduct managers, marketers, content writers, trainers to train and develop the MVP and staff must be $40,000.\u201d Does this mean that the work of all these professionals would cost, together, 40 thousand dollars? How much would it go for each? How many hours of work would each of these people dedicate to this project, so that we can get an idea of \u200b\u200bthe price of their hours of work and conclude if the value is fair or not? \u201cFor partnerships and marketing initiatives for these startups to gain visibility. We will spend $5,000 to commercialize the initiative.\u201d If so, what would the marketing campaign look like? What strategies will be adopted, where will it be done (social networks or more traditional media, perhaps?). The proponent also states that the \u201ccost of technical development for basic infrastructure is US$ 15,000\u201d, so, adding these three values, we get the total amount of US$ 60,000. But we also don't know why the technical development of the infrastructure would need to cost 15k, in short, all values \u200b\u200bshould be better explained, clarified. And finally, speaking of the team, we have many professionals involved here, we are given their names, a very brief description of their professional roles and, in most cases, their linkedin profiles, where we can get to know them in a more practical way. and direct. I think that's the best part of the feasibility, although I think it would be better if everyone had attached a linkedin profile, or if they didn't, at least the one of some social network that they have, so that we have a way to prove the information said about everyone. It would also be positive if the details on their CVs were more detailed, if we knew more specifically what they have done so far in their careers and how they relate to our blockchain. So I think the feasibility of this proposal is good, there is a roadmap, the budget breakdown is explained in a relatively basic way, and the team's presentation is not adequate. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of the project is not bad, but at the same time it needs to be deepened to be adequate. Many indicators are mentioned that would serve to monitor how the project development process would be happening and if the desired final results were achieved. However, this data is mostly numerical, I swear that a qualitative analysis would also be necessary. Let's start with the process: fundamental indicators like \u201cnumber of startups integrated / number of startups launching their MVP / number of trained developers\u201d are cited. But, in addition to knowing the number of people, projects and startups that would be receiving this aid, I would like to know how the team of professionals in this proposal would be organizing themselves in relation to work. That is, are the weekly targets being met? Would they be working the promised hours? Would they be doing all the meetings that were agreed with the developers? It would be necessary, first of all, that we have a very detailed roadmap, by which we could have something to base ourselves on at the moment to monitor if the process was being done as planned. Afterwards, it is necessary for the proponent and some members of his team to update the Cardano community periodically (preferably monthly) on how things are going, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This must be done through direct contact with the community, using any of the various possible platforms (telegram and discord channels, online tools such as google docs, emails, in short, as you prefer). And in relation to the final results, in addition to the aforementioned data collection, it is essential that we have direct contact with the developers who were advised. The most appropriate way for us to do this in my opinion is through synchronous online dating. A meeting could be held in Town Hall to understand how they were helped, if they are now active members of the Cardano community, and if so, what activities they develop, if they still have any doubts about our ecosystem; it would be important that they were fully embraced, in addition to the technical instructions offered in this proposal, but also by other community bodies such as the Catalyst School, if they are interested in submitting proposals, that they participate in the community conversation groups, in short, that they fully enter our community. With that, I think that auditability would be increased, that the numerical suggestions would be added with more humane and careful analysis in relation to the processes and people involved in this project. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 6, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1042, "q0": "The proposal aims to solve an important problem in the cardano ecosystem such as the lack of web3 developers, I would have preferred more emphasis on the training of young talent as a solution, the proposal addresses the challenge by increasing the number of developers, also diffusion in the media and connecting with businesses, strategies are not specified to mitigate the challenges or risks identified.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Positive aspects:\n\nI can identify team members and links to their experience.\nAlthough it is short, a realistic timetable can be appreciated.\nIt explains how the project will be carried out and the necessary resources.\n\nAspects to improve:\n\nThe budget is not clearly detailed, especially the $40,000 part.\n\nI also think that the budget is not reasonable since it covers 40% of the total fund.\n\nThere is no detailed plan if more funds are needed.\n\nTechnical aspects such as the content of the program for young talent are not clearly explained.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nSpecify how much is allocated to each section: product managers, marketers, content writers, etc.Try a lower amount, probably between 10% and maximum 20% of the total funds.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The roadmap and milestones are clear, the KPIs are well specified to measure the success of the project.
