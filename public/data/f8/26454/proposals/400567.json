The idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal is very good and it totally aligns with what is asked in the challenge, because our goal here is to somehow popularize the Cardano ecosystem for the Indian audience, specifically. In this way, we would be contributing to the country's development, since people learning about Cardano could: invest in our currency, which in the long run will generate profit; actively participate in the community, for example through Catalyst; learn more about our technologies and align this with their professional activities (be they in the technology, advertising, legal, business, etc.) That is, in many ways, the local population should benefit. As well as our blockchain, of course, we need to finance ideas that help explain our technologies, through investment in ada, as I mentioned, buying and selling CNFTs, direct investment in some projects like Dapps and etc. All this will certainly be achieved if the Indian population gets to know our blockchain better, and the promotion of these events will certainly help with that. That is, in theory, this idea is perfect with what we are trying to pursue. However, in practice, it is still somewhat abstract how such events would work, little is known about each of them specifically. We know that in total there would be twelve, but we do not know which subjects would be addressed in each meeting; we don't know which professionals would lecture; nor do we know how many people are expected to be an audience for the event, or how the team will be able to publicize the events so that people are interested even without knowing what blockchain is after all. Anyway, little is said about the exact structure of each meeting, we know that there will be an educational demonstration, followed by a lecture and a moment of networking and coffee break, from what I understand. However, what is the difference between the educational session and the lecture? Maybe the target audience, maybe in the first case we are trying to reach young people and students, and in the second case people who are already involved in Cardano's technologies? In other words, my opinion is that the idea is aligned with what is sought in the challenge, but unfortunately the explanations about it are scarce, so it is not possible to fully understand how it will happen, and this compromises our confidence in the impact. Therefore, I will give a neutral grade, if the event had been better explained, the grade would probably be maximum, because the theory itself is exactly what we are looking for in this challenge. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "A roadmap is not drawn up that allows us to understand well how the necessary processes for carrying out these events would take place. The proponent explains that the events will take place in the 3 main cities, but which cities are these? It is also said that \u201cwe would measure our deliveries with a ledger that would track the number of participants throughout the year. Also, how many people can we integrate into our project catalyst through account creation. Another measure we would take is how many people per event create a wallet.\u201d These indicators are interesting to analyze the auditability of the project, however, they do not talk about the feasibility. For the project to be viable, it would be necessary for the proponent to attach a roadmap, indicating the activities that would take place according to a certain time interval (monthly, for example). These activities should talk about the pre-production of these events, everything that would need to be agreed and defined, such as physical space, which speaker would be chosen for each event, how it would be announced to people about the existence of these meetings, etc. That way we would have a solid understanding of the process, which unfortunately does not happen due to the lack of explanations. Regarding the budget, I think it's explained in a very basic way how the requested money would be used. It would cost 1500 dollars per event, 750 for space rental, 500 for the speaker and 250 for meals. But my question is the following, how these prices were defined if a) we don't even know the exact locations of each meeting, so prices can vary b) it is not defined who the speakers are, that is, maybe they charge a value above or under 500 dollars c) the value for meals should be calculated based on how many people will attend each meeting. So I think that although it is quite possible to understand the financial division, it is not so simple to believe in the need for 1500 dollars for each event since everything is still undefined. And finally, speaking of the team, we have a very diverse team here, with many people participating in the project. However, the explanations about each of them are quite superficial. We don't know much about his previous experiences because all that is revealed to us are his professional performances and a small resume is not attached. Some people have made their linkedin profiles available, so it's easier in these cases to check their previous work, what they've done so far, etc., but ideally, all of them would provide this information, not just some team members. Therefore, I think the feasibility of this project is low, with several things to be improved. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The ways to audit the proposal are quite numerical (numbers of: people we can integrate into our project catalyst + people creating portfolios + interactions on social media sites (what media?) + people viewing youtube videos + new proposals coming out from India). In addition to these indicators, in order to carry out an adequate auditability of the process, I think it is important that we monitor the work routine of the professionals involved. What would each of the people mentioned in the team part do for this project? According to the roadmap, which was not actually attached, how can we verify that activities that were promised for each month were actually fulfilled? In summary, what I want to say is: it is important to know quantities, how many people created portfolios, submitted proposals, etc., but it is also necessary for us to know how the whole process of building these events was. Once all this analysis is done, it needs to be made available to the Cardano community. How can we verify this information? Regarding the final result, the proponent again focuses a lot on a quantitative analysis, as according to him success would be measured by the number of people participating and proposals submitted. However, I would like a more humane analysis of the thing, for example: a survey with the participants, to understand how they absorbed the knowledge that was passed on. In what way do they also intend to apply this knowledge, if they will study more about ecosystem technologies, will they participate in Catalyst. If proponents of this project are born, it would be very interesting to know what these proposals were. Finally, we need to know what the real impact of all this was, both for India and for Cardano. Therefore, I think the proponent should promote a broader and richer survey, and this final survey should, as well as the partial results coming from the progress, be available to any member of the Cardano community. There are several ways to establish this bridge, but the most direct, in my view, are through Town Hall, discord groups or telegram. At this point, it is at the discretion of the bidder and his team. To conclude, in summary, what I think is that the path of auditability has started well, but it needs to go beyond the numbers and also become more accessible to all members of the ecosystem. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 9, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1578, "q0": "From the point of view of Cardano which would be funding these events, the biggest risk would seem to be that these networking events may not actually be impactful. 50 people may come out to an event, especially if there\u2019s merch and refreshments, but then what?\nGenerally increasing interest in Cardano is unlikely to be very impactful. The lack of a strategy for meaningful follow-up with any of these three segments is a significant lack, e.g. on social media or YouTube, or call-backs, mail campaigns, etc.\n\nA related problem is that the target audience group or groups aren\u2019t well defined.The key audience segments would seem to be potential investors, potential developers, and potential users of Defi, because these groups may in the future contribute back to or get involved meaningfully with Cardano. However none of these segments is specifically addressed. \nThe stated goal of onboarding new potential Catalyst proposers only aligns with Challenge goals if people being \u201conboarded\u201d to Catalyst are developers or otherwise qualified to submit meaningful proposals; this difficulty speaks to the lack of differentiation within the intended audience.\nRather the approach appears both one-off and generic, which implies mediocre impact. \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "It looks like this group will be able to book speakers and venues and to carry out this plan as described, given the team members.\nHowever the commitment of team members is very hard to assess.
