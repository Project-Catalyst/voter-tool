India has a big developer talent pool that is under-utilized.", "f6_no_assessments": 7, "f6_rating": 4.0476190476190474, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 7381, "q0": "The present challenge aims to fund proposals that at the same time benefit India and Cardano. This can be done through the education of technology professionals in the country, or working on behalf of projects being developed there that have something to do with our blockchain; it can also be done by increasing the level of education and generating employment for the local population. Regarding the benefit of Cardano, the intention is for our blockchain to expand in the region, reach more people from different layers, break barriers and become more democratic, that there is a growth in investment in Ada, creation of digital wallets and in general increment in transaction number on Cardano blockchain. With this, the proposal is directly aligned with these goals, because it intends to invest in start ups and teams of developers that work with Cardano. Proponents claim that there has been a recent boom in the country with regards to blockchain, but that this has mainly been aimed at other systems, and investment and work is needed for Cardano to occupy a place of visibility among the country's developer community. . From what I could conclude by reading this proposal, we already have fertile ground that needs to be sown, let's say, because India is a country with many students and professionals in the field of technology, but I believe that both because of the language barrier and because of the geographical distance one of the main pools, projects and investment center at Cardano (USA and Europe), this country has not had the necessary impetus to organically generate a community of professionals working on our blockchain. In this way, the proponents, who are developers and already have 3 proposals financed by Catalyst (it is very positive that they have attached their links, because we can see in practice what these ideas are), believe that with their knowledge and requested budget, a investment work in the creation of start ups that prepare these people (developers who could become key parts of our ecosystem), in the sense that in the future they can be proponents, specialize more and more on Cardano's technologies (whether through work practical or taking courses, such as the Plutus programming language). Therefore, I think that the impact of this proposal has the potential to be maximum, deserving 5 stars. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is good in some parts and needs improvement in others, so I will make suggestions on how the shallower parts could be better, in my view. About the script, I found this part of the proposal very good, extremely detailed. We know in which months the project would take place and details about what the tasks in each of them would be like, as they are listed and explained in (I believe) chronological order. It would be even more interesting if the proponents organized these tasks within weeks, that way we would understand even more how things were being organized. I think some tasks could be more detailed. For example, when they say that in March there will be a campaign (I believe that it will be entirely online on social networks) promoting Cardano and job opportunities). I would like to understand how many days this would last, on which platforms this content would be released, if it would be in video, text or informative prints, if any digital marketing and design team would be behind this part of the proposal... In April some tasks could also be better clarified, such as \u201cencouraging interns to participate in pioneering courses to develop essential skills\u201d. How would these incentives be? Overall, I think the script is very good, but it could be better if it were even more temporally organized and some tasks were even more detailed and explained. Now about the budget, I think it's possible to understand why 30k was requested, but they don't establish a clear financial division. They explain which parts would cost so much, but in regards to that I think there could be more detail. For example, most of the amount would go towards the salary of the developer and his intern. Their work would last 6 months. But how many hours per week? If this were said, we would know the hourly value of each person's work. In total, how much of the 25k would go to the developer and how much would go to the intern? Would they work in parallel or would the intern do complementary tasks that would help the developer achieve his goals faster? The other 5k would go to a number of smaller expenses like HR, marketing, etc. But how much would go for each? And who are the people who would work on these, let's say, non-technical parts (at least in regards to blockchain)? What would your work routines be like? And finally, about the team, I think this part also leaves a little to be desired in terms of detail. We know there are two developers here (Advait Joglekar and Adnan Khan) and they are Catalyst winners. But it doesn't say a resume of what they've done so far, sure we have links to their winning proposals, but what work did they do in addition to that? How did they start working at Cardano? I would like more personal information about each, such as their linkedin profiles for example, so that we can get to know who they are, in addition to their funded projects. I also wanted to know who the marketing and HR people are, the intern and so on, in short: I wanted to get to know the team completely, with basic information about everyone. Therefore, feasibility can improve through a more detailed explanation of the budget and staff. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I think the proponents have a good view of what it would be like to audit this proposal in relation to the results, as they provide us with quantitative (very satisfactory) and qualitative (which can be improved) indicators. In terms of numbers, we have many ways to measure whether the project has achieved what it wanted: \u201cnumber of developers trained, number of new products or features developed on our dApps, number of interns on board, number of freshmen participating in pioneer programs of the IOHK through us\u201d etc and etc. This would in fact be direct and statistical ways of demonstrating that the mission was actually accomplished. Now, looking at this in a more human way, the goal would be to create a \u201cbuzz\u201d in the Indian developer community, in order for them to realize the employment opportunities at Cardano and how our blockchain is differentiated and has many advantages. It is intended that the professionals in question become active members of the community, either through Catalyst, as proponents, or by developing products (Dapps and etc) from scratch with our blockchain technologies. I think that in addition to HOW MANY developers were \u201cconverted\u201d with this project, proponents should also analyze HOW. It would be interesting for them to establish a later contact with these professionals, in order to understand where to go, what they are doing, what they are working with, how they can bring a return on the investment made in them. I think this research should be done and the result taken to the rest of the Cardano community. Regarding the process, the proponents do not mention many ways to follow the daily development of their project, I think we should promote monthly meetings between the team and the community, in order to know how the delivery of partial results is going. In this way, I think that yes, it would be possible to fully audit the proposal, we just need to focus our attention not only on numbers and not only on the final result, but also on partial deliveries and what the developers would be working on after the project. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 8, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 503, "q0": "This proposal appears to be basically an ask for a capital investment to grow the Skrypt Labs startup team of Cardano blockchain developers in India. They would use the money to hire two developers and an intern, with enough money to sustain them for six months. They also seem to mention additional interns and outreach/training, although if there is any real plan around that is unclear. I think the primary premise is hiring additional qualified developers and at least one additional trainees for their startup team in India. For what it's worth, I think its a worthwhile proposal, well aligned with the Campaign goals of onboarding new developers in India, and raising awareness of Cardano in India. I am rating impact as only a four because while I agree that there is impact, two developers and an intern seems to be quite a limited impact. Additionally, I am unclear on the future sustainability of this fledging business. They have built some good-looking products which is great, but there is no clue given as whether these are expected to be profitable (now or in the future) or just overall if they have a strategy for sustaining and growing their business. (I'm not saying they DON'T but I can't figure it out from what they have shared and linked here. For a stronger proposal, I would want to know more about the startup business we are being asked to invest in - something like a \"business plan\".", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The skills and experience of the two-developer Skrypt Labs team is clear in the proposal and linked materials. I feel confident in their abilities as builders in the ecosystem, and in their ability to hire and train qualified developers from different backgrounds who have an interest in learning and building on Cardano. \nThe budget for six months salary for two new developers and an intern is modest from an American perspective (mine) a quick Google search reveals that it is indeed reasonable for India.\nThe plan for future funding beyond the six month onramp is unclear. It seems that it might be just that the new hires will have to learn to hustle - finding funded gigs to work on or making their own proposals to Project Catalyst. I would like to see this explained more clearly, as I am somewhat reading between the lines and extrapolating to understand what the longer term plan might be. \nI think this kind of \"Get Started Now, Figure It Out Later\" kind of approach is fairly common with some entrepreneurs, even some successful ones, and our whole ecosystem is nothing if not entrepreneureal! Nevertheless, I'd like to encourage these proposers to put a little more clarity around business plans and explaining why they are a good investment. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The roadmap for interviewing, hiring and training is clear and reasonable. They are clearly identifying the problem/need for more developers in India, and have provided a clear plan to hire two more plus an intern with funding provided from Catalyst. Their KPIs include simply hiring the humans, but also projects completed, GitHub commits, and \"Number of Interns\" participating. (This last point is something that is unclear in the proposal. They are asking for funding to hire one intern for six months, but in other places seem to be talking about multiple interns and \"freshers\". I am not sure where these connect to the plan)\nOverall, while it's nice to hear all the hopes and dreams for a project, I would like to have a clearer picture of what \"Done\" would mean for this funded project.

However, the proportion of the population in rural, unbanked, and poverty-stricken areas is significant due to the lack of startups. The proponent came up with the idea of expanding his team and attracting developers to join with Cardano and create global Blockchain products.
