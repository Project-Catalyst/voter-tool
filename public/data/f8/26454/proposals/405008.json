They propose to solve the problem by doing some research and extending a Cardano DApp to at least 5 end-users. There is some conflicting or confusing information in the proposal: in the Roadmap, they are looking to onboard 5 mediators by the end of 2022. In the success metrics section they mention onboarding 40 (more) Indian mediators in a year - but it doesn't seem like they are committing to this outcome (since it's not on the roadmap or deliverables section). In any case, onboarding something less than 50 users in India in the coming year, is an underwhelming prospect for impact. This proposal does address the challenge goal of creating relationships and DApps for India.  However, this proposal seems to be confused about whether it's a RESEARCH proposal or a DApp Delivery proposal. The budget it a bit high for a research-only proposal, and a bit low for a full-throttle solution delivery. The promised deliverables don't fully commit to one or the other either. The plan for future/scaling seems weak because there is no plans or accommodations really mentioned. They do talk about some success metrics beyond the 3 month funding request, but no mention of how ongoing efforts will be funded. This proposal has good potential impact, but it could be improved by providing more clarity about how this effort will grow from a small research+MVP project into a long-term success with widespread adoption. I'd be happier with the proposal as written if it was perhaps framed as primarily-research (with clearer research deliverables) with a test market-research component (onboarding 5 users, etc etc.) Then perhaps we could expect to see a better-detailed followup proposal, for more funding, when the results of initial research are in.     *I give this proposal an IMPACT rating of 4.*\t\t\t", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Regarding FEASIBILITY: The proposing team appears to have great alignment of skills and experience needed, as shown by the team members listed, their impressive and relevant CVs, as well as those of the wider LoxeInc team on their website.  There is a budget mentioned, but it is not as clear as it could be: The line items themselves are clear, but they don't say enough.  For example, it's not at all clear to me how 3k is an appropriate budget to \"localize\" and launch an app for a whole country. They mention that their team members will be working on the effort \"Part time\" for three months, but there is no detail what that really means. Based on the very low numbers, its seems like they will be quite underpaid, or are only committing to very few hours - none of this is made clear.  This proposal will require additional funding (they mention goals and success metrics beyond the 3-month funding period), but there is no apparent plan for where it will come from. Perhaps they are counting on Catalyst for each step of the way -- and I don't think that's necessarily bad -- but I'd like to see it explained one way or another.  I am not sure if the timeline is realistic because frankly the deliverables are fairly vague. Other than onboarding 5 mediators, they are committing to 3 months of research & relationship-building. It's not clear exactly what answers they are looking for with their research, or how their relationship-building will be quantified. Solution design and technology tools are clearly explained in their previous funded proposal.  It is not clear if potential risks have been properly considered because they mention the risk of having trouble connecting with local people and crossing cultural barriers, and just say that this experience would be \"Valuable.\" I don't entirely disagree but would also like to understand how they might be planning to surmount these barriers.  The feasibility of this proposal is iffy. To get a better rating for feasibility I would suggest locating at least one Indian human who is interested in this project and is willing to help sculp this proposal and offer localized insights to help mitigate risks and increase the likelihood of meaningful success. OR, this project could be re-written as a research-only effort (with an appropriate budget for that) with one goal being to locate and onboard one or more such humans.        *I give this proposal a FEASIBILITY rating of 3*\t\t\t", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Regarding Auditability: This proposal does have a clear timeline, with the steps along the way clearly defined:   Success metrics are described, but I think they could be much better, because other than the rather low numbers of onboarded users that they are shooting for, the other metrics are not especially quantifiable - or even really defined. How will you demonstrate \"Outreach\"?  \n\nThe problem is clearly exlained. In short: localized DApps in India, decentralized and trustworthy mediation services for more people.  However, I am not sure if the solution described would really solve the problem because this proposal doesn't commit fully to research or DApp-building and marketing.   \n\nThe auditability of this proposal could be improved by making the deliverables more quantifiable, or impactful. If the goal was to onboard users, I would like to see an impact greater than 5 users. If the goal is to perform research, I would like to see a list of : How many Universities will you work with, and how will those relationships be explained and reported back to the community? What research questions will you answer, and where can the community go to read about these results?           *I give this proposal an AUDITABILITY rating of 3*\t\t\t", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1180", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 7460, "q0": "This proposal fully fits the objectives of the challenge, because here we are looking for ways to benefit Cardano and India in parallel. This will certainly happen with this project, since the activities of the Mediators.ai platform (previously called Win Win) would be expanded to the country. This platform promotes the conciliation of conflicts outside the judicial system, aiming to avoid unnecessary expenses and bureaucracy. In this way, Indians would be directly benefited. Both because they can submit their problem situations on the platform, in order to try to solve them with more transparency, using the benefits supported by our Cardano ecosystem. This could be done if expensive and unnecessary fees were avoided, for example, and being able to have all the information about the action minted on the blockchain and with that they would be immutable and more secure; and for those Indians who decide to be mediators, who prepare and qualify for it, as this is certainly a good opportunity for extra income for those who have the profile of the vacancy and are properly educated. This project will also be beneficial for Cardano since our technologies would be adopted in a new activity in that country. This can bring many benefits, such as increasing trust in blockchain technology; also, the demystification of some prejudices such as \u201cblockchain is just investing in cryptocurrencies, that is, a risky way to get rich quickly); in terms of popularization. Once people get to know one of the uses of blockchain, they can become more interested in the subject, researching and learning other ways to become active members of our community. It is positive that this proposal is an extension of a project that is already underway and is already taking place in the United States - the expansion to India means studying the market, understanding its specificities and adapting the instances of the Mediators.ai platform according to the results of this research. And this will probably happen successfully, because of all the experience that the team already has in this same project. So I think the impact will be very positive, both for India and Cardano. Note: 5. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is great because the proponents provide us with all the information we need to know what would happen, when, how, for how much money and who would be involved in it. But let's go by parts. Regarding the script, the months in which the project would be developing are informed: September, October and November. We know exactly what activities were going to take place in each of these periods, so we have a great understanding of the process to come. So the script part is fine. Now moving to the budget, the requested money would be divided into 3 parts: the salary of the mediator, the salary of one of the members of the Mediators.ai platform and also the value of the platform located in India. Regarding this part, I think there could be a little more detail, for example: how many hours the professionals involved would work; what constitutes this expense of the platform located in India (would it be some kind of tax? This is not so clear to me). So I think it is possible for us to understand how the requested money would be used, but it would be even better understood if these details were provided. Finally, analyzing the team, I think this is the most trusting part of the whole proposal, since a) all members inform their names, describe in an extensive way what they have done so far in their professional careers, being very active people in the Cardano ecosystem, who have already delivered other initiatives outside this platform 2) they are part of the company team (Loxe Inc.) that works with Cardano's blockchain, this demonstrates how experienced they are with the technologies that relate to it of our ecosystem c) in addition, as I mentioned in the impact part, this proposal is about the evolution of something that already exists. This project is already a reality, they already make the activities of the platform happen in the United States d) they are also expanding the platform to Latin America, which demonstrates how, in addition to having a lot of technique, they also already have some experience in how to make that the initiative adapts to new contexts. Therefore, the feasibility is very good, there is a lot of security in the whole, and my only suggestion is the increase in the hours spent by professionals on this project, in the budget part. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Finally, we will analyze the auditability of this proposal. We know that on progress, the proposers will organize themselves internally through a methodology chosen by them (it would be interesting to explain more about this, as I believe that most readers of the proposal do not know which methodology exactly this is). Regarding how the partial results would come to the knowledge of the Cardano community, they say that reports will be made, which will likely contain updates on how the monthly activities were performed as well as what goals were achieved in that period of time. These reports will be shared in monthly meetings with IOG project coordinators. In this way, a lot of security is passed on how the project will be monitored as it progresses. Now, speaking of the final results, the proponents point out what are the expected results for a period of 3, 6 and 12 months after funding. This generates a very good understanding of what success would be, we know how many mediators they intend to be working at Japan's Mediators.ai. It would also be interesting for the proponents to do a survey on how this project impacted the Japanese public, have people in that country shown themselves to be open to adopting this alternative form of conflict resolution? Did this also help to demystify what blockchain is over there? Was it an important factor in the widespread adoption of Cardano in that country? Finally, a more qualitative analysis would also be interesting, in order to understand the consequences of this proposal for both Japan and Cardano. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 4, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3103, "q0": "This is a decentralized dispute resolution platform with a marketplace built on the cardano blockchain.
