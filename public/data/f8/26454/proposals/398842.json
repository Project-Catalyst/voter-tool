Each word costs 0.08 for complete translation to voicing. This cost comes to 1200 and into 3 months it is 3600.  Then this language needs its own Social media campaign since the users of one language would not care about social media campaigns in another language.

In all other respects they are essential the same. Hence it is almost impossible to write 19 distinct assessments, I have tried to find specific differentiators but have also looked at the package of proposals as a whole as, I believe, this will add greater value to the voter. Looking at this specific proposal for translating videos into Marathi, it largely meets the challenge brief in seeking to broaden the horizons of the Cardano ecosystem. The proposer should be praised for taking the initiative. I would suggest the proposer uses the comments section to explain voters their rationale behind this multi-proposal approach. That should help with transparency and help people make an informed decision. For example: Are they looking for voters to decide on which languages they prefer thus restricting the choice to the existing community. This kind of defeats the purpose of reaching out to new communities. If this is the case I have done a rudimentary research on number of people speaking each language to help the voters make an informed decision. Given more time, an in depth analysis of demographics would be useful showing current literacy levels, access to technology, levels of education, English speakers, etc in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

In simple terms we are looking at a total ask of $135,900 of which $38,000 (28%) is contingency. At a proposal level that is $7100 budget with $2000 contingency. My project planning head immediately points to the 28% contingency. It is not clear what this is set aside for. A risk of ADA price fluctuation is noted in the proposals, however one of the proposed mitigations for that is a 10% contingency, the other being to sell funds privately to ADA holders. In addition the proposals states \u201cWe have ample resources to complete the project on time and within budget\u2019, once again raising the question on the need for such a large contingency in proportion to the budget? Now looking at what is to be delivered. Each proposal states the YouTube channel will be launched with 6 videos. We have to assume that means 6 videos translated in all 19 languages should they all be funded. After 3 months 10-20 videos (each translated in 19 languages) That gives us 380 translations in total at an average of 4 per day. I have run this by someone with experience in this area and their reaction was \u2018its going to need a considerable team\u2019. So, let\u2019s look at the evidence of a team with the skills to deliver this proposal. The proposer claims to have many years experience in this field but this is impossible to verify based on the evidence (LinkedIn profile) provided. The other key resource (Muthiah) presents as a trilingual translator. Specific languages are not mentioned so very difficult to validate of if they have the skills for this specific proposal Two other individuals are listed, their LinkedIn in profile are well populated but don\u2019t display the skills required to deliver this project. That leave us with the \u201cextensive network of Master translators\u201d. Again no evidence of their existence of previous work exists so impossible to evaluate. I believe the proposer has a lot to offer the ecosystem and can suggest the following: 1. Help the voter understand the need for 19 similar proposals 2. Provide evidence that they have access to the skills required 3. Look at a small scope with a set of languages he or Muthiah are comfortable with. Use this as a POC on both the translation and engagement side. SHOW the community this proposal is growing adoption. 4. Take the learnings (e.g. which types of video are interesting your audience) and if a larger (multi language) proposal is what is required submit it in a future fund leveraging in the economies of scale that will naturally provide on the maintenance of socials, contingency & marketing.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The metrics are sensible in terms of measuring engagement on youtube which is a great basic piece to measure.

Therefore, translating videos from very relevant youtube channels that talk about Cardano, such as Emurgo, Cardano Foundtain and the IOHK channel, will be able to bring to many Indians safe and accessible knowledge about our blockchain. We know that the main difficulty for non-English speakers is understanding complex content in a language other than their mother tongue. It is not simple to learn about blockchain, about cryptocurrencies, go beyond the basics that people usually know, understand the differences and advantages of the Cardano ecosystem in relation to other blockchains, let alone if this is not taught in our own language. Therefore, if the contents of the aforementioned channels and a few others (which ones? It would be good to know them so that we know that they are as reliable as those that are said) were properly translated into Marathi, the speakers of that language will have a much simpler access to contents that surround the Cardano ecosystem. With this, doors will open, they will discover opportunities for both investment (like buying and delegating ada, for example) and extra income (if they work as CAs and vCAs on Catalyst, for example). Or even, if they are people in the technology, legal and business areas, the areas that most need manpower in the proposals, they can find a steady and very profitable job here. Thus, the objective of benefiting India would be fully achieved. Logically, the Cardano ecosystem would also benefit a lot in this story, as new members would be added to the community, who can become investors, project workers, who will likely create digital wallets, Ada, CNFTs, which will help in the creation of Dapps ; in general: they will make our blockchain grow, as we dream so much. I truly believe that this proposal has the potential for maximum, extremely positive impact. However, I think it could be better explained which contents exactly will be translated, which specific subjects, in which order and etc, as I will comment better on the topic of feasibility. Restricting myself to impact, this project, in my opinion, deserves top marks. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the money, I think this could have been explained better. We don't know what the marketing campaign will be like, so I can't justify the need for $1200 to be set aside for this. I don't know what a contingency fee would be, I would like the concept of this to be explained and also why it would cost 2 thousand dollars. Regarding the money requested for translations themselves, I think it could be measured in another way, it is not feasible to audit whether as many words were actually translated as promised. It would be safer, in terms of verification, if the price was defined by video minutes or even by the hourly rate of the person working on that part. About the team, this part of the proposal is very good, the participants are presented in an individualized way and very rich in details. Their names are said, a long description of professional activities they have performed so far, social network profiles are attached to most of them, etc. My suggestion for improvement is to clarify who would do what within this project. Now about the planning schedule, that is, the roadmap: the activities are not explored with the same richness of detail that we found in the team's presentation, it is said that they would be done in the 3 months of the project in a very shallow way. The first month would be more about organizing the team and starting the translations, while in the others, content production and videos would be continued. As I mentioned in impact: we would like to understand what subjects would be addressed, in what order, how basic knowledge would be deepened, if there would be any kind of contact with the subscribers, to clarify if they had doubts. In general, but details about the generated content. In general, I think the feasibility still has a lot of work to do, so I'll keep a neutral opinion here. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Finally, let's assess whether the proposal is auditable. I think that in addition to the monthly verification of translated videos on youtube, the team should provide more complete feedback at the end of each month. It can be a summary of how the activities were developed in that period of time, if everything went as planned, if the translators followed their work routines with commitment, if the promised minutes for the month were delivered, if there were problems between the team or in the generation of content... Realizing if the final result of each month was delivered is important, essential, but knowing the pre-production of that too. Regarding the final results, I think we should go beyond a quantitative listing of information such as number of subscribers, comments, hours viewed, etc. How would the target audience be absorbing the content learned? It would be very useful if they created some way for these people to communicate continuously, like a group on telegram, for example, through which they could help each other and where a survey could be launched after the 3 months of the project. This research would aim to understand more fully how the translations affected Marathi speakers. How are they participating in the Cardano ecosystem now? Did they become a bidder, or CAs, vCas? Are you studying about plutus, in the case of programmers? Are designers looking for projects to work on? Have investments by this part of India's population increased? If yes, how? All this should be clarified and taken to the community, either through a video on youtube, posted on the channel itself, a final report written and sent to the Project Catalyst telegram channel, anyway...

It is proposed to specify a clear period for activities to be divided into 3 months. The author has a team fluent in all languages \u200b\u200bwith more than 20 years in the industry. I believe the project's roadmap will be on schedule as the author promised. The budget is 7.100 USD, detailed and listed by the author for each category. With the amount listed for each month, I find the budget sufficient to check the progress of the proposal. Suggest an easy way to measure success through the metrics the author has listed. . . It is surprising with the number of years of experience that the group has given, the 4-member group has more than 20 years of experience. I do not doubt the experience of the propagandists, they are all elite members, members that we can follow through social networking sites. With a solid team of experts with good leadership, based on the information provided I think this project will be successful.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "(\"The author writes the proposal in different countries, but the content will mostly be the same, so when I analyze the project there will be similar sentences\").

The author gives great ideas it tackles effectively the challenge, if it is funded I believe the project will be very successful it will have a good impact on making more people aware of Cardano. However, the success of this project is tied to the success of other projects so I think the risk will be multiplied. . .

This proposal, therefore, falls within the challenge setting purpose. The translation duration off 120 minutes per month seems so little for a person who would like to discover about something new. If the translated time can be increased, it would be more attractive. Later on, the proposal can be scaled up easily by translating to Marathi more videos, clips and other channels such as the Emurgo and Cardano Foundation Youtube channel. In the proposal, some risks are identified accurately and some mitigation solutions for those risks are reasonably presented, enhancing the chance of project success and ensuring project impact to the Marathi speaking people in India.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project's plan of uploading one video every three days sounds more feasible if the duration of each video is roughly estimated. Besides, proposal roadmap is clear and straight forward. The translation of 120 minutes video per month seems below standard is therefore feasible. For a person who would like to discover more about blockchain, in general, and Cardano, in particular, the duration of 120 minutes per month of translated video seems too small. If the proposers can increase the duration of translated video, it would have greater impact on the community. In addition, the founder team is master of translation with clear reference links for audience to assess at any time. Moreover, the requested budget sounds reasonable. It is broken down into assessable details, either. Total requested budge of 7100$ is reasonable. In summary, there is a good chance that the proposal is will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Proposal's roadmap has been presented clearly since it is quite straightforward. The measurement of success has been defined, also. If the metrics for success has been quantitatively defined, the proposal would be auditable.

How many numbers of average views per video would the project be classified as success? How many numbers of watching hours would the project be classified as success? How many numbers of comments would the project be classified as success? How many numbers of shares would the project be classified as success?

So thank you once again!"}, {"id": 8578, "q0": "The \u201cCardano in Marathi\u201d proposal in the \u201cGrow India, Grow Cardano\u201d challenge is for translating Cardano related video content into Marathi. The same team has submitted 15 functionally identical proposals, each covering a different language of the Indian subcontinent. I would like to point out that in this case, this is not necessarily a problem as each proposal covers essentially a different service. The aim of each is to translate a YouTube video every 3 days, in this case into Marathi.\n\nI have meticulously verified the text of all 15 proposals in a text editor that allows for snapshots and comparisons between snapshots (Scrivener), to make sure the text of the proposals is the same. With a few minor exceptions of paragraphs being present in some proposals, but not in others, I can say with confidence that they are functionally identical proposals. As such I will be reviewing the proposals as a proposal group.\n\nGiven India\u2019s importance in the IT world, and especially considering its potential future growth my view is that this group of proposals would represent a very good investment for the Cardano community, and could have a great impact on attracting Indians to the ecosystem.\n\nThe main thing that I think is missing from this proposal group is the fact that they do not reference or acknowledge each other. If they did, the voters would get a much clearer picture of the project\u2019s scope overall and be able to make much more informed decisions as a result. I would advise that in the future, if the proposals are to be resubmitted separately, the proposer should clearly indicate that the proposals are part of a proposal group and perhaps write a paragraph or two about the vision behind the project as a whole and how they plan to implement it, especially since the same people will be responsible for the project management, logistics and implementation of the whole set of proposals.\n\nI can understand the reasoning behind submitting each language translation as a new proposal, so that the Cardano community can choose to fund as many as they think is necessary, and that the project can still go ahead if only a few languages are funded. However, I also feel that the average voter, who may only come across 2-3 proposals should have been made aware of the existence of the proposal group. \n\nThe proposers provide the number of speakers for each language in each category, however as the proposals do not reference each other I will make a list of all languages the proposers have submitted proposals for, in order of the number of worldwide speakers:\n\n\t1)\tHindi - 528 million speakers globally\n\t2)\tUrdu - 280 million speakers globally\n\t3)\tBengali - 250 million speakers globally\n\t4)\tPunjabi - 113 million speakers globally\n\t5)\tMarathi - 83 million speakers globally (this proposal)\n\t6)\tTelugu - 83 million speakers globally\n\t7)\tGujarati - 75 million speakers globally\n\t8)\tTamil - 75 million speakers globally\n\t9)\tKannada - 56 million speakers globally\n\t10)\tBhojpuri - 51 million speakers globally\n\t11)\tOdia - 39 million speakers globally\n\t12)\tMalayalam - 39 million speakers globally\n\t13)\tNepali - 25 million speakers globally\n\t14)\tSinhala - 25 million speakers globally\n\t15)\tAssamese - 24 million speakers globally\n\nI have cross-checked these figures with the information provided in the Languages of India Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_India , and for the most part they check out. There are a few small discrepancies, but that is perfectly understandable given the dataset, even the Wikipedia article feature 2 separate lists with slightly varying numbers. Not on the lists in the article are Nepali (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_language) and Sinhala (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhala_language).\n\nI have also compiled a list of links to all the proposals in the group for easier reference:\n\n\t\u2022\tCardano in Hindi - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398838 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Urdu - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398847 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Bengali - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398841 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Punjabi - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398857 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Marathi (this proposal) -  https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398842 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Telugu - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398843  \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Gujarati - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398845 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Tamil - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398840 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Kannada - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398850 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Bhojpuri - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398981 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Odia - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398853 \n\t\u2022\tMalayalam - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398856 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Nepali - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398858 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Sinhala - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404484 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Assamese - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398980 \n\nThere are a few inconsistencies, meaning the authors failed to update each proposal with the correct language, or, in a few instances, the number of speakers internationally is not consistent within a proposal, however, that is understandable given the number of proposals they had to keep track off.\n\nOverall, even though the proposal itself could definitely use some more work and could have been better written and more refined in a number of areas, the initiative itself is worthwhile and it\u2019s a big plus for the Cardano translation effort that we have access in our community to such well-connected individuals in the translation field that are offering their services at very competitive rates.\n\nThe budget for translating a single language is very reasonable at $7,100, however, all the languages combined add up to almost 3 quarters of the total category budget, $106,500 out of $150,000. While the initiative to make Cardano content accessible in various Indian languages is certainly worthwhile it is up to the Cardano community to decide which to prioritise and fund and hopefully this overview will assist with that.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Also indicated in the Impact section of my assessment of this proposal, \u201cCardano in Marathi\u201d, is part of a group of proposals that aim to translate IOHK YouTube content into 15 Indian languages. As the proposals are functionally identical, my reviews will also be almost the same. However, reviewing a group of 15 proposals took almost the same amount of time as assessing 15 unique proposals, because of the steps described in the Impact section of my assessment. \n\nThe roadmap is very detailed and easy to follow. It makes perfect sense for the projects.\n\nThe budget requested by the team is very reasonable and a portion of it, $2000 out of $7100 is set aside for contingencies, meaning that even if unforeseen situations were to happen the team should be able to deal with them and deliver the product.\n\nAll the 15 proposals promise to \u201cTranslate the entire content of IOHK in stages\u201d, however since that is a monumental task I would have liked to see more indications about their plan of action, and what they plan to start with. The proposals mention applying for future Catalyst funding\t if the project is to continue. \n\nSince the proposals\u2019 primary focus is translating YouTube videos from the IOG channel, I would advise contacting them and coordinating with IOG on this effort. Especially if multiple proposals will be funded.\n\nThis could result in multiple benefits. For instance, the proposals don\u2019t specify how the translations are to be handled, if they intend to bake them in, hardcode them in the videos, or if they are to be presented as CC (close captions).\nIf the translations are baked in, it would make sense for IOG to provide them with the original video files. This way the team won\u2019t have to download the highly compressed video file from YouTube and upload a video file that has gone through multiple compressions, greatly reducing quality.\nIOG could get access to the text of the translations to be included in its primary videos, if wished, as CC (close captions).\n\nThe description of the team members involved with this project is very detailed and they seem more than competent to get the job done. The included LinkedIn profile links were helpful, however the LinkedIn profiles were kind of sparse for some of the team members. But, that didn\u2019t constitute a problem since enough info is given in the proposals themselves.\n\nThe roles that the team members mentioned in the proposal will take within the projects are not exactly specified. However, I assume they will be mostly responsible for the project management of the proposals and the translations will be handled by the \u201cMaster Translators\u201d mentioned several times in the proposal. If this is the case, I would have liked to see more details around this and how they plan to recruit. However, given the stated experience of the proposals my level of confidence that they will get the job done is high.\n\nI particularly appreciated that, unlike many other proposers, the team behind this proposal has taken the time to properly identify and address a long list of risks/problems that could occur during the translation process. This definitely increases the feasibility of the proposals.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As already mentioned in the Impact and Feasibility sections of the assessment, \u201cCardano in Marathi\u201d, is just one in a group of 15 proposals that aim to translate IOHK YouTube content into 15 Indian languages. Marathi, in the case of this proposal.\n\nGiven that translated YouTube videos are the main deliverables to track for this group of 15 proposals the metrics presented in the auditability section should be sufficient to verify the evolution of the projects as they all have to do with engagement on the platform.\n\n As the output of these projects is YouTube videos, the quality of the translations will only be able to be verified by speakers of the 15 languages which the projects aim to produce translations for, but that is beyond the scope of current Catalyst auditability requirements. \n\nThe definitions of success given are more or less a copy/paste of the metrics presented in the initial section of the Auditability part of the proposals and various other parts of the proposal. However, the initial paragraph does offer some info about what the team hopes to accomplish with this overarching project that spans 15 Catalyst proposals in this round.\nIn the future, I would definitely recommend giving more thought to this section of the proposals and rewriting it. For instance, attaching clear values to each of the metrics given would have turned them into milestones/goals; an example: \u201c15000 average views per video\u201d. But, ultimately this doesn\u2019t carry much weight in this case, given the nature of the project and the set of proposals.
