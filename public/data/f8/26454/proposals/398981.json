In all other respects they are essential the same. Hence it is almost impossible to write 19 distinct assessments, I have tried to find specific differentiators but have also looked at the package of proposals as a whole as, I believe, this will add greater value to the voter. Looking at this specific proposal for translating videos into Bhojpuri, it largely meets the challenge brief in seeking to broaden the horizons of the Cardano ecosystem. The proposer should be praised for taking the initiative. I would suggest the proposer uses the comments section to explain voters their rationale behind this multi-proposal approach. That should help with transparency and help people make an informed decision. For example: Are they looking for voters to decide on which languages they prefer thus restricting the choice to the existing community. This kind of defeats the purpose of reaching out to new communities. If this is the case I have done a rudimentary research on number of people speaking each language to help the voters make an informed decision. Given more time, an in depth analysis of demographics would be useful showing current literacy levels, access to technology, levels of education, English speakers, etc in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Bhojpuri ranks in the bottom 6 so maybe not the highest priority? 1.Hindi:615M 2.Bengali:265M 3.Urdu:170M 4.Punjabi:126M 5.Marathi:95M 6.Telugu:93M 7.Tamil:81M 8.Gujarati:61M 9.Kannada:56M 10.Bhojpuri:50M 11.Odia:38M 12.Malayalam:38M 13.Sinhala:17M 14.Nepali :17M 15.Assamese:15M Where the voter needs to pay particular attention is the entirety of the ask.

In simple terms we are looking at a total ask of $135,900 of which $38,000 (28%) is contingency. At a proposal level that is $7100 budget with $2000 contingency. My project planning head immediately points to the 28% contingency. It is not clear what this is set aside for. A risk of ADA price fluctuation is noted in the proposals, however one of the proposed mitigations for that is a 10% contingency, the other being to sell funds privately to ADA holders. In addition the proposals states \u201cWe have ample resources to complete the project on time and within budget\u2019, once again raising the question on the need for such a large contingency in proportion to the budget? Now looking at what is to be delivered. Each proposal states the YouTube channel will be launched with 6 videos. We have to assume that means 6 videos translated in all 19 languages should they all be funded. After 3 months 10-20 videos (each translated in 19 languages) That gives us 380 translations in total at an average of 4 per day. I have run this by someone with experience in this area and their reaction was \u2018its going to need a considerable team\u2019. So, let\u2019s look at the evidence of a team with the skills to deliver this proposal. The proposer claims to have many years experience in this field but this is impossible to verify based on the evidence (LinkedIn profile) provided. The other key resource (Muthiah) presents as a trilingual translator. Specific languages are not mentioned so very difficult to validate of if they have the skills for this specific proposal Two other individuals are listed, their LinkedIn in profile are well populated but don\u2019t display the skills required to deliver this project. That leave us with the \u201cextensive network of Master translators\u201d. Again no evidence of their existence of previous work exists so impossible to evaluate. I believe the proposer has a lot to offer the ecosystem and can suggest the following: 1. Help the voter understand the need for 19 similar proposals 2. Provide evidence that they have access to the skills required 3. Look at a small scope with a set of languages he or Muthiah are comfortable with. Use this as a POC on both the translation and engagement side. SHOW the community this proposal is growing adoption. 4. Take the learnings (e.g. which types of video are interesting your audience) and if a larger (multi language) proposal is what is required submit it in a future fund leveraging in the economies of scale that will naturally provide on the maintenance of socials, contingency & marketing.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The metrics are sensible in terms of measuring engagement on youtube which is a great basic piece to measure.

So this assessor is talking nonsense\n\n "}, {"id": 7355, "q0": "The proposal is about translating content from the \u201cEmurgo and Cardano Foundation Youtube channel\u201d into a native Indian language, but it is a bit confusing because the proponent cites its languages: Bhojpuri (\u201cProvide translated videos in Bhojpuri educating the Bhojpuri community in India as well as internationally about Cardano and its ecosystem as well as news and current affairs regarding the Cardano Project\u201d) and Hindi (\u201cThus Hindi speakers cannot learn in their native language. There are 51 million Bhojpuri speakers in India and around the world\u201d) . Anyway, I think that, apart from this confusion, the proposal is a good idea and fits very well with the objectives of the challenge. We know that the biggest difficulty in making Cardano a popular and widely used blockchain is, among others, the language barrier, and if this is overcome, surely more people would have access to the technologies of our ecosystem. In this way, the goal of expanding Cardano to India would be fully achieved, as it would be possible for people to learn about what blockchain is, what Ada is (how to acquire and degas), what are CNFTs and NFTs, what are the cases of use of smart contracts and many other matters that relate to our ecosystem. This would organically benefit this audience, as a) people connected with technology (whether students or professionals) will be presented with a range of possibilities, as there is a great need for skilled labor in Catalyst projects, for example. In fact, not only people in the programming and computing area in general, but also professionals in the business and law fields (I notice that these areas are very popular) b) people could invest in our currency that certainly has the prospect of appreciating, or that is, this could be a good source of income (although not so safe, very profitable). I found it interesting that the proponent has already defined the main metrics and objectives of the proposal; this allows us to have greater clarity on what is being aimed at and certainly makes it easier for the professionals involved to focus, in addition to being of great help for the community to audit the project, as I will comment on the last topic of analysis. However, it would be necessary for the proponent to define which language he will ultimately translate as well as the subjects that would be addressed. To finish my opinion: the proposal in theory perfectly meets the requirements of the challenge, but in practice it is still a little confusing. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Let's start by analyzing the script. I think the explanations provided about each month could be more precise, we don't know, for example, how the proponent will do to bring the team together (will this be online or in person, will all the professionals presented in the team part work in every step of the process?). Now about producing 120 minutes of video a month, how would that be done? How would the pre-production of the video be organized, that is, who would dub, who would subtitle? How would the videos to be translated first and then be defined? By the way, about the amount of videos, the proponent says that 1 video would be released every three 3, so the logic would be that at the end of three months the channel would have 30 videos at least right? Because a month has an average of 30 days, 30 days divided by 3 would be 10 videos per month. In three months, 30 videos, but he says the goal is for 10 to 20 videos to be released, so I don't quite understand how he got to this result. Anyway, in addition to defining the amount more precisely for the videos, it would be important for him to outline which subjects would be translated exactly and in which order. It would be very positive if he had created a playlist with the videos he intends to translate. That way we would have a very clear idea of \u200b\u200bwhat would be done during the proposal development process. Now talking about the following months, he could have detailed better how this process of establishing partnerships would take place, that is, with whom he intends to establish them and in what way. Now moving on to the division of the requested funding, the proponent claims that it is based on an amount of 15,000 translated words. But how can this be accurately monitored? I think it would be more interesting if he promised, as we have in the script, 120 minutes per month, so it's much easier for the community to check if the amount of content that was promised has been translated. The budget is divided into small parts, the part of the salary of those involved in my view is very well detailed, but the parts referring to social networks and also the payment of the contingency fee should be more explained. I don't know exactly what a contingency fee is. Now let's go to the team involved: we have a lot of details about who they are, we know precisely what they did before the project in their professional lives and we also have their linkedin profiles available to us. With this, a lot of credibility is passed on to the team, and confidence that they are able to successfully execute this proposal. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Throughout the detailing of the proposal, the proponent informs us of the KPIs, deliverable results and metrics that can determine the progressive success of this initiative. Therefore, we have a lot of material that serves as a basis for performing the auditability of progress. In other words, we know what the small goals are, what would be considered a partial success, and so on. However, it is necessary for the proponent to better establish what would be the ways that the Cardano community could access this information, because we know what to monitor, but who would do this monitoring work? Would it be the members of the community themselves, or maybe a member of the team is willing to work with it, keeping all of us updated on the tasks developed each month and also on the small achievements? This doubt needed to be resolved for me to consider the auditability of progress perfect. Now talking about the end results: we know that the crux of the matter is to provide content in the native language of the inhabitants of India, so that they can more easily learn about our blockchain and become active members of the Cardano community, one way or another, as I mentioned in impact. Again, I raise the same question: how will this impact be analyzed and how will this information become known to all members of the ecosystem? I believe it is the team's responsibility to study how this proposal will impact the target audience with a lot of specificity and provide this data to the Cardano community. This can be done through synchronous meetings in Town Hall, or by posting a report on online platforms (google docs is easy to use and practically everyone can access). Anyway, we need to understand how, in practice, the translation and posting of this content made a difference in the lives of the Indians involved, and also if this made our blockchain more widely adopted there. Is the working part mentioned by the proponent during the description of his project really making up the team of designers, programmers, animators, finance specialists, anyway? Therefore, I think that auditability is already well underway, but in order for it to be perfect, it is necessary that this contact with the community becomes clearer. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 3, "ng": 6, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "\nThese projects are not intended to build Devs. they are intended for 99% of the population who are non devs to onboard to Cardano as well, hold some ada, learn how to invest, how to increase their holdings in qty and value, and get used to a crypto economy.  \n\nDOes the community not understand simple KPIs?

It is proposed to specify a clear period for activities to be divided into 3 months. The author has a team fluent in all languages \u200b\u200bwith more than 20 years in the industry. I believe the project's roadmap will be on schedule as the author promised. The budget is 7.100 USD, detailed and listed by the author for each category. With the amount listed for each month, I find the budget sufficient to check the progress of the proposal. Suggest an easy way to measure success through the metrics the author has listed. . . It is surprising with the number of years of experience that the group has given, the 4-member group has more than 20 years of experience. I do not doubt the experience of the propagandists, they are all elite members, members that we can follow through social networking sites. With a solid team of experts with good leadership, based on the information provided I think this project will be successful.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "(\"The author writes the proposal in different countries, but the content will mostly be the same, so when I analyze the project there will be similar sentences\").

The author gives great ideas it tackles effectively the challenge, if it is funded I believe the project will be very successful it will have a good impact on making more people aware of Cardano. However, the success of this project is tied to the success of other projects so I think the risk will be multiplied. . . This project is completely new and is waiting for funding.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_649", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "\n\nThanks for your fair review. if we make it you too are part of what made us succeed. So thank you once again!"}, {"id": 8590, "q0": "The goal of  the \u201cCardano in Bhojpuri\u201d proposal is to translate Cardano related video content, from the IOHK YouTube channel into Bhojpuri. The same team has submitted functionally identical proposals, each covering a different language, for 15 different languages of the Indian subcontinent. I would like to point out that in this case, this is not necessarily a problem as each proposal covers essentially a different service. The aim of each is to translate a YouTube video every 3 days, in this case into Bhojpuri.\n\nI have meticulously verified the text of all 15 proposals in a text editor that allows for snapshots and comparisons between snapshots (Scrivener), to make sure the text of the proposals is the same. With a few minor exceptions of paragraphs being present in some proposals, but not in others, I can say with confidence that they are functionally identical proposals. As such I will be reviewing the proposals as a proposal group.\n\nGiven India\u2019s importance in the IT world, and especially considering its potential future growth my view is that this group of proposals would represent a very good investment for the Cardano community, and could have a great impact on attracting Indians to the ecosystem.\n\nThe main thing that I think is missing from this proposal group is the fact that they do not reference or acknowledge each other. If they did, the voters would get a much clearer picture of the project\u2019s scope overall and be able to make much more informed decisions as a result. I would advise that in the future, if the proposals are to be resubmitted separately, the proposer should clearly indicate that the proposals are part of a proposal group and perhaps write a paragraph or two about the vision behind the project as a whole and how they plan to implement it, especially since the same people will be responsible for the project management, logistics and implementation of the whole set of proposals.\n\nI can understand the reasoning behind submitting each language translation as a new proposal, so that the Cardano community can choose to fund as many as they think is necessary, and that the project can still go ahead if only a few languages are funded. However, I also feel that the average voter, who may only come across 2-3 proposals should have been made aware of the existence of the proposal group. \n\nThe proposers provide the number of speakers for each language in each category, however as the proposals do not reference each other I will make a list of all languages the proposers have submitted proposals for, in order of the number of worldwide speakers:\n\n\t1)\tHindi - 528 million speakers globally\n\t2)\tUrdu - 280 million speakers globally\n\t3)\tBengali - 250 million speakers globally\n\t4)\tPunjabi - 113 million speakers globally\n\t5)\tMarathi - 83 million speakers globally\n\t6)\tTelugu - 83 million speakers globally\n\t7)\tGujarati - 75 million speakers globally\n\t8)\tTamil - 75 million speakers globally\n\t9)\tKannada - 56 million speakers globally\n\t10)\tBhojpuri - 51 million speakers globally (this proposal)\n\t11)\tOdia - 39 million speakers globally\n\t12)\tMalayalam - 39 million speakers globally\n\t13)\tNepali - 25 million speakers globally\n\t14)\tSinhala - 25 million speakers globally\n\t15)\tAssamese - 24 million speakers globally\n\nI have cross-checked these figures with the information provided in the Languages of India Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_India , and for the most part they check out. There are a few small discrepancies, but that is perfectly understandable given the dataset, even the Wikipedia article feature 2 separate lists with slightly varying numbers. Not on the lists in the article are Nepali (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_language) and Sinhala (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhala_language), languages mainly spoken in Nepal and Sri Lanka respectively.\n\nI have also compiled a list of links to all the proposals in the group for easier reference:\n\n\t\u2022\tCardano in Hindi - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398838 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Urdu - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398847 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Bengali - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398841 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Punjabi - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398857 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Marathi -  https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398842 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Telugu - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398843  \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Gujarati - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398845 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Tamil - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398840 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Kannada - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398850 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Bhojpuri (this proposal) - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398981 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Odia - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398853 \n\t\u2022\tMalayalam - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398856 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Nepali - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398858 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Sinhala - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404484 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Assamese - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398980 \n\nThere are a few inconsistencies, meaning the authors failed to update each proposal with the correct language, or, in a few instances, the number of speakers internationally is not consistent within a proposal, however, that is understandable given the number of proposals they had to keep track off.\n\nOverall, even though the proposal itself could definitely use some more work and could have been better written and more refined in a number of areas, the initiative itself is worthwhile and it\u2019s a big plus for the Cardano translation effort that we have access in our community to such well-connected individuals in the translation field that are offering their services at very competitive rates.\n\nThe budget for translating a single language is very reasonable at $7,100, however, all the languages combined add up to almost 3 quarters of the total category budget, $106,500 out of $150,000. While the initiative to make Cardano content accessible in various Indian languages is certainly worthwhile it is up to the Cardano community to decide which to prioritise and fund and hopefully this overview will assist with that.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It is important to point out that, as also mentioned in the Impact section of my assessment of this proposal, \u201cCardano in Bhojpuri\u201d is part of a group of proposals that aim to translate IOHK YouTube content into 15 Indian languages. As the proposals are functionally identical, my reviews will also be almost the same. However, reviewing a group of 15 proposals took almost the same amount of time as assessing 15 unique proposals, because of the steps described in the Impact section of my assessment. \n\nThe roadmap is very detailed and easy to follow. It makes perfect sense for the projects.\n\nThe budget requested by the team is very reasonable and a portion of it, $2000 out of $7100 is set aside for contingencies, meaning that even if unforeseen situations were to happen the team should be able to deal with them and deliver the product.\n\nAll the 15 proposals promise to \u201cTranslate the entire content of IOHK in stages\u201d, however since that is a monumental task I would have liked to see more indications about their plan of action, and what they plan to start with. The proposals mention applying for future Catalyst funding\t if the project is to continue. \n\nSince the proposals\u2019 primary focus is translating YouTube videos from the IOG channel, I would advise contacting them and coordinating with IOG on this effort. Especially if multiple proposals will be funded.\n\nThis could result in multiple benefits. For instance, the proposals don\u2019t specify how the translations are to be handled, if they intend to bake them in, hardcode them in the videos, or if they are to be presented as CC (close captions).\nIf the translations are baked in, it would make sense for IOG to provide them with the original video files. This way the team won\u2019t have to download the highly compressed video file from YouTube and upload a video file that has gone through multiple compressions, greatly reducing quality.\nIOG could get access to the text of the translations to be included in its primary videos, if wished, as CC (close captions).\n\nThe description of the team members involved with this project is very detailed and they seem more than competent to get the job done. The included LinkedIn profile links were helpful, however the LinkedIn profiles were kind of sparse for some of the team members. But, that didn\u2019t constitute a problem since enough info is given in the proposals themselves.\n\nThe roles that the team members mentioned in the proposal will take within the projects are not exactly specified. However, I assume they will be mostly responsible for the project management of the proposals and the translations will be handled by the \u201cMaster Translators\u201d mentioned several times in the proposal. If this is the case, I would have liked to see more details around this and how they plan to recruit. However, given the stated experience of the proposals my level of confidence that they will get the job done is high.\n\nI particularly appreciated that, unlike many other proposers, the team behind this proposal has taken the time to properly identify and address a long list of risks/problems that could occur during the translation process. This definitely increases the feasibility of the proposals.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Also indicated in the Impact and Feasibility sections of the review for this proposal, \u201cCardano in Bhojpuri\u201d, is just one in a group of 15 proposals that aim to translate IOHK YouTube content into 15 Indian languages. Bhojpuri, in the case of this proposal.\n\nGiven that translated YouTube videos are the main deliverables to track for this group of 15 proposals the metrics presented in the auditability section should be sufficient to verify the evolution of the projects as they all have to do with engagement on the platform.\n\n As the output of these projects is YouTube videos, the quality of the translations will only be able to be verified by speakers of the 15 languages which the projects aim to produce translations for, but that is beyond the scope of current Catalyst auditability requirements. \n\nThe definitions of success given are more or less a copy/paste of the metrics presented in the initial section of the Auditability part of the proposals and various other parts of the proposal. However, the initial paragraph does offer some info about what the team hopes to accomplish with this overarching project that spans 15 Catalyst proposals in this round.\nIn the future, I would definitely recommend giving more thought to this section of the proposals and rewriting it. For instance, attaching clear values to each of the metrics given would have turned them into milestones/goals; an example: \u201c15000 average views per video\u201d. But, ultimately this doesn\u2019t carry much weight in this case, given the nature of the project and the set of proposals.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_681", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "\n\nThanks for your fair review. if we make it you too are part of what made us succeed.
