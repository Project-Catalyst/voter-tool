But let's explain everything in detail. The idea is to train 200 young people to work with web applications3, that is, applications that are somehow linked to the blockchain. The proponent informs that many times even people who work with technology do not follow this career for lack of people who teach content in an accessible way and also because they do not know the opportunities that this type of application can offer. I thought it was excellent how the proponent attaches here a link that supports his speech, as this argument is always necessary for us to understand the validity of past information. With these issues in mind, the core of this proposal can be summed up very well in the following excerpt: \u201cIt is not only about enabling students to become good quality developers, but we also want them to help them have a successful career. For that, we want to empower them as entrepreneurs to launch their own startup or provide a good career on the web3, connecting them with other successful entrepreneurs\u201d. This dialogues directly with the two facets explored in this challenge: the benefit of Cardano first, after all, IOHK is investing financially and it is essential that our blockchain is at least popularized in these proposals. This would certainly happen here as new students on web3 mean in the future new professionals working with Cardano's technologies, that is, the expansion of our ecosystem. Future developers of smart contracts will probably be born from this project, or members for startup teams that can become DAOs, in short, it's clear to me how Cardano would benefit from this initiative. In the same way, the target audience, that is, Indians, would also benefit greatly, since countless opportunities would be available from the moment they learn to deal with web technologies3. This is, in practice, employment and income opportunities that are certainly very promising, as I believe that in the future the need for this workforce will only increase. It is also positive as the proponent claims to have a lot of networking, this increases the chances that universities, public and private organizations will get involved in the project, further expanding the possibilities for the 200 Indians that will be contemplated. It's definitely a top note. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the proposal is, in my view, average, as we generally have the basic information needed to understand the project planning, how the requested money will be spent and also who are the professionals involved. However, each of these parts could be more detailed. Starting with analyzing the script, the proponent divides the total time into 3 blocks: the first month, after 1 month and the final results. He even provided an interesting level of detail regarding the first two months, explaining well what would be done and in what way. But in relation to the third month onwards, how would the activities be organized? I would like all the project months to be as well explained as the first 2. What time interval between the first 2 and the final results? Anyway, I think this part of the proposal deserves an improvement. Now let's talk about the budget, the amount requested is 30 thousand dollars, I found a fair value for the magnitude of the proposal (200 students would be educated of, which would generate an average 150 dollars per person helped, which is very reasonable) . The whole is divided into a few parts, which are: \u201ccourse material will cost about US$5,000\u201d + \u201ctravel and infrastructure cost will be US$5,000\u201d + \u201c$20,000 in training\u201d. Do you agree that each of these parts could be better explained? Why the course material will cost 5 thousand dollars, what is this trip that is mentioned? The $20,000 of training would be geared toward students, but how would that be done? Will scholarships be given? I think that part could have been better explored as well. finally, speaking of the team, I think we have a lot of information about some team members (Nicky Jacob for example) while others have very little information about themselves (George, Thanuj Sinha and Nabarun Chakrabortty). Ideally, the same level of detail would be presented to each of those involved, that is, we would know their names, what their professional attributions are, a brief summarize of what they have done so far (whether these activities are relevant or not to the Cardano ecosystem) and the linkedin profiles (that part is ok!). In other words, we need to know a lot of information about everyone so that total confidence in the team is transmitted. However, all the parts of viability, as I've already said, provide us with what we need to know deep down. A little more detail would level up this part of the proposal, but it's still good. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "On the auditability of the process: in fact, I think that half of what we need to know is explored here. We would know how many students would actually be involved in the project and also how they would be putting into practice the knowledge acquired in this course (let's call it that to make it easier), as this information would be made available on GitLab (each student would open an account). However, I think it would also be necessary for the proponent to explain how the team's work could be tracked each month. Do you agree that in basically all proposals we have tasks and goals? That is, tasks would be what we would do and goals for what. And in the auditability of the process here, we know what the goals would be, but it's clear how the tasks could be tracked. I suggest that the proponent make this correction by providing ways for us to keep track of these two fundamental and directly related parts. Now in terms of success, I thought the proponent suggests very interesting ways for us to verify that the objectives have been achieved. I think this is because he does not suggest that only quantitative data be analyzed (we know that the goal is 200 students and that all receive course certificates); he also suggests other, more qualitative ways in which we could audit success, such as: \u201c10% of admission is placed in a startup even before course completion\u201d and \u201cAble to attract local sponsorship for next cycle execution\u201d. In my view, the analysis he proposes is perfect because from this information the impact of this project would already be indicated both on the Cardano ecosystem and on the local population of India. The only thing I would suggest is that he make it clearer how all this could be analyzed by the Cardano community. Ideally, the proposer and his team would actually do a bunch of research and summarize it all in either a big final report or a video presentation, which could be part of a Town Hall, for example. Summarizing what I think: in the auditability of progress, it is necessary that we also have ways to verify the tasks; and in the auditability of the results, it is necessary to clarify how the Cardano community will be able to verify all the data collected. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 7712, "q0": "This is a great proposal and directly relates and impacts the challenges. Training young students on Web3.0 as well as guiding them into building dapps could bring value for the youth and the Cardano ecosystem. The proposal identifies several problems within the challenge which need to be solved, the first is \u201cNew developers lack access to a cost-effective solution to get trained\u201d the second to be \u201cbecome self-sufficient\u201d and the third \u201cdeploy their apps on Cardano\u201d. As an entrepreneur for 20 years, the only concern I have is where the focus will be as each of the three problems are important and need to be delt with. I obviously understand the connection between the three parts but concerned about the combination at all at an early stage of the initiative. Building the right training materials and training 200 developers on Cardano is already a huge task - how do you make sure you will do that great? Not every student will then build a dApp or would like to be an entrepreneur. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align with the outlined challenge settings. Great that you considered some business models to continue: i.e. attract local sponsorships for running the next cycle. The budget requested is 20% of the challenge which could be a bit high considering the objective of the challenge, however as the output of this proposal will be multiple dApps there are good alignments, considering successful implementation.   \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer provides good information about his skills and experience and also lists the other team members with minimum information. Overall seems like a very experienced team but not clear what is their knowledge of Cardano and catalyst and in particular, about the content, they will need to train. So first we need to train the trainers. One thing you should consider is reaching out and collaborating with various Cardano and Community initiatives for example the Plutus or Atala Prism pioneer programs and the Catalyst school for more basic training. \n\nThe budget includes three main categories Course preparation, travel & infrastructure cost, and training. It is mentioned in a general way and it is not clear how it is calculated and distributed. For example 5000 for the course materials, what the course will actually include is not very clear (although some reference to web2 course is available). More details about the travel and infrastructure will also be helpful and finally the 100 training budget per student, who will be receiving that? Is it the trainers? So, it will have been good to have more details to be able to assess if the budget is reasonable to achieve the set goals. The budget does not include marketing and communication which might be needed to achieve the goals. \n\nFrom my experience as an entrepreneur, I am a bit concerned about the plan as in the first months there are many activities and the objective to train 200 youth is quite significant considering that the proposer would like to direct them in building dApps or work for startups.  I would have suggested focusing as a POC in the first three months on a smaller group and then seeing how to grow it.  Missing some more details on that shows not only what is being done but also how.\n\nThe proposer has considered one key challenge relevant to a successful implementation. There is more, however, for example regarding content development, having 200 relevant youth or placement post-course, which I would recommend to consider. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement is presented - there are some concerns about it as mentioned in the feasibility section. The Metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal is well presented and traceable. The idea to open a Github account for each student is very good and will help to trace the progress. Also, the other KPIs are well defined. \nAs mentioned above the proposal is trying to focus on multiple problems and therefore also solutions. My recommendation is to define it better and have a more focused POC.  Overall, the community will be able to audit the results and therefore I gave 5 stars. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_636", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8707, "q0": "The proposer seeks to provide free training for 200 students on Web3 to deploy their 1st app on Cardano by partnering with various colleges to solve the problem of lack of access to cost effective solutions, which Cardano can be a cheaper but effective solution. The impact on empowering the youth to be a developer or a freelancer is very laudable about this proposal. They would provide youth with financial freedom by helping them join startups or launch their own venture or have a successful career. The team of proposers want to create a community for talent seekers and talent in the web3 space through colleges and provide training and certification for students in Cardano. The proposer stated that there is a small percentage of engineers with tech and linguistic skills in India, so this proposal seeks to bridge that gap in India and solve unemployment issues in India. \nThe proposal has a few stated risks being resistance to change on the part of college management. So they provided a solution that they would rather approach students informally to achieve their goals by boycotting the formal way.\nBased on this laudable approach and impact, I rate this category 5 star. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan of this proposal is quite detailed mentioning that they will create course materials; list schedules and availability of trainers and mentors; reach out to engage with key startups and NGOs; give introductory class to students on web3 and use case studies; identify the initial batch of committed and deserving students,  and reach out to media. The mention is made of training 50 students every month and train 200 students by end of the project. Training would be such that at the end students can deploy a basic app using Cardano. They will then connect the developers with various startups and their founders to provide a better understanding of the ecosystem. Students who cannot start their own businesses can be supported to connect with the right startups. \nThe total budget of USD30000 is quite reasonable for such a project. However details of the UDS100 per student were not given in the proposal. Details could have been provided as to whether it is for transportation or for stationery or anything to help easy auditing. So the proposer should take note of this in their next proposal. \nThe team of 10 people for this proposal have various experiences- engineer, developers, 10 years in entrepreneurship, with all their names mentioned and LinkedIn links provided make the project a potential success. Names such as Nicky Jacob, Sachin J.S., and Jimshad mentioned. \nWith all the details provided I rated the category 5 star.

Hence my 5-star rating.\n\nThey also stated that it is a new proposal and I commend the team for their awesome effort and wish that they win funding for this laudable project to impact lives of the youth positively. \nThe SDG rating of 4 and 8 chosen fit the challenge very well- that is quality education(4) and descent work and economic growth (8). \nI highly recommend this proposal for funding.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_688", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 1, "ng": 7, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10187, "q0": "This is a proposal to fund the free training of 200 students on Web3 to launch their first application on Cardano by partnering with colleges.
