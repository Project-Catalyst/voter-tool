In all other respects they are essential the same. Hence it is almost impossible to write 19 distinct assessments, I have tried to find specific differentiators but have also looked at the package of proposals as a whole as, I believe, this will add greater value to the voter. Looking at this specific proposal for translating videos into Tamil, it largely meets the challenge brief in seeking to broaden the horizons of the Cardano ecosystem. The proposer should be praised for taking the initiative. I would suggest the proposer uses the comments section to explain voters their rationale behind this multi-proposal approach. That should help with transparency and help people make an informed decision. For example: Are they looking for voters to decide on which languages they prefer thus restricting the choice to the existing community. This kind of defeats the purpose of reaching out to new communities. If this is the case I have done a rudimentary research on number of people speaking each language to help the voters make an informed decision. Given more time, an in depth analysis of demographics would be useful showing current literacy levels, access to technology, levels of education, English speakers, etc in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Tamil ranks 7th so maybe not the highest priority? 1.Hindi:615M 2.Bengali:265M 3.Urdu:170M 4.Punjabi:126M 5.Marathi:95M 6.Telugu:93M 7.Tamil:81M 8.Gujarati:61M 9.Kannada:56M 10.Bhojpuri:50M 11.Odia:38M 12.Malayalam:38M 13.Sinhala:17M 14.Nepali :17M 15.Assamese:15M Where the voter needs to pay particular attention is the entirety of the ask.

In simple terms we are looking at a total ask of $135,900 of which $38,000 (28%) is contingency. At a proposal level that is $7100 budget with $2000 contingency. My project planning head immediately points to the 28% contingency. It is not clear what this is set aside for. A risk of ADA price fluctuation is noted in the proposals, however one of the proposed mitigations for that is a 10% contingency, the other being to sell funds privately to ADA holders. In addition the proposals states \u201cWe have ample resources to complete the project on time and within budget\u2019, once again raising the question on the need for such a large contingency in proportion to the budget? Now looking at what is to be delivered. Each proposal states the YouTube channel will be launched with 6 videos. We have to assume that means 6 videos translated in all 19 languages should they all be funded. After 3 months 10-20 videos (each translated in 19 languages) That gives us 380 translations in total at an average of 4 per day. I have run this by someone with experience in this area and their reaction was \u2018its going to need a considerable team\u2019. So, let\u2019s look at the evidence of a team with the skills to deliver this proposal. The proposer claims to have many years experience in this field but this is impossible to verify based on the evidence (LinkedIn profile) provided. The other key resource (Muthiah) presents as a trilingual translator. Specific languages are not mentioned so very difficult to validate of if they have the skills for this specific proposal Two other individuals are listed, their LinkedIn in profile are well populated but don\u2019t display the skills required to deliver this project. That leave us with the \u201cextensive network of Master translators\u201d. Again no evidence of their existence of previous work exists so impossible to evaluate. I believe the proposer has a lot to offer the ecosystem and can suggest the following: 1. Help the voter understand the need for 19 similar proposals 2. Provide evidence that they have access to the skills required 3. Look at a small scope with a set of languages he or Muthiah are comfortable with. Use this as a POC on both the translation and engagement side. SHOW the community this proposal is growing adoption. 4.

So all languages cannot be lumped together to do one campaign.  The cost of that being 1500..  Then for contingency we have allocated 2000.    \nThe assessor says There is only one issue that perplexes me, and that is the budget per word: $0.08, the team must give greater market salary requirements for this budget, as well as a contingency cost of $2000 to be covered and expressly defined.\nThis is nonsense.

All languages cannot be done by same people or same social media campaign.  This is why we broke up. Smaller proposals enable people to clearly see we are not here to grab money.   Each language needs its unique Social media campaign to reach people.  We cannot lump everything into one.  This assessor clearly if from India is of a tech back ground, knows English and Hindi and thinks everyone in the country speaks Hindi and ENglish as well as he/she does.  This is ignorance, bias and absolute discrimination since he should know that people in other states much prefer their own language to Hindi. \n\nSecondly Why consider the total ask?  The rules state that each proposal has to be considered on its own merit.  Therefore even if  i had a hundred language proposals, if i had a hundred teams of two Master Translators and Two Proofreaders, then it will get the job done. We are doing this for 25 years buddy.   We know exactly how to run a translation project.\n\nHe goes on\nThe proposer claims to have many years experience in this field but this is impossible to verify based on the evidence (LinkedIn profile) provided. The other key resource (Muthiah) presents as a trilingual translator.\nI have stated as below, we have and use our extensive network of Master Translator Partners.\n\nThe assessor has not read the proposal. It states clearly as follows\nThe number of people required to complete this task has been calculated.  \nWe will be using our inhouse resources as well as obtain our Master Translator Partner network to handle overflow of work to ensure that our deliverables remain on track. They would be brought on board as and when needed and budget would include their costs\n\nI can see clearly that this assessor is merely following the wrong ideas of some CAs to say that the feasibility is not good because they believe I alone  is doing Or Mr Muthiah D is doing,  the translations or this internal team is doing the translation of all the 10 languages.  This is completely WRONG.  As mentioned above we are using our External partners who are Master Translators with many years of experience and qualifications in translating as Native speakers of Tamil both in Sri Lanka and India. So his feasibility assessment is wrong. \n\nHow the budget was calculated has been clearly laid out as follows.. if he claims he has read the other proposals he will know that we are doing 15000 words per project. Each word costs 0.08 for complete translation to voicing. This cost comes to 1200 and into 3 months it is 3600.  Then this language needs its own Social media campaign since the users of one language would not care about social media campaigns in another language. So all languages cannot be lumped together to do one campaign.  The cost of that being 1500..  Then for contingency we have allocated 2000.    \nSome specific statements that are absolute nonsense=\nHowever, because the primary responsibility of this position is to translate text from English to Tamil, the proposer should include more specific information on their translators' expertise in their Master Translator Partner Network.   As stated we have been doing projects for over 25 years. The definition of Master translator if this assessor doesn't understand is a MASTER OF HIS CRAFT.  A SENIOR IN THE INDUSTRY.   Each one will have different qualifications.  As for our specific master translator, he is the ONLY ONE IN SRI LANKA to write for the Mahawamsa which is like the BIBLE OF HISTORY of SRI LANKA for over 4000 years. It has been written from the time of kings.  This is a role that he alone in Sri Lanka has. So this assessor is talking nonsense\n\nHe states \" \n\n\nThe assessor has been influenced by IGNORANT GROUP THINK set in place by certain malicious CAs who seek to influence these CAs with rubbish instead of reading the proposal carefully since all facts are stated there. IF anything was still unclear I am a CA myself and was easily accessible through the CA chat or my own TG. Therefore please filter this out as its a malicious effort to bring down the proposal through ignorance.\n\nAlso he is completely biased and not seeing the reality as is Language diversity in India based on above mentioned biases.\n"}, {"id": 7344, "q0": "The proposal relates perfectly to the objectives of the challenge, as it seeks to translate content related to Cardano into the Tamil language (spoken by around 68 million people in southern India, according to my research). In this aim, we seek to benefit both India and Cardano. And with this project, this would certainly be achieved, because: 1) by having such videos about Cardano translated into their native language, the inhabitants of South India would have an easy gateway to becoming members of the community. This can generate countless benefits for them, because with such primary teachings, people who work with technology can seek to study and deepen; for example, by participating in programs to become programmers in Plutus, the Cardano blockchain programming language used to make smart contracts. That way, they could work on one of the many Catalyst projects, where this type of manpower is sorely needed. Those who are not in the area can also work for Cardano, as other types of professionals are also required in the ecosystem, such as designers, advertisers who publicize funded projects, game narrators, etc. Or, even, the people who watch these videos become CAs and VCAs, project mentors and so on. The list of opportunities is extensive. Therefore, I believe that the proposal would benefit India to the full. And naturally, the Cardano ecosystem would also come to an advantage, since so many people would know more about our blockchain, maybe invest in it by buying and delegating Ada, CNFTs, the number of transactions on the blockchain could increase. With the popularization of Cardano, the general investment would probably grow. That is, it is a project that reaches both sides: the country of India and our blockchain. However, the problem I found here was the lack of specificity regarding the contents that will be addressed. We know that videos from famous youtube channels that talk about Cardano will be taken, but it is also said that videos from other places would be taken. Which? And what topics would be covered, in what order? All this information could be clearer. If this were explained, I believe I would give maximum marks for the impact of this proposal. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "We have a roadmap that explains what would happen in months 1, 2 and 3. However, from what is said the activities would be the tables (producing 360 minutes of video and publicizing this), but no details on the work routine. How would these videos be produced? Who would be responsible for each part? How long would the translation process take? How many videos per month? What would the marketing campaign look like? As important as producing the videos is knowing how they will reach the audience. Will the target audience be aware of these translations, and so, in fact, would the objectives that were planned be achieved? Therefore, the script is just a notion of what would happen, in my view, not being adequately detailed. It would be necessary to understand the routine of the professionals involved. Now speaking to them, this part of the proposal is very good. We know the names and a brief curriculum of each of them, that is, previous experiences, how they work in the ecosystem and so on. All social network links are provided, in this way, we can prove the information that is described. One suggestion I would like to make is: it would also be interesting if they defined more specifically who would do what in the project, what role they would have individually so that together they form a team. Finally, in relation to the budget, a total of 7100 dollars is requested, which in my opinion is a value quite compatible with the magnitude of the project. I think that the amount requested for translation is very fair, although it is difficult to audit whether 50 thousand words were translated per month. I think it would be better to measure this price based on the hour of work, because it is difficult to prove how many thousand words have been translated. Other parts of the budget like the social media campaign should have been better explained. We don't know, for example, how this campaign would take place. What would the advertising look like? Who would work on it? How much would your working hour be worth? Anyway, I don't think it's possible to justify very clearly how the requested funding would be used in this project, because we don't have the necessary details. Therefore, in my opinion, what has to improve in this part of the project is precisely the budget explanation, also a greater depth on the activities carried out monthly; and also, explain about the role that team members would play in the project. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The author repeats here information already mentioned in other parts of the proposal. It provides many KPIs and goals to be achieved, such as: number of average views per video / number of watching hours / number of comments. However, I think there are still more accurate ways to audit this proposal. Let's start with the fact that the roadmap is not very detailed, so it is difficult for the community to monitor if the more specific activities are being done properly. Let's understand better: instead of just saying that 360 minutes of video would be produced, the bidder could explain what would be done each week; by whom; in what way; at what times. It is true that we are told how the Cardano community could monitor the partial results of the project, through the excerpt \u201cAll published video materials can be checked through the Youtube channels. We will publish transcriptions of each video in the Cardano Forum\u201d. But that doesn't say about the tasks that would need to be carried out here, that would be behind and such goals. A weekly report could be produced that would raise if these tasks are done the right way, at the right times, and by the right people. This document could be sent on the telegram channel \u201cCatalyst Project\u201d, for example. Or even in other ways, it is enough that the actions are periodically monitored and that this survey reaches the Cardano community, in one way or another. Now speaking of the final results, we know several metrics that would be used to understand if the project achieved the desired results and if the main objective of making Cardano content accessible to Tamil speakers was achieved. However, as with the auditability of the process, how would the community have access to these final results? It is necessary that the author of the proposal and his team establish this bridge, and as it is a more detailed and extensive data collection, I think it would be interesting to create a visual document, to facilitate the understanding of the community. Or even a synchronous video meeting. In general, my opinion is that the proponent is concerned about outlining ways to audit the proposal, but does not realize that it is also important to make them easily accessible to the Cardano community, not only about the partial result but also about the processes. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 3, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "THese projects are not intended to build Devs. they are intended for 99% of the population who are non devs to onboard to Cardano as well, hold some ada, learn how to invest, how to increase their holdings in qty and value, and get used to a crypto economy.  \n\nDOes the community not understand simple KPIs?

The same team has submitted functionally identical proposals, each covering a different language, for 15 different languages of the Indian subcontinent. I would like to point out that in this case, this is not necessarily a problem as each proposal covers essentially a different service. The aim of each is to translate a YouTube video every 3 days, in this case into Tamil.\n\nI have meticulously verified the text of all 15 proposals in a text editor that allows for snapshots and comparisons between snapshots (Scrivener), to make sure the text of the proposals is the same. With a few minor exceptions of paragraphs being present in some proposals, but not in others, I can say with confidence that they are functionally identical proposals. As such I will be reviewing the proposals as a proposal group.\n\nGiven India\u2019s importance in the IT world, and especially considering its potential future growth my view is that this group of proposals would represent a very good investment for the Cardano community, and could have a great impact on attracting Indians to the ecosystem.\n\nThe main thing that I think is missing from this proposal group is the fact that they do not reference or acknowledge each other. If they did, the voters would get a much clearer picture of the project\u2019s scope overall and be able to make much more informed decisions as a result. I would advise that in the future, if the proposals are to be resubmitted separately, the proposer should clearly indicate that the proposals are part of a proposal group and perhaps write a paragraph or two about the vision behind the project as a whole and how they plan to implement it, especially since the same people will be responsible for the project management, logistics and implementation of the whole set of proposals.\n\nI can understand the reasoning behind submitting each language translation as a new proposal, so that the Cardano community can choose to fund as many as they think is necessary, and that the project can still go ahead if only a few languages are funded. However, I also feel that the average voter, who may only come across 2-3 proposals should have been made aware of the existence of the proposal group. \n\nThe proposers provide the number of speakers for each language in each category, however as the proposals do not reference each other I will make a list of all languages the proposers have submitted proposals for, in order of the number of worldwide speakers:\n\n\t1)\tHindi - 528 million speakers globally\n\t2)\tUrdu - 280 million speakers globally\n\t3)\tBengali - 250 million speakers globally\n\t4)\tPunjabi - 113 million speakers globally\n\t5)\tMarathi - 83 million speakers globally\n\t6)\tTelugu - 83 million speakers globally\n\t7)\tGujarati - 75 million speakers globally\n\t8)\tTamil - 75 million speakers globally (this proposal)\n\t9)\tKannada - 56 million speakers globally\n\t10)\tBhojpuri - 51 million speakers globally\n\t11)\tOdia - 39 million speakers globally\n\t12)\tMalayalam - 39 million speakers globally\n\t13)\tNepali - 25 million speakers globally\n\t14)\tSinhala - 25 million speakers globally\n\t15)\tAssamese - 24 million speakers globally\n\nI have cross-checked these figures with the information provided in the Languages of India Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_India , and for the most part they check out.

It makes perfect sense for the projects.\n\nThe budget requested by the team is very reasonable and a portion of it, $2000 out of $7100 is set aside for contingencies, meaning that even if unforeseen situations were to happen the team should be able to deal with them and deliver the product.\n\nAll the 15 proposals promise to \u201cTranslate the entire content of IOHK in stages\u201d, however since that is a monumental task I would have liked to see more indications about their plan of action, and what they plan to start with. The proposals mention applying for future Catalyst funding\t if the project is to continue. \n\nSince the proposals\u2019 primary focus is translating YouTube videos from the IOG channel, I would advise contacting them and coordinating with IOG on this effort. Especially if multiple proposals will be funded.\n\nThis could result in multiple benefits. For instance, the proposals don\u2019t specify how the translations are to be handled, if they intend to bake them in, hardcode them in the videos, or if they are to be presented as CC (close captions).\nIf the translations are baked in, it would make sense for IOG to provide them with the original video files. This way the team won\u2019t have to download the highly compressed video file from YouTube and upload a video file that has gone through multiple compressions, greatly reducing quality.\nIOG could get access to the text of the translations to be included in its primary videos, if wished, as CC (close captions).\n\nThe description of the team members involved with this project is very detailed and they seem more than competent to get the job done. The included LinkedIn profile links were helpful, however the LinkedIn profiles were kind of sparse for some of the team members. But, that didn\u2019t constitute a problem since enough info is given in the proposals themselves.\n\nThe roles that the team members mentioned in the proposal will take within the projects are not exactly specified. However, I assume they will be mostly responsible for the project management of the proposals and the translations will be handled by the \u201cMaster Translators\u201d mentioned several times in the proposal. If this is the case, I would have liked to see more details around this and how they plan to recruit. However, given the stated experience of the proposals my level of confidence that they will get the job done is high.\n\nI particularly appreciated that, unlike many other proposers, the team behind this proposal has taken the time to properly identify and address a long list of risks/problems that could occur during the translation process.

However, as my experience in translating and producing Cardano videos, the number of IOHK documents has produced more than 15,000 different documents. It was a huge amount of work to do that the word \u201centire\u201d did not fit into a proposal within 3 months. Instead, a priority list of topics for translation would be more feasible. \n\nThe budget was broken down into Translate, Marketing, and Contingencies of fall down ADA price.  In the team, except for Dimitri, there are 3 other people who have decades of experience in translation. In addition, they can expand up to hundreds of people in the community of translators with which they are working together. However, it would be better if we could see the translation products that you have done. Because the documents from Cardano, IOHK are almost technical knowledge, it is difficult for translators who have not prepared professional knowledge to make its meaning closer. This happened to me while running my translation team. And the last, who will take the obligation to translate into Tamil, and who will audit his/her translation? It is better if there is a translator who was born and growth in India and spoke in Tamil.  \n\nFor those reasons, I rate 2 stars for the Feasibility.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "\ud83d\udc49NOTE!
