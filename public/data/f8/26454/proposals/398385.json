The first steps they took were amazing such as dialogue behavior with  Goodwall Student Council, Board, Council, regular focus groups and post-program surveys to make the application  more relevant. and increased scalability for even better  infrastructure and user interfaces. . / User. With their long-term view expressed over the next 612 months on how to target the market, all they are doing is a good step forward to expand the blockchain community and take blockchain education seriously.

In terms of scenarios, they present the stages that need to be completed to achieve their goal, but I think these stages can be explored further. For example, \"Design promotional items\", what kind of marketing strategy would you use? (If social media, what kind of social media and how do you use it to get more attention?). It is always good to explain each term in detail so that those who are not familiar with it fully understand the proposition. According to the relevant budget, I think the level of detail here is average and still needs more details for each section, such as budget plans, in advertising budgets> must be revealed more (by digital marketing of Facebook advertising for 1k dollars, etc.). Finally, we know that each part of the project will cost, and involves transformation costs, they are very well calculated, decomposes and explained so that we can understand exactly what will happen here.

Not only did they ensure the transmission of information that could help the rest of the community track the progress of the project, but they also established a viability plan in which they would track impressions.

Challenge Entry Challenge entry is defined as a downloaded video or image that is related to the program. And they  also give us an example of their report to show how they report  the results of each KPI. However, there is one strange thing that I discovered, it is about the timeframe of the KPI they will achieve, namely the unavailability, eg every few months. So they have to define for example a KPI of 1 million impressions that should be achieved for each post within a month, or I suggest SMART goals for example, the goal to build the addon is a specific \"S\" pecific, \"M\" easurable, \"A\" chievable, \"R\"easonable and \"T\"ime-bound to make this project easier to test.
