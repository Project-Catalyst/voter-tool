This has the potential to reach over 90 Million people, and may be a gateway for Cardano to set up local hubs in South India in many of the populated areas, including the megalopolis of Hyderabad, the 4th most populous city of India. With this Proposal\u2019s aim being to make Catalyst and Cardano content and information available to those folks, this seems like a near-ideal way to bring developers into our ecosystem and, as the Campaign seeks, creating a buzz about Catalyst and promoting awareness. The Campaign also notes that there is a known large pool of IT talent and skills waiting to be tapped, and this Proposal mentions that South Asians are well suited for coding/developing, so it only seems natural that this project will have a powerful Impact exactly how Catalyst and Cardano are hoping for. Moreover, the inclusion of captioning/subtitles in transcriptions ensures that even Deaf members will be included, which is an added bonus for outreach/impact. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The steps of this Proposal seem logically broken down into realistically feasible bits and steps/phases, each quite actionable. It appears that teams to enact the plan are largely already ready to go to work, and that a network is readily available to address any hiccups. The four members of the listed team appear to have considerable experience doing this type of work, and even have an expert project manager, and as far as I can see nearly every step of the process has already been calculated and accounted for. Not only do all members have plenty of experience, but the numbers breakdown provided seems that this type of work would be a considerable bargain compared against commercially having this work done by others outside of the Catalyst proposal group. The budget mentions not charging for or needing to increase the budget if extra work is provided, suggesting that there may likely even be better output than the proposal itself implies. \n\nEach monthly goal seems practical and not overly ambitious, the per-day output of videos/work seems practical and not overly ambitious, and a well drawn/laid out plan seems ready to go. This project seems very feasible, ready to start, and pretty much only needs the Catalyst approval to become a reality.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project lays out its milestones and KPIs quite well, and everything past the very beginning stages seems very well auditable. It specifies how many minutes to expect for each phase, and following subscribers, views, shares, etc. should be quite easy for any of us to check in on at any point. Not only are number of minutes of output video specified, but being able to check in on the amount of engagement with each video via things such as shares or view count now and eventually Catalyst engagement from the targeted community joining on should allow auditors to see how effective nearly all stages of this project have been even beyond just the duration of this project.

That he has lumped it together with other projects and without any basis is condemending it even though we have said we have Master Translators for each project. He is therefore biased and should be filtered out"}, {"id": 8579, "q0": "The goal of  the \u201cCardano in Telugu\u201d proposal is to translate Cardano related video content, from the IOHK YouTube channel into Telugu. The same team has submitted functionally identical proposals, each covering a different language, for 15 different languages of the Indian subcontinent. I would like to point out that in this case, this is not necessarily a problem as each proposal covers essentially a different service. The aim of each is to translate a YouTube video every 3 days, in this case into Telugu.\n\nI have meticulously verified the text of all 15 proposals in a text editor that allows for snapshots and comparisons between snapshots (Scrivener), to make sure the text of the proposals is the same. With a few minor exceptions of paragraphs being present in some proposals, but not in others, I can say with confidence that they are functionally identical proposals. As such I will be reviewing the proposals as a proposal group.\n\nGiven India\u2019s importance in the IT world, and especially considering its potential future growth my view is that this group of proposals would represent a very good investment for the Cardano community, and could have a great impact on attracting Indians to the ecosystem.\n\nThe main thing that I think is missing from this proposal group is the fact that they do not reference or acknowledge each other. If they did, the voters would get a much clearer picture of the project\u2019s scope overall and be able to make much more informed decisions as a result. I would advise that in the future, if the proposals are to be resubmitted separately, the proposer should clearly indicate that the proposals are part of a proposal group and perhaps write a paragraph or two about the vision behind the project as a whole and how they plan to implement it, especially since the same people will be responsible for the project management, logistics and implementation of the whole set of proposals.\n\nI can understand the reasoning behind submitting each language translation as a new proposal, so that the Cardano community can choose to fund as many as they think is necessary, and that the project can still go ahead if only a few languages are funded. However, I also feel that the average voter, who may only come across 2-3 proposals should have been made aware of the existence of the proposal group. \n\nThe proposers provide the number of speakers for each language in each category, however as the proposals do not reference each other I will make a list of all languages the proposers have submitted proposals for, in order of the number of worldwide speakers:\n\n\t1)\tHindi - 528 million speakers globally\n\t2)\tUrdu - 280 million speakers globally\n\t3)\tBengali - 250 million speakers globally\n\t4)\tPunjabi - 113 million speakers globally\n\t5)\tMarathi - 83 million speakers globally\n\t6)\tTelugu - 83 million speakers globally (this proposal)\n\t7)\tGujarati - 75 million speakers globally\n\t8)\tTamil - 75 million speakers globally\n\t9)\tKannada - 56 million speakers globally\n\t10)\tBhojpuri - 51 million speakers globally\n\t11)\tOdia - 39 million speakers globally\n\t12)\tMalayalam - 39 million speakers globally\n\t13)\tNepali - 25 million speakers globally\n\t14)\tSinhala - 25 million speakers globally\n\t15)\tAssamese - 24 million speakers globally\n\nI have cross-checked these figures with the information provided in the Languages of India Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_India , and for the most part they check out. There are a few small discrepancies, but that is perfectly understandable given the dataset, even the Wikipedia article feature 2 separate lists with slightly varying numbers. Not on the lists in the article are Nepali (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_language) and Sinhala (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhala_language).\n\nI have also compiled a list of links to all the proposals in the group for easier reference:\n\n\t\u2022\tCardano in Hindi - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398838 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Urdu - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398847 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Bengali - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398841 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Punjabi - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398857 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Marathi -  https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398842 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Telugu (this proposal) - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398843  \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Gujarati - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398845 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Tamil - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398840 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Kannada - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398850 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Bhojpuri - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398981 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Odia - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398853 \n\t\u2022\tMalayalam - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398856 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Nepali - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398858 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Sinhala - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404484 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Assamese - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398980 \n\nThere are a few inconsistencies, meaning the authors failed to update each proposal with the correct language, or, in a few instances, the number of speakers internationally is not consistent within a proposal, however, that is understandable given the number of proposals they had to keep track off.\n\nOverall, even though the proposal itself could definitely use some more work and could have been better written and more refined in a number of areas, the initiative itself is worthwhile and it\u2019s a big plus for the Cardano translation effort that we have access in our community to such well-connected individuals in the translation field that are offering their services at very competitive rates.\n\nThe budget for translating a single language is very reasonable at $7,100, however, all the languages combined add up to almost 3 quarters of the total category budget, $106,500 out of $150,000. While the initiative to make Cardano content accessible in various Indian languages is certainly worthwhile it is up to the Cardano community to decide which to prioritise and fund and hopefully this overview will assist with that.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Similarly mentioned in the Impact and Auditability sections of my assessment of this proposal, \u201cCardano in Telugu\u201d is part of a group of proposals that aim to translate IOHK YouTube content into 15 Indian languages. As the proposals are functionally identical, my reviews will also be almost the same. However, reviewing a group of 15 proposals took almost the same amount of time as assessing 15 unique proposals, because of the steps described in the Impact section of my assessment. \n\nThe roadmap is very detailed and easy to follow. It makes perfect sense for the projects.\n\nThe budget requested by the team is very reasonable and a portion of it, $2000 out of $7100 is set aside for contingencies, meaning that even if unforeseen situations were to happen the team should be able to deal with them and deliver the product.\n\nAll the 15 proposals promise to \u201cTranslate the entire content of IOHK in stages\u201d, however since that is a monumental task I would have liked to see more indications about their plan of action, and what they plan to start with. The proposals mention applying for future Catalyst funding\t if the project is to continue. \n\nSince the proposals\u2019 primary focus is translating YouTube videos from the IOG channel, I would advise contacting them and coordinating with IOG on this effort. Especially if multiple proposals will be funded.\n\nThis could result in multiple benefits. For instance, the proposals don\u2019t specify how the translations are to be handled, if they intend to bake them in, hardcode them in the videos, or if they are to be presented as CC (close captions).\nIf the translations are baked in, it would make sense for IOG to provide them with the original video files. This way the team won\u2019t have to download the highly compressed video file from YouTube and upload a video file that has gone through multiple compressions, greatly reducing quality.\nIOG could get access to the text of the translations to be included in its primary videos, if wished, as CC (close captions).\n\nThe description of the team members involved with this project is very detailed and they seem more than competent to get the job done. The included LinkedIn profile links were helpful, however the LinkedIn profiles were kind of sparse for some of the team members. But, that didn\u2019t constitute a problem since enough info is given in the proposals themselves.\n\nThe roles that the team members mentioned in the proposal will take within the projects are not exactly specified. However, I assume they will be mostly responsible for the project management of the proposals and the translations will be handled by the \u201cMaster Translators\u201d mentioned several times in the proposal. If this is the case, I would have liked to see more details around this and how they plan to recruit. However, given the stated experience of the proposals my level of confidence that they will get the job done is high.\n\nI particularly appreciated that, unlike many other proposers, the team behind this proposal has taken the time to properly identify and address a long list of risks/problems that could occur during the translation process. This definitely increases the feasibility of the proposals.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Also indicated in the Impact and Feasibility sections of the review for this proposal, \u201cCardano in Telugu\u201d, is just one in a group of 15 proposals that aim to translate IOHK YouTube content into 15 Indian languages. Telugu, in the case of this proposal.\n\nGiven that translated YouTube videos are the main deliverables to track for this group of 15 proposals the metrics presented in the auditability section should be sufficient to verify the evolution of the projects as they all have to do with engagement on the platform.\n\n As the output of these projects is YouTube videos, the quality of the translations will only be able to be verified by speakers of the 15 languages which the projects aim to produce translations for, but that is beyond the scope of current Catalyst auditability requirements. \n\nThe definitions of success given are more or less a copy/paste of the metrics presented in the initial section of the Auditability part of the proposals and various other parts of the proposal. However, the initial paragraph does offer some info about what the team hopes to accomplish with this overarching project that spans 15 Catalyst proposals in this round.\nIn the future, I would definitely recommend giving more thought to this section of the proposals and rewriting it. For instance, attaching clear values to each of the metrics given would have turned them into milestones/goals; an example: \u201c15000 average views per video\u201d.

The total number of translation duration of 120 minutes per month seems limited for someone who would like to discover about blockchain and Cardano. If the translation duration can be increased, it would be more attractive. The idea can also be scaled up easily by translating to Telugu more Cardano and blockchain's videos and other channels such as the Emurgo and Cardano Foundation Youtube channel. Furthermore, some risks are identified correctly and reasonable mitigation solutions for those risks have been provided, enhancing the chance of project success.

How many numbers of average views per video would the project be classified as success? How many numbers of watching hours would the project be classified as success? How many numbers of comments would the project be classified as success? How many numbers of shares would the project be classified as success?

So thank you once again!"}, {"id": 7347, "q0": "The impact is good, but there are problems here, so my opinion on this part of the proposal is neutral. As soon as I started reading this proposal I noticed a dissonance. In the title, it is said that there would be translations of content that addressed Cardano into Telugu, but during the impact, right at the beginning of the explanations, in the part of solutions to the problem, the proponent cites another language: \u201cprovide videos translated into Tamil educating the Tamil community in India and internationally about Cardano and its ecosystem (...)\u201d. After all, in which language will the translations be generated? Perhaps the bidder got confused when writing the proposal, as, from what I can see, India contains several different languages \u200b\u200bbeing spoken by its natives, and this same bidder has launched several proposals to translate some youtube videos into different of these languages. Anyway, I will consider that this proposal will work on top of the Telugu translations, but it would be important for the proposer to review this proposal and fix the error. Now talking about the impact of the proposal, I think the idea is good and it aligns well with the objectives of the challenge. There would be translations of videos from famous and important youtube channels that talk about Cardano, such as the \u201cIOHK channel, as well as content from the Youtube channels of Emurgo and Cardano Foundation\u201d. It would be important for us to know exactly what content would be published here, within the various options provided by these channels. I think the ideal for us to understand the impact in a specific way is to list how many videos would be translated and which ones, in order of release. Of course, they would start with more introductory topics such as what is blockchain, what are cryptocurrencies, what is Cardano and so on, and then move on to an in-depth approach to the topics. But to improve our understanding, the ideal would be that the proponent actually made available which videos would be translated, that he attached the respective links in the description of the impact. I would also like to know which other channels would be chosen for the videos to be translated, because this would increase confidence that the information provided would be factual, safe and correspond to the truth about how our ecosystem is constituted. In other words, we would have more confidence in what was to come. Ultimately, I think so, the proposal aligns with the goals of making Cardano more accessible to the inhabitants of India, as the language barrier would be broken down, and this would make it easier for them to become active members of the Cardano community, either through participation in Catalyst, working as programmers, designers or advertisers for any of our funded projects, etc. And, obviously, this would benefit the blockchain itself, as it would popularize it in India, causing the number of adherents and investors to grow as a whole. I think the things that need to be addressed are the confusion as to which language the translations will be made into and providing more detail on what exact subjects translated and where that content would be fetched from (apart from the cited channels). \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Starting with the script analysis, we are told what would happen in the first 3 months of the project. As I understand it, the project would have this duration as a total. I think the past information about the months is basically the same and is not properly fleshed out. In the first month, the channel would be launched, with translated and dubbed videos, resulting in a total duration of 360 minutes. And in the other two months, what would happen would be the continuation of content production, with the goal always around 360 minutes, as well as publicity campaigns on social networks. What would need to be done in my opinion, to improve this script, is that each month was divided into weeks and that we had an individual explanation of what would happen in each of them. Would it be necessary for the activities to be detailed in more depth, for example, how would the team be assembled? What would the work routine be like for the translations to be done? What would this social media outreach campaign look like? Which social networks would be focused, and why? And how would the content be transmitted? Would it be through illustrations, videos, texts? There is a lack of detail when it comes to understanding how everything will be organized. Now talking about the budget, the asking amount is 7100 dollars. The value of the translations themselves is calculated in words resulting in a total of 1200 dollars per month. I find it difficult to keep track of whether the promised amount of words has actually been translated, so in my opinion it would be better if this price was calculated according to the length of time. For example, 1 minute translated would be X value. That way, it would be much simpler for us, in the auditability part, to check if the requested value was used correctly. Other parts of the funding should also be better explained, in my opinion, such as the 1500,000 requests for campaigns on social media. We know that it is essential for any project to have strong publicity, but as I explained in the detailing part of the script, this campaign is not detailed, it is not explained, so we cannot justify whether the amount asked for this part is fair or not. All parts of the budget should be well argued. And finally, about the team, this part of the project is very good, a good detail is presented about each member of the team, we know their names, their professional resumes, whatever, what they have done so far, and we also have links to social networks through which we can verify the said information. Therefore, in terms of feasibility, only 1 of the three topics is satisfactorily detailed, so I suggest that the others be equally in-depth. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The bidder provides a means of auditing the bid, both in terms of the process and the final results. As it is a project that lasts three months, my suggestion is that at the end of each month a final report is made available that contains links to all the videos that were translated and also a small summary of how the team worked in that period of time. : if everything that was planned was done, both in the production of translation and in the dissemination of the content, if something was pending for the next month, if any difficulties were faced, etc. I think that this way, we would have a more complete understanding of the development process, beyond the posting of the videos itself (which is the most important thing, of course, but not the only thing to follow during the 3 months). And in terms of the final results, I would like more qualitative data to be analyzed in addition to the numerical statistics provided by the proponent. It is extremely important that we know the number of followers on the channel, the number of hours viewed, etc., because these quantities will objectively demonstrate the scope of this project. But beyond that, we would need to understand if the people who watched the translated videos were understanding well, if they actually became active members of the community, if they created digital wallets, acquired Ada, etc. This data could be collected through a direct survey with the channel's consumers, and the results of this survey would need to be made known to the Cardano community. This bridge can be established in several different ways, such as through more written forms, or through a video meeting between the team and some channel subscribers, who feel engaged in helping to understand the impact of this project, this meeting could be done in some post Town Hall room, recorded and posted on their own channel, of course, if all participants allowed it. In summary, I think the auditability is good, but it can improve in some points, mainly due to a more humane approach to the final results. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "\n\nTHese projects are not intended to build Devs. they are intended for 99% of the population who are non devs to onboard to Cardano as well, hold some ada, learn how to invest, how to increase their holdings in qty and value, and get used to a crypto economy.  \n\nDOes the community not understand simple KPIs?

In all other respects they are essential the same. Hence it is almost impossible to write 19 distinct assessments, I have tried to find specific differentiators but have also looked at the package of proposals as a whole as, I believe, this will add greater value to the voter. Looking at this specific proposal for translating videos into Telegu, it largely meets the challenge brief in seeking to broaden the horizons of the Cardano ecosystem. The proposer should be praised for taking the initiative. I would suggest the proposer uses the comments section to explain voters their rationale behind this multi-proposal approach. That should help with transparency and help people make an informed decision. For example: Are they looking for voters to decide on which languages they prefer thus restricting the choice to the existing community. This kind of defeats the purpose of reaching out to new communities. If this is the case I have done a rudimentary research on number of people speaking each language to help the voters make an informed decision. Given more time, an in depth analysis of demographics would be useful showing current literacy levels, access to technology, levels of education, English speakers, etc in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

In simple terms we are looking at a total ask of $135,900 of which $38,000 (28%) is contingency. At a proposal level that is $7100 budget with $2000 contingency. My project planning head immediately points to the 28% contingency. It is not clear what this is set aside for. A risk of ADA price fluctuation is noted in the proposals, however one of the proposed mitigations for that is a 10% contingency, the other being to sell funds privately to ADA holders. In addition the proposals states \u201cWe have ample resources to complete the project on time and within budget\u2019, once again raising the question on the need for such a large contingency in proportion to the budget? Now looking at what is to be delivered. Each proposal states the YouTube channel will be launched with 6 videos. We have to assume that means 6 videos translated in all 19 languages should they all be funded. After 3 months 10-20 videos (each translated in 19 languages) That gives us 380 translations in total at an average of 4 per day. I have run this by someone with experience in this area and their reaction was \u2018its going to need a considerable team\u2019. So, let\u2019s look at the evidence of a team with the skills to deliver this proposal. The proposer claims to have many years experience in this field but this is impossible to verify based on the evidence (LinkedIn profile) provided. The other key resource (Muthiah) presents as a trilingual translator. Specific languages are not mentioned so very difficult to validate of if they have the skills for this specific proposal Two other individuals are listed, their LinkedIn in profile are well populated but don\u2019t display the skills required to deliver this project. That leave us with the \u201cextensive network of Master translators\u201d. Again no evidence of their existence of previous work exists so impossible to evaluate. I believe the proposer has a lot to offer the ecosystem and can suggest the following: 1. Help the voter understand the need for 19 similar proposals 2. Provide evidence that they have access to the skills required 3. Look at a small scope with a set of languages he or Muthiah are comfortable with. Use this as a POC on both the translation and engagement side. SHOW the community this proposal is growing adoption. 4. Take the learnings (e.g. which types of video are interesting your audience) and if a larger (multi language) proposal is what is required submit it in a future fund leveraging in the economies of scale that will naturally provide on the maintenance of socials, contingency & marketing.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The metrics are sensible in terms of measuring engagement on youtube which is a great basic piece to measure.

So many reasons..\nCombining into one proposal may make sense to this proposer who may not be from Asia and recognize the huge diversity from state to state or region to region. All languages cannot be done by same people or same social media campaign.  This is why we broke up. Smaller proposals enable people to clearly see we are not here to grab money.   Each language needs its unique Social media campaign to reach people.  We cannot lump everything into one.   \n\nSecondly Why consider the total ask?  The rules state that each proposal has to be considered on its own merit.  Therefore even if  i had a hundred language proposals, if i had a hundred teams of two Master Translators and Two Proofreaders, then it will get the job done. We are doing this for 25 years buddy.   We know exactly how to run a translation project.\n\n\n\nHe goes on\nThe proposer claims to have many years experience in this field but this is impossible to verify based on the evidence (LinkedIn profile) provided. The other key resource (Muthiah) presents as a trilingual translator.\nI have stated as below, we have and use our extensive network of Master Translator Partners.\n\nThe assessor has not read the proposal. It states clearly as follows\nThe number of people required to complete this task has been calculated.  \nWe will be using our inhouse resources as well as obtain our Master Translator Partner network to handle overflow of work to ensure that our deliverables remain on track. They would be brought on board as and when needed and budget would include their costs\n\nI can see clearly that this assessor is merely following the wrong ideas of some CAs to say that the feasibility is not good because they believe I alone  is doing Or Mr Muthiah D is doing,  the translations or this internal team is doing the translation of all the 10 languages.  This is completely WRONG.  As mentioned above we are using our External partners who are Master Translators with many years of experience and qualifications in translating as Native speakers of Tamil both in Sri Lanka and India. So his feasibility assessment is wrong. \n\nHow the budget was calculated has been clearly laid out as follows.. if he claims he has read the other proposals he will know that we are doing 15000 words per project. Each word costs 0.08 for complete translation to voicing. This cost comes to 1200 and into 3 months it is 3600.  Then this language needs its own Social media campaign since the users of one language would not care about social media campaigns in another language. So all languages cannot be lumped together to do one campaign.  The cost of that being 1500..  Then for contingency we have allocated 2000.    \nSome specific statements that are absolute nonsense=\nHowever, because the primary responsibility of this position is to translate text from English to Tamil, the proposer should include more specific information on their translators' expertise in their Master Translator Partner Network.   As stated we have been doing projects for over 25 years. The definition of Master translator if this assessor doesn't understand is a MASTER OF HIS CRAFT.  A SENIOR IN THE INDUSTRY.   Each one will have different qualifications.  As for our specific master translator, he is the ONLY ONE IN SRI LANKA to write for the Mahawamsa which is like the BIBLE OF HISTORY of SRI LANKA for over 4000 years. It has been written from the time of kings.  This is a role that he alone in Sri Lanka has.

It is better if there is a translator who was born and growth in India and spoke in Telugu.  \n\nFor those reasons, I rate 2 stars for the Feasibility.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "\ud83d\udc49NOTE! Because of the similar content in the proposals, my assessments and rating for the proposals started with: 'Cardano in ' submitted by Dimitri Fernando might look similar. I wrote this after spending more than 10 hours reading. This was not copied from anyone.\ud83d\udc48 \n\nThe given metrics to measure is acceptable. And the success of the project Cardano in Telugu after 3 months is very obvious. But, it is better if you show a sample product. A video of an IOHK document that was translated into Telugu might help the community visualize your success. \n\nBecause this is your first time submitting a proposal, I suggest you should submit only 1 or 2 proposals for testing, you will have something to convince the community. You can start with the Telugu community. In addition, we also want to know how your team can manage more than 30 different projects if all your projects are funded. \n\nFor those reasons, I rate 2 stars for the Auditability.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_89", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "\nThis should be filtered out for following reasons\nHave we anywhere said that we are going to do the entire content within this particular proposal?  Surely anyone with a primary school scope of English understands that our overall objective is to translate the ENTIRE content of videos.\n\nIn many places in the proposal we have given our exact objective for this particular project.  We have also said how many minutes of video we would be creating. \nDoes this assessor ask devs to show sample product to get funding?   They get funding and then build an MVP.  \nAgain he asks how we can manage. WIth master translators. again read ..\n\n\nThe number of people required to complete this task has been calculated.  \nWe will be using our inhouse resources as well as obtain our Master Translator Partner network to handle overflow of work to ensure that our deliverables remain on track. They would be brought on board as and when needed and budget would include their costs\n\nI can see clearly that this assessor is merely following the wrong ideas of some CAs to say that the feasibility is not good because they believe I alone  is doing the translations or this internal team is doing the translation of all the 10 languages.  This is completely WRONG.  As mentioned above we are using our External partners who are Master Translators with many years of experience and qualifications in translating as Native speakers of Sinhala  in Sri Lanka . So his feasibility assessment is wrong. \n\n\n\nWe are running our translation agency for over 25 years now. We work on projects like this with Master Translators all over the world.  We are not doing it simply myself or the in house team.  We have an established and recognized process of translating a few hours of video to thousands of hours of video. The process is the same.  We just increase the number of Master Translators and Proofreaders, Voice artists, Editors, Subtitling Experts and so on.  T\n\n\nhe assessor has been influenced by IGNORANT GROUP THINK set in place by certain malicious CAs who seek to influence these CAs with rubbish instead of reading the proposal carefully since all facts are stated there. IF anything was still unclear I am a CA myself and was easily accessible through the CA chat or my own TG. Therefore please filter this out as its a malicious effort to bring down the proposal through ignorance.\n\n\nOn this basis we can see he is incompetent or biased and has to be filtered out.\n\n"}], "solution": "Provide translated videos in Telugu about Cardano ecosystem.
