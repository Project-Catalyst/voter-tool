It looks likely this project will make a positive impact because of a number of factors.\n\nThe plan is to engage with the community in a number of practical ways. One is on the selection of videos to be produced. As they acknowledge, knowing exactly what topics to cover is a challenge; this strategy at the very least shows a willingness and commitment to work with their more local community. This will enhance impact.\n\nAnother factor is the plan to do live support on Telegram. Team members have experience with English-language Telegram in this area.\n\nFinally, their commitment to making produced resources freely available to the public will add to impact, as will the choice of Hindi since Hindi is the most-used Indian language. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Feasibility looks strong due to solid previous related experience of team members not only in the area of SPO but also in creation of online guides and YouTube vidoes. Their SPO experience includes membership on SPOCRA board. \nThe fact their goals are limited to translating specific, already-identified guides, and making 12 videos, adds to credibility; they\u2019re not promising the moon. \nThis team is going to be very busy April-June to get all this done. But given their track record it\u2019s believable they will be successful. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The numbers look reasonable, e.g. $1250 to translate four guides. Unfortunately the \u2018video translation of current guide\u2019 for $1500 is unclear, will that be sub-titles or a whole new video or a transcript or\u2026? \u2018Project management and other expenses\u2019 is vague but $1250 seems reasonable, given the scope of the project and number of players. \nA little more breakdown of the numbers would have been helpful, but as far as a basic framework for auditability the numbers look adequate.\nUnfortunately the proposal doesn\u2019t give metrics for uptake of the learning materials e.g. views and interactions both on YouTube and Telegram. However given they\u2019re already active in Cardano it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll be able to promote the resources within the Cardano community and that will be enough to get the ball rolling. \nSuggestion for the team to check out the Kirkpatrick model of assessing instruction. It ranges from student satisfaction to changing student practice. Meaning an ideal metric would be to show how viewers of these resources are able to apply the knowledge in their lives. \nIt would have been good to see some resources going to promotion; presumably some of the $1250 for \u201cProject management and other expenses\u201d will go to that.   \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1391", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3060, "q0": "The aim is to create educational materials in Hindi language.

In the proposal there are 2 people who are in the team. This seems like a limited team to put everything together. The budget overview is very limited. It would be useful if it included hourly wages for the makers. I also think it would be interesting to put exact dates in the proposal about what they would release during that period. It also doesn't say what they're going to do with the copyright of various courses that need to be translated. There is nothing in this proposal about the pitfalls in this project. It might also be useful to raise money to buy laptops for families living in poverty. This proposal does not discuss the technical aspects. The advantage of this project is that it can be financed relatively with little money and yet it can have a major impact on the quality of education.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "In this proposal, the milestones are unclear to me about what the exact performance is. The schedule is very general. It is clearly described how they can solve the intended problem. There are no clear KPIs included in the proposal. This project certainly has a future in my view.

Firstly, I like how the proposer provides an initial goal of 12 videos and these videos will be uploaded to Youtube and spocra.

At this stage of proposal, project timeline should be presented in term of week for easy assessment of the project feasibility. Requested budget has been broken down into measurable details.

This amount is too little for 3 months project management, not to mention \u201cother expenses\u201d. Video translation (current English guides) 1500 USD. This amount is not assessable neither since it depends on the number of videos, the lengths of one video. Team members are meagerly introduced with related experience to the project.
