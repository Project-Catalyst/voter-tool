The LexDAO organization seems to be rooted in the Ethereum ecosystem. I had some difficultly researching LexDAO as some of the content seems to be restricted to members. But I found references to Gitcoin grants, references to ETHDenver, and in the video showcasing Geoff Costeloe, he makes reference to his experience as a Solidity developer. The proposal explains that as a first step they would \u201cSense the Cardano community to nominate public submissions opportunities.\u201d  Part of this work would include \u201cpolling affected Cardano subDAOs.\u201d I wish that the proposal had provided more details about how they plan to leverage their experience in other ecosystems for the benefit of the Cardano ecosystem. As the CA Guide states, a characteristic of an impactful proposal is that it \u201cclearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem.\u201d Particularly given the large amount of funding requested, I would like to see more evidence and more specifics regarding how the funds would be used to benefit Cardano. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "From what I could gather from the publicly available information, LexDAO appears to be a group of attorneys certified by some sort-of framework. As stated above, much of the information about the guild is restricted to the group\u2019s members. According to the proposal, members of this group submitted feedback to the Wyoming legislature regarding a bill about DAOs. A link to their Github repo is provided. I found the GitHub pages to be full of jargon that was not explained either in the repo or in the proposal. For example, Github referenced \u201ccodeslaw chefs\u201d and \u201cPoAPs\u201d and \u201cOpenLaw markdown.\u201d These references didn\u2019t tell me anything about the specific regulatory goals the group was pursuing, and in what way their efforts has successfully impacted the proposed legislation.  \n\nThe budget breakdown references 40% of the funding would go towards participation prizes such as books, swag, or social capital. I am not sure what \u201csocial capital\u201d means in this context as a prize to be allocated in return for participation. Given their total budget request of $150,000, 40% of that amount is $60k, which seems like a lot of money to be given away in the form of some sort of pirze. The second line item is 30% (or $45k) which would go to go the coordinator(s). As there is no information regarding who this individual is (or individuals are) it is impossible to evaluate whether they can feasibly deliver on this line item. The third line item involves paying bounties (20% or $30k). Additional details on how the bounty program would work would be helpful. \n\nThe final allocation is for, among other things, \u201cGas fees for PoAP.\u201d It is problematic for a proposal seeking funding from the Cardano Treasury that they plan to use those funds to pay for activity on the Ethereum blockchain. Perhaps they are not aware that Cardano has its own NFT minting and smart contract capabilities. I refer to the above section regarding the need for more details about the benefits to the Cardano ecosystem. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The auditability section does not provide specific or quantifiable KPIs or metrics to measure. There is not method to assess or evaluate what work has been done with the large amount of funds requested, whether that work was effective, and whether it successfully responded to the challenge brief.

This would have the advantage of focusing on policy changes that have worked in several other jurisdictions and attempting to recreate that success without essentially starting the legislative process from scratch each time. There is an acknowledgement of some of the potential difficulties that will be encountered with this model including jurisdictional differences which is good to see. The overall approach is broken down into phases which are a little hard to understand and even have different names in the impact section. The assumption is that these phases are part of the governance structure that the DAO will use to create beneficial legislation. With all that said I am having difficulty understanding how this way of producing a product (a piece of legislation) is better for the Cardano community than using catalyst to propose and fund these same products internally. If there is a distinct advantage specifically to using an outside structure for this I don't clearly see it and perhaps that could be expanded upon. One of the key pieces of this proposal also focuses on running \"hackathons\" which in this case are akin to crowdsourcing legislation. The monetary request to do this is high and again I do not see an explanation of why the model used in this DAO to do this is fundamentally better that using existing Cardano governance through catalyst. The possibility of being able to learn from previous legislative success and quickly apply those successes elsewhere is appealing but I feel the reason for the particular model used requires more clarity given the large amounts of funds requested. Another aspect of this proposal is that these proposed legislative documents would be useful across jurisdictions and be scaled globally. This is a big statement which would need clarification since jurisdictions all work under different models and authorities and therefore it is not self evident that this would work. For these reasons I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal has identified a number of particular legislative documents and entities that it would like to crowd source responses to/for. It also has left a category open for \"various crypto bills\" on top of the specific ones it mentions. This is good as it provides concrete goals but also some flexibility. It also provides 3 examples of previous work which consists of a petition, a proposal and a bill amendment proposal. This to me shows that there is a clear an achievable objective of producing crowd sourced responses to these various entities. I have been involved in petitioning government for legislative changes throughout my professional life on many occasions although admittedly only in one jurisdiction. From my experience politics is often about who you know rather that what you know. I would like to believe that the approach that this proposal aims to achieve of \"a sniper shot\" rather than \"shotgun\" is functional but I do not see the evidence of that yet. The examples that were provided do not show any resulting legislative changes. As a suggestion I would like to see a lobbying component to this proposal. Creating good policy is half the story, selling it is the other. I think this proposal shows that it can accomplish half that fundamental equation. Since this is also fundamentally a new approach I may be wrong about my assumption that you need lobbying for this type of initiative. In that case I would suggest that the proposer provides more examples of successful legislative changes that have been accomplished using their method. At this point I neither agree nor disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The metrics used for success are articulated and would be relatively easy to assess. There are no specific quantitative numbers given as to what would constitute a successful participation at a hackathon, or numbers of media mentions. Some more specifics would be useful in this section but the fact that qualitative goals were established is acknowledged. However more importantly there were many actions identified in the feasibility section which are ultimately what is important as metrics for this proposal. These are easily verifiable since they are public record documents that would be submitted to the various legislative agencies. Also successful legislative changes would also be easily verifiable and shared. I would suggest that these various concrete objectives be included in the auditability section of any future proposals for ease of assessment. Timeframes for how quickly these various documents could be completed and submitted should also be included.

The statement of risk Is: \"Incomprensible (exact spelling) Pitch - technical gobbygook deters grass-root advocation\".` Unfortunately, for what I think, could be a powerful proposal left me  with a bewilderment towards what this Proposal was working to achieve. I understand it is primarily seeking funding for a series of Hackathons of about 5-10 thousand per / total of $200,000 out of a budget request of $150,000. I have not been able to fathom what the Hackathons will achieve. Further I am not able to conceptualize how the proposal is demonstrating to address the Challenge of Crypto Currency favorable lobbying, education, rule influence or privacy legislation. I would advise the Proposer to re-edit the proposal and put it in ELI5 language for other Assessors and the Voters.

The proposal is not focused in it's presentation, which may be its biggest challenge to voters. Second the budget request does not meet its suggested expenditures. The solution (distilled version) is to 1. Sense, 2. Analyse(not my spelling), 3. Respond. The budget allocates $150 - 200 K out of a $150,000 Budget request towards 20-30 Hackathons with 40% of that for swag.  There is no budget allocation for the first two endeavors of Sensing and Analyzing.\n____________________________________________________\nThe team behind the proposal is a little fuzzy to my research.  There is a github with primarily a Youtube vid about DAO Denver. There is also a LexDaO Discord which apparently is a $300 a year membership driven not for profit association about legal settlements and coded agreements. It does appear to have history of what looks like legal consulting for a fee.\n____________________________________________________\nMy suggestion for my comfort level and perhaps those of the voters would be to adjust your proposal to state exactly who the team members would be administering this budget and the plan.
