So I agree with the proposer in that we need to make sure that a broader range of view points are considered in the design and implementation of a CBDC, if one is indeed pursued by the U.S. I am giving 4 starts because the project needs to provide more detail about how this think tank will be represented by a diverse group of participants to ensure that it effectively inspires favorable legislation for all of crypto and Cardano. For example, provide examples of what roles each member in the think tank should represent, such as stake pool operators, dapp builders, retail investors, privacy advocates, etc. CBDCs have the potential to be great financial surveillance tools, or great financial transacting agents. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This will be a tough challenge to fulfill unless the proposer can provide detailed information about their level of experience and expertise in the lobbying space, and how it will be put to use. It's going to be very important to be effective at capturing the attention of congressmen. Washington is a busy place and attention spans are small. So making sure that concise and effective ideas are proposed is tantamount to success. It might be more advisable to split this into a two phases. The first phase seeks to build out a representative and experienced set of think tank members that meet for several weeks to layout the tenements of their positions on CBDCs and the methodology they will pursue to deliver that message. Then in the second phase, the group requests funding from a future project catalyst fund to actually do the work, and head to Washington for in-person meetings with government influencers and congressmen. This would ensure that they groups unified message can be passed through the community as well. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Perhaps elaborate more on how you will provide updates to the project. For example, will you present to the Catalyst community? Will you release bi-weekly YouTube videos? How about asking for community input on ideas forming in the think tank? Communicating how funds are being used, and demonstrating progress will be important to get voter confidence.

The amount requested is very substantial, the risk of not finding the right people to join the think tank is pivotal, and the plan to share information with \"the right people\" doesn't give me a whole lot of assurance that the research would even be used. As an essential first step, I think this proposal needs confirmed reputable minds (with highly educated backgrounds) that are committed to participating. I also feel like I need more reliability in the relationships with \"the right people,\" such as specific names of core figures and their relationship with the idea and the people involved. These are factors that I cannot look past before giving more consideration to the proposal. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "There is no foundation for a reliable plan here. First, find people to be involved first, so that credentials can be provided. There also needs to be credentials for the person proposing this request, which could have been provided in this proposal. There needs to be a more specific breakdown of the costs for the budget, other than the requests for $30k, and a short statement on what it will be used for. If we don't know how the money will be budgeted and spent, there's no way for us to know if the money is being spent in a efficient and impactful way. The use of words like \"likely\" tells me that there is no concrete plan in place, which I think disqualifies the calculation for a need for $30k. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The listed goals for auditiability are not goals at all. They give a list of foundational criteria for what the CBDC would look like. However, there's no timeline, no outline of what is to be accomplished, and no identification of sourcing for where these bi-weekly updates would be posted. Again, I like the idea, I just don't see anything tangible for me to vote on here.

The problem also connects well to the challenge brief, as there is certainly a need for the blockchain industry to influence the evolution of any CBDC. However, the proposal states that the digital currency \u201cmust be able to be used on any blockchain.\u201d It would be worth debating whether that is a worthwhile objective, never mind whether the goal is technologically feasibile. But leaving that aside, the proposal needs more detail to explain how the use of the funds would directly benefit the Cardano ecosystem.

I googled Clear Contracts and was able to find LinkedIn profiles of the team behind the company. After looking at all five profiles, it is clear that while the team has a variety of skill sets, none of them list any lobbying or regulatory experience. The proposal provides a vague statement that the proposed think tank will be composed of a variety of different individual contributors. The proposal references the risk that it might be a challenge to find the right members. However, there is nothing to indicate how the proposer will recruit members to the think tank, how they will be incentivized or motivated to contribute, and how they will relate to one another.

Looking again at the goal of creating a token that could be used on every blockchain, it would be very difficult to audit this point. There are no concrete milestones to explain what progress towards this goal would look like. The amount requested, USD 30,000 is certainly not enough to support the creation of a US CBDC that was able to run on every blockchain (or even some subset of the top ten largest projects, to narrow the scope just a bit). Additional detail is also needed regarding the point that the currency must be \u201cthe most accessible asset ever to exist.\u201d A definition of accessible is required, as well as a plan for how the funds would be used to achieve that objective. Similarly, the vision of success includes a token that must have KYC included. More details are needed regarding what it would mean to \u201chave KYC included,\u201d and how the funds will be used in support of that objective. Furthermore, it would be interesting to understand how the proposer plans to reconcile some of these goals. For example, it would be difficult to include a KYC requirement with a token that needed to run on the Monero blockchain.

More think tanks are necessary to educate inform policy-makers and therefore support Cardano and crypto community in general.

Also, there is no indication as to why the design of any CBDC should be of interest to the Cardano community, save that it were to be implemented on the Cardano blockchain, which seems in all fairness highly unlikely due to the desire to maintain monetary sovereignty and control on the part of Central Banks as a whole.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Except for the previous proposals for funding, there is no provable track record of the proposer, be it through LinkedIn or with engagement to the community. More specifically, in spite of requiring a budget of 30000 dollars, there is absolutely no specification of allocation of funds in any way whatsoever, so it is impossible to assess feasibility since there is no objective budget for a potential roadmap or plan of action. For future iterations, a detailed spending plan to be able to make a valid analysis of budgetary requirements is indispensable.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Again, given the lack of a clear budget with specific allocations of funds, and with no KPIs other than an ideal set of characteristics for a CBDC, the community would be unable to audit the use of the funds required.
