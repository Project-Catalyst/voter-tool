By the way, the proposer can add some case-studies to persuade the readers more. \nAs the project target to train the legislators, the proposer already put the detailed numbers of legislators in specific state to be trained.

Therefore, it is suggested the proposer to prepare again the budget breakdown based on activities in the roadmap. In addition, the budget is better to write in detail, directly to kinds of payments.\nTeam allocation was prepared by the proposer.

The proposers seem to have a good grasp of the existing PA draft legislation, and how their efforts would fit into the current policy landscape. I was surprised that there is no mention of how supportive the current PA US senator is of the crypto industry. Pat Toomey is outspoken regarding his desire to promote the industry and protect innovation. Given the lead proposer\u2019s background, I am sure he is aware of Toomey\u2019s position, and would only suggest that Toomey might be able to support the team\u2019s efforts, especially since Toomey is heading into retirement from the US senate.

The KPIs reference additional meetings with the State Treasurer\u2019s Office, candidates for Governor and US Senate, and members of the Governor\u2019s office. From googling Dominic Folino, his LinkedIn profile details his extensive experience in this field. However, his only support for the lobbying activities seems to come from a much more junior member of the team, Caroline Ehrenfeld, and it is not clear whether she is engaged in the proposal activity on a full-time basis. It seems that the tasks might be too ambitious for the team referenced and for the requested budget. $20,000 for lobbying engagement does not seem to be enough to cover all the activities envisioned.  Looking at the PA Blockchain Coalition website, it seems clear that many more people are involved with this effort than are detailed in the proposal. Perhaps the amount requested would only provide some support for activities that are already ongoing. It would have been helpful to have this explained.  \n\nI would envision that it might be difficult to get the attention of some of the lawmakers. Those most in need of education are probably the ones least likely to make time to meet with a Blockchain Advocacy group. I would have been interested to learn how the team plans to mitigate this risk, although the proposer\u2019s experience in this industry suggests his skill is equal to the task. While accomplishing all of the intended meetings in a three-month time frame might have been impossible, the proposal details an 18-month time frame, which seems feasible enough to this CA who does not have a good understanding of how the lobbying process works. Getting legislation enacted with in an 18-month time frame also seems like a very ambitious metric. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal provides a clear roadmap with milestones.
