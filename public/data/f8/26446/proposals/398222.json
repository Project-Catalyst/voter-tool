Colombia is an emerging country, considered as one of the fastest growing cryptocurrency markets in Latin America, based on Chainalysis\u2019 2021 global crypto adoption index. The position of the Colombian government regarding crypto regulations, is related to the data recollection and country online investment interaction, that they have been working for future crypto legal establishment. However, sooner or later Latin America governments will accept cryptocurrencies as investment assets and financial instruments of exchange. The capital involved is too substantial to be ignored, particularly after the pandemic crisis. In this context, this proposal addresses the necessity of Cardano and blockchain adoption in certain jurisdictions, as happened recently with Bitcoin in El Salvador, since Colombia does not have a clear cryptocurrency regulation. The proposer explains the solution would be presenting a normative regulation like the one that the United State government published. Even though, this tentative plan identifies a problem within the challenge, I would suggest the proposer attaches references and documents that provide more specific information about \u201cThe Regulatory Projection and Financial Regulation Studies Unit\u201d, and how he is planning on adapting/adjusting this plan to the Colombian normative/legislative country reality. I also would not consider a draft or idea as mentioned in this study, a challenge or risks related to a future regulatory legislation, which can scale or be adjusted according to the Colombian crypto laws. We need to consider these types of crypto regulation implementations are first challenged, discussed and decided by the government and congress parliament, and the laws can vary from one country to another. \nScore given: 3\n\n\n\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "\nFEASIBILITY:\nThe proposer identifies a problem within this challenge and provides the presentation of a normative regulation based on a past project held by the United States government, related to regulation metrics for cryptocurrency. However, they do not provide evidence (references or links) of an adaptable draft, where he can explain this regulatory project and how it would be successfully implemented according to the Colombian cryptocurrency legislation. In addition, the budget does not provide enough information. The proposers estimate that it would take about 3 months to write and present the proposal for future regulatory crypto laws, but I believe we need to understand how the amount of 18000 USD would be distributed and invested throughout the process of gathering information, generating ideas, and putting up a formal Decree proposal for crypto purposes that can be successfully implemented. On the other hand, the proposer provides a professional social media reference (LinkedIn) that is not active/does not work when clicking on it. It is crucial to offer as much information as possible to verify that the proposers or team of a project, have the relevant skills and experience needed to execute a proposal. I would also like to point out that according to \u2018Semana\u2019 (a Latin American online newspaper), Jorge Castano (Colombian financial superintendent) describes in one of the written articles (in March 2020), there is a pilot program in Colombia, where people can interact from their bank accounts with digital platforms that buy and sell cryptocurrencies. This pilot program will be held until next year 2022, and based on the results, the government will define in which form the cryptocurrencies will be legally operated in Colombia. In this context, I do not think that the budget proposed is necessary, since the Colombian government, exchange cryptocurrency entities and other organizations are already working towards crypto legislation in Colombia. This is the Spanish link which provides the previous current situation about  the crypto pilot project: https://www.semana.com/economia/inversionistas/articulo/el-futuro-de-las-criptomonedas-en-colombia-se-definira-en-marzo-de-2022/202144/\nScore given:1\n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "AUDITIBILITY:\nThe proposer does not offer the detailed procedures he will utilize to measure the progress of the project. I understand he is estimating a 3-month time frame to investigate, write and present a proposal to help regulate cryptocurrency in Colombia, but I would suggest contacting specialized attorneys and professionals in the finance/investment field, who work for the government. I appreciate the time and effort the proposer has invested in offering and idea that focuses on a current problem for cryptocurrency regulation in developing countries, but it is important to remember that this type of matters are sensitive procedures that are discussed and managed by the government and bigger legislative organisms. Also, the project is lacking on providing active online references, to verify the skills of the team and to provide more professionalism and validity of a project, I would suggest updating this information.  On the other hand, it does not look clear to me the way the proposer explains the success of the project. I understand that investigation and creation of technical content related to regulation of cryptocurrency is the first step to push a law approval, however there are different online sources that demonstrate and verify explanation and updates based on cryptocurrency advances in Colombia, and how this subject is already been addressed by different entities. \nScore given: 1\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1557", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 464, "q0": "The proposal is about providing the legal services of the proponent to build regulation of cryptocurrencies like never before in Colombia. In my opinion, this is an interesting idea and has a great challenge, because creating a completely new regulation for a country is not a simple matter. As far as I understand, comments on the development of financial regulations should be decided by the \"Financial Regulation and Forecast Research Unit\". So is the proponent a member of this unit?

The proposed implementation plan is 90 days or 3 months to investigate, write and present the proposal.

As much as I admire the passion and energy thrown into this proposal, I am highly skeptical that this is a sensible thing to do. Knowing intimately a lot about how legislative processes usually occur in more than one jurisdiction, I fear that a very high risk of this project will be simply that the regulators will not take it into account. Let me try to explain why. When such a legislative body is slammed with a fully drafted project, unseen before, it takes a tremendous amount of energy and will power for the involved public employees just to go through the proposal and understand the sometimes complex train of thought that went into its creation. It\u2019s a very unusual circumstance to say the least. \n\nMoreover, such a project would be very hard to scale and replicate efficiently for other use cases / other jurisdictions. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team \u2026 is actually composed of the proposer himself. I sincerely feel that such an undertaking is better suited for a collective effort of a well bonded team with good and very good connections to the regulatory bodies of the respective countries. \n\nThe budget is also brushed with very thick strokes and leaves a lot to be desired in terms of granularity. We only know that \u201cfor the investigation and legal advice, 3K USD are needed per month, thus 9k USD for 3 months and an additional 9k USD for the legal advice\u201d. \n\nAs far as planning goes, the project should be finalized in 3 months and presented in front of the regulatory body. Even disregarding the fact that the granularity leaves a lot to be desired, I find it highly unlikely that such a complex project setting the tone for crypto regulation can be drafted in such a short time by a fully fledged team, let alone by a single person as in this case, even accounting for all the energy and passion put into it. There are countless implications that have to be assessed: tax, legal, connecting with the wider law framework, analyzing policy options, gauging law makers' appetite for certain topics, etc. \n\nMy honest and sympathetic advice is to take a step back and try to gather a team around this project and for the next iterations focus on finding ways of working with the regulatory bodies from the very onset, and channeling the energy towards reaching common ground and advancing their understanding of the topic instead of focusing on delivering ready made proposals. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "As much as I hate to say this, the success of such a project is likely to be measured in a binary way: either it is successful (if regulators take it into account, read it, ask questions, understand it, use parts of it in the future, use it as reference, take it as a beacon of good practices etc.) or \u2026 simply gets shelved with close to zero impact and being very difficult to assess from the outside which one it is, since regulator\u2019s opaqueness will come into play. \n\nTo sum everything up, it is a project difficult to keep track of (being an individual effort), no practical KPIs are provided and none that I can think of, and the only deliverable towards the Cardano community I can see is the draft proposal in Spanish, obviously useful for the Spanish speaking community and much less for anybody else.

I wish that more information had been provided to explain what a \u201cDecree\u201d is, the process one would go through to develop one, and the impact it would have on the legislative process.

According to the commenter, one must be a Congressman of the Republic or have sufficient contacts in order to promote a debate.
