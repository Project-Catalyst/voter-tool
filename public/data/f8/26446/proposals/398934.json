This is to explain why this solution chooses to approach lawmakers in Sri Lanka.

For future iterations, perhaps an integral Lobbying for Cardano in South Asia Challenge setting might be more interesting. Also, seeing as there is another Lobbying for Cardano in Sri Lanka proposal in this same Challenge and Fund8, perhaps join efforts with Dimitri Fernando (the other proposal\u00b4s author and Founder of the South Asian Town Hall) to create synergies and devise a more effective and well-rounded strategy for future editions.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer has no verifiable experience within Catalyst, although many proposals have been submitted in the current Fund.

Also, it would be interesting to explore which governmental regulatory bodies and authorities would be approached to initiate the lobbying strategy (eg., which representatives should be approached first due to their prior known pro-crypto stances to serve as the vanguard for lobbying favourable legislation, or identifying and engaging key bureaucratic positions within the national system to be able to become aware of potentially damaging legislative proposals before they are approved and irreversible).", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The bulk of the funds requested aim at the establishment of a lobbying panel that has no stated characteristics (lawyers, legislative assistants, congressmen, blockchain specialists, etc).
