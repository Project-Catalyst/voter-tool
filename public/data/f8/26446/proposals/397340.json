The aim is to empower youth and women entrepreneurs through education, social and political change. This would be accomplished through creating training resources both for youth and women entrepreneurs and also for policy makers. These are laudable goals which would likely create value for the community. The resources are targeted to specific groups but would be made available for free to anyone who wants to access them which is also good to see. The proposal however does not match the challenge goals well. The KPIs do not specifically address material for legislators or regulators. The challenge goals are oriented to lobbying politicians for better tax rules, usage rules, and privacy rules for cryptocurrency. The challenge also incorporates an aspect of focus on PoS and Cardano particularities. None of these aspects are a stated particular focus of this proposal. One could argue that social metrics in legislation is beneficial to all aspects that we should care about. As someone who has experience with interpretations of legislation and legal documents I would say that this would not be an accurate description of the spirit or intent of the challenge as written. I would recommend that this proposal be submitted into a more appropriate category for funding. Therefore although this is a solid proposal in many other ways, I disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.

The resources required are broken down into categories and those categories seem reasonable in the sense that the budget and the goals are well matched. There is a realistic timetable provided for the objectives of the project. The project is working in partnership with other well known projects in the community who have solid reputations which improves the odds that the objectives here would be rolled out successfully. It is also very good to see that there is some thought put in on how to avoid duplicating efforts through ongoing dialogue with other projects. Any economies that projects can make in that sense is obviously beneficial for the community and shows conscientiousness on the part of the proposers. One suggestion I would have is to elaborate on the challenges anticipated. This is not touched on very much other that saying that the goal is to move away from male dominated traditional commerce.

The milestones are realistic and include dates for implementation (in the feasibility section) and when pieces will be ready for use. The key goals are included but does not show specific KPI targets which would be good to have to form a more quantitative measure of successful implementation. For example there could be a target of educating X number of new entrepreneurs in online business or producing X number of courses. The timeframes for all this could also be duplicated in the auditability section for easier assessment since they are only in the feasibility section. There is no specific mechanism mentioned where the community can go to measure the progress although the team is active in the community and would have many ways to make progress visible.

It has a coalition of like minded organization, a mini Whos Who in Cardano, which is the number four of the key metrics in the Challenge Brief - Number of partnerships and collaborations with organizations and non-profits that work in the same cause. The Proposal does not address from my reading and assessment the first goal of Lobbying but does directly address the education of Legislators. I would suggest to the Proposers that an edit to strengthen voter attraction would occur if the sections on Legislators education on Crypto Currency were more emphasized in the proposal. This would elevate my assessment based on the Challenge brief to a 5 - Strongly Agree, that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\n___________________________________________________\nSuccess for this Proposal is well defined as well as the key metrics it addresses.

From the proposers I am impressed about their ability to write on the problem statement. It gives a clearer picture about what is actually happening in most African countries. Whilst the pandemic has made countries recognize the need for deeper digitalization, the digital divide has also widened within and across countries. The digital skills gap is one of the major deficits that many developing, least developed and small state economies are challenged with. The most affected from the digital divide are women across and within countries hence the proposal to empower women and Africans in general on Project Catalyst and for that matter Cardano is a well thought one.
