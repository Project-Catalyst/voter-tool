The prototype has been in development since 2018 (even before Catalyst funding) and has been used by diverse groups for various purposes, for instance (1) schools creating teaching guidelines, (2) demands list by NGOs / protest movements or (3) NGO - gov\u00b4t - municipality collaboration for climate plans. \n\nThis proposal aims to modify and adjust the platform in order to enable activities aligned with the lobbying for favorable legislation challenge: (1) create a special website, (2) implements UX/UI adjustments, (3) Initiate webinars and workshops and (4) translate the platform in 3 to 5 major languages.\n\nI would judge the scalability outlook for the project as rather modest, knowing that adoption amongst country regulators will be a door-to-door uphill battle where it is unlikely that a major success / adoption in one jurisdiction will spur adoption in other jurisdictions with less evangelical efforts. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is a solid team / business behind this project, so it has good to very good chances of implementing it, especially given the fact that it had received funds in previous rounds and that a working product is already up-and running, so only additions are necessary. The overall budget is very reasonable, with 50% going towards UI/UX and the rest for content, translation support and other dev needs. I am not sure however if the proposed budget for translation would really cover the needs for a meticulous translation to the 3-5 languages advertised - perhaps a bit of clarification on this topic would be useful for next rounds in case funding will not be secured this time. There is a rough timeline offered, with major milestones being achieved anytime between 8 to 25 weeks from launch, so we can reason that the project aims to be completed in 25 weeks, with the webinars and workshop extending the most. \n\nI think that the proposal would have benefited two additional ingredients: \n- propose mechanisms through which to identify high-potential languages or countries for allocating translation resources where they will impact the most;\n- allocating at least part of the resources towards raising awareness / business development /  building a network of contacts in target countries.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal offers KPIs for 3 years after the launch, including 5 to 10 different bills / legislation proposals from different jurisdictions uploaded to the platform, 250-2500 registered users and among them at least 10% known lawyers/policy experts. I find the proposed indicators and targets fairly challenging but overall making sense in the project's context. Perhaps future iterations can include feedback modules from users in order to create virtuous feedback loops. \n\nSadly, there is no proposed mechanism or website / module to offer more information to the Cardano community with regards to the implementation. Perhaps future iterations / projects from the team might include a description regarding how they envisage communicating and bringing assurance to the community in a regular fashion.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1454", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 463, "q0": "The goal of this proposal is to introduce and refine the Consenz application: the agreement-building application that can be used to create an open law drafting process that allows a large number of active participants to review and edit documents, creating a \"microdemocracy\" system.

In order to have a diversity of perspectives reflected in the creation of new crypto legislation, we need an efficient and organized method of gathering information and feedback from a wide variety of constituents. The technology platform the team plans to develop would add value to the Cardano ecosystem by enabling the community to easily contribute to the process of legislation creation. The metrics and goals directly align with the challenge brief as the team plans to influence the passage of legislation in multiple different jurisdictions. The team is building a platform and it is easy to imagine how it could scale for many different regions and systems by making minor changes to the technology. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The technology itself and the teams ability to tailor their solution for the legislative process seems very clear. They already have an MVP in the works and provided a good demo for the CA/vCA subcircle. The team members have a wide range of skills, including experience in various aspects of technological development. The biggest challenge from a feasibility standpoint will be getting legislators, and all those involved in the legislative process, to actually use the technology. I envision that this effort will require strong business development and sales skills, as well as good connections and networks within the jurisdictions targeted for the tools\u2019 usage.  Team member Ofry Erlich brings both of these skills to the project. He has worked in software business development and has connections to the Israeli political system. My advice to the team would be to concentrate on using the tool first within the Israeli legislative process. Once success has been achieved with one government, it will be easier to market the tool to other countries and jurisdictions. I would also encourage the team to build their network of legislators and lobbyists in other geographical areas. There are even other lobbying proposals in this challenge that might be interested in utilizing this tool for their work. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap provided in the feasibility section provides a very clear path to describe the development of the tool. The budget line items also align well with the roadmap. However, the KPIs focus on usage of the tool, rather than its development. They also apply to 3 years following launch, which would make it difficult to audit them as funds are being released. The KPIs also seem aggressive, given the budget request. Nothing in the budget is allocated the marketing effort needed to get \u201c5 to 10 different bills\u2026uploaded\u201d and nothing is mentioned regarding the networking required to ensure that \u201cat least 10% (of the registered users are) known lawyers/policy experts.\u201d I also think it is wildly optimistic to describe as the success of this particular project that the consenz platform \u201cbecomes the standard drafting tool\u2026in 5 different countries at least.\u201d Nevertheless, I admire the team\u2019s vision and would only suggest that additional funding and projects will be needed to accomplish these lofty aspirations.

There is little or no efforts being made to justify to politicians and legislatures the need for cryptocurrencies and cardano particularities to operate freely. \n\nThis task is a difficult one since it could take years to draft and pass parliamentary Bills or Executive Instruments for cryptocurrencies and Cardano in particular to have the environment to operate. \n\nHowever, if we do not start now and early, things may get out of hand and it could double the years to fight for friendly laws for the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem. \n\nThis proposal is specific to create the platform to gunner for the lobbying for favorable legislations.
