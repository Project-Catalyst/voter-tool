And of course, in order to be able to shape legislation, one needs to first of all establish a reputable voice and wrap its existence around a traditional solution such as an NGO / think tank. \n\nA successful project deployment would also bring about significant synergies for future similar projects, with potential good practices emerging from such policy shaping activities, or even casting a wide net and merging several lobby activities under the same umbrella and benefiting from an already existing organization recognized by stakeholders - so great scalability potential.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The core team consists of three members: A researcher with years of experience in think tank development and non-profit management, an advocate of the High Court of Kenya and a cryptocurrency enthusiast with experience as a risk and compliance officer. One of the members is an active Catalyst member, and this is definitely an argument that they have a solid understanding of the funding process and community\u2019s expectation towards each funded project. It is also worthy of praise the fact that all team members have made their Linkedin profiles available and one can very easily assess the way in which their expertise and skills match the project. I do have mixed feelings however whether the overall team generally present high enough caliber for a project with such an increased visibility, and I see merit in striving to on-board additional members in the future. \n\nThe budget is sufficiently granular, but to turn this proposal into an excellent one I feel that at least some broad indication of hourly rates should have been provided at least for the items where the efforts will commensurate mostly into hours of work by the core team. There are also certain items which make me wonder what exactly will be the use for those items, for example Team fees to offer the most obvious example. \n\nTime-wise the project is split into three main parts. The first one (1-3 months) comprises mostly set-up efforts and marketing and outreach activities. The second one (4-9 months) would focus on research, publishing policy papers articles and increased development efforts. Lastly, the third phase (9-12 months) would bring to fruition the efforts in the prior phases through engagement with authorities and an increased media presence, and hopefully partnerships with visible stakeholders. Although the general idea is definitely there, I would have appreciated a drill down in some key topics, for example regarding what kind of research / policy papers they envisage to publish, or what kind of partnerships they seek to develop in the long run. You know the saying, if you do not know where you are sailing, no wind is favorable. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I salute the team\u2019s openness towards auditability, since they have pledged to make their activities open, and recording of stakeholder and educational outreach available to enable tracking. They have also created a channel on Discord and would publish the activities on a partner institute\u2019s website.\n\nThere are also a number of KPIs presented by the team that will further strengthen the team\u2019s ability to deliver clarity to the Cardano community: number of reports, media appearances, policy papers, advocacy campaigns. I see a lot of merit in such a quantitative approach, but feel somehow that future iterations might take into account adding a few qualitative indicators as well, albeit much more difficult to design, implement and track. To name just a few, perhaps they could implement some sort of feedback mechanism amongst stakeholders through which to gather feedback following their interaction on certain topics. \n\nA last strength of this proposal is the fact that the team is well aware of the risks involved in undertaking such policy shaping activities, and rightfully identified that varying interest from political stakeholders for certain topics is usually a major challenge, and they provide a positive example of how they tackled such a problem in the past. The humbleness of how they approach that example gives me a slight extra boost of comfort that the team is fairly well positioned to face future challenges.

However, for future iterations of this project, I would suggest focusing and narrowing the scope of the use for the funds requested (or of the planned output of the CCL) for specific policies that favor Cardano adoption (for example, advancement of PoS vs PoW draft legislation, bearing in mind the environmental benefits of PoS blockchains such as Cardano).", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer lacks any prior engagement with the Catalyst and Cardano community, given this is his first interaction with the project.
