This proposal is judged partly through its individual merits, and partly through the way it fits into the wider DLT360 project. My assessment takes into account aspects common across all proposals (team specific like adequacy, competency, workload, or similar reporting mechanisms / budget logic). You shall therefore find common parts across these proposals (labeled as such) and parts specific to each proposal.\n\nSpecific part: this proposal aims for a leading member of the DLT360 team to lead the setup of a legal think tank in Brussels, covering the European market and European legislation that relate to stakeholders in the crypto-industry.  \n\nI think there is a fair connection between the proposal and the challenge - and I fully understand that the desire to \u201clobby\u201d for legislation is easier said than done, and I think this kind of effort is, although not enough to reach that purpose, definitely a step in the right direction. Actually influencing legislation will surely come down the line at some point.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "COMMON part: Great team. DLT360 is operated by an outstanding and growing team of regulatory experts, very active in the Cardano community. They also benefit from a scalable network of contributors from the Cardano community, academia, industry and EU institutions. In terms of team competence, skills and experience, they are well positioned.The multitude of projects funded under their umbrella showcases the great capacity to identify opportunities within the Cardano community and clearly articulate them into actionable projects. \n\nCOMMON part: Significant existing and future workload. DLT360 is a wider project initially funded in Fund6, and greatly supported by at least 5 proposals in Fund7, for a total funding so far of 85.000 USD (own calculations), many of them being still ongoing. During Fund8 the team is casting a very wide net with at least 20 additional proposals across several challenges, for a total funding of at least 411.000 USD. Onboarding so many projects so quickly can potentially lead to: too much workload, overlapping deadlines, increased risks of under-delivering, inability to distinguish added value of one project versus another, unnecessary stress and a lack of focus on and core scope and competencies. Future iterations that can bring comfort to these worries will of course be highly appreciated. \n\nCOMMON part: ALL of the 13 projects have overhead items included in the budget (project management, social media, back office, etc.) consuming an overall 30-40% of each budget (an educated guess let\u2019s call it). I think there was a missed opportunity there in terms of gathering all overheads under one roof and simplifying the budgets for all proposals by keeping them strict for core-activities.\n\nSpecific part: 70% of the budget goes towards the personal time of the project leader, at a rate of 800 EUR/ day (2-3 days/month). Loic dictates that the project can carry on for 15 months until exhausting the budget. \n\nHe is a Brussel-based lawyer with 10 years of experience in tech law, and author of several legal crypto- publications. He would have an \"office day\" per week where people can call or mail, and set up video-conferences to ask their questions. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "COMMON part: Existing track record. DLT360 projects are interlinked and since there are a number of running projects the team is definitely familiarized with the standard procedures and reporting process of the Catalyst team, so there are very low risks in terms of failing to communicate properly or inability to implement the necessary KPIs. \n\nThe proposer will keep timesheets to show the community about the kind of work he does. Legal questions and answers will be anonymized and made available to the Cardano community, for their own benefit.

While potentially highly beneficial, the Guide states that the impactful proposal must have metrics and goals that align with the challenge setting. The challenge brief calls for the \u201ccreation of an environment of laws that are more favorable.\u201d The metrics described in this proposal focus on the interpretation of existing laws, rather than the creation of new laws.  Lobbying efforts are mentioned in a couple of places, including in response to the comment referenced above. However, there is no detail provided regarding what actions would be taken as part of this lobbying effort, and all the specifics in the Feasibility and Auditability section relate to providing legal advice. The Guide also states that an impactful proposal should add value to the Cardano ecosystem. Interpreting current regulations and laws for the cryptocurrency industry is an incredibly difficult task. The ability to consult with trained legal experts would add considerable value to the ecosystem. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer is a European-qualified lawyer with some years of experience in the IT industry. He previously worked for large corporates and law firms, and now runs his own legal firm. Following on the comments in the prior section, I could not find any evidence of past experience with lobbying or legislative work.  The budget is divided into various line items and corresponds to the road map. The proposal is very ambitious, and the proposer plans to offer a wide variety of services including publications, direct legal advice, and seminars. The wide range of activities could suggest a lack of focus. However, it is more likely that he proposer is highlighting the areas in which he could provide assistance and will respond to the specific requests that arise from the community.  As lawyers themselves need to work within their own tightly controlled regulatory framework, it would be interesting to understand if the proposer intends to offer specific legal advice, and if he plans to put that advice into writing to provide to the projects that consult with him. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The road map and milestones provided are clear and seem achievable.  The publication of practical guidebooks regarding regulatory changes would also provide value to the community, and it will be straightforward to audit whether those are delivered as described.

This proposal clearly tackles the main fronts identified by this challenge, with the added bonus that a Brussels-based crypto advocacy group would enable lobbying for a large number of jurisdictions from one sole geographical vantage point, thus potentially also reducing the associated upkeep and maintenance costs for the advocacy group. It would be interesting to know whether the proposer plans to engage only at the EU-level, or rather take advantage of the national representatives from the EU member states in Brussels to advance bilateral advocacy and lobbying efforts, rather than focus solely on the multilateral aspect, seeing as many attributes regarding crypto regulation may indeed remain wihtin regulatory discretion of the national-level authorities.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer's prior experience and previous written articles regarding the subject showcase the necessary expertise to develop the proposal. Also, the willingness displayed in comments and replies (both here and in the Fund7 proposal) to generate synergies with other like-minded projects plays towards the author's strengths and willingness to engage with other Community members in furthering the portrayed goals. It is interesting that in this iteration the proposer has identified  profiles for potential team members (DLT 360), but it still would be interesting to explore which governmental/inter-governmental regulatory bodies and authorities would be approached to initiate the lobbying strategy (eg., if speaking EU-wide legislation, which countries\u00b4 representatives should be approached first due to their prior known pro-crypto stances to serve as the vanguard for lobbying favourable legislation, or identifying and engaging key bureaucratic positions within the EU system to be able to become aware of potentially damaging legislative proposals before they are approved and irreversible).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap and proposed budget are merely indicative of the costs associated with creating the lobbying group set forth within the proposal. However, in spite of saying that he will comply with the necessary reporting as part of Project Catalyst, the lack of clear milestones, KPIs and success metrics hinders the auditability of this proposal; I would strongly recommend monthly goals set out in regards to either specific measurable lobbying efforts (interviews with national/EU level representatives and/or bureaucrats), published articles, crypto-favorable legislative or regulatory drafts to be circulated to already vetted pro-crypto representatives within the EU system of national governments, growth of number of members actively taking part in the advocacy group, etc.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_787", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Creation of EU crypto advocacy think tank (part of DLT 360), helping Cardano stakeholders with legal Qs +be SPOC for knowledge.", "experience": "European Business & Tech lawyer and crypto entrepreneur with 10Y XP, author of several legal crypto publications, already working with DLT360 https://www.dlt360consulting.com/ (today unpaid) to provide legal & regulatory clarity to the Cardano community"}
