With this proposal they are asking for funding to analyze the scope of a potential integration with Cardano. Following this initial effort, this might (or not) materialize into high potential areas to be later on built / integrated.  \n\nI am not convinced that there is a good fit of the proposal with the challenge. Since Ferrum is unsure that there is a potential to be integrated with Cardano, a primary step would be for Ferrum to pay a closer look at their current and future services and development plans and come up with viable avenues for integration. This argument gains even more weight when considered at the same time with the fuzzy budget logic that renders the project highly unfeasible in my opinion. Unclear potential, so 3 stars I think are appropriate.  ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team behind Ferrum seems very strong, and they have made an excellent effort into presenting themselves. \n\nFrom a budgetary point of view, this proposal is unique, unfortunately, since it has used absolutely no figures whatsoever. The entire budget section is simply an argument as to why granting the funds is necessary in order for Ferrum \u201cto be able to justify prioritizing this integration [...]  cognizant of their backlog\u201d. Rephrasing the argument, for me it sounds more like \u201cwe are not entirely sure that there is a business case to be made here, but if you fund us we shall make an effort\u201d.  Moreover, this proposal is also highly dependent on an additional proposal from Fund 8, without which the project cannot be successfully completed. \n\nThese red flags combined render the proposal infeasible in my opinion.

If this idea is a good idea, and the service model will be profitable, which it likely would be, then I believe Ferrum can fund this initiative, not Catalyst, and let the market decide if it provides value. The more pools that are run by these \"professional\" services, the harder it will be for new stake pool operators to get started and be successful.

The pitch deck does provides details and customer's stories but no evidence or link were provided to validate the claim of 150 clients using it or the Algorand grant. \nThe goals provided are kind of broad and not specific, mentioning functions of the Staking service and integration to Cardano, but not how that will help this challenge to reach its goals, hindering the possibility to assess their impact. \nSo I suggest to work on those details, completing the proposal as per the level of detail expected in a Catalyst proposal, for it to be assessed appropriately.

Also as part of the process the proposers mention \"Cardano\" as an entity that will verify the deliverables and provide further guidance, but that entity does not exists within the Cardano Ecosystem, it would be really beneficial for a future proposal, that the proposers get more acquainted with the Cardano Ecosystem (Foundation, IOG, Emurgo, Catalyst) so it can be more specific on that type of assertions. \nThe budget requested is in line with the challenge expected proposals, and maybe is appropriate for the successful completion of the proposal, but there's no rationale being provided on how it will be used and when in order to be able to analyze it. \nI suggest you to get back to the project board, produce all this details that are required for a Proposal to successful, in case you are voted by the community it will be key for the progress of the project and for the reports the community request later and if it is not funded, to be able to give it a try in next fund.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are not measurable KPIs provided, nor dates or any information provided so that the community can properly audit and track the progress and delivery of this proposal.\nThere are commitments and some methods indicated, such as that progress and financial reports will be provided but nothing about what will be tracked and how to know if the Return on Intention will be produced.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_288", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal is very well crafted and all aspects of why this could prove to be impactful to the Cardano community are presented in a detailed manner, with examples given to support most claims. The plan is clear and detailed and most aspects related to why the proposed Ferrum staking solution would be beneficial are much better presented than most proposals.\n\nHowever, there are a few reasons why I can\u2019t grade the impact of the proposal with a maximum score. Given that assets on Cardano are issued as native tokens, not bound by a smart contract, and that the protocol itself operates under the model of liquid staking I remain unconvinced as of now that locked staking solutions would prove to be very popular in the Cardano community. I am aware that they represent the standard operating procedure on most other blockchains, but because of the difference in the model of the base protocol, I sense that Cardano has a different culture in this regard.\n\nPlease also read the note at the end of the auditability section, as it applies to every section of the proposal.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The milestones, roadmap, and KPIs provided are clear, detailed, and easy to follow.\nThe team is named, seems very adequate to implement the project, and bio for each of the members is given, but unfortunately, no external links or references are present to support the info.\n\nThe biggest downside of the feasibility section, however, is the budget breakdown, apart from a general overview of the proposed distribution there are very few details justifying the requested amount, which makes it very hard to ascertain if the budget is adequate for the needs of the project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal focuses on the methodology that the implementers will use internally to measure their progress, unfortunately not enough emphasis is presented on how that progress will be reported, because the KPIs and the metrics that the auditors will be able to monitor to verify the progress are not clearly stated. To some extent the metrics and KPIs can be deduced from other sections of the proposal, but I really would have liked to see them clearly stated and presented in a manner appropriate for auditing.\n\nThe definitions of success question is very summarily answered, more details and possibly a breakdown of the envisioned success in 3, 6, and 12 months would have certainly been helpful to keep track of the project.\n\nNote (this applies to all sections of the proposal):\nWhile at some level I appreciate the ingenuity of the Ferrum team to split the same project into multiple development goals and submit basically identical proposals, I have deducted a point from the score of every section of the proposal for this as I feel it represents a somewhat dishonest attempt at gaming the Project Catalyst system. On the other hand, I too share the teams frustration with Project Catalyst\u2019s clear trend of favoring \u201ccheap\u201d projects over much more feasible and impactful ones, that would naturally come with a higher price tag, but I don\u2019t think that gaming the system is the solution. As a result, I have only subtracted 1 point from the score - otherwise, I would have considered an attempt to game the system as a serious infraction.\nFor instance what happens if only one of the proposals gets funded, as it stands I see these options:\n\n\t1)\tThe project doesn\u2019t get done due to insufficient funds\n\t2)\tThe project does get made, but because of lack of funds the developers are underpaid\n\t3)\tThe sum asked for in the proposals is grossly over-budgeted to account for the possibility of a project not being funded.\n\nNeither of them seems like a desirable option.
