It is about evolving a project that already exists, which is based on the following situation: our wallet addresses are very large and complicated, people are insecure about making transactions on the blockchain because they are not sure if any characters are wrong, so usually they do a test sending 1 ADA just to check if everything is ok even with the address created. This is quite problematic because, as the proponents report, it ends up causing people to spend twice as much on transaction fees. It is much better in fact if our addresses were shorter and simpler, this would convey much more security when receiving or sending our cryptocurrency. The idea of \u200b\u200bthis proposal is to create a list of contacts, that is, addresses, that are saved so that we can transfer or receive Ada more quickly and safely from frequent contacts. Let's imagine that a company decides to adopt payment in Ada and asks its employees to create wallets. Even if the group of employees is not that large, for example, it could be 5 employees, the boss would probably do the test transfer to verify that their wallet addresses are correct. This is problematic on two points: the first, which has already been explained by the proponents, in which the employer would pay double the fees (which gets worse if we are talking about executing the payment of 5 employees, as there would be a total of 10 fees paid) ; and the second problem would be the work it would take to get the addresses of each employee, this would take some time since each one has its own very extensive code. 582 / 5.000\nResultados de tradu\u00e7\u00e3o\nIf this payment is made monthly, for example, if the boss already has a list of his permanent employees in his portfolio, he can select the payment in a much more practical way. That is, the evolution of this application really aligns with what we are looking for in the challenge, as the proponents themselves claim, the proposal would meet the following commands: \u201cwhat needs do Cardano users have that can be solved by new applications?\u201d + \u201cwhich apps offer the most value with the least technical sophistication?\u201d + \u201cIntegrations with existing products\u201d. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the script, I thought that the proponents could have been a little more specific about the activities that would be developed in the months in question, August, September and October. They tell us the main tasks for each month, but it would be even better if they had detailed each one more. For example, we know that in August we will be working on the \u201cAddress Book UX Design\u201d. How will this be done? How will the designer propose this interface, what would his work routine be like so that this goal is delivered at the end of the month? My opinion is that the schedule is not bad, but also has a more basic character. Now talking about the use of funding, the amount requested for the project is 10 thousand dollars, the proponents explain that this funding would be used for the salary of the professionals involved. It would be $1,000 for the designer, $1,000 for the project manager, and $8,000 for the software engineer. I believe that, as with the script, a little more detail could have been delivered here. How many hours a day do these professionals intend to work? For how many days a week? Since the engineer will work part-time, would it be 4 hours a day of work, taking into account that a daily is usually 8 hours? I believe it is possible to understand the reason for this amount, and I really think it is fair for the proportion of the project and the benefits it will generate for the Cardano community, however I would be more pleased if these more details were provided. And finally, speaking of the team, in my view this part is perfect, we know the names, the professional roles and some past experiences of each member of this team. They are very experienced in their areas of expertise, having already delivered several projects and tools, and are very active in our community as well. Trust is also passed on because they are already developing this project, this proposal would be an evolution of the product. So, about the team, I really have no criticism to make as I think that part is already ideal. In summary, the feasibility is good, but deserved better detail, especially in the script part. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of this proposal is high. The proponents claim that they will have a way of organizing themselves, through the Agile methodology (I would like to know more about this), and in relation to the community, they will create a \u201cprogress report that will be done through monthly meetings with the challenge team and coordinators' meetings with the IOG team\u201d. In other words, it is very clear how the Cardano community could track partial results and gradual achievements. It would also be important for them to include in this report a session dedicated to talking about how the tasks were performed, that is, how the professionals' work routine took place in each month of this trajectory. Maybe this would be easier to visualize with the roadmap detail, but if they tell us about the goals and tasks, I think the auditability of the progress would be perfect. Now, speaking in final terms, we know that success is \u201csuccessfully developing the adatar.me address book and getting users to use it to facilitate their asset transfers in Cardano\u201d. We have a very accurate scenario that can be verified, did this really happen? Proponents also report what they expect to achieve for the project within 3 and 6 months of launch. I really believe that this idea will greatly benefit the Cardano community, because it would solve a problem that is common to all holders of Ada and digital wallets, and I think it would be interesting for proponents to conduct a user survey to find out how it went. the individual experience of each, as this application contributed to better adhesion of transactions on the blockchain. This research could be made publicly available to all members of our community. Therefore, I believe that the proponents provide us with good information on how the gradual advances would be perceived and what the successful scenario would look like, making it simple for us to understand (and monitor) if the proposal is following the intended path/results. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 5, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 10601, "q0": "Adatar is currently still lacking adoption very much. The number of users and adatars created so far is still well below 100. We can go to their website directly to verify. Based on the metroc or KPI stated in the initial proposal of adatar in Fund 6, we should have seen nearly 5,000 adatars created by around this time. There are various causes that can make the adoption of adatar is lagging. One of them could be the lack of interesting and useful features. If this proposal is voted for and implemented well, it might help to alleviate the adoption issue mentioned above. One of the the key impact adatar is trying to deliver is acting as a gateway by onboarding the general audience outside of crypto space to try using crypto as payment, and in this case exclusive to ADA for now. This will help the bottomline of Cardano adoption, though probably less impact on existing audience who is happy enough to use normal address format. Since they mentioned that many people are experiencing inconvenience of double transaction fee to make sure address is okay and got no problem, maybe the Loxe Inc. team can consider developing a feature that assist user to check if an address/public key is valid and has no issue to receive a transaction, just my two cents.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Because this proposal is one of the Adatar series proposals that Loxe Inc. submitted, it is written just as fine as the rest. Well, what can I say more? Loxe Inc. team have written a lot of proposals to Catalyst, so they know what to write while presenting it clearly. The team\u2019s track record is clear with the right skill sets to execute this proposal while also backed by a decent number of relevant experiences, both collectively and respectively. The timetable along with the items the team will deliver is presented in a concise and clear fashion. The duration is also within executable reach.

Overall, nothing seemed to be overstretched in my opinion.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Loxe Inc. is no stranger in Catalyst and they had secured some funds previously. Probably due to this fact, they have developed a standard in their project management scheme both internally and externally.

I believe they will put extra effort into communicating with the community through their social media as well.
