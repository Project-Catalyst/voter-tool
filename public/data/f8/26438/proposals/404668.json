Moreover, NFTs are used with a focus on removing friction and making decentralized collaboration more accessible to everyone. Therefore goals of the proposal are aligned with the Dapps and Integrations challenge. Proposed design ideas including colonies, a gamified UI/UX based on the adventures of littlefish, NFT gallery for littlefish and colonies are quite interesting and it gives a sense of uniqueness with the logo and graphical design. Proposals come up with a decentralized cooperation tool which become popular in other chains as well. Therefore once implemented Cardano ecosystem can greatly be benefited as it will be a collaboration tool example based on the Cardano blockchain. Littlefish Blockchain Features such as NFT, direct donations to colonies and NFT purchases for colony NFTs as well as Colony Features - Members, selling Actions, displaying Actions created by the colony, reward sharing for Action can increase the utility and adoption of Cardano as targeted by this challenge. Future challenges are also considered in the proposal. Besides I suggest bringing real social and environmental purpose-driven NGOs or teams on board during the design process. Therefore you can better understand their needs.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team provides the relevant technical skills and experience needed to implement the proposal. Although the total number of team members are not identified, a number of hours for each work is clearly identified for implementing the different tasks of the proposal. I assume the current team of 6 is going to work on and not any other external resource is needed. It seems the team is reliable and well-formed they have  a proven history of work and the team remained although they were not funded in the previous fund cycle.\nA reasonable budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items. The sustainability of the system to fund future activities are identified to be solved by giving value for different pieces of the platform through NFTs purchased by Littlefish Foundation. In that way, the team is planning to reward the contribution to the platform. Although these NFTs may later be displayed in the Platform where they gain value or not, it is critical to decide which parts to be made NFTs. I suggest the team have a strategy on that as it would not be feasible to generate NFTs for all pieces in the platform.\nThe timetable shows details of the work which will be completed for each month. Given team experience in software development and business development planned work looks achievable. The proposal provides a sensible and conductible plan for implementation that shows know-what know-how information. For example, the team chose WordPress as the main platform integration which can ease the broader adoption by users of WordPress. \nLooking at the video regarding the team working on the architecture and design provides evidence that the team has implemented several meetings so the team-building process has already started which synergies the next collaborations. Although challenges and risks are explained, strategies for avoiding risks and challenges are not clearly explained. For example, it is identified that the \u201cmain challenge will be to technically specify, implement and test Action NFTs\u201d. I suggest you consider inviting external experts to the meetings where you particularly focus on that aspect of the platform. Organising such thematic sessions can allow you to think out of the box and explore new ways of problem-solving. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement are provided by the team. They already set up communication channels with the community in an open manner. As they use Github they specified commits and usable demos as a metric to show project technical progress. Besides the community participation measure is planned to be proven by Discord activity. Moreover, the number of users (littlefish), Number of colonies created, Daily/Total amount of donations, Number of NFTs minted, Number of NFTs sold are actual KPIs for proving the platform assess the success of the proposal. Audibility is well designed, there are deliverables identified per month that make auditing the proposal easier.

This could have potential to increase the demand for Cardano and for more people to join these groups. I would hope that these groups will also be able to help each other stay informed and to learn more about blockchain technology.
