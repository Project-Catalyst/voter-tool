You don\u2019t introduce how your project will work, how your dApp will function and who it will aim at. Just with one sentence like that, the voters won\u2019t capture enough information about your dApp. The second drawback is that the way you present how this project will address the challenge is also too short. The point you raise here is integrations of secure chat channels for the use of projects in the ecosystem, so you need to explain more about this statement, such as how it will solve, in detail, how insecure chat channels can be detected and removed, and what primary needs users have that could be solved by this new app. Write more about this if you want to persuade the voters. Most importantly, when it comes to future risks in the process of delivering this project, the challenges you predicted are too meager due to its vagueness. Onboarding education will undergo various tests and roadblocks for users, so the case here is what they are! Name several certain roadblocks they can confront accompanied by solutions for each of them so that the community will realize how thoroughly your team prepared for this challenge. If you can complete this section like I suggested, I strongly believe that the voters will highly appreciate your project as well as your team\u2019s potential.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "To put it bluntly, this proposal has no work plan and timeline. How could you receive good marks from the voters while you aren\u2019t presenting any specific roadmap for the project. This indicates clearly that your team doesn\u2019t have any orientation for the project. Please show them your work plan so that they can review how your team will work to deliver the solution. In addition, when you request the fund in dollars, namely $112000, you need to present a budget breakdown in USD instead of ADA because you know, we can\u2019t deny that the price of this coin can fluctuate at many times and it\u2019s not as stable as the dollar or stablecoin. Because of this volatility, at times, the requested budget of $112000 can vary and this affects profoundly to the investors, and even your team. Plus, providing extra information about the expenditures for items as you listed, including servers, ip, stakeool, educators, etc would be definitely a great idea for the investors to be aware of the whole operating costs of your team. Finally, in terms of your team members, I can\u2019t see any data of their positions in the project. It\u2019s essential that you should give a general introduction of their jobs, working experiences and accomplishments, as well. For example, who will be in charge of developing the servers? Who will supervise the product operation and launch? That is my suggestion for you.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Coming up with specific measurement tools for tracing the growth of the project as well as certain criterias for a successful project is of essence. Why? Just imagine, without a single tracking tool, how could the community monitor the project progress indeatil, right? Unfortunately, this proposal still puts forward no certain method for the community to keep track of the dApp. At the same time, your definition of success to this project appears to be extremely scant, which is likely to gain little trust from the community. To the best of my knowledge, at least you should mention the quantity of users who will access and use your platform as that is the basic criterion for judging a project successful or not. This is my only advice I can give here in this section. If only you could introduce more about your proposed solution, I think I will be able to share with you more suggestions to define your project\u2019s success.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1675", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 7307, "q0": "Unfortunately the proposal is poorly explained, the proposer only gives us a general idea of \u200b\u200bwhat his project is about, without the necessary detail so that we can really understand how what he suggests would be done and what impacts this would have on the Cardano ecosystem. We know it's about making the cryptographic environment more secure, and he's already tested this integration in \"projects near and far to use and test as we integrate communities.\" But what projects would these be? How near and far? We are measuring the distance of what? In what ways were projects made safer with the technology developed by the proponent? We know that the objective of the project is to create \u201cSecure chat channel integrations for use by projects in the ecosystem\u201d, however, it is not explained in an accessible and detailed way how this would be done. What was lacking in this proposal was, in fact, deeper explanations about the activities that will be developed; these explanations would need to be accessible to all readers of the proposal, that is, the language used should be simpler than what we currently find describing the proposal. Ideally, everyone could fully understand what would be done; even though some technical details would inevitably have to be explained in technical language, the general idea must be conveyed so that the CAs, vCAs and Catalyst voters fully understand what the bidder wants to convey. Otherwise, only a more limited audience, working with technology, would be able to understand the proposal. In general, my opinion on the impact of this proposal is that it cannot be adequately measured for the aforementioned reasons (lack of explanations in general and also because the present explanations are written in a way that is somewhat inaccessible to everyone). If such corrections were made, we would be able to better understand if the proposal is in line with the objectives of the challenge, which are basically to promote the construction of Dapps that are beneficial to the Cardano ecosystem, that increase the number of members of our ecosystem, promote the purchase and delegation of Ada, as well as the commercialization of CNFTs and other statistics that point to the greater popularization of our blockchain. \n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proponent does not provide any roadmap to be followed, therefore, it is not possible to understand which steps would have to be completed for the project to be completed. It really just says that the work is started and that it comes to deliver a great process, however this does not point us at all about what has already been done, what will come next and how long it would still take for everything to be ready. Ideally, he would divide the total time into small parts, eg months; and that each month he would inform which activities would have to be done, and detail each one very well, in the sense of knowing: what would be done, by whom, how long it would last and how it would be done. It is necessary that we have knowledge about the work routine of everyone involved in the project. Therefore, unfortunately, this part of the proposal is totally insufficient. Now talking about the budget, a very high amount of $112,000 is asked. This money is also not satisfactorily explained, basically it is divided into two parts: the salary of the professionals involved (each one would receive 5090 ADA, with a total of 22 people) and other things like \u201cservers, ip, domain, stakepool, moderators\u201d , educators\u201d. Let's go: how much time would each professional dedicate to this project? As we are told, we do not know the price of their working hours, so there is no way to define whether the amount that was chosen as a salary is fair. We have no idea if the project would only take a few months or about 1 year to complete, so we don't know if the 5090 ADAs requested would be for a short or long time of work. Regarding other things, we don't know how much would go to each (how much would be spent for servers, for moderates, for educators and etc). It would be necessary for the proponent to inform what values \u200b\u200bare needed for each small part and to argue why this investment would be necessary. That is, the monetary part of the proposal also leaves much to be desired. Finally, about the team, we basically don't have information about each of them, all we know are their names and contacts (emails, and @s that I assume are from instagram). It would be necessary for us to know what roles each of them would play in this project, what their areas of training, examples of previous work and how each one relates to the Cardano ecosystem. So unfortunately all parts of the feasibility are very superficial, needing a complete overhaul. \n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "About monitoring the process, the proponent says: \u201cPlease come and join us and watch the project grow from within\u201d. How? How could we audit the progress of things? At first, it would be essential that a script be prepared. That way, we would have a basis on which to audit. We would know which activities should be developed in each time interval. With that, we would have goals, partial results to be achieved. It would be necessary for the proponent to define these issues and then maintain constant contact with the Cardano community, in order to provide us with regular feedback on the development of the project in practice. This could be done in several ways, such as monthly meetings with some members of the Cardano community, in order to pass on the main updates, if there were problems/challenges to be overcome that month, how they were solved and etc. Or, instead of synchronous meetings, reports could be prepared, punctuating advances in topics, and these would need to be made available to the community, either through discord channels, online tools or by email, for example. Now speaking of the end results, again we only have a very abstract scenario being represented: \u201cgive people and users a safe place to chat using end-to-end encryption\u201d. Right... we know that this is the main objective of the proposal. However, how can we verify that the applications developed here were delivered completely and properly, if something was missing? How can we measure how security of chats has really improved? How has all this impacted the Cardano ecosystem? It lacked the proponent to define more objective and practical ways of how success would be perceived, in addition to determining what success would be. Therefore, it is necessary that these corrections are made, I really cannot see how this proposal can be easily audited because, in addition to not having a good auditability traced, we do not know details either about the final product or about its construction process. With that, unfortunately I suggest that this topic is also completely reformulated, in order to give us a more palpable and clear way of how to audit the project. \n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 8, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3408, "q0": "The information provided is quite limited.
