Create a way for users to owe the reputation of entities (I believe both people and companies), in a decentralized way through the Cardano blockchain. In fact, there are already some types of sites where we can see the reputation of companies, such as specific sites for complaints, for example. But I don't think that compares to having some technology coined in blockchain, because it's much more secure, non-corruptible or tamper-proof. In this way, companies/people would not be able to change the data already registered, that is, it would be a more reliable source than a conventional website. This would certainly increase the number of transactions on the Cardano blockchain, thus achieving one of the specific goals of the challenge, while possibly attracting new users to our ecosystem, reaching more goals of the present challenge and also the specific challenge for this, present in the fund 8 , even though the author claims that the target audience is Cardano users themselves. I found this passage particularly interesting: \u201cThis is also a springboard for exploring the audibility of purpose-driven companies and entities.\u201d In fact, it would be a very useful way of monitoring whether some projects/companies/public personalities are acting in accordance with their principles, this could even be useful for the auditability challenge present in fund 8. That is, it is a proposal that, when In my opinion, if well executed, it can have a positive impact not only on the challenges of Dapps but also on others of attracting new users to Cardano and improving the auditability of our projects. A constructive criticism: in the part of possible difficulties, the author says that carrying out this work can be complex at certain points and it would be necessary to seek support from third parties. It would be interesting if he were more specific, he says he would call a friend, but do we already have some potential partners here? This could also be important for us to understand if the author has networking. Other than that, I think the proposal has great chances of generating positive results and its impact is in line with the objectives of the challenge. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is ok, having some parts better and others more basic. In the script part, the author states which tasks will be performed in order to develop his project as a whole, these tasks are detailed, so that there is an explanation, however basic, about each one of them. And these tasks are divided in time. With that, notion of how long each one would take to be developed, if they would happen in sequence or in parallel. Proposals generally establish phases. Ideally, we would know what would happen by breaking the timeline into months, and those months into weeks. However, I still think the script was constructed satisfactorily. Regarding the budget, I found this part quite succinct. There are 24k orders for design and engineering. But how so? How much would go to design, and how much to engineering? And within these two areas, what small costs would add up to result in this final amount? The asking value is high, we would need many details to convey confidence in the need and good use of this money. The salary values \u200b\u200bof the team members are also said, but we do not know how many hours per week, for example, they would dedicate themselves to the project. And finally, when it comes to the team, we have a lot of detail about each of the project participants. About each participant, we know their professional background, what they have done so far, how their relationship with the Cardano ecosystem is, in addition to links through which we could prove the experience that is said, such as linkedin profiles (less for Christin Schmidt, unfortunately). One thing that came to my mind: who would be responsible for marketing? This part is essential for any project, and this one is even more so, because the idea is to build a network of trust, right? How is this possible without people knowing about the project? I believe that the feasibility of the project does not prove to be effective, the only part that deserves more detail is the explanation of the budget, because in general confidence and knowledge about the process are passed on to those who will read the proposal. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditability is very well detailed. As in feasibility there is the construction of a work schedule, we were able to orient ourselves well about what would happen, when and how, it is possible to satisfactorily follow the development/construction process of the project. About the results, we also have a lot of information. One detail, however, that I noticed that could be improved: the duo will make video records available, but where would they be posted? How often? How would the Cardano community be aware of the existence of such videos, how to follow them? The part I found most positive was the open Github, so the community could follow the more technical development of the project. I believe the authors have given enough details on how people could establish this direct and constant contact with the project. The success of the project is explained in a simple way, accessible to all audiences. The authors dedicate a part of the proposal to explain possible developments of their work, which is great, as they demonstrate confidence in our blockchain and in themselves. So, in my opinion, this part of the proposal is very good, it conveys a lot of confidence in how we could monitor both the progress of the development process and the final results, that is, it is a proposal that is self-audit. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Thanks for the detailed review.

You explain and present enough information about the project as well as the product to be developed. Timeline for 6 months is also mentioned very detailed and logical. How users interact with the product is also clearly explained. In addition, detailed budgets are provided openly and transparently. The persuasiveness and feasibility of this project is very high.

The proposal addresses the challenge and has a connection with the challenge brief. Once the project is developed it has the potential of bringing onboard many user unto the cardano ecosystem. The organisation of workshops together with the use of a special purpose platform is revolutionary. Furthmore, the proposer has clearly stated the MVP which will include a protocol that  allows trust between DIDs to be established.

It was lovely to read."}, {"q0": "The proposed protocol and application is for building and querying trust between entities. While this in itself might be a worthwhile endeavor to pursue, the current version of the proposal focuses only on the broad overview of what they would like to achieve and there\u2019s not nearly enough detail on how they\u2019re planning to achieve it or what the end product might look and work like. I would definitely encourage iterating a more refined version of the proposal and submitting it to a future fund. The project seems to have potential, but the proposal itself doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s quite there yet.\n\nThe target audience of the solution is also quite ambiguously defined. I would suggest trying to actually narrow down a more precise and well-defined use case, especially important in the MVP stage of the product.\n\nFor the reasons mentioned above, as it stands now it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint exactly what the impact of funding this proposal might be on the Cardano ecosystem and that is reflected in my score of 3 for impact.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "This seems to be a very ambitious project, for which the team should be commended and encouraged to develop it further. However, given its very loosely defined nature and unclear objectives, I remained unconvinced that this would result in even a remotely functional product.\n\nAs per the objectives of the challenge what we are trying to fund are functional dapps or solutions, or clear paths of achieving them in multiple stages over multiple funds, not just code that will end up sitting in a Github repo. The proposal in its current form doesn\u2019t seem to satisfy that. Hints that perhaps even the proposers themselves are uncertain if this will result in an actual functioning product can be found throughout the proposal.\n\nA roadmap is present, but the steps presented on it are overly general, further emphasizing the need for clarity around the project.\n\nA budget breakdown is present and sufficiently detailed, but given the exploratory phase that the project is in, and the pretty high asking price of $165,487 it probably would have made more sense to split the proposal in 2 and submit it in 2 separate funds.\n\nAccording to the experience and credentials mentioned in the proposal, the team should be able to complete a project roughly matching the vision that they present, but since that vision is not yet clear the feasibility of the entire proposal is in question.\n\nMy initial score for this section of the proposal was 2, but since further exploration of the topics presented should be encouraged I have settled on 3.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A list of KPIs and milestones is presented by the team, but I assess that the ambiguous nature of the project overall will also be making auditing efforts unclear and hard, as the stages can easily be reinterpreted by the proposers.

I\u2019m not necessarily saying that that\u2019s an invalid definition of success, it\u2019s just hard to assess without further explanation.\n\nI would suggest clarifying the vision for this project further and resubmitting to a future fund.

Furthermore, the reviewer seems to have an understanding of product development that is in direct contradiction to the philosophy and approach we are implementing and proposing here, which has led to many negative interpretations of the way that we have presented ourselves.\n\nImpact\n-----------\nThe reviewer says\n\"The project seems to have potential, but the proposal itself doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s quite there yet\". I do agree that the proposal text itself could be improved, however our focus is on doing the work. While it is true that we didn't state in plain text the use case, or target audience. We tried to make the mindset and strategy of our plan transparent (in the Feasibility section -> Vertical Slicing, Prototype vs production, Bootstrapping, Don't Cling!, Purpose Driven). This is because we know that keeping ourselves open to pivot is of high importance to delivering a product of value and letting the target audience etc naturally emerge.\n\nThe reviewer said \n\"as it stands now it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint exactly what the impact of funding this proposal might be on the Cardano ecosystem\",\n\nI believe that the reviewer is referring to the unclear nature of the outcome of our process. While I agree in this sense that it is hard to pinpoint the exact impact. We believe this differentiation of process over product to be the differentiating factor that will enable us to deliver novel and viable infrastructure and end user solutions.\n\nFeasibility\n---------------\nThe reviewer said\n\"However, given its very loosely defined nature and unclear objectives, I remained unconvinced that this would result in even a remotely functional product. As per the objectives of the challenge what we are trying to fund are functional dapps or solutions, or clear paths of achieving them \"\n\nThe argumentation given here is exactly how we don't think novel functional products should be built. The software industry has moved on from the waterfall model for a reason. again, we put emphasis on the process and approach of using agile like methods.\n\nAs stated by the reviewer they have very little belief in the success of our project. While that is fine, many points about our approach have been either misunderstood or simply ignored. The statement of \n \"not just code that will end up sitting in a Github repo.\" Is rather insulting and shoes a lack of understanding about the approach that we have presented to ensure real world use case and efficacy.\n\nWe have a highly iterative strategy in place, interest from multiple partners and end users, and a strategy in place for further user testing and onboarding.\n\nThe reviewer also recommends us to make the proposal smaller. We already did this, in terms of really catalyzing ourselves for success we decided on this size and amount so that we have less busy work for a solid period of time to do the hard work that needs to be done.\n\n\nAuditability\n---------------\n\nIt seems like the reviewer is not really saying anything here. KPI's and auditing will always be hard. We believe that making work and progress transparent for all parties is the best way to achieve this.\n\ne.g. \"The team is most likely on to something, but further exploration and a more concise approach are required.\"\n\nIt's hard to understand what is really being recommended to us. Catalyst is one method we are using to help us pickup this exploration. Simply thinking about things and resubmitting a proposal next fund isn't a feasible strategy for exploration or learning. We would get better at writing catalyst proposals, though."}], "solution": "By building a second layer solution we enable a decentralized knowledge of trust (and semantic data) for SSI, Wallet and Dapp solutions.", "experience": "Software Developer 8 yr.
