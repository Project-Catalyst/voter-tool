At the same time the statement of how problem is to be solved is explained with a technical elements of the offered services, so I suggest to define use cases and offering, because in the documentation provided there are only component use examples.\nHowever the objective of the proposal is very interesting, but I think it's important to improve details about the proposal services solution for the challenge (eg. Typical services use case for developer, example benefit for service creator and community, \u2026)", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There are links in the proposal, which allowed me to verify the application engineer David Jacobsen, the senior developer Brice Sinkule and the project manager Hal Arnold with their credentials. \nThe proposer team is well skilled about the partial context of the proposal (Application angineer, full stack developer, front-end, etc..), but in my opinion the point of attention is the lack of the infrastructure lead and application architects, and the proposer don\u2019t explain how to increase the teams.\nThe scope of the solution is explained (e.g. how the funds will be spent, what features will be implemented, and so on\u2026). There is a too simple cost worksheet, that doesn\u2019t contain all costs (eg. Infrastructure, cloud license, etc.)\nThe plan for implementation could have been a bit more specific, but as it is now it's good enough as well. The proposal doesn't go into too much detail into the technical aspects like architecture, language and technologies for the implementation. The proposers have not mentioned some potential challenges and how they plan on solving them.\nThe entire budget requested is very high and positioned at the top of the challenge, but there aren\u2019t MVP or other concrete achievements to see, understand and evaluate feasibility.

The budget would be split as follows: 20% for front end / API, 20% for Plutus backend development, 20% for system administration and 20% for 9 months of hosting. A very small budget of 2k would go towards a third party security audit, and this is definitely a point of concern where maybe the team must come up with a more realistic budget for a competent audit, whereas 2k is definitely not enough for this. \n\nWith a strong team and a detailed plan, I deem this project as highly feasible, with the caveat that the technical solutions chosen will hopefully be reviewed by dedicated CAs with extensive development / engineering / systems experience.

All developers who are interested in cardano developers can take advantage of this CaaS to create their contracts. A very complete plan that is neatly written including to conduct a security audit which is a very important part. It would be better if you also make an explanation to answer the question that does this CaaS service not eliminate the concept of decentralization? And won't it slow down the transaction process? because of course it takes good device specifications to be able to serve all hosted contracts.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The costs involved are quite large, but that's reasonable for a project like this CaaS. The implementation steps are well structured as are the components that need to be financed.

In the security audit fee component, it needs to be added so that it can really ensure that the contract is not easy to be hacked and it is better to add a special budget related to security.

Great idea for a proposal. Propose indicates a legitimate problem and then provides an idea of a valid solution. In addition, this proposal considered the risks and challenges associated with successful implementation.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proponent provides a very detailed plan for implementing definite milestones and timelines.

The UI can initiate container creation on the server and can affect the container's state\nThe success of the project is very well described.
