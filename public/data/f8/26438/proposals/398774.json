The name of the proposal and the solution the proposer is presenting has some discrepancy and is not quite clear. I personally feel the problem of not having a good UI/Ux experience in web3 applications needs to be addressed and rectified rather than falling back to web2 application support. The need of integrating the NFT and its verification over social media might be exciting, but the criticality of the project is not very urgent and we have plenty of other genuine problems across the Cardano chain that needs immediate attention. And with no clue as to what the proposer is trying to solve, it's very hard to evaluate the impact and the community needs to be heedful regarding this proposal.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposer keeps the proposal very compact, thus, making it a little tough for the readers and the community to understand how the team proposes to tackle the problem. The team mentions no clear deliverables to look forward to. The fund requested is very hefty and can not be justified until and unless the proposer provides a detailed breakdown of how and where the funds will be utilized. And the proposer pays no attention to providing information about the flavor of the team designated to work on this idea, to the community and there's no viable way to assess the experience and the capabilities of the team. With no clear action plan or team, the community needs to be wary about the proposal's chances of successful implementation.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "With a lot of lacking details, it's quite hard for anyone to track the direction the proposal is headed. Lack of facts regarding the prior groundwork and research is not helping the proposal's credibility in any way. In addition to that, the success definition and KPIs that the auditors could use are missing, hence the auditing process could turn out to be full of complications and tedious. The successful outcomes of the proposal do not match any of the challenge's requirements and look very feeble. So I suggest the user returns to their meeting rooms and jot down a verifiable plan and come back with a stronger manifesto in the upcoming rounds and the current one isn't supporting their passion or their aspirations.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 5, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1511, "q0": "The idea presented in the proposal is both interesting and have good use cases today, in other words it\u2019s a relevant idea that aligns with the challenge setting and it contributes to widen the Cardano ecosystem.

The proposal fails to give any real details more than the vision of your project and empty promises about what you will deliver in the future if you get funded. For example, the roadmap should be constructed and presented in the proposal. It is hard to deem the proposal credible in its current state.
