There are many types of auctions held. However, sometimes the auctions are not transparent. In addition, many people participated and won the auction but did not fully fulfill their responsibilities and obligations with their auction winning. I believe Decentralized Auction Platform is a good proposal to be able to solve the above problems. Operating a decentralized auction platform will make the auction completely transparent. Successfully operating the auction platform on Cardano will help Cardano apply more to life. In addition, this also gives businesses more confidence when adopting the Cardano platform to operate their businesses, which will attract more businesses to join the Cardano network.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Do Thi Hong Hanh, Le Minh Tuan or other members of the group are all people with a lot of long-term experience in the same field. This gives me confidence that the team will execute the proposal well. However, I think that in addition to the risks you mentioned and the solutions to deal with, there are some issues that you need to pay attention and solve such as: How can you attract bidders? come to your auction platform because for some items the buyer needs to see it in person. How do you limit the auction participants will drop their deposit when they bid successfully? I think, if some of these problems can be solved, more people will trust and use this auction platform.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The itinerary you have given is very detailed and complete. This shows that you are very professional and well prepared for the success of this proposal. In addition, I noticed that you also use the amount of $102,984 very transparently and clearly.

The proposer presented a vital problem on a relatively large scale. No online auction platform can scientifically guarantee the transparency and truthfulness of the auction results and ensure the anonymity of the users. Correct; auctions are an essential industry in the global economy, there are many auction forms, but each still has many problems to solve. Technology is increasingly developing; decentralization is what we want to aim for. Building a decentralized auction platform on top of the Cardano ecosystem seeks to solve those problems, help promote the development of the auction industry and attract more users to the Cardano platform.\nThe solution proposed by the proposer identified most of the challenge's concerns and logical arguments. Based on the core issue of auction activities which is transparency, authenticity, and assurance. They pointed out the disadvantages of traditional and online markets. These disadvantages are, in turn, the advantages of a decentralized auction platform.\nEvery project undertaken is inevitable challenges or risks. The proponent has outlined three main risks and their solutions in great detail. That's a large workload; legal issues, and legal entity. I agree with these possible risks. However, I see that NFT is still not strictly regulated; anyone can create and sell NFT assets, there is no guarantee for its value. This will take risks for the buyer; I hope the team will have an answer for me.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This is a detailed plan proposal with a clear timeline and specific goals.

Each person's work is clearly assigned.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Auditing is an essential part of evaluating the success of the project. With this proposal, the proponent introduced KPIs for each specific period. Development progress, financial and accounting statistics will be published on the project website. Each phase of the project will have a public report.\nThis is a brand new project; it has not been tested. The project's success was determined as successfully building a DApp; attracting the participation of all 3 parties: The auction house, the property owner, and the bidder; Successfully holding 3 sample auctions; and becoming the model DApp for the auction business and a standard example of transforming a traditional business into a decentralized environment.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1631", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The problem statement in this proposal is clear, and aligns with the challenge question: What needs do users of Cardano have that could be solved by new applications? The proposed solution of building a decentralized auction platform, where bidding actions are conducted by smart contracts using ADA payments is a great way to add utility and value to Cardano. The team proposing this is experienced in operating a large online auction house in Vietnam, and this would be a good pilot project for Cardano to bring in users that may not be familiar with Cardano. There are some other online NFT auction websites, so this would not be the first attempt at building such an online auction, however it may be the first time a large traditional auction house uses Cardano.

First, I try to find exisiting Decentralized Auction Platform, which is none (exceptional for Blockchain Auction in Polkadot it's totally different with this proposer idea). So if the proposer can implement this idea, it could be the first!\n\nThis proposal not explaining what markets they targeted. Proposer just explain the solution of the existing auction platform problem. What will this platform will be used for? NFTs / digital assets or could be for daily business goods like Proposer's auction platform (steels, lands/properties, etc)?

And it is a plus thing that one person is a professional in field auction. Budgets are very well explained and seems like realistic for big project like this.\n\nSince proposer not provide any reference or explain that proposer already had a study about this idea, here I find some resources (journal and paper) about the Blockchain-based Auction models: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2021/5523394/ and  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.12534.pdf both were published in 2021.

Solution, Building a decentralized auction platform, bidding actions are conducted by smart contracts using ADA. Decentralized Auction Platform - where transparency, honesty, anonymity, transaction time will no longer be in the hands of any auction house or minority manipulation group. For auctioned properties such as land, transparency is certified by the responsible authorities, this is why the proponent should add more information or how the law or policy is implemented, in addition.

This solution could help to bring more new and viable application on the top of Cardano, help drive the growth of the auction industry and attract more users to the Cardano ecosystem, well aligned to the goals of challenge setting. I just suggest the proposer provides some evidence about the untruthful or cheating in the current online auction, especially some recent scandals in manipulating or pumping the real estate in Thu Thiem district, HCM city  of VietNam. By hence, it will enhance the impactful of proposal in solving the cost of problem.\n\nThe Author gave out many challenges/risks that the proposal could encounter during implementation and ways for solving them, this makes the proposal more confidence. But it's better if the Author in-depth review the lack of Auctions on the blockchain standard solutions and violated ability to existing regulations, meanwhile the since June 2020 licensed and certified legal entity for online auction platform will not help much in this new blockchain-based Auction platform.\n\nIn common, I appreciate this proposal and hope the proposer will make clear and improve more about its impactful.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has skills relevant to auction, notary, business development, full-stack development, software product manager, blockchain DApps development, UI/UX design with reference Linkedin link and website.

It'll increase the feasibility if the proposer provide a Github repository to show proof of work  and experience on Cardano or Plutus pioneer program. And please note that the current website was built on traditional platform, not based on blockchain technology, so we could not assume it as an MVP of the challenge campaign. It would be better if the Author show a Github sample demo source code. If not, the proposer consider to build a whitepaper detailing the solution.\n\nThe proposal provided a detailed plan and rational timeline for delivering the solution, there is a detailed cost breakdown in the proposal that makes sense for the included line items with labor hours and salary. It's a positive point of this proposal. \n\nAs a blockchain solution consultant and long time working in bidding industry, with the auction scheme provided, I realized something are still vague and need deeper explanation, such as: (1) The way/method in encrypting auction participants data similar to e-wallet addresses, (2) How to deal with each transaction and data change from bidder (3) Transaction fee mechanism?\n\nIn marketing, I look forward to see more information except marketing budget, I suggest to carry out an advertising campaign to engage the community, especially the enterprises and individuals in auction/bidding industry.\n\nIn general, I doubt about the feasibility of this proposal, hope the proposer to prepare more carefully in next Funds.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal's KPIs and other measures of success are auditable, helpful for community tracking how the proposal is progressing with the public source code of the project on Github as promised.
