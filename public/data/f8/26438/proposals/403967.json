The impact the proposal could bring is certainly massive however, we have seen a lot of proposals revolving around wildlife conservation especially in \"Grow Africa, Grow Cardano\" challenge. The interesting fact is the proposer's idea to embed a Defi to raise support to the non-profit organisations striving to conserve wildlife, but apart from that I feel a lot of redundant features in the other proposals, and I feel a careful consideration is required to make this proposal stand out and unique compared to the others. The aim to reduce carbon footprints and make the transactions more and more rewarding is gonna draw some attention and hence I would score 4 out of 5 on the impact parameters.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team seems to have covered every gap there is to fill ranging from developers to advisors. The cumulative experience the team brings to the table is astonishing and looks capable of getting this project up and running. The timeline defined although includes more of a one-liner milestones, is self-explanatory and is quite enough for a reader such as myself get an idea of their approach. The budget however makes up to about 4% of the entire funding allocated and looks like a bit overestimated but the team makes an excellent note saying the entire team shall be self-funded and all of the funds raised through catalyst shall strictly be used for the project development, hosting and support which shows the connection the team has with their project and their intent and passion to work on it. Assuming this is all the funds that might be required to bring the project to life, the manifesto we have in front of us has all likelihood of being economical and worthwhile.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPIs defined are carefully defined so as to stay in track with the milestones the team has defined in their action plan.

But the detailing provided looks a little scarce and most of the facts are left to the readers and community to draw assumptions regarding how impactful and effective the development process would be during the development phase. Most of the metrics revolve around the quantifiable measures post development of the proposed application and tracking the development would be a little less relaxing but post launch the metrics are crystal clear for the audit process and hence I hold myself back from giving full marks on the auditability parameters.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 4, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 512, "q0": "I don\u2019t see much alignment at all with the challenge.
