This would generate a very valuable Dapp that would add to our Cardano blockchain a new type of use for NFTs, which is not found so far in any other blockchain and also with the establishment of several smart contracts. Perhaps this novelty will attract new users to our blockchain, popularizing it, thus achieving one of the specific objectives of the challenge. Also, this would certainly increase the number of transactions in Cardano, as we are looking for in the current challenge. From what you can understand by reading the proposal, the idea here is for people to pay small amounts in ADA to be in a certain place at a certain time. An observation: what would HOSKY and Nudge be? I would like the author to explain this, because I don't know it myself and I believe that other CAs may also be unaware of this part of the proposal, which compromises the full understanding of the project. It is quite positive how the author places us with practical examples of the application of his project, that is, we understand, through the areas he cites (business advertising, donations to charity based on location, etc.) Such areas are extremely detailed and argued, so that we can understand very well how this application would take place in practice. In addition to the two main areas, the author also cites other examples of application of his project, that is, it expands our horizons. Another positive point is that the author clarifies where these applications would be used (one application for computer and one for mobile). It also establishes possible difficulties and challenges, which demonstrates preparedness in dealing with adversity. If this works out, it will certainly be a big step for Cardano to become popular in several aspects, fully achieving what is sought in the challenge. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The author starts this session by talking about which applications would make up the whole project (2 front-end applications, a back-end and smart contracts) and explaining how each one of them would be built and work, in addition to the technologies used specifically. Then he focuses on the script: it is explained which activities would be developed each month, and not only that, but also the weekly division of occupations. That way, we have a solid view of what's to come, fully understanding the process. For me, he leaves nothing to be desired in terms of explaining the development of the project. As much as it is an extremely technical proposal, it is possible for all audiences to understand (at least the basis) of what will be done and when. Regarding the budget, we see that it is divided into two parts: for the payment of the professionals involved and the expenses of the day of the event. It is also possible to understand with complete clarity how the requested money would be used, and I sincerely think it is a fair value for the complexity of the project and the tasks to be carried out. And finally, as far as the knowledge of the team is concerned, from what I understand, we only have information about the leader, Dmitry Shibaev. About him, we know his role in the project and a long professional history is detailed, duly proven through the various links attached. However, I missed the knowledge of the other team members. Who are they, what are their resumes? This is the only part that I believe needs to be improved, because we know that there are several professionals involved, and we need to know each one of them in depth. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The author lays out many ways to audit the project. Starting with the aforementioned KPIs, we know what specific objectives are expected here, and which relate to different areas of the proposal, not just one front. With this, is it possible to accurately monitor whether success is being achieved, that is, are the expected results actually being achieved? He also claims that the application will be tested in a real-world event (a cycling event), so it is possible for members of the Cardano community who live in that location to participate in the event and bring feedback to the rest of us, in practice. . The author goes on to explain how the success of the project would be, setting many objectives. There's no shortage of ways to check the results here! In addition to the final product, it is also possible for the Cardano community to follow the progress of the project, that is, its development, its construction process, through the very detailed script that was presented to us. A team could be assembled, which would be responsible for the close monitoring of this proposal, bringing to the rest of the community summarized and direct information regarding auditability. Yes, it is a proposal that is completely auditable, the proposal contains more than enough information to perform these tasks. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 610, "q0": "The Cardano Beam proposer has presented here a clear vision for a tremendous possibility within the Cardano ecosystem:  GPS trackable NFTs and tokens that can be placed and picked up in the physical world by end users of an app on their local devices.  This simple relationship sparks the imagination with use cases:  the author suggests (and plans to build out for) communities incentivizing healthy habits, local advertisers, and sporting events such as races, however so many more use cases present themselves.  Geocacheing, voter participation, key event tracking of vehicles or packages in transit, location based gaming...the list goes on.  The author also provides compelling market research that indicates wallet/ADA adoption that could be in the millions globally, and even more adoption if the impact spreads out to the wider Cardano ecosystem of native assets and tokens.  It is well suited to the Challenge Setting it has been presented in, especially in regards to accelerating NFT and token adoption on Caradano, given that users will have the ability to mint tokens from the app itself, meaning it can function as an Onboarding Tool for people new to Cardano or the blockchain.  GPS based NFTs and tokens have struggled to take off on other chains due to either A) the lack of smart contracts to allow flexible standards and conditions for pickups and placement, or B) fee structures that limit the timing/scope of placing and receiving tokens.  Both areas are problems just looking for a solution like Cardano.  Going forward, the Beam project has its eyes on further decentralizing the platform nodes and expanding into even more areas such as geocacheing collectibles.  All in all, the project looks fantastic.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer, despite being a one man team, has already prototyped several of the main components of this project, including the phone app and the mapsAPI, in order to test proof of concept.  They have provided verification via a github repository of both the work done so far on this project as well as previous projects in react and js node, both key pieces of architecture for this stack.  He also runs a Cardano SPO and shows familiarity with the Cardano toolbox, including the cardano_wallet and _graphql.  They are seeking funding to specifically build out the cardano node and back end stack to effectively attach these protocols to the Cardano blockchain, to polish and iterate the front-end UI/UX, as well as an extensive run at the test-net, collaboration with Cardano Foundation to push to mainnet, and finally a real world test run that consists of a cycling event based around the use of the App.  Even in this case, the author indicates that they are sticking with what they know, having been an active cyclist with plenty of experience around these kinds of events.  The timetable laid out covers every conceivable implementation of the plan, from choice of database to choosing APIs with an eye towards managing bugs.  The tasks are laid out in a logical, realistic order, 4 weeks at a time, providing a full 6-7 months to finalization.  There is significant explanations of all relevant technologies and necessary resources, with each major milestone broken down into manageable chunks defined by which resources are needed or delivered at each step.  Among the noted risks, the only one that is isn't really endemic to Cardano at large, is the idea of GPS spoofing, which the proposer lines out a reasonable mitigation strategy for.  Finally, a note about smart contracts, which may prove to be one of the bigger solutions that needs to be built out here, the proposer includes the basic structure for a typical SC on this platform in such a way as to indicate they won't be caught by surprise in implementing this critical component.  The majority of the budget is broken down by hourly rates to deliver the technology stack, and the rate is competitive.  In addition it lists out a light administrative budget, appropriate for a small team, with a small ask for early marketing for the testnet deliverables.  The event budget acts as both an administrative and marketing budget for the project as a whole, and with the entire project coming in at around 1% of the total Campaign Setting budget, it seems quite reasonable.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap is extensive, and quite clear, laying out a 7 month timeline.  The first 5 months of the project are broken down into 4 week segments, built around specific deliverables such as spinning up the initial node, or achieving smart contract -- wallet integration.  The last 3 months of the project are described with less granularity, but allowing more time between specific deliverables, which should build some cushion into the earlier, tighter schedule.  The listed KPIs, particularly the app downloads should be easy to prove, and the proposer includes several back-end KPIs, measuring server stability, which is a much appreciated piece of data that can help inform other projects.  The 4 main deliverables are listed separately to make them easy to find, and they correspond well to the beat of the audit timing (should be delivered on a monthly basis), and the Test Event has been given its own section where it is broken down as a multi-part deliverable.  This proposer has been in contact with the community in the development of this proposal and has been transparent and available, and there is no reason to think they would not continue to hold themselves accountable to the community.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 5, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5199, "q0": "There needs to be a 6 star option, specifically made for this proposal. Let's recall the stated mission on the Cardano Catalyst website: \"Project Catalyst is a series of experiments which seeks to generate the highest levels of community innovation.\" I don't think it's possible to read this proposal and come to the opinion that this idea does not fit that mission. If this exists anywhere in the crypto space (if so, I've never heard of it), I would defend this project as the superior creative minds in how they intend to implement this Dapp. They probably provide way more information than necessary for this proposal but it's DEFINITELY not empty information that has no relevance. I found this impacts section to be riveting. The imagined use-case of this is so open to a wide range of possibilities that integration and adoption through this project are SO tangible. I think the pictures they paint for possible use-cases of this product is what gives them a lot of weight in appealing to this category of innovation. If they didn't provide so much evidence for what they're working on and who's on their team, I wouldn't have thought this concept is even remotely possible. Here's my favorite part: This project is really not requesting that much, especially compared to the impact potential for the adoption of Cardano. If you think about the incentive of companies to utilize this Dapp, I expect companies to pay billions for the ability to SO EASILY incentivize people to come to a chosen location. I think it goes even farther beyond what this proposal paints, with the developing use-case of NFTs. I imagine NFT coupons for free pizza or exclusive access to an event at a later date. I'm very impressed. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "They're already developing this project, so there's a lot more confidence in the possibility of this Dapp being an imminent reality. According to their roadmap, this could be seen on the testnet in just 1 month. The roadmap is extremely well organized in that it is broken down month by month WITH sub-categories of what they plan to do week by week. The extreme detail in the planned outline of this project gives me more confidence in their ability to deliver. The budget is also extremely detailed and extraordinarily well spent. There's no portion of this budget that I think is overpaying or wasteful spending. Actually, I think the compensation set for developers is even set too low. We'll call it a good freaking deal. The only thing I might not be totally sure about is the fact that I can only see one developer on the project. I could say I am in disbelief that this could be done by one person alone but the track record kinda speaks for itself. I'm sure there's some kind of collaboration of some kind in the background. If not, this dude is just not human. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPIs in this section is thorough and quantifiable. I like to judge this section most harshly but there's nothing really noticeably wrong with this proposal. I do like to see milestone-based KPIs but that's more of a personal preference. The definitions and outlines for success here are actually a little overkill. I really like that there are metrics provided about both number of users on the platform and the various KPIs on user activity for the diversity of data. I really like that there are data presented on hardware performance, which is something I never see in these things. I'm also very impressed with the number of metrics provided for different specific aspects of how well the different features on the Dapp perform. That's already quite a lot, but it then goes into definitions of what success would look like in regards to the test event and targeted viewership for that. This is hands down the best proposal I have ever seen.
