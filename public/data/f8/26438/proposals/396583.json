The proposer has developed Qbo as a tool that uses cloud tech to store information in it's existing database for ease of use when interacting with the surrounding environment and commands from users. Utilizing this data, the team wants to implement \"a proof-of-concept piece of software to upload encrypted messages/images to the Cardano blockchain\", something implements in phase 1 but now with improving such a concept. This would enable a Cardano node, or the synchronization of multiple nodes to share information within the network for easily certifiable information, messages sent and received, which will be catalogued on-chain. The future challenges still exists, as mentioned by the proposer, larger than usual text or image files that could become expensive, the proposed solution would be to use a hybrid model by having larger amounts of information stored on a public database with certified uploads to the blockchain. This solution could eliminate the high volume of information received from creating an overload on-chain, something that has been a major downside of Cardano as of late; slower than usual transactions or even failed transactions from certain Cardano wallets and unprepared systems. This proposal may add significant value to the Cardano ecosystem, with the use of technology being implemented into an already successful product, Qbo, that could bring on new investors seeing potential use cases of the blockchain's capabilities while this team will be sharing, promoting and creating more interest towards universities and businesses worldwide.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer clearly states that even though the company behind Qbo has many years of experience with AI/ML development (expressed through Youtube links and websites shared here: https://thecorpora.com/blog/) and made great success from Fund 5 (phase 1). The team now needs additional members to complete the tasks of the proposed goal. This goal in it's entirety requires the skills of blockchain developers who understand the Cardano platform inside and out to implement and improve on Qbo's performance as well as the company's future success in creating a robot capable of sending and receiving information securely and efficiently. Having any down time or lag within Qbo's data, may jeopardize user experience and have a negative impact on the product. The budget to accomplish such a goal proposed is more than reasonable given the timeline and cost of these new members. The proposer does not clarify who these new member will be but does state that the 32 week window for completion is set to include individuals who possess certain skillsets as needed. With any additional funds, the company will make use by adding more storage for information with servers that will assist in the product development and testing. The potential risks to future challenges are not defined within the proposal, but the team behind the proposal is confident that it can deliver sufficient results on time, before end of year (9 months to figure out and solve any minor/major issues that may arise).", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer's form of auditability is described with the supplied feedback given by the community of users that already have been validating the current API/SDK, by using the new SDK that links to the blockchain after completion. This feedback is essential for the improvements made in Phase 2 (current proposal) with a community of more than 1,500 active members of theCorpora, who will be testing. Weekly reports via Gitlab (link provided) will update the progress being made for PC community to view and assess accomplishments during the given timeline. With the intention of having a fully finished SDK, in the coming years, the team will participate in multiple attempts from crowdfunding which could provide \"greater visibility to Cardano projects\". Any mentions of the Cardano platform on a larger scale will add value to the ecosystem as a whole. To what degree of promotional efforts that will be done beyond Qbo's internal functions with the use of Cardano will remain to be seen. Though with interest from fortune 500 companies and IBM, it's clear this proposal could have potential to reach a wide audience, giving Cardano's capabilities more recognition and in turn, add new users & investors. As both technologies are still growing to their full potential, it will be interesting to see how the two benefit from one another.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1529", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 5, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 337, "q0": "The main factor that leads us to believe in a positive impact of this proposal is the wide scope of use of the transmission of encrypted data that the project will carry out using the Cardano blockchain. We observed that with the success of this project, several others can benefit from a faster structure for uploading texts or images. Clearly, there are several types of data driven services that would benefit from this, as the proposal itself mentioned, we see as an example the loading of images to be used in recognition algorithms. With that, we have that the proposal fits well in the challenge in which it finds itself and that its success would bring great visibility to the ecosystem of Cardano.\n\nWe note that the amount being requested of $89,700 is quite considerable, but as factors that justify this, we have that this proposal is the continuation of a previous one (from fund 5) that was successfully financed, in addition to having a highly awarded team in charge of its execution. We'll talk more about that in feasibility.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As mentioned earlier, if we look at the team behind the project, we can see that it is a very award-winning company, which has already done business with technology giants such as IBM, ASUS and INTEL. Another factor that makes us believe in the feasibility of the project is the general scope (but well organized) of the area of \u200b\u200bactivity of the technology being developed. Regarding the organization of the plan's actions, we can find very clear and structured steps in well-defined periods of time that show us a path to be followed. In addition, the actions performed become more complex over time, indicating a good logical chain. We observed that in WP1 the development of the database system is carried out and only in WP3 a communication test is performed. Regarding the budget details, we noticed a good explanation that defines how the value of $85,000 was reached, with information on what the hourly rate of work will be. This total amount seems quite consistent, as we realize that the team will be formed by 5 members of the company (https://thecorpora.com/blog/) and will be considered a period of 8 months of work. But the observation is that this figure of $85,000 is diverging from what was stated at impact (there was $89,700).\n\nWhen analyzing the proposal, we were able to find even one more indication for the feasibility of the project. We see that some robot units will be sent to universities, so even if a final product takes longer than expected to be finalized, its development will already be contributing to the propagation of blockchain and cryptography concepts in the academic environment.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For everything that was described in the proposal, we see that this will be a product in development that will need to be tested by future users, since the objective is the manipulation of data by them. And we note that this was considered here, since one of the auditability modes will be testing with users and capturing feedback. Public ways of tracking the result were also demonstrated, through periodic updates on easily accessible platforms. And we verified that the perception of success is well described, with a numerical parameter that will indicate if the project was successful (implementation of the two communicated networks).", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 3, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3774, "q0": "To the best of my knowledge, your proposal manages to meet general requirements of the challenge\u2019s \u201cImpact\u201d section. This proposal was able to meticulously introduce your main products, their primary functions, and the precise foreseen risks associated with particular solutions. The way they (your servers) work is so convincing and interesting that investors are believed to understand well. You also specify the advantages that users can receive, such as easing the flux of critical information between different users (or entities). Other than that, I think you should clearly determine the \u201cusers\u201d here, like you will mainly focus on who they are. Secondly, many of your listed impacts, in my opinion, align with the application\u2019s output of the challenge (like tracking and classifying all the information that circulates in a given network). However, I would like to put forward a small notice. A high quality dApp is the one that could enable users to adopt Cardano, which is also the main objective of the challenge, so you can mention this content in this section to let the investors know that your products can help them increase Cardano adopters.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Well, to the fullest extent, you carefully proposed every milestone of the future progress of your project, even including the activities of the last day before the D-day. Despite giving some information relevant to budget breakdown, like allocating money in team salaries, your team may forget deepening into the budget required for other stages, for example, mini servers and robots for the community which aim to test the API, the delivery fee of sending updated robots to the communities, to Africa. Especially, I think there\u2019s a big mistake here in this proposal when it comes to the requested funds. Before, you wrote that the requested funds in USD is just $1, but in fact, you are seeking a budget of $85,000. It must be a typo, right? If yes, please fix this as soon as possible. Finally, in terms of the number of needed team members, it can be seen that you gave no authentic number of your core staff and others relevant. Admittedly, your team has a highly seasoned experience in this business (more than 10 years), but you had better name the leader, the developers, the managers and many other positions that your team already had so as to give the investors a complete view of your human resources.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Concerning this Auditability part, you are doing great when giving an impressive number of active users in your Forum Community. Additionally, your team succeeded in raising a huge amount of budget (over 200,000 dollars) for a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo in just over one month in 2017. That\u2019s a remarkable success. And the way you define how the success of this continuing project looks is very realistic and close to your proposals.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1675", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4295, "q0": "Thank you for providing this information. Also congratulations on the progress so far.The team has a lot of ambition, in my opinion, and the aim is to develop servers for a network of operating units (robots) that will be in charge of coordinating message sending/receiving activities that will be certified using the Cardano Blockchain. This proposal, I believe, matches the challenge setting and, if accomplished, would have a significant impact on the community and the future of Cardano. One of the noting points is that some mindmaps were presented by links, which summaried and illustrated the athour\u2019s idea. However, the second link to product\u2019s function seems a bit confusing for readers. I suggest that proposer should add more details in this picture to make it easier and clearer for readers. Proposer indicates the potential audience they are targeting. That is server users. In my opinion, the article is quite good when team showed how their project affects this object: \u201ceasily certify, catalog and sent critical information to external units and ease the flux of critical information between different users (or entities)\u201d . Next, i think that the metrics are appropriate for the proposal challenge. The scope of the information flux is adaptable, allowing it to be easily changed according to the operator's demands. However, the author has not stated what results will be achieved after the project is completed and communicated to the community. As for the risks or challenge section, I applaud the presentation of the proposers. They presented difficult challenges they will face and also had clear solutions for each of them. Even so, there are some points that I still don't understand. For example, who will face these challenges, users or team members or something else? Similarly, who will stand out to solve these difficulties? Team has not mentioned. I believe the proposer should expand on his or her thoughts. such as where will their project have a direct impact on the Cardano ecosystem and  is it possible to expand in the future? As such, they will have a better Impact section.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project has the participation of a five-member team with experience and professional working attitude, which will help when launching the application to gain the trust of users. Having over 10 years experience with AI and Interactive Robotics, they understand AI/ML development. Team seem to be Pioneers in \"Robotic\" Cloud Computing,... In addition, their firm has received numerous major honors, including being chosen by Intel as one of the most promising startups in the next ten years in 2011 and being named as the top 1% crowdfunded product on Indiegogo in 2017, raising over 380 percent of its original sales target. It has earned the trust of customers thanks to its professional and dedicated attitude, which has enabled them to sell thousands of robots to partners and clients in 49 countries from 6 continents. Moreover, there are links provided for verifying their forum and channel on YouTube. These demonstrates thorough prior study and a clear understanding of their knowledge's limitations, as well as the ability to identify what is required to address the problem. Another good point of this proposal is team is estimating the time they expect the development occurs and the budget for each period of time. There is a timeline that lays out the specifics of the steps to be taken, which I find it to be realistic. Likewise, the descriptions of the budget items are also extremely detailed, covering all facets of the budget. As a whole, this section, I believe, deserved a five-star rating from me.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In this part, I believe the author clearly defines his goal, and the process of implementation, which shows that they are determined to carry out the project with a serious attitude. This proposal's success criteria are straightforward and easy to assess. \u201cWe will update every week our repositories in gitlab https://gitlab.com/thecorpora/QBO and our Forum Community\u201d. As a result, I think the precise roadmap of the steps to be performed here include dates for when each step will be implemented, tracking progress on a weekly basis may be easier for developers and community. In addition, some key performance indicators (KPIs) are absent, both for measuring progress and success. As a result, the proposal should contain more specifics on how success would be tracked in a shorter time frame, in addition to the KPIs, for a future submission. Also, due to the thing that the specific feeds and oracle data to be provided are determined by community voting, some flexibility in these measurements is to be expected.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1717", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6686, "q0": "I strongly agree that this proposal addresses the dapps challenge and will have a big impact on the cardano ecosystem. As a senior developer myself I have often faced the dilemma of how to best deal with storing images, and with blockchain this problem becomes even bigger, especially if later on we have to use this information to train AI. We are heading into a decentralized AI space, especially with partnerships between SingularityNet and Cardano. Therefore, such basic problem areas need to be explored and resolved as soon as possible.\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of their previous funded project in Fund5, which was a proof of concept to upload encrypted/decrypted messages/images to the Cardano blockchain. Now they want to create a network of servers, each  running Cardano node, that will allow the information to be both secured and true as Cardano is used in the backend to create transactions (to certify and hence allow verifiability of a message coming from any robot/client), and those transaction ID and metadata information will be also stored on the postgres Database, which will allow all the benefits an RDBMS system such as Postgres provides (faster and complex querying of information). \n\nOverall I feel this is a very unique proposal and strengthens the AI and dapp ecosystem on Cardano. Good luck to the team.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has provided the youtube link and links to their website. The company who has proposed this proposal is already well established and has significant years of work experience in Robotics and AI software. The budget considerations are well explained, and total man hours including the hourly rates are provided. However, they are planning to hire blockchain developers for this project, although this is not a major concern in my opinion, because the expertise they need for this proposal is more onto the interacting with Cardano (e.g. via Blockfrost or simply querying/writing to blockchain) and as mentioned they have already winning fund proposal and have done this before.\n\nAs a developer myself, I am pretty satisfied with the budget considerations. Additionally, the money is allocated for buying mini servers and robots that the team also wants to send over to some of the universities in Africa, where students can not test and improve the API, which in my opinion is a win-win situation (students gain knowledge and API comes out as more robust).\n\nThe timeline is well divided and realistic in my opinion. Milestones details are provided and starting from 2 weeks to 3 months of technical implementation details are given. Nevertheless, some of the risks/challenges that the team has outlined are definitely something the community should be aware of. \n\nChallenges such as how much transactions will cost on Cardano and Synchronization issues between robots (synchronization is always a big problem, data consistency vs reliability debate is a big one in software engineering). Agree, that the proposal is very ambitious but the team has very good experience with this stuff, and with ZK rollups and Hydra planned in the next year or two, I can only see that  only few of these risks are the ones the team should be dealing with. Therefore, I strongly agree that this proposal has a high probability of being implemented successfully.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The community will have the opportunity to closely follow up the progress of this proposal. In many senses it would also be cool to see it live (via youtube videos) progress reports e.g. Robots sending certified information over the network and Cardano being used as one of the critical backend infrastructure will be a treat to see.\n\nAdditionally, the short term to mid term goals are explained very well and they are planning to open source the dapp and SDK, so it will be available to the community to see how API development is coming up. Anyone could actually test/verify the API and additionally peek into the source code (if needed as it will be available on gitlab). In the longer run, the team wants to further polish this API and SDK via some of the biggest crowdfunding companies, giving a great deal of visibility to the Cardano projects.\n\nTherefore, I strongly agree that the project is auditable and the community will have no problems tracking the progress of this proposal.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_454", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8784, "q0": "As stated in the problem statement, having to store images with metadata can be a chore and this project addresses it.
