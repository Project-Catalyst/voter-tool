The idea is novel and very fresh. The proposer also makes assessing the proposal enjoyable and easy to digest and understand by using relevant analogy to assist and open reader\u2019s mind.  There are still very few projects in Cardano addressing and trying to resolve real world problems at the moment such as this one, and on a grander scale on top of that. The proposer is a comprehensive and forward thinker that he already concepted the ecosystem to be integrated, yet still as decentralized as possible through other proposed projects mentioned in the proposal. I must say that my brain is very stimulated from reading this proposal and I also feel educated from information about academic publishing industries the proposer exposed. The proposal perfectly explains in clarity how blockchain technology and cryptocurrency advantages can benefit more less-powered stakeholders in the industry and being used to gain an edge versus the incumbents. I sense this proposal can be a multi-billion-dollar idea considering in 2020 publishing global market size is estimated to be around USD 100bn. We, as a community in Catalyst, could have a major part in fostering and nurturing this idea will be a great testament to the world that Cardano is gradually and majorly transforming the world to be a better reality. This may sound too much like a hard sell, but I wish I could rate this proposal higher in this aspect than I already did.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The planned timeline looks executable. It is also being outlined well with the concrete action plans and deliverables stated explicitly and in a quantifiable manner. The milestones are exactly what we can expect every 3 months for such a project. The budget also looks reasonable and costs are broken down sufficiently clearly. Rates are also well within market standards with some contingencies already factored in, I believe. The team also looks very solid with the necessary background and suitable role compared with respective members' skill sets. I have negligible doubt in delivery considering their record of accomplishment and capabilities both individually and collectively. We should also appreciate that the proposer being frank about the risk of being able to satisfyingly deliver the stated and expected results, given the massive scale of the idea. However, being both open-source and cross-chain project at the same time, they could gather as many helps needed from both communities to tackle upcoming issues and resolve both difficult engineering and business issues since the implementation of this proposal is crucial and highly valuable for both Cardano and ARWeave ecosystem. It also relieving and assuring at the same time that proposer states the integrity of these projects with the interconnected others will not compromise the independent progression of respective ones which is very well thought I must say. The reason I don\u2019t give full stars is because the feasibility of implementation itself (apart from the relatively complete and well-written proposal) is still a probability to some (good) extent.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As I stated in the feasibility aspect, being an open source-project and cross-chain project simultaneously also scores them the most points in auditability. This quality really helps to attract and maintain traction from anyone interested in the general audience thus making every action and updates being highly anticipated and under scrutiny. I also commend their explicit statement about adopting and internalizing the values of decentralization, permissionless, transparency, openness, and collaboration. The proposer also does not only write beautiful and grand words about his idea, but also supplement us with quantifiable metrics such as number of commits in GitHub, presentation/discussions/meetings the team is conducting to market the project, and users & partners interested to utilize and collaborate in the PubWeave platform. These are fair enough selection of success measures in addition to the KPIs mentioned in their proposed timeline. The single sentence log in their website weekly update is a bit lacking but some help in form of them committing to be more active in Twitter and Medium to blog their regular activities which open for all of us to check and learn more about will give the community more faith in them.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_943", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 427, "q0": "The project is super ambitious, and we can\u2019t be sure that it will be successfully implemented.

The proposal identifies the problem of the current academic ecosystem and the value a decentralized platform on Cardano would provide by eliminating the middlemen in publishing and providing content creators with ownerships and accessibility.  While this is a new project it can relate and build off the team\u2019s prior successes in Funds 6 and 7.  They have identified the risks which are the significant cope and size of the endeavor however I believe the team has a strongly likelihood of success because of the history.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provides a road map with timelines and major milestones and has also included an hourly scope of work based on core development work (i.e. plutus engineering, UI/UX dev, etc.).  In addition, the team has utilized its experience over the past funded projects to align with a more realistic cost structure.  The size and scope of the project is significant so I think the proposer could benefit by having the project broken down into phases (e.g. phase 1 \u2013 build the decentralized portal and test with 10 researchers, phase 2 \u2013 build the treasury function and engage 10 reviewers, etc.).  The team has a successful history and experience which is why I believe they have taken on a more significant project.   In addition, they are smart to collaborate with outside organizations for their expertise.    ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer has identified the primary KPIs however this section is not as strong as the other section primarily because the proposer identifies KPIs such as, 10 potential researchers, 100 preprinted articles, etc., which should be listed within the KPIs.

I should, responsibly, acknowledge my bias here. I have a very strong opinion about funding in academia has a centralized dictating impact on content. So, something like this makes me jump to conclusions about the liberation of academia, in my opinion. This is just an additional impact that I can speculate on from this type of project. The more relevant impact, as listed by this proposal, is providing a micro-economy built specifically for academics. I am aware that academic journals give almost no revenue back to the hard-working individuals that created their product via hours of research, years of experience, and an unimaginable amount of money for their education. The decentralization of this business reestablishes that incentive for people to pursue higher education, in a world where it is becoming much less desirable. The demand for university lecturers is not what it used to be and the job opportunities can be relatively slim (depending on the field of study). (Anecdotal) I remember working at a local restaurant alongside a young woman who had a master's degree in biological sciences. All this to say, there are dwindling incentives to pursue higher education and this proposal can have a major impact on this phenomenon, facilitated and rekindled by Cardano. My concern is the price tag and potential for success. This project makes no difference at all if there is not adequate marketing, partnerships, and users to build this treasury. I think it's worth the risk. VERY high-impact potential here.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The entirety of this roadmap is only based on the development of the product, with much less effort identified for marketing and developing user participation. This may not be a huge deal because previously approved proposals have some allocation to marketing/networking and this project is likely to benefit as part of the greater academic ecosystem that they are building. I'm very confident in the feasibility of this proposal. It's being built by people that appear to have built a reputation with the Cardano community and are building other tools to serve the academic community. The roadmap looks reasonable and I appreciate the transparency in their justification for the increase in their hourly rate, compared to previous proposals. I approve. I do wish they would've linked all the team member's LinkedIn profiles, so I don't have to go digging for it. That probably won't hurt them here but, then again, it's a very high price tag and there's a risk of CAs/voters missing that information. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I was moderately disappointed by this auditability section because I have very high standards for this section and I probably had higher expectations for people in academia. In reality, what is presented here is perfectly fine, I'm just not overly impressed with it. They've got 3 primary metrics for quantifiable measures of success that are viewable from the community/public. They'll provide regular updates to Github (which they've linked, they'll provide presentations on what they're doing (which also acts as marketing), and the number of academics/institutions that utilize the platform (which I think is the most important metric. I like quantifiable KPIs and I LOVE a roadmap with milestones for these metrics. While I expect this proposal to be approved just fine, I will recommend stepping up their game in this way. With multiple proposals that keep getting approved (and price tags that keep increasing), I would hate to see a community perception that these projects are a never-ending hole of an unlimited need for funding (much like California's high-speed rail project). That might just be me over-speculating but I do think improvement is always good.

While it has long been known that musicians are fleeced by record labels, it might not be as well-known that a lot of academic journals profit off the work that a lot researchers provide to the journals for free such as the articles itself and editorial reviews. These journals can have profit margins up to 40% for work funded by public money, yup that\u2019s right your money.\n\nWhat\u2019s more important is that all these knowledge done by academics are being held back by gatekeepers who choose what gets published and what doesn\u2019t. PubWeave will ensure that knowledge can be accessible and that as many publications get funded as possible. \n\nOn a bigger level, this could change many things like the way drug development is done, maybe even curb the powers of Big Pharma to how those in the scientific community get rewarded and funded. Also really fitting that once again, Cardano is proudly run by academics.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team demonstrated a lot of experience from their past work and have delivered for previous fund proposals such as their OpenScience NFT and its corresponding marketplace as well as PanDAO.
