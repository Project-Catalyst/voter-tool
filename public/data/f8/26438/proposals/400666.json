According to the proponent, games are currently the fastest growing category in the blockchain space, and Cardano has yet to really grow in the field. And the proponent's solution is to create a Milkomeda game that will be a simple casual game using blockchain concepts, bringing adoption and usage to Cardano through Milkomeda. Since this is a game project, I think it would be better suited to the \"Gamers On - Chained\" challenge. There is a sincere advice that I give to the proponent that you should clearly define what challenges your project is facing, in order to receive funding I think it is essential that the information about the proposal be complete. content and criteria should be clear, this proposal looks like an idea or your walk, it is not a complete proposal.

The proposal provides three timelines for project completion, but there don't seem to be any details on how the community can track the proposal's progress. Without a blueprint, the $40,000 request budget is also unallocated. No go-to-market strategy, no budget analysis to see if the amount is right. Also, the project team is called \"dcSpark with experience building many dApps\" without further explanation. Team is one of the very important factors determining the success of a project or not. Any reference to team size, qualifications, and previous experience of team members will allow for better evaluation of the proposal.

Regarding impact, some issues that should be noted are as follows:\nfirst, as can be seen, the problem is quite clear, however, solving this problem may not contribute to achieving the challenge's goal and KPIs, in some certain meaning; The issue raised has a certain convincing, I agree that the number of games on the Cardano platform is currently not much, compared to other Blockchain ecosystems. As for the solution, I think there are a few issues that emerge that need attention with this proposal: (1) building a fun game is, in a sense, still relevant to the goals this challenge seeks to seek. [\"What applications will provide the most value for end-users in 2022?\"], however, since the problem stated has not been carefully explained, my question is: how urgent is it to make a fun game in achieving the goal set by this challenge?; and (2) the solution has not been described clearly enough in detail (supported by very limited information on: team, goals, roadmap, KPIs, budget structure) so that the expected impact is not clearly visible.\nIn conclusion, I strongly disagree with the impact of this proposal.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Regarding the possibility, there are some issues that should be noted, including:\nFirst of all, this team profile still remains very abstract, there is very limited information to evaluate how suitable their skill, experiences for implementation would be.

This proposal's goal is not clear because too little descriptive information is provided to clarify the content of this game], and there is not any KPIs/metrics for measuring the success, no roadmap for tracking the implementation progress, and no budget breakdown, as a result, it is hard to assess from this side.
