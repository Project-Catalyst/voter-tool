The value proposition of this project is rather unclear for me, an I am not sure whether it refers strictly to a Cardano integration with their existing platform (as a form of payment / onboarding Cardano native NFTs), or whether a much more comprehensive plan is envisaged, since the team is also mentioning the development of a DAO and a DeFi app for services such as credit, savings, staking and insurance for artists. Such a wide scope can be either an advantage (good horizontal proposition) or a disadvantage (loss of core competence), depending on how you look at it.\n\nNevertheless the idea behind connecting Cardano with an existing NFT marketplace is definitely in tune with the challenge. I offer four stars in the hope that the scope of the project will be better defined in future materials.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The 7 person team behind the proposal seems very solid, with expertise in software development, technology, marketing, art industry - a very powerful mix and a solid fit for the project. I have skimmed their public bios and have read a few public recommendations from their social profiles and the first impressions are extremely favorable.\n\nThe project would take 26 weeks to finalize, and is roughly split in 4. Parts. Weeks 1-8 would see the integration with ADA, weeks 9-16 would introduce an ADA wallet, weeks 17-22 would end with having support for Cardano mainnet, and weeks 9-26 would focus on community development and marketing efforts. \n\nBudget-wise, the money would roughly split equally between development / wallet / community engagement / QA + launch. It would have been extremely beneficial to have perhaps an overview of hours estimated for implementation and hourly rates utilized. \n\nIn conclusion a solid team with a sound plan / budget, with an opportunity to improve on their level of granularity in terms of information offered. Solid 4 stars. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team offers success measures / targets that truly makes sense: Cardano transactions in Africa (likely easy to track and share publicly), adoption rate of the marketplace with 500/1000 users/day after 3 months from launch, and trained developers with increased contribution to github code base. Last but not least, community membership (artists most likely) rising from 300 currently to 4-5k. Mini conferences, online events with the Cardano community would complement all of this.

A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization which allows users to take part in the decision making on the activities of the project. While this solution already exists on the cardano block chain (think epoch.art), they want to target the audience of the African artists which should give them a boost in terms of adoption.

One of the most important parts of a successful execution is the team. The proposers have included the linkedin profiles of the team members as well as listed their experiences and skills. After the team, I take the budget very seriously as it should make sense and break it down accordingly. The proposer has broken down the budget but I recommend them to break it down further.

The proponent cites that as new artists use blockchain technology, new members are likely to be attracted to the Cardano community. In fact, it might be, but I would like a more solid plan to make that happen. It would also be important, in my view, that the author of the proposal had explained why he chose our blockchain to develop Nifty Row, which Cardano differentials would be used here? In general, I think the idea of \u200b\u200bcreating a space that can leverage the use of blockchain in the artistic community is very good, promoting support for this audience by better explaining what this new technology is, improving the trust and authenticity of the works; in addition to developing DeFi services, as mentioned by the proponent.

Let's cite the example of the first interval, the \"Full Features Market Development/Integration in Ada\" would be done. But what small activities would make up the development? Who would do them, in what order, and why? Likewise, all other topics should be better sorted out. The same thing happens with funding. Information is said very superficially; we don't know for example why $20k is needed for \"Full Feature Development/Market Integration in Ada\". All parts should be carefully detailed, mainly because they are such expensive values. The best part of this topic is, without a doubt, the team presentation. We know their names, resumes and linkedin profiles, as we understand their professional backgrounds very well and we are very confident in their preparations to perform the service. So I think the first two parts of feasibility are pretty inadequate, but the last one is good.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "It's great how the author outlines different ways we can audit progress. These are qualitative metrics, for the most part, but I think it's better that way than just dealing with numbers. The only thing that should have been clarified better then is how such varied information will reach the Cardano community in a simple and direct way. By discord, telegram, email? Will it all be posted on github or some other information sharing site? In relation to the final results, something similar happens. The amount and level of detail of the information given is high; we just need to understand how they will be accessible to the Cardano community. My suggestion is that a meeting be held at the end of the project, open to any member of the community who wishes to participate, in order to present in detail everything that was done and how it reached our blockchain, if in fact the objectives of the challenge were met.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10990, "q0": "Entrepreneurs really don't like to be asked: why don't they start with something smaller in scope, with a part of the puzzle they want to put together? It has on them the effect of a sharp stick in the eye.  However, it is the question most often asked when someone present a project that will have a lot to validate.  Lots of moving parts.\n\nThis is one of those projects.  It is really ambitious: a marketplace, a DeFi structure, a DAO structure.  Each item has its own universe, increased in complexity by the features that the proponents want to include in each one.  \n\nI have no doubt about the seriousness with which the implementation team will take on the project. They seem to have already started working on the Nifty Row marketplace.  However, based on the approach provided in the proposal, an obstacle in one part of the proposal (a natural situation in the project execution business) would affect the execution in other parts of the proposal, thus affecting the entire system. So we would be talking about the existence of a systemic risk: if the marketplace fails  (the gateway to the whole project), the DeFi services lose credibility, and if the DeFi services are affected, the DAO loses its purpose. \n\nThere is no doubt that the proposal has been the subject of hours of design and conceptualization.  It is clear that the proponents have a good understanding of the overall problem and how to contribute to reducing the inequalities generated by that problem (the information provided in the proposal and the information that can be accessed on the website, especially in the document called Deck, allow me to deduce that).  In the long run I would not be surprised to hear of them again as a project that leveled the playing field for artists from Africa, the MENA region and South America (territories of exquisite cultural and artistic richness).  However, they should start with one part of the triad they wish to build.  They would have more control and flexibility over their work.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The complexity of the proposal contrasts with the brevity of the information provided in the Roadmap and the Budget.  In contrast, the information from the team members is generous.  The Auditability section has an attention-grabbing KPI: \"Trained blockchain developers who should be able to assume the development roles for the project after 2 to 3 weeks of training and contributing to an increasing code base on github (https://github.com/Nifty-Row/)\".  In my opinion, this situation does not indicate decisively that the team does not have the necessary skills to execute the proposal, however, given the complexity of the proposal and the scarcity of information provided regarding its execution (in the Roadmap and the budget), as an evaluator and as a voter I find it necessary to obtain more information on the execution process to have a clear idea of the feasibility of the proposal.

As a metric, the number of users is a general symptom that ends up indicating nothing specific about the internal structure of a project.  The importance of a KPI lies in its ability to identify a problem as accurately as possible, allowing you to act quickly.  The complexity of the proposal requires KPIs located at internal points of the proposal that measure the vibrations occurring inside, not the tunnel exits.

It would have been better to break it down even more to clarify the reason for the amounts behind these items. It is somewhat unclear exactly when the main launch is, but it states weeks 17 - 22 is for support for Cardano Mainnet launch. They focused a lot on how marketing will be done and not so much on explaining how and what is being done when it comes to building. No mention of the architecture of the dApp or Plutus.
