It is about \u201cproviding a Cardano blockchain-based ticketing marketplace for live and virtual events powered by smart contracts.\u201d The problem situation defined by the proponent is that buying and selling tickets online is full of very expensive fees (which is true, anyone who has ever bought tickets to a party or show on websites and apps knows what he is talking about). The solution would be to host this transaction on the Cardano blockchain, so that it is completely transparent, immutable, secure and above all cheaper. As I said, I think it could be an organic way of attracting new members to our community, because people would just be looking to do things they already do (buying tickets to various events online). They wouldn't come because of Cardano, but they would know Cardano automatically. Perhaps this will attract new active members to our community once people realize the advantages of transacting on the Cardano blockchain compared to other blockchains and even traditional transfers. The proponent also argues, through research, about the magnitude of the problem he intends to solve here, as is clear from the excerpts \u201centertainment is one of the largest and fastest growing sectors in the world (US$ 2.6 trillion by 2025)\u201d and \u201cestimated $15.9 billion ticket scalper market in 2020\u201d. It's super positive how he gives sources of his research, several sites through which we can verify the said information. Throughout the description of the proposal, the proposer goes on to argue how this application would work and why Cardano is the most suitable blockchain to develop it; it also further explains what the benefits would be for all users involved, such as artists and end consumers. Therefore, I think the proposal's impact is excellent, we know exactly: what would be done; why it should be done; features about Dapp; how beneficial this would be to Cardano; what the experience of each type of user would be; etc. This proposal certainly aligns with the objectives of the challenge, which in short are to promote the adoption of Cardano through high-value and impact Dapps for our blockchain. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponent states what would be done in months 1, 3, 6 and 12 of the project. Long explanations are provided, so that we are able to understand very specifically what would have to be done for the project to become a reality. I think that in terms of detailing the activities, this part is excellent, my only suggestion for the script part would be that it really breaks the total time into shorter intervals, for example in months. This would further increase the level of understanding of the process. However, I emphasize that this question is presented with a lot of specificity and satisfactory level of detail. Moving on to the next analysis topic, the budget is not very well explained, unfortunately. We know that the professionals hired will be \u201c1 full stack web developer and 2 smart contract developers, plus a project manager\u201d and that they would work on the project for a total time of 3 to 6 months, which may vary. I think the proposer should have been more specific here. How much will each professional involved earn? How many hours per week will they dedicate to the project? If the time varies from 3 to 6 months, it means that they can earn an \u201cx\u201d or \u201c2x\u201d value, as the same amount of money can be used for twice as long, for example. This raises a little concern for me, it would be more interesting if the proponent had defined a safer time for the development of the project, and stipulated the hourly value of each professional's work. That way, we would have a much more solid notion of whether the money asked is fair or very high. So, on that, I believe the proposal could be better. Finally, speaking of the team, I think that this part is also not so adequate, little information is provided about each of the professionals involved. Although they have provided their linkedin profiles, the ideal would be for them to better detail their resumes in the proposal itself, that is, previous experiences, whether projects developed within our ecosystem or not. I would say that there is a certain trust in them, due to their professional performances and linkedin profiles, but this trust would be intensified with a more extensive curriculum here. So I conclude that the feasibility is ok, but it can still improve. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I think the bidder explains well what would be considered success in the 6 month period (\"shipping an initial version of the web client, deploying multiple iterations of the smart contracts on Cardano Testnet, and starting integration with the frontend of the client\" mobile for Android and iOS\u201d) and 1 year (\u201csuccessfully deploy our verified contracts on the Cardano mainnet, acquire at least 1 partnership with a venue or event organizer, and list tickets on sale for at least 1 pilot event\u201d). However, I believe that 6 months and 1 year is too long for the Cardano community to be out of date on progress. I think it would be more appropriate for the author of the proposal to determine smaller goals, partial goals to be achieved monthly, for example. It would also be important to have an idea of \u200b\u200bhow the work routine of those involved would be, if all professionals would be fulfilling the promised tasks in the right way and within the agreed deadlines. I think the proponent will update the IOG coordinators at meetings that take place on a standard basis, but I would like him to make it clearer how members of the Cardano community could be privy to such information. Regarding the final results, we have very well defined the success scenario that would be \u201cbringing a low-cost and frictionless experience to the market for the end user, allowing more people to enrich their lives with virtual and face-to-face experiences\u201d. The proponent claims that this can be measured through the Dapp used in mobile apps; the main objective would be to deliver a finished version of this application and the secondary objective would be to establish a partnership with a Cardano project, already stronger within our community. Again, I believe we know very well what to audit, we have a great explanation of what would need to be achieved in order for us to consider success a reality. My suggestion is to make such information accessible to members of the Cardano community, in my view the only thing missing even in the auditability of this proposal is to explain how this bridge between the project and the community would be made. Otherwise, everything is very well explained, we have a very satisfactory level of detail. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 422, "q0": "The entertainment industry has suffered from middlemen for years.

I'm not totally convinced that the price tag is appropriately proportional to the level of positive impact and innovation that it brings to the table. Second, I wish I could see reputable names for these connections to \"music industry producers\" and \"labels & performers.\" In order for this product to see any value towards adoption, there has to be interest and utilization by event ticket distributors. This is not the type of project that could be slowly grown by individuals pouring into the product. There needs to be an assurance that there will be clients. I give a positive review because I like what I see and I trust the developers to have these things in place, but I can't see proof of it. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The roadmap is much too detailed.

The one qualm I have to raise with this budget is the lack of specificity. The proposal states that it will be going entirely to pay developers but I'd still like to see a breakdown. I want to know how much is intended for payment to these developers and over what timeframe, so that I can have a clear understanding of how efficiently the funds are being spent. Most of my issues with this proposal are relatively minor but are all still things that I definitely feel like I need to be seeing for a request of this price tag.
