The proposal appears to be aimed at helping fund the development of plugins that will give Cardano the benefits of integrating with the Matrix solution. It is unclear on exactly what type of plugins the team think should be built. Some clear examples would be beneficial to understand exactly who may benefit from these plugins. It is clear how improving the usage of the Matrix application through the use of plugins in the Cardano ecosystem could be impactful - however in the future more depth should be added.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has provided a link to their GitHub repository which provides a range of evidence towards the amount of contributors and repositories that the group have released. The website https://www.matrix.org/ also helps to provide more detail on their current product offering. As the development for these plugins is supposed to happen with five different teams at $10k each it would have been nice to understand the selection process and examples of the type of teams that would be selected. It would be the quality in the selection of these teams that would determine how feasible this proposal is. A roadmap break down is not provided. A brief budget breakdown is provided and seems reasonable for what is being executed.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The Matrix articulate that the teams selected will be responsible for the reporting and ensuring progress is being made. This is useful however an improvement on this would be to include the responsibilities of the proposer and how they will audit the proposal execution as a whole as they are the ones responsible for the execution of these collected efforts. It would be beneficial to have a defined way that the community can audit the work that the proposal team does to organise this proposal. In terms of clarity this proposal could have benefited from better examples and also a clearer roadmap on how they will attract, engage and ensure delivery of the different integrations they will be delivering if this proposal was funded. Some metrics could have been added about existing integrations and how they have performed or more general usage of the Matrix solution and how this can be applied to the integrations as sensible KPIs for that work.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_758", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9886, "q0": "This proposal states a problem very broadly, and the solution lacks minimum details to understand what will be developed. A general statement of developers going to \u201ccreate Dapps and integrations using existing matrix plugins and opensource solutions\u201d is not enough to justify the 89kUSD budget that is requested. \nI personally have low development skills, but I tried to understand what the plan for this proposal is by reading proposing team\u2019s website matrix.org. When I\u2019m writing this review, Cardano is not mentioned on this website.\nThe proposer does not demonstrate how his solution will increase utility and adoption of Cardano, this is why I select impact rating = 1.\n", "q0r": 1, "q1": " As the team does not give a clear description of what this proposal offers to develop, assessing feasibility leads me to a low score.

What those integrations involve? What kind of developers are facing problems and what kind of problems are they? What that old project you mention is about? Maybe you should give a little more information about it at the start of the impact section of the proposal and then proceed to link the current proposal and with that old project. The idea of developing tools open Sourced, secure, scalable with community verifications and layers of permissions sounds like a good one but is very general and needs a lot more elaboration on it. Also providing pictures is entertaining but think about change them into bullet points in order to focus more on more important parts of the proposal. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Unfortunately, i'm noticing some insufficiencies when it comes to how this proposal will be implemented successfully. There is no detailed plan there first of all. The proposer does not provide the type and number of team members required to implement this proposal. Providing a github account of the whole project (not the CEO's for example) is clearly not enough to verify the skills and experience of the people involved. Who are those people that work on this for a month and who of them over a decade? What is their background and has it anything to do with the challenge setting and the proposal? What languages and architecture are you going to need for your implementation? The budget is there but i do not completely agree with the way it has been broken down as it makes me question about a lot. When you refer to the development, how many developers are you going to need, what type of developers are they going to be and how many hours will they spend on this proposal? What do you mean by self sustainable models and what by the costs in general? One positive thing i can say to counterpoise these bad practices, is that you referred to the possible risks of this proposal successfully. I really do think that it needs a lot more work to stand decently as a proposal. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Again, there are a many insufficiencies. There is no roadmap and no milestones to it with a time horizon ahead. The KPIs are not described clearly, the only thing that is mentioned is that each member will be responsible to deliver each KPI, without referring to it/them. No numbers are there to measure the success in some way and the whole description of success does not make much sense. Last but not least, there is no way for the community to track the progress of the proposal, again a github account is just not enough. I am really sorry to assess like that but there is no guideline has been followed here. I am looking forward to seeing this proposal, more mature and more complete, on the next Fund, if it not funded on this round.
