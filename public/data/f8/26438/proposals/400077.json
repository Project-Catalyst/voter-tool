They intend to create a Dapp that would serve to ensure that people have access to services and products in a more shared way; from the excerpt \u201cour system provides a dynamic guaranteed income in our community token - $MADAO\u201d, we infer that all users of this application would receive a certain amount of money (in the form of a token of its own for this application), but it is not so clear why this is would be received. Would the user sign up and automatically receive this token? Wouldn't he have to do some service in return, do some kind of work? Proponents claim that the difference between this application and similar ones would be the way to spend the tokens obtained. According to them, in other applications of the genre \u201cthere is no practical way to spend your collected tokens on these networks, other than a few handpicked retailers\u201d; the problem would be solved from the moment that \u201cusers exchange goods and services directly each other, mediated by our software client, keeping real economic actors and speculators out.\u201d In other words, this application intends to create its own microeconomy. I thought the idea was quite interesting, but two fundamental issues are not so clear. The first is the one I already explained: we don't know if the users of this Dapp would have to provide some product or service in order for them to receive the tokens back; it is not clear if this would be automatically provided, in which case it is a little strange because Dapp would end up playing the role of a social program to support the population, and we do not know where the tokens would be taken from (who would \u201cpay\u201d for this, anyway? simplified way) and also what would be the target audience of Dapp (any specific community, country, location...)? The second question is: how would Cardano technologies be involved here, in a direct way, how would our blockchain benefit? We know it would be a DAO, so we are led to think that the tokens in question would be minted on the Cardano blockchain. In the excerpt \u201cthe MADAO network allows users to sponsor each other with contributions of $ADA\u201d, we see that some transactions could be done in Ada, so that's where Cardano's technologies would fit. However, I wish the proponent had clarified this doubt better. I'll give it a neutral grade because I think the idea is good but it's so well explained, so I'm not so sure about the impact. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal script starts from the moment the application is ready and users are already using it. We can verify this through the excerpts \u201cMADAO User Client can send and receive MADAO tokens\u201d and \u201cMADAO User Client can distribute dynamic guaranteed income based on Freedom Framework KPIs\u201d, which are activities to be developed in the third quarter of the year. But we are currently in the first quarter (I evaluate this proposal exactly on the 21st of February); when the results of the fund come out and the money is distributed, it will probably happen in May, that is, in the second quarter of 2022. So what will happen in this quarter? Why do proponents explain activities from the third quarter and with Dapp developed? Ideally, the script would be reworked and two changes made. First, the temporal division: it is more appropriate for time to be divided into months rather than quarters. Afterwards, the proponents would have to explain what would happen from the moment the project was financed, that is, mid-May. The activities should be very detailed, we should have a solid understanding of the entire process performed. So, in my view, this script is quite inadequate, it leaves a lot to be desired. Talking about the budget, the explanation of the 17 thousand dollars requested is rather superficial. We know that for example $8,000 will go towards development; however we don't have good explanations about this development, the proponents only claim that the money would be destined to pay the coder, who would create the software. I found this explanation very vague, we would need to know things like 1) what he would do in his work routine 2) for how many months this professional would work 3) how many hours per week would be dedicated to this project (with that, we would know the value of his hour of work and we could find out if he is fair or not). All parts of the budget should be detailed at this level. Finally, analyzing the team, I think that few things are informed about each, we only have an idea of \u200b\u200bwho they are, but we do not know their resumes, previous experiences and connections with Cardano. So there's not a lot of confidence in this team. In summary, I think the project's viability is low and has a lot to improve. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The auditability of the process is very good, I would say almost perfect. Four metrics are defined (savings rate + spending rate +\nnetwork size + engagement) that will serve as a way to measure the development of the project; these metrics directly correspond to the partial results, and I think the explanations about each of them are very well detailed and developed. My only issue here would be to really understand how all this information will reach the members of the Cardano community; there will likely be periodic meetings with IOG representatives, but we don't know how this will be extended to the rest of the community. Therefore, I think it is important that this issue be clarified, other than that, I think everything is in agreement about the auditability of the process. Now talking about the final results, I found that the level of explanation has gone down a lot, the proponents only vaguely outline what would be considered success: \u201ca network of beneficiaries using MADAO to buy goods and services from each other and sharing the ADA to help each other with uncompromising financial demands that cannot be met on MADAO, through an accessible, user-managed dapp.\u201d How can we see in practice if this has been achieved? What measurable metrics will we use to see proven success? How will we know if MADAO network users have also become active members of the Cardano community, in addition to users of this application? Did they go on to acquire more Ada? Are transactions on our blockchain more frequent? I think that the proponents do not establish palpable ways of understanding the desired situation and also do not clarify how the bridge to the Cardano community would be. Anyway, this topic of the proposal isn't bad (especially in the first part, which I thought was really good), but the second part still needs to be explained better, so I'll give it a neutral note.

If the team was able to implement the MADAO with onboarding enough users, and then leverage that user base to build a community of buyers and sellers to trade amongst one another with a $MADAO token. This would help the cardano ecosystem as a whole in many areas included the ones in this challenge. One of those ways would be with the issue that all DAOs deal with in one way or the other and that is liquidity. The staking rewards of a DAO are not exchanged on any large exchange, so without supporting infrastructure and liquidity allowing them to be converted into a coin with high liquidity, then you are stuck with something with little to no value and high depreciating inflation. This proposal vaguely describes a situation of creating and integrated platform that would allow users to directly buy and sell to one another. \n\n  All of these things would be very valuable to the ecosystem, and hit on many points in the challenge. The issue that i am seeing is the lack of detailed information in the proposal and even in the website as to how they will achieve this and deliver a successful project. There is mention of \" The Freedom Framework\", which i understand to be how they plan to implement the high APY return a DAO is famous for, and they say they will maintain these funds with a series of internal KPIs and they named it The Freedom Framework. \n  I would have liked to see more in depth explanation on almost all of the topics of the proposal. It would be reassuring to know this isn't just an exact copy paste of existing DAOs but instead new and unique ideas that would come from the team.

The harsh realization of these super high APY staking reward models is that they are not sustainable for long, and people end up losing a lot of money. The way this project will attempt to solve it is by creating value for the reward token $MADAO. Their idea is to create a direct Buyer to Seller marketplace within their DAO and use the token as payment. for this to happen the DAO would need a very large user base, along with many other integrations that were not mentioned in the proposal. The budget is very underestimated to bring a project of this scope to the ecosystem, and they have not acknowledged the need for future funding or where that might come from.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal seems to outline a fairly comprehensive understanding of how they will manage KPIs.

Is it for one month, three months, two weeks? I\u2019m left having to guess. I would have very much preferred to see calculations based on an hourly rate. In addition, this would have provided the assessors with a way to verify the feasibility of the requested amount. For instance, perhaps the amount requested is too low to be feasible for the planned features. I am particularly puzzled by the meaning of the last line of the budget breakdown - $200 for Digital Infrastructure - what does that refer to exactly, $200 seems a much too small amount to be feasible for any kind of \u201cDigital Infrastructure\u201d.\n\nShort bios for each of the team members are present in the proposal, however, no external links to professional profiles or other means of verifying their claims are present.

Many funding rounds down the road, this might be a world-changing project, with potentially high impact, but it misses the main challenge brief of creating a working, viable dApp. Because this is what the challenge wants to see: that can already drive adoption and contribute to an impressive portfolio of Cardano and Catalyst use cases by new dApps that come out of this funding round.
