Minting ntfs is not a smooth experience most of the time. Projects as well as the cardano nft community will welcome this nft launchpad if the proposers can deliver the results they are promising. I think that the proposers have done a good job identifying a problem within the challenge which needs to be solved. They also have mentioned the benefits and value that this solution will add to the cardano ecosystem. Altogether, I give this a high rating in the impact department.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have provided the necessary information to have my confidence in a successful implementation of the proposal.

However I recommend them to add links to the team members linkedin profile.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal can be audited because the proposers have included a roadmap with milestones that will help track its progress. Furthermore the KPIs and metrics that define success are also included.

However, after reading the proposal, the solution that is described is closer to a \u201cminting engine\u201d and I assess this to have potentially a great impact on the Cardano ecosystem.\nGiven the multisig nature of the proposed solution this could lead to a substantial decrease in network congestion by eliminating redundant transactions in the Cardano NFT space and introducing the world to the power of eUTxO.\n\nAs a suggestion, I would recommend rephrasing the word launchpad if a resubmission of the proposal will be required.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The presented roadmap is clear, on point, and covers every detail that you would expect for the successful implementation of the solution.\n\nThe project breakdown is minimal but is enough to describe the expected distribution of funds, however, I would have liked to see the exact timeframe covered, especially for salaries and perhaps an hourly rate for the developers.\n\nGiven the experience of the team and the fact that part of the project is already live on testnet I have a high level of confidence that if funded, the project will be delivered.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPIs are clear and easy to follow and should facilitate easy auditing of the progress made towards the deliverables of the proposal.\n\nThe definitions of success however are a bit too general and don\u2019t necessarily address the development of the proposal specifically. To that end, I would have also liked to see them addressing development timeframes, such as 3, 6, and 12 months. Hence I subtracted a point from the suitability score.\n\nAt first, I was a bit confused after reading this statement : \n\n\u201cYes we were funded in fund 7 under Mini/Low-Budget Dapps & Integrations (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/384881). The fund was for developing an efficient minting mechanism through smart contracts but our research showed that multi-sig is a far better option to implement so we switched to that as you can see in our development timeline of January and February. This proposal is a continuation of the same project in order to develop more features.\u201d \n\nDoes this mean that the proposer team received funding for a project that they decided to not deliver on and submit another proposal to expand the scope? That would be problematic. But this is not the case, as I have checked their website, and the multi-sig minting service for which they received funding is already implemented and minting NFTs successfully on testnet. I have minted one such testnet NFT without a problem.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_681", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8656, "q0": "The proposer's idea is \u200b\u200btaking advantage of the Eutxo-smart contract that is pretty good. It helps users to save a little fee for NFT trading because the smart contract will execute both minting and NFT exchange at the same time. However, I consider this solution to be only an improvement solution, but not yet able to bring great results according to the criteria set by the challenge. A highly efficient NFT market, besides good technical operation, the most important for a successful marketpalce that it must have large amount of a quality seller (many quality NFTs) and many buyers. The innovative solution is only effective when the platform is running and their users want an improvement in cost and transaction speed. My suggest :\n1.in order to make this proposal have more impactful and solve the challenges, the proposer should have more solutions to attract users, attract NFT sellers to increase the effectiveness of the solution. (I suggest it because i was joining proposal's discord channel while i reading the proposal. There are about 40 member, it isnt large number).   \n2. with this technical improvements to the platform, the proposer can cooperate with major NFT marketplaces on Cardano by integrating it into these platforms (where there are a lot of buyers and sellers).", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The project has been active since January and this is also included in the detailed plan of the proposal. And everything is going according to plan so far. According to the implementation schedule, the proposal will end in April. This is possible because most of the work has been completed on schedule since January.\nProposal implementation team are really experienced people, the team leader has had 3 funded proposals in previous funds. And that's the best proof that the Dapp is working. I also tried test Dapp, it's good.\nFunding breakdown for paying income for 3 members of the project team and expenses for buying servers, software, and hardware to build Dapp. I assess it very reasonable", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The informations of proposer provides for measuring and tracking project progress is actually a bit redundant. The proposal only provides a roadmap for the completion of the product, and also does not provide targets on the number of users that will be achieved. Was the proposer mistaken on this point? To tracck the progress of the project, Just go to the website Rarety.io to check. However, I suggest the proposer provide an additional source to check the code like github to demonstrate the technically improved solution as stated by the proposer.\nThe project looks like a perfect success if the proposer can come up with targets on how many users will reach. But actually, the success of the proposal can be assessed by the fact that the Dapp is working and 75% of the plan is completed as given.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_683", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10415, "q0": "Currently an NFT marketplace that streamlines the chain load is a highly appealing idea. Even with scaling solutions coming a more efficient solution is preferable. The minting platform for project launches has already been built and now the proposers are looking to continue to develop the functionality of the platform so that it can establish itself as a top NFT platform. The proposal meets the challenge objectives and with a working MVP is a good candidate for further funding.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team have a working MVP and have the necessary experience and technical expertise to continue to develop it into a more complete product.
