Managing copyright is a highly complex challenge today, and so far nobody has a perfect solution. The value proposal here is to introduce an identification process based on Cardano in order to manage authorship acknowledgement of materials made by multiple authors. \n\nI am highly enthusiastic of the potential impact of such a tool that might increase the efficiency of the worldwide copyright market, with the slight caveat that I feel somehow that this kind of solution can also be analyzed from a permissioned blockchain point of view (vs. permissionless as Cardano). There are many arguments to be made for this, and I bring forth the following: enforcing copyright will still be highly dependant on each country\u2019s system of law and existing institutions and market players in copyright-intensive industries (arts, research, drug development, etc) so in most of those cases a system in which only the interested parties develop and maintain a blockchain with the source of truth can be just as effective and more efficient than a permissionless solution such as Cardano. Four stars. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has done an excellent job at presenting themselves and the use case for their proposal, and the effervescence of the comments section from the proposal is perhaps the best indicator that they are on to something excellent here, with potentially great public traction and interest from the community. \n\nTimewise they have come up with a 2-months plan of implementing the solution, while the budget is not granular enough in my opinion and there is a moderate risk that the overall costs have not been sufficiently analyzed and estimated, leading to potential cost overruns during the implementation. Four solid stars in the hope that budget matters will be offered more attention during the implementation phase, if funded. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team promises to create a website containing information about the progress and the status of the development. This is an excellent indicator that they wish to tailor the information for the Cardano community. Every milestone will also be accompanied by a video.

"}, {"id": 3355, "q0": "From providing a description of the current problems in managing copyright, the proposer offers a promising solution based on the Cardano network to address these issues. Following this order, they have succeeded in showing the necessity and potential development of their project. The main features of their project (using blockchain technology and Cardano hydra) are described in the proposal, allowing the community to understand how they function and what the expected benefits are. The financial and social KPIs are also included to measure the progress and development of the project. \nThe main uncertainty in the duration of the project is related to the status of developing HYDRA as they stated. However, they have provided some demo and draft work so the community can access these files to get a view of their current work and precisely evaluate their ability. Another challenge is the staffing cost since they can\u2019t afford that amount of money. Once they get funded, this problem can gradually be tackled.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The specific milestones and durations are covered in their action plan. In each milestone, there are synchronized tasks that need to be done to ensure the project\u2019s progress. These activities are in tune with their development orientation. The community can use this framework to track progress over time and define any possible delays. \nTheir budget will be spent on the salary for 3 developers. Since there are not so many types of expenses, the community can easily track the cash flow and ensure transparency in their financial allocations. \nThe team is portrayed with two current members. Their relevant working experiences, backgrounds, and Linkedin accounts are illustrated in the proposal. With their knowledge and experience in IT and AI, they will be able to run the project effectively. And as they said, the team is being expanded, which will increase the capacity and productivity of the team\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "By creating a website to report the progress and development of the project, they have assured the community of the transparency and reliability of their project. Besides, as mentioned above, there are some financial and social KPIs that the community can use to assess their performance.\nThe specific goals for success are firmly set. These goals act as a base for the community to determine whether the team achieves the visualized success or not.
