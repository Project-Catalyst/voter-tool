Possibilities for the general public are also offered, such as the purchase of participation in songs and the possibility of making gains from it. Given these characteristics, it is possible to indicate that the proposal fits the scope of the challenge in question. However, some doubts arise regarding the possibility of the project actually fulfilling what it proposes and generating a positive impact on Cardano's ecosystem.\n\nIt is possible to notice that the platform aims to go in different directions, but the general idea that we perceive is that the project tries to embrace many challenges and provides a lot of complex functionality at first. We can justify this point with the following idea, we know that there is already a barrier to be overcome so that the sale of music in the proposed format reaches a wider audience. But we perceive in the proposal a concern to attack multiple modalities of this mode of commercialization that, in fact, is not yet well rooted; in relation to royalties for example, we observe: implementation of royalties for fans, division of royalties between artists and royalties for streaming. Perhaps it would be interesting to establish a more direct path at first. At the same time, the platform also involves selling physical merchandising and the goal of creating a community around music.\n\nIt seems like a very bold attempt at a first approach, and the $100,000 budget would probably not be enough to achieve the result.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Regarding the project team, we see that the professionals have a good qualification to fulfill the task. But the details of the plan that must be followed to promote the growth of the platform were not very clear. A good part of the description present in the proposal describes the functionalities of the different pages that will exist on the site and what the possibilities of action for a user are, but this was not a very clear way of detailing the stages of building the business. We get the impression that we are looking at the descriptions that will be passed on to the developers of what should exist on the platform, but there is a lack of a better understanding of how things will work together. There is also a website under development, but the content there does not help us to solve the doubts that were raised here.\n\nRegarding the distribution of the budget, we noticed a concern on the part of the team in allocating resources for both marketing and project management, showing that it was not only focused on the development of the platform. A valid point to be mentioned here is also that it would be interesting to make easy availability of the CVs of the professionals involved.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Regarding the described ways to verify the success of the platform, we found ourselves in a situation similar to what had occurred initially. It had been mentioned that the project will allow several possibilities of action for users, but that these possibilities were not very detailed. Here we also note the lack of a greater explanation in relation to follow-up. The JIRA tool has been cited to monitor the progress of tasks and there will also be commits to github for goal verification. But this information is very general, given all the fronts on which the project plans to act.\n\nIt would be nice to have more quantitative indicators to understand the evolution, such as a number to be reached of artists present on the platform, an expected volume of commercialization of CNFT's or an expected number of partnerships to be closed in the first months of the project. Given the purpose of the platform, a notable idea might be to try partnerships with an artist from the indie universe, in order to bring greater engagement to the project.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 6, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3779, "q0": "Generally, this proposal manages to provide the community a straightforward introduction of the project DM. From this content, I can clearly acknowledge your platform\u2019s chief functions, target customers, and it is highly expected to become an ultimate solution for the music industry to address systemic problems. This is considered as an effective application output that this challenge requires in the projects. Especially, finishing up to 70% of the application is seen to be an important indication of your team\u2019s thorough preparation. Upon allowing the artist and/or label to retain the majority share of all transactions, it means that your key metric aligns with that of the challenge since you let an \u201capplication transaction\u201d be an output, and simultaneously, it promises to be an useful method to attract users to access your platform and adopt Cardano. Unfortunately, despite predicting precisely the primary difficulties that your team can face during the project progress, you fail to put forward several solutions to minimize them. To be specific, you had better give general feasible solutions to address the lack of knowledge about Cardano growth tools, like recruiting some advanced developers or specialists in this field to improve them (this is only my example solution, raise your own)", "q0r": 4, "q1": "You know, your proposal satisfies me because of its detail and transparency in milestones but also disappoints me due to the lack of timeline. In particular, you provided a lot of detail about the CNFT marketplace implementation that helps the voters to be aware of your plan, but now what they wonder is when these goals will be achieved. It will be impossibly accepted if you only propose a long work plan without a single timeline, right? Regarding your team members, the introduction about them is extremely short. It\u2019s worse when you don\u2019t mention anything about their backgrounds and working experiences aside from the title of their positions. Please supplement this crucial information, or at least you should attach their LinkedIn links so that the voters can evaluate their standards for this challenge. Furthermore, one urgent issue appears in this section, the budget allocation. It is clearly stated in the campaign brief of the challenge: \u201cFor smaller teams (4-5 people) with proven competence, relevant experience and technical skills with sketches/whitepaper detailing how they would go about to launch their proposal, the budgets would typically be in the range $40,000-$80,000.\u201d While your team only has 3 members during the whole process, it implies that the cost of $100000 is unreasonable. Thus, I suggest you opt for two options as follows. The first is to reduce the requested budget to a smaller number. Another one is to invite more people with relevant experiences to conduct this project together.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I know you are capable of coming up with measurement tools to keep track of the project progress, but your limitation is to not provide enough detail or explanations about these tools. Just with one sentence like that, many of the community won\u2019t be able to understand these tools\u2019 functions. For that reason, you are highly advised to clarify generally their uses, such as what milestones will be kept track of by JIRA, slack and GitHub. On top of that, with regards to the definition of success, if your main interest is adoption and transitions, you could specify them by imagining the quantity of  transactions that will be made daily or weekly, or maybe the number of Cardano adopters/active users. That will be a useful method to gain more positive comments from the voters.   \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1675", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1497, "q0": "A quick google search and I found out that in Q4 2021 about 406 million people use Spotify monthly.

The team is looking for funding to build DecentralizeMusic.com (DM), a live streaming website that also allows artists to create profiles, sell products, music, nfts, and more. This is an exciting and ambitious concept. In my viewpoint, it is rather obvious how this suggestion relates to the challenge setting. I liked the overall idea, the project proposal, and the overall outlined tasks and milestones sounded reasonable to me. Unfortunately, there is no mention of the expected impact of the implementation to the community. They mention \"\"success metrics\"\" that are more implementation milestones as \u201cadoption and transactions\u201d seems subjective and not concrete.

Because a detailed background of the team behind a project is critical to ensuring voters' confidence in its success and feasibility, it's critical that the proposer considers the problem for future proposals. The total money sought is $100,000 USD, which has been divided down into components. However, in order to comprehend the budget allocation, more specifics in a budget breakdown would be better. According to my understanding, the majority of the funds requested would be used to compensate the development team. It would be extremely beneficial if the plan included an answer to the question of how many working hours are to be divided among how many hired individuals, and so on. A roadmap is provided and well-described, with concrete achievements highlighting the implementation's steps one by one. It's a shame the deadline for delivering the proposed solutions isn't included. As a result, there is no timeline for completing the aforementioned activities in each phase. Overall, I don't believe this concept will be implemented successfully in terms of feasibility.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The fact that the proposer claimed to utilize project management tools such as JIRA, slack as well as github to track the progress make it apparent how data and tracking will be collected. However, to add auditability to the project, there should be an open source nature of the platform. This will help the community to fully grasp how the project is progressing and where it is heading. I would advise the team to define in full what success measures they intend to have.

These are very potential proposals that could bring widespread adoption to Cardano. I am also interested in this proposal the solution proposed by the proposer. In particular, the proposer mentioned that their Beta product is nearing completion. It can be seen that the solution of this proposal is divided into two parts. Part 1, a platform that allows artists to livestream, upload and store their art products... Part 2, proposer will build a marketplace using blockchain technologies to connect artists with people use. In this section, the proposer has not provided detailed technical solutions on how they will create the marketplace. When I took a look at the proposer's roadmap, I saw that they also gave basic solutions to create a Dapp. Perhaps at the beginning of the project such a technical solution is enough. I have some suggestions for the technical solution of the proposal to be more complete. To solve the problem of creating CNFTs, there are currently a lot of CNFT-related tools created by developers in the Cardano community. Even in catalyst, there are many proposals for tools related to CNFT, proposer can contact to some NFT tool developers to seek cooperation. Or 1 dapps that in my personal opinion the proposer can refer to https://cardahub.io/", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The detailed plan for the first phase of the project is given in great detail by the proposer. Showing that the proposer knows what he is going to do. However, the proposer seems to have forgotten to include detailed timelines in his plan. In this case, I think the proposer forgot because roadmap looking very detailed that means the proposer has the experience to do the job or has done thorough research. The only \"not good\" part of the plan that the proposer may not have a detailed time for is the NFT or wallet integration, the reason is because as the proposer mentioned is that he does not have enough experience to deal with it at the moment. this problem. Regarding the capacity and experience of the project team, although there are no common profile links in the proposal but I have looked at the project's website and youtube channel and found that they are quite professional and experienced in the field of music industry, and graphic design. The youtube channel also has more than 5 thousand subscribers, which also proves that they also have a significant number of followers. This is consistent with the campaing of challenge.\nHowever, the fund breakdown is really not good, the fund is divided into 4 items with a total fund of 100000$. According to the information the project team that provided by proposer, they are  3 man team and with the platform size not really proven, the amount of $ 100000 is not suitable for the criteria of this challenge. Fund allocation of the proposal also needs to be further clarified, for example $ 30000 for 3 core-teams member need to specify whether the amount is paid monthly or for the entire project process. Fund allocation for blockchain programming related work accounts for the majority of the total fund but is rather sketchy and lacks information. To solve this problem, the proposer needs to provide more detail in the project roadmap about the time to complete the blockchain-related work, the number of dev to do it AND the amount of requested budget should decrease a little bit (For exp: 80000$)", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The method to track the project progress that given by the proposer is to track the commits on github. I completely agree on this approach however in the case proposal will be funded proposal, the proposer needs to add detailed timelines so that the project progress can be tracked through it. How to measure project success? In my opinion, the proposer needs to provide a number of the users that will be achieved so that it can be verified how the project will help in the development of the Cardano community.

The proposal describes a website DecentralizeMusic.com (DM) as their live streaming platform, it allows them to create artist profiles and create NFTs tied to artists and music to bring these NFTs to exchange and buy and sell.\nIt's a good form in today's music, film, and art markets, it's not something original or a bold initiative that grabs attention. I went to the website above and there were some pictures of the artists and musicians involved and it was very sketchy.\nCurrently, DecentralizeMusic.com (DM) is not an NFT platform, we need to clarify what technical solution or NFT trading education program you are implementing? Because the NFT market is very large, you determine which specific platform you sell.\nThe proposal poses a lot of risks and challenges, items are very important for the project, in addition to the lack of funds which is a common risk of many projects, in this proposal too many other risks are posed: About web operation host, fan royalty implementation, artist split royalty implementation, Streaming royalty implementation, CNFT Minting machine, and NFT collection challenges, wallet scans for airdrops, etc. However, there is no accompanying solution or how to solve the problem when faced with these challenges. That makes me think that the proponent has not thought through this proposal, and I don't know what strengths they have here to develop the project and create a product that has an impact on the music distribution market.

Nor is there a 3-6 month short or a 6-12 month mid-term milestone mentioned, sorry for this.\nIn the budget cost: expenses are allocated to each separate item, I just noticed that I didn't see the server cost as the author worried here as well as the taxes and artist copyrights. mentioned.\nFinally, the project presented a programming team with 3 members and their tasks.
