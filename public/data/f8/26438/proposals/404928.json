This app would be a great example for possible DAO implementations and the extent of benefits availed. Both BvC and P2P done through blockchain recording leave little room for any defaults or wrong doings. The inclusion of almost all types of betting (pool,sports,prediction markers) will challenge different platforms and attract betters from different categories and hence increase the reach of the app. This will establish the the app as a fore runner in the field in an environment where the platforms struggle to create trust among users and increase user-base.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Target for this fund basically is: \"FrontEnd and BackEnd models for BvC Casino games\" , \"Player and Funds management\" and  \"Web application based on react\" and \"Wallet Integration\".

Proposer have a good intention to make it the betting more fair instead of centralized and (usually) exploit players with removing the middlemen. Proposer intends to make native betting token ALLIN for governance and ALLIN stable-coin token (pegged to fiat), since we got DJED's update will be in Q2-2022 maybe considering DJED as your stablecoin it will be great.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Proposer understand that it is important hiring people with relevance skills (about online betting), kudos to that! Budgets are clearly detailed down with reasonable explanation. Since the budgets are for 6 months work and their timeline is in 12 months working, I assume proposer will be requesting more fund in the next phase. Proposer should be able to arrange how to get the next funding, because the competition in Catalyst is getting tougher every round (especially in this Dapps & Integration challenge).

For get more convinced to the community, the proposer could provide some evidences to show inherent problems of the current betting industry and enhancing the impact of the solution, such as: cheating gambling, Bet monitoring and betting analysis practices (could see this referenced link of Interpol as https://www.interpol.int/content/download/16262/file/Good-practices-in-addressing-illegal-betting_FINAL.pdf).\n\nAs a developer, I see this proposal is scalable and has inherent growth and longevity using a unique solution, bring its competitive advantage by providing many Bet Types and Game Types, 2 types of token (ALLIN token and Stable token) for many level of risk of bettors.\n\nIt's a positive point of the proposal in mentioning challenges in the cost and complexity of regulatory compliance and licensing and gave out solutions for them.

Only one item I concern is the budget for legal because licensing and regulatory compliance will draw much more budget in relating to government.\n\nI look forward to see more information about marketing, but it is not mentioned at how the advertising campaign would be carried out to engage the community, attract user/bettors by what kind of media and its budget also.\n\nBut anyway, I still think this proposal has a rational feasibility to success with the MVP on developing.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal laid out a clear and reasonable timeline with specific GOALS, I think it's helpful for community tracking how the proposal is progressing.\n\nThe proposal's KPIs and other measures of success are auditable and available but it need reasonable effort of the community.

Additionally, in my opinion the proposer consider to improve the current website to provide regular updates for the community easily.\n\nThe proposal clearly defines what success means with this definition is clearly derived from their KPIs and there is not much things to concern.\n\nGenerally, this propsal has enough auditability for the community.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_775", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 1, "ng": 1, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10453, "q0": "This would be a very exciting project that would add some serious fun to the dApp Ecosystem.
