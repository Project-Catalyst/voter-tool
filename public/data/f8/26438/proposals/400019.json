It focuses on the probelm that the student community of the African region to efficiently and timely get Scholarship/donation unlike the traditional existing Dodation services lack efficiency, transparency and security. The proposed solution tends to attend this issue by creating a Scholarship/donation platform where students can avail their scholarship and donation at low costs and condition based secure peer to peer based donations to the students in need.This solution will definitely address the problem statement efficiently as it enables the student community members in need of funding for their further education and realise their full potential both academically and otherwise easily through the platform that the proposer team teands to develop using the funds availed. This definitely will help the students coming from low-income backgruond to get funded from philanthropists who were earlier hesitant due to opaque nature of the traditional scholarship/donation setups. But by bringing the decentralized and transparent nature of cardano blockchain into play \"DirectEd\" can potentially solve the impact of scholarships reaching the actual needing hands.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The detailing given to the action plan and the possible challenges the team might face is intriguing and is in accordance with the proposed idea.

The phase-wise milestones and the time constraint by which they are planned to achieve also appear to be sensible. They have already created a PoC on cardano testnet and planning to deploy before even this funding round terminates. They have also cosidered the legal and IP into cosideration and have looked into the challenges they might face during the implementation.

Greatly appreciated review and assessment."}, {"id": 7389, "q0": "The proposal is perfect in terms of impact. The proponents are to be congratulated because they have created a project that can generate wonderful results for both Africa and Cardano, and I will explain why. The heart of the project can be understood in the following excerpt: \u201cScholarship/Grant platform based on Ethiopia\u2019s Atala Prism, enabling safe, low-cost and conditional donations for students\u201d. This is the idea. This will certainly benefit Africa, as it will allow financial donation in the form of scholarships to students who, as the proponents themselves say, contain potential but unfortunately do not have the means by which to exploit it. These students often do not have the basic conditions to eat properly, let alone study. Donors often fail to donate out of distrust of how these funds will be used, and hosting such information on the Cardano blockchain will make it tamper-proof, transparent and fully trusted, which can easily boost the number of donations made. And once such students receive the scholarships (if they are not fulfilling their basic obligations, the rest of the money can go back to the donor, which is very positive, as it is a way of guaranteeing to those who donate that their money will not be invested in vain), they will be able to devote themselves properly to their studies; perhaps, they will be able to enter college and have a dignified professional life, and they will always be grateful to Cardano for having been a way to make all this a reality. If the project succeeds, it will certainly popularize our blockchain across the continent, it will be seen with good eyes, and this will increase the number of investors in Ada, new people will be interested in participating in the community, people from the tech area may consider studying our programming languages \u200b\u200band work on our project, the number of transactions on Cardano's blockchain will certainly grow, in short, I only see advantages here. The team seems so aware and prepared for this project that they also establish what would be the possible risks to be faced, and some solutions that could be applied to each situation, which demonstrates a lot of maturity and reality in relation to the context and the problems that can happen. on here. Anyway, I think that this project has everything to succeed and most likely will have an extremely positive impact for Africa and Cardano, perfectly meeting the objectives of the challenge. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The script is very good, we know what would happen and approximately when, in this way it is quite possible to understand the project development process. Some activities could be more detailed and the time division could be more exact, for example phase two would be from March to July. But what specifically would happen in March, in April, in May and so on? If this division were more exact, we could understand even better how this process would happen. However, his explanation is still much better than most projects, proponents are concerned with detailing various activities that would be developed in each phase. Regarding the team, I think they are extremely qualified people, based on their CVs, this can be concluded. It would be interesting for all members to have a link to their social networks, or in the case of those who are part of the universities, their profile could be attached on their websites, in short, some way of verifying the information that is said, as in the case of Johannes Haushofer, for example. It would also be better if the proponents explained who would do what in the project, this is not so clear, we don't know which people would be responsible for which activities. This is always important to know, especially in a complex project with such a large team. Regarding the budget, we have very detailed explanations on how the total amount would be divided, the parts into which it is divided are very well explained, including for example how many hours the professionals involved would work on the project. Therefore, in my view, the feasibility of the proposal is fully in line and conveys security as to what will be done, by whom and for how much investment. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability of the project is great, but it can improve a little in terms of the final results, I think. Regarding the partial results, that is, the project development process, the team would make updates available in Notion, so this part is fully auditable, it is enough that some members of the Cardano community are in charge of carrying out this monitoring periodically. This can be done weekly, every 15 days... Open Notion, browse through it until we find updates that can tell us where the stages of this project are. Regarding that, I think that's all right, that there's nothing to suggest. However, about the final result: from what I understand the funding requested now would be enough to cover phase 2 of the project, only. It would be necessary that, as was done by Notion on the carriage floor, let's say, the team also needed to establish a solid bridge with the community. This could suitably be done through video calls, I imagine, whereby some members of the Cardano community (preferably the same ones who audited the process through Notion) meet with project representatives to understand what the results have been so far. I think that there is no other way to measure the impact of this proposal, because, as it is said, it would not correspond to the project as a whole, so we can measure those commonly used statistics such as: number of Ada purchased, number of digital wallets created, NFTs brothers-in-law, etc. In this case, the final results of the project would be, in my opinion, to analyze whether the scholarships were actually awarded, if the students were making good use of them and what were the results of this investment in their academic lives (in the long term, it could even be analyzed whether they became members of the Cardano community). However, I think that this cannot be evaluated at the moment, being auditable content for when the last phase ends. Therefore, the only way I understand to understand if this phase was successful is to inform the team directly, and they do not suggest this, so it would be an improvement that I could suggest for the auditability of this proposal. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "This assessment goes into great detail on how the proposal addresses all main objectives for each criteria and clearly expresses why, while also giving reasonable advice for improvements.
