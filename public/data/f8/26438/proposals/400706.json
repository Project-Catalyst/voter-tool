Hence to uphold the reputation and integrity of the chain the applications and assets are built upon, the applications are expected to meet certain quality checks and some unified templates would assist such process. Provided there are readymade testing templates available, it would be fair and just to evaluate all applications against them to decide on the capabilities and value of each of them. The proposer tends to address this matter at multiple fronts be it unlocking the potential of varied DApps and cross-chain integrations which is only gonna become more and more important as we progress. There would be a grave need for applications to be compatible or have the necessary mechanism in place to facilitate the cross-chain integration. Also, the team is very much aware of the kind of hurdles that lie in their path and seems to have the necessary checks to overcome this effect. Hence impact-wise the proposal looks optimistic.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer presents us with a great action plan that complements the brilliant idea they have introduced. The milestones are defined clearly with monthly deliverables going all the way till December 2022 even though the funds requested by them are to support only a part of this plan. In spite of needing about $40k to complete their deliverables, they are claiming only about 25% of it, this shows the other fundings the team has been successful in raising and also a lot of support from the Chilean government. All these points are only lifting the credibility and genuineness of the team. The long-term plan of the team adds to their commitment and passion. The budget breakdown attached here shows clearly where and how the funds raised in fund8 will be used and it sure is reliable. The team introduced are all experienced people, however, a few roles are yet to be filled. But considering the solid core already in place and the amount of groundwork and preliminary already in action these gaps should be filled very easily.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "To augment the brilliant idea and the supporting plan that has sure left me in a bit of awe. The KPIs are defined keeping all the aspects of the problems the team is planning to solve. The metrics are all aligned with the campaign's requirements and are sure suitable to support their progress. The team has submitted several proposals in the previous rounds and also successfully funded in some of their ventures and hence the community can sure trust that the team would assist the audit process. The outcomes such as the open-source CARDANO/DESO template and cross-chain decentralization are clear indicators of the team's success once implemented. The milestones set at monthly intervals, the sprints during the development, and the KPIs are all crystal clear and good enough to make the audit process trouble-free and productive.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 5, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Fast and easy testing is an integral part of project development. Currently, the development of dApps on the Cardano blockchain is actually very time-consuming and complicated. The proposal suggests a simple alternative to ease this process by outsourcing various parts. \n\nIf the team succeeds in facilitating this process, it can have a catalytic effect for the Cardano ecosystem as dApps can be developed more easily. Since the team has been funded once before and was able to learn a lot from their old project, they are able to define the challenges accurately.\n\nThe proposal is very well thought out and the approach is described. If the team is able to implement the project, it could bring great benefits to the Cardano ecosystem.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team provides a complex description of the project and can back up their statements with relevant sources. The technical analysis is well thought out, the only topic I miss is security. However, this is especially important for chross-chain projects, as they are particularly easy to attack. \n\nLeaving this aspect aside, the project is extremely well set up. There is a very detailed milestone and budget plan. The team has a sophisticated strategy on how to proceed and has the necessary skills to implement the project. \n\nFurthermore, the team already has developer contacts in the DESO community and has ideas on how to deal with any issues that may arise, ensuring a robust process.\n\nThe team is also well positioned for further development and mass adoption.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The information provided (roadmap, budget and KPI) is very detailed and absolutely sufficient to evaluate the progress of the project.

It is a specific use case for DApps and Integrations. The scale of impact that a proposal will have on such a large challenge is hard to measure. DAPPS are integral to the success of cardano and the blockchain community as a whole. DAPPS provide many advantages over traditional centralized applications, including improved security, transparency, and decentralization. However, DAPPS face several challenges that must be overcome in order to achieve widespread adoption. These challenges at least in part, are addressed with this proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team of this proposal does not underestimate the challenge that they face before they can successfully implement the project. DApps can be used to process and manage data in a decentralized way. DApps can also be used to create new services and products that are not currently possible with traditional centralized applications. That is just one of many special things over all about this challenge. Integration with existing systems can be challenging, but it is possible to use DApps to connect with legacy systems in a secure and trustless manner. In short, the DApps approach is both practical and feasible for many different types of projects and organizations", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal appears to have a qualified team to understand and navigate the crazy ecosystem that is the DApp community. The team gives a lot of information on project milestones and a timeline that can be expected. They understand the importance of community involvement, and plan to report project updates to the community on a regular basis.  There is an understanding of the need for DApp integration, and plans to work with popular DApp platforms to ensure compatibility.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1959", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal aims to connect Cardano and DESO blockchains to offer Tools/UI to let actual users test early stage dApps and to provide feedback based on their experience. This integration could have been a good fit also for the cross-chain collaboration challenge but it definitely fits here as well. If it can help even 1-2 Cardano-based projects test their solutions early, the investment probably pays itself back in no time.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In the challenge setting it is mentioned that \"without a full team or completed whitepaper detailing the solution, the project ought to be considered as a research stage project and budgets should less than $10,000\". This has been taken into account and the proposal aims to cover only the Cardano-relevant parts of the budget.\n\nThe multi-talented team covers all aspects expect Cardano development (they are looking to hire a developer with this budget for four months). The team's expertise covers software, design thinking, community management, filmmaking, design thinking and business skiils. Furthermore, it is backed by an accelerator program.\n\nLet's hope they can find the developer soon enough and get to work.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Although I'm not entirely competent to judge what DESO is capable of, the plan is quite clear and the budget reasonable. Milestones and KPIs are clearly laid out and it will be fairly easy to follow the progress of the team. The most unclear part of the proposal is the vague connection with their previously funded proposal Cooperativa Local. I understand it's like the first test case but apart from that it's a bit difficult to grasp. Also, I'm not entirely sure what the crosschain token in DESO is supposed to achieve. A little bit more crystalization is needed but all in all this is a proposal with great potential ROI.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_289", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "According to the proponent, Cardano Catalyst dApps aimed at using Tokenomics, DAOs, or NFTs face barriers to mass building and testing/validation with potential users. The solution to this is open source web templates built on top of CARDANO-DESO to provide customizable Tools/User Interface projects for testing easy, cheap, fast solutions and large (https://cooperativalocal.org/). There is clarity about the problem, the solution, and how they relate to the challenge. Based on what was written in the proposal I found it to be very well thought out, the way it describes the solution and its impact on the challenge very thoroughly, the proponent also anticipated. all possible risks and measures for some of them. Based on what is presented, I think this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From March to May 2022, pending the results of Fund 8, the proposal will implement the F6 Market Launch Plan (March) and large-scale testing in Chile. Even if the F8 resource is not supported, the team's proposal would still go towards providing CARDANO-DESO compatibility. This for the team is also their enthusiasm for this project. Regarding the current project, the proposal provides an 8-month roadmap, from the expected funding date in May, with a clear timeframe and roadmap with columns for each month associated with the target instrument. This output is not only planned to feed the current fund, but also to bring processors from more places (up to fund 10). This tries to supplement my belief that the team has foresight and has a solid plan in place. Regarding the required budget of $9,250, I think in line with what the recommendation gives, the tool could be CARDANO developer cost x 4 months = $8,000 and Test and refine Delivery time First Cross-Chain: $1,250. Another good thing about the proposal is that it shows a ratio that lists other costs that are necessary during the course of the project but are not related to the required budget of this fund8. The recommended group is also very well described, we know who they are, what their experience is and what role they play in this proposal, through each member's Linkedin page, the more I strengthen my trust their own for the team. Without a doubt, with the experience and planning presented, I am confident that it is very likely that this proposal will be successfully implemented.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the proposal provides sufficient evidence to audit its progress and success. With a rich roadmap and clear milestones have a sense of when and how the work will be completed. It is impressive that a significant amount of work has been initiated, and beyond the scope of the funds being requested for this proposal. KPIs are very clear and consistent with the definition of success emerges a good understanding of the target problem. A very detailed plan is presented, the proponents are very transparent about themselves and the funds asked are very low, which clearly shows the honest motivation of the announcer.\nThis proposal is a new proposal that is not a continuation of the project previously funded by Catalyst. However, the group has also been funded with fund 6 by the Phygital Hub for Local NFTs & DAOOH project (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/370246) and has a proposed proposal at F7 with approval agreed but no funding: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/384259.
