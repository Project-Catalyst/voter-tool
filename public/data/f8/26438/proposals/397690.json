The proposer more than adequately demonstrated how the process will work to achieve the desired outcomes. In addition to the written explanation of how the contracts will work, the provider included a video recording with a demonstration of how this process could work in real life. \nThis project showcases the best features of Cardano Smart Contract in being an asset for both the employee and employer and moreover the Cardano ecosystem. With this type of implementation who needs lawyers or traditional contracts (static contracts).\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provided ample evidence with reference links of relevant skills and experience of team members and stakeholders. The budget allocation appears to be more than adequate to meet its set goals and objectives.  The budget is clearly outlined and broken down into identifiable items. The timeline seems reasonable to complete the work. Additionally, the proposer has considered challenges and risks relevant to the successful implementation of the project.\n\nThere are so many great proposals in Catalyst that give us a window into the not yet fully realized Cardano ecosystem and this is one of them.  This is one of those projects that stands out in showcasing Cardano\u2019s Smart Contract and could be a spark for the push for mass adoption. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal provides me with a clear roadmap with milestones to more than adequately measure the progress and success of the project.

You've clearly outlined bWorks' responsibilities, given illustrative examples, and highlighted features, functions, and processes. The impact on users and Cardano is also highlighted in this proposal. In particular, I am looking forward to the values \u200b\u200bthat the project brings as you described.

First, about your plan, the roadmap and the timeline being outlined very clearly. Every job and outputs are mentioned on a quarterly basis. In this section, the project's KPIs are also mentioned. The next thing is about the detailed budget, it is extremely meticulous, clear and reasonable. Of course $71000 is not a small number, but with the plans you prepare, as well as your strong and talented team members, I believe it makes perfect feasibility.
