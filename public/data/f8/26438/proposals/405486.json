This proposal effectively addresses the challenge. A suggestion for improvement would be to do further 'competitor' analysis and to explicitly state the USPs (unique selling points) of Cardahub vs other solutions. The proposal included competitor analysis, however, further analysis would be useful for the growth of their platform. For example, it would be great to see how their features compare to Fibo.Art which is another NFT Marketplace built on Cardano. Nonetheless, the Cardahub proposal definitely identifies a problem within the 'DApps and Integrations' challenge which needs to be solved and they have outlined how they attempt to do so. They did also mention that they have new features which will be launching in March and that they'd update everyone in the comments of their proposal. Hence, there is articulation on how their platform will add value to the Cardano ecosystem. For example, their 'NFT Dual listing' is an interesting concept and it would be great to see some case uses of this feature. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The experience and educational background of the Cardahub team is extremely strong. They state that half of their team have PhD's in relevant areas - they provided evidence of relevant skills and experience, namely LinkedIn urls and upon inspection, the term certainly have the know-how needed to implement the proposal. Additionally, the platform is already at an advanced stage as they have been building it for a while. Hence, the proposal is likely to be successfully implemented.  Their website is sophisticated yet user-friendly. Their immediate call-to-action buttons make the process seemingly straight-forward. As for the budget, it is broken down into identifiable items, however, some of deliverables mentioned have seemingly been done already. Perhaps the team have made some progress since they first wrote the proposal. Subsequently, they could consider re-allocating and spending more on the fund on 'Survey, research, networking, community outreach' as mentioned in their proposal so that they can get more users on board using Cardahub. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposing team made good use of visual aids in the form of videos to really illustrate their offering, this was very helpful in seeing how Cardahub works. There was so repetition in the proposal especially in the feasibility section. They listed several milestones which have been completed already but less so on new tasks which the fund would be used for. It is certainly impressive how much they have done so far - though, my suggestion would be that they re-consider the allocation of funds and create a breakdown of exactly where it would be spent for their new objectives. Overall, it is a great, well-thought out proposal and it is clear that the team has worked hard to create a marketplace which is useful for the future of CNFTs. It may be that they need to invest more in social media to get potential users to register on Cardahub, start creating and minting NFTs. Also, to encourage engagement in their community (stimulated by social media and subsequent campaigns) - this can include blog posts to build their community and generally more crypto community content (tutorials etc). At this stage of their proposal, this may be where the greatest priority should be held as a marketplace needs users. I'm excited to see how Cardahub grows!

There is no further explanation about how this will be implemented, its technical features, or its potential impact on the CNFT space.

I would suggest that the proposer reassess the longer-term intent of this project and provide a more detailed vision of what they plan to do and a more detailed account of how they plan to do it.

An additional value-add that distinguishes this project from other NFT projects that already exist within the ecosystem is the ability to create a dual listing not only on this site, (cardahub.io), but also on another NFT marketplace via a credit token (see the excerpt below copied verbatim from the proposal).\n\n*Dual Listing : Dual Listing is Cardahub's unique feature that you can't find anywhere in any NFT marketplace out there. Dual Listing allows you to put your NFT on sale on our marketplace, but at the same time you receive an credit token representing that NFT. And you can put the credit token on another market for sale at the same time. That means Your NFT gets listed on two marketplaces at the same time, thus doubling the chance it will get sold.\n\nFurther, the requested budgetary amount of $33,600 falls within the scope of an intermediate project, meeting the following conditions of the challenge/campaign brief:\n\n*For smaller teams (4-5 people) with proven competence, relevant experience and technical skills with sketches/whitepaper detailing how they would go about to launch their proposal, the budgets would typically be in the range $40,000-$80,000.\n\nGiven the already functioning and attractive website that already has traffic in terms of collections and individual NFT's listed, with some minimal data at bottom of the homepage of recently sold items, it is clear that the project is already drawing a user base to the Cardano ecosystem. And the videos were very helpful in experiencing the ease of use of the project. That being said, I would like to know more about the dual listing function and how it works in order to properly assess whether or not it is viable (since, though Cardano in itself is very collaborative, I can't see another marketplace accepting a credit token from cardahub.io unless there is some form of compensation attached). Also, though I have no doubt in the capabilities and skills of this All-Star caliber team that are potentially overqualified to deliver on this project (I'll address further in the feasibility section), I do ask the team to think more deeply about their unique value proposition and how to distinguish cardahub.io from its direct competitors. I myself might lean into thinking about the possibilities of adding functionality (and what would those functionalities be?) to the NFT process of creating and minting NFT's. With such a highly intelligent and accomplished team, I have no doubt that they could come up with innumerable possibilities. And if they can attach functionality (potentially through a partnership with an already existing dex for example), it would be a truly distinctive advantage.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This project, which is already functioning as of January 1st, 2022, is applying for funding to complete its explicit and detailed roadmap, including forming Strategic partnerships, NFT Browsing and Ranking, creating Developer API Access, enhancing their NFT Collections, implementing NFT Auction and NFT Staking, an NFT Mystery Box, and Marketing Campaign. The budget asks to sustain 3-6 people for 3 months time who will complete the smart contract, UI and backend, and research, networking and community outreach to bring more visibility to the project.\n\nWith the impeccable credentials of the team members that show a wide range of the skills and abilities needed to implement the project, I feel very strongly that this proposal meets the following standards of feasibility:\n\n*The proposer provides evidence (references, links, etc.) of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal.\n*The proposer knows, in an identifiable manner, the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal.\n*The budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items. \n*The budget is reasonable to achieve the set goals.\n*The proposal offers a realistic timetable to complete the work.\n*The proposal provides a sensible and conductible plan for implementation that shows not only what is being done but also how.\n*The plan describes the resources necessary to implement the proposal.\n*The proposer has considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation.\n\nHowever, the only two caveats I have are that the proposal does not fully explain its current distinctive feature of dual listing and how the credit token will function, and the proposal hints at a valuable feature that is not explicitated in the proposal itself (see the language from the proposal itself, copied below).\n\n*An extremely hot Feature is coming soon on March 2022. To the best of our knowledge, Cardahub is the very first platform in the whole CNFT Space to have this unique feature, and is the only one that could provide this offer. (we'll update in comment below when it's ready. Stay tuned! )\n\nTherefore, I cannot abide that the proposal has accomplished the following important aspect of feasibility:\n\n*The proposal clearly explains technical aspects like architecture, language and technologies if they are crucial for implementation.\n\nThat being said, I reiterate that there is no doubt in my mind that, after examining this proposal and its links thoroughly, it will be fully implemented and is extremely feasible.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal is clear and sufficiently audit-able. The roadmap is clear and provides distinct milestones and a time horizon for achievement, and gives ample evidence of past milestones achieved, which are verified by using the already existing website to create individual NFT's or collections. This adds confidence to an assessment that future as yet unaccomplished tasks will be accomplished in the time stated.\n\nAlso clear is the description of the problem of this challenge, which is addressed by proposing to enhance an already existing NFT marketplace. I hope the proposers can wisely implement the budget to gain traction in the already/soon-to-be-crowded NFT space via community outreach and marketing, but it is clear that they have provided a valuable option for a creator or buyer searching for an NFT marketplace.\n\nThe only other thing I would add is that I'd like to see more detailed and specific metrics/KPI's for each task in the roadmap. For example, the NFT Auction - what would make this successful in the team's eyes? But I do understand that it would make an already long an detailed proposal much more unwieldy and potentially unreadable. So I understand the exclusion of such minutiae, but this should suffice as a note to the team to be aware of the success of each component on a granular level, if need be, so that they know whether a particular component is adding to the ease and understanding and success of the user or not.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_452", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10214, "q0": "The proposal addresses the challenge correctly.

There could easily be other measures of success in meeting deadlines, amount of users, feedback metrics, and marketing (which is extremely overlooked in this proposal). I think what this proposal comes down to is an incredibly talented and capable team, with a \"messy\" proposal. If it weren't \"messy,\" I might have some questions regarding marketability, the potential for success, and lack of perceived uniqueness.

This proposal benefits greatly from its \"show rather than tell\" approach, with videos walking the user through minting, listing, and buying processes, all of which appear to be well-thought-out and well into development. With a conservative approach emphasizing simplicity and UI, a fully implemented Cardahub could serve as a great entry point into the Cardano ecosystem for NFT creators and enthusiasts. The experienced team looks to be more than a match for the project, which is already well underway. \n\nThe proposal correctly notes that Cardahub will be facing stiff competition within its niche, particularly in the form of CNFT.io. To this end, Cardahub hangs its hat on proprietary smart contracts over platforms that are using open-source code, citing security risks for the latter. I'm not sure the proposal, as written, fully makes its case here. It may be helpful to elaborate on the example it alludes to, as well as head off counter-arguments in favor of open-source contracts.
