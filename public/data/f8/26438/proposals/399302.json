It is said that decentralized identities would be used, but how? How would Atala Prism enter this project? It is mentioned briefly that payment tokens would be generated, would be minted at Cardano, right? And these CO2 offset tokens, how would that work? Why would this all be classified as a DAO? Unfortunately, I think the authors fail to explain clearly and clearly why Dapp would be beneficial to our blockchain. They explain the problem situation and their proposed solutions very well, but dedicate little space in the impact to explain about the technological parts referring to Cardano would be used and developed. So as far as impact is concerned, I don't think we're clear on whether the challenge's objectives would actually be met.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "This topic is more or less, some points are strong but others need to improve a lot. Starting with the script, this part is very superficial. The proponents divide the total time into 3, 6, and 12 month intervals, and explain very superficially what would happen in each of these intervals. It would have been far more appropriate if the division had been monthly, and more details had been attached about each of the activities. The money requested is well explained. The various parts that make up the whole are detailed, although these could also be further broken down (for example, how would the marketing be done?), it is possible to have a good understanding of how the budget would be used. Regarding the team, I like this part, the names and a brief resume of each professional involved are presented. Trust in them is conveyed as they are active people in the Cardano community. They say the Wada group would also participate - but other people besides these? Who, and doing what? Finally, I think the topic is not bad, but still not ideal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Success would be measured by the number of Dapp users and also through a fully redacted specification document + a full white paper for future implementation + a fully functional MVP. Regarding these three things: how often would they be updated once they were created and how would the Cardano community be aware of what was new, how would they be updated with changes? I also think it's important that we monitor the work behind these partial results, in addition to the targets themselves. Talking about success, the proponents state what success would be for a period of 3, 6 and 12 months, but they focus too much on Dapp and not the repercussions of this for Cardano. How can we be sure that the specific objectives of the challenge are being met? How can we measure, quantitatively and qualitatively, the consequences for our blockchain? In my view, this is essential and is absent from the auditability of this proposal. Therefore, I believe that overall the topic should be reviewed and improved.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10944, "q0": "This proposal he's trying to solve the problem of inefficiency in the car end transportation business in Cameroon.

I think that it is very useful to the community and should help make the transportation  in Cameroon much more efficient. For that reason this proposal  is in the scope of this challenge. I think that this proposal could also  fit the grow Africa grow cardano challenge. Altogether the proponents  have done a great job explaining the goal of this project.

I have  visited the LinkedIn profile of the team members, and I have to say that they are pretty knowledgeable.

There is a big difference between an app and a dapp. A dapp is built with decentralization and blockchain integration in mind. Most existing dapps do not need to use blockchain for their use, using blockchain increases cost and friction for users. This proposal does not adequately articulate the reasons for developing this dapp using blockchain technology. The only mention that allows creating an association between the app and the blockchain would be the use of a reputation system through Atala Prism, so it would be important for the proposal to describe this component in more detail, as well as the purpose of the aforementioned DAO, so that it is possible to understand how the blockchain will be used in the app.\n\nThe intention to create a model with native assets for payments was mentioned, but the dapp will not use crypto transactions at this time(MVP version).\n\nThe proposal includes some metrics, but the only target indicator included in the proposal (KPI) was 100s of users signing up and engaging in this DAO in 12 months. It would be important to establish KPIs/indicators with complementary targets to make it easier to identify the potential of the proposal, because only with the KPI provided we only know which users will sign up, there are no KPIs that allow us to understand the use of the dapp itself.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team has relevant experience in software development, including Haskell, but there is no mention if any member of the team has experience with Plutus.
