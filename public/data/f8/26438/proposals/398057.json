Making it easier to integrate apps and websites to the Cardano ecosystem will surely attract more developers and consequently more users to Cardano. However, there is lack of information regarding what the final product should be like, so there is no way to tell if it will be truly impactful for the community. Maybe you could include in your proposal how a developer should expect to use your product and which features it will include. Also, in order to better align the metrics with the Challenge, you could include the number of developers using this product, the number of Apps created using this product and the number of users brought by those Apps.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Judging by the stated relevant experience, I think it's very likely that the proposal will be successfully implemented. The proposer says that he has already developed for several other blockchains. I only missed some reference or link that could support that statement, it would be far more appealing if we could see some of your previous works.\nThere is a list of 3 members required to fill the team. I agree that 3 high skilled members in those positions could achieve said goals. Maybe you could specify which various Frontend frameworks would be needed to execute the idea.\nThe budget is basically used to pay for the team members' time. It seems very reasonable considering the objectives and potential impact.\nThe timeline is split between the desired languages for support, but I think it could be broken down into smaller tasks. We have to make sure that it will be time to developing and homologation. Considering the testing phase, this schedule could be a bit tight.\nThe proposer identifies that keeping the dependencies up to date should be a challenge, but does not provide a way he could mitigate it.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As said in the previous criteria, the roadmap could be broken down into smaller tasks and the metrics could include the number of developers using this product, the number of Apps created using this product and the number of users brought by those Apps.\nThe definition of success is somewhat ambitious when it says that no new users will be worrying about integration because more complex projects could fall outside the scope of this product. Instead, it could be measured by the number of Apps created with it, the increase in number of Apps created on some period or the percentage of Apps created using this product.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_951", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 367, "q0": "In fact, with the growth of Cardano and the popularity of its technologies, more and more people will be interested in ways to add their applications to ecosystem functionality. In this way, the creation of a package that facilitates the implementation of these functionalities is an idea that in fact fits the goals of the challenge in question. However, we see that not much information has been given that shows us that this proposal will actually have a positive impact. When answering the question about how the proposed solution will address the challenge, we only see an indication that the proposal will be included in the project gallery and that a post will be made. we realized that only these actions do not bring so much visibility to the application, so that other people also get to know it. The explanation of the risks that can be found during the project is also not very elucidative, some questions arise such as: what could cause the dependencies not to be up to date and what actions could be taken to mitigate this risk?\n\nThe amount being requested to carry out the project is not very suitable for an application of this type, taking into account the information described so far, we are in doubt whether the $35,000 will be used in the best way to bring the proposal to life.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Regarding the feasibility plan, we also found a lack of more detailed information about the steps that must be taken to achieve the objective. For example, we noticed that the period of time destined to support each language in the project was described, but from the way this information was passed, we do not know if these periods of work will happen concurrently one after the other. Likewise, from the description of the professionals that will be needed in the project, we do not know if the frontend and backend teams (to which 85% of the budget is allocated) will be formed by only one professional each, or how many hours per week they will work , to have the information of the cost per hour. We were also unable to find the curriculum of the author of the proposal.\n\nAnother point worth mentioning is that it would be interesting to plan a prototype to be validated during development. This prototype could, for example, make the implementation of just some simpler functionalities initially, it could also be partnered with some sites to validate the product and in return offer a considerable discount for the use of the final version. In general terms, we realized that a little more specificity was needed about the feasibility plan.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Regarding the way chosen to monitor the progress and development of the project, we noticed that it is very general, without providing clearer means for the process to be audited. In fact, the more languages and frameworks are compatible, the greater the scope of the project, but it would be interesting if there was an indication here, for example, of a project management tool to monitor development, such as Jira. It would also be nice if sprints were defined, with their duration times indicated, and the results of these were periodically shown to the public.\n\nRegarding the perception of project success, it seems interesting that some goals were numerically defined and verified, such as:\n\nAn expected number of users of the application in the first 6 months of its release\n\nThe average revenue this launch earned\n\nHow many companies got to know Cardano through this application", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 5, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2017, "q0": "I would agree that a Cardano app could be useful in the ecosystem.
