However, people don't know how to use/exercise them to their advantage", "f6_no_assessments": 4, "f6_rating": 4.916666666666667, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"q0": "All the functional data privacy laws and consumer arbitration methods are no use if the consumer downs't knwo about it or how to use them.  First level integration of this education already exists as functionality in the Profila app, along with the ability to send out the basic DSR (data sbuject rights) forms that businesses must comply with.  This proposal is for the design of a smart contract that basically ties up the whole legal side of the DSR compliance transaction.  The idea is that when you send in a DSR request to a company, they must comply within a certain amount of time, and if they fail to do so, proof of that must be on record and presented in your defense for legal action (this all assumes that you believe a company is violating your DSRs).  With the creation of the smart contract (and the proposer lists other options besides smart contracts, but this is by far the best option and hopefully the one they go with) this whole process of sending the DSR form, timing out the request, and receiving and logging the compliance reply will be containerized on the blockchain, where it is available for proving the validity of your claim.  Beyond just creating a solid legal basis for any claim that a company has violated your privacy, this is all a part of the wider Profila philosophy of putting you in control of your privacy:  education, tools, empowerment.  This in turn could have a radical influence on business culture as consumers with actual knowledge and ability to follow through on the knowledge are able to take them to task for the games they play with receipt of DSRs and fudging of the compliance windows, or even, among the worst practices, assessing costs to the consumer for the execution of DSR requests, which are supposed to be absolutely free in every jursidiction I am aware of that requires them.  These are the tools that start getting the business--consumer relationship back on equal footing, where it belongs, and where honest commercial agents have wanted it all along.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The timeline is a bit boilerplate, but it can be cross-referenced to the body of the impact field to yield decent knowledge about what they are developing here and what the architecture is that the integration is going in to (and it helps a lot to go to their website and look at their overall roadmap).  The team keeps building out more and more with each fund, and you can see how areas like marketing are tightening up.  The tech team has some sprawl and some unknowns in it, but having read all their proposals for this fund, I believe that after this funding round, the ZKP and Atala pressure alongside things like this smart contract development is going to require their tech stack to draw a lot of threads together as they roll out the beta test with their multinational (Cisco?  I wonder...).  In the meantime I appreciate that they are letting some of that hierarchy be emergent (at least, that is how it looks to me).  Especially with Atala, they won't gain much with a top down imposition of how these pieces are meant to play together (and that is without even considering optimizing for ZK rollups and Hydra, which are coming soon). This project (the smart contract plus a few optimizations to UI/UX and scaling) is only on a 6 month timeline, but they are framing that within a larger 12 month timeline that sees the rollout of the platform for onboarding its first beta cohort with a single Brand.  The budget is clearly broken down by how many days they require for each project role and what rates.  I saw no errors and no glaring omissions or incongruent amounts (and I am assuming their blockchain developer means the Plutus developer for the smart contract, as it is the first line item).", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They divide their community auditing protocols into two categories (and both categories are public).  The first is the \"official\" channels like the biweekly coordinator calls and monthly progress reports, and the second is their more publicly facing protocols (which are more useful to the community at large, IMO), such as their GitHub updates, Biweekly newsletter and monthly TownHall breakout rooms.  The latter, especially, with the AMA format is a great way to connect with the team and explore some of the motivations and intricacies of the platform.  They helpfully include the milestones broken up through the early stages weekly, and then as the more emergent design requirements go into the workflow, more broad strokes.  It is expected that those times, especially the 3-6 month section will be stretched out to weekly milestones for the project as the early design work yields results.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 4, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This team understands what it will take to let the users have control over their data and their identity. Most users on the blockchain don't understand how privacy works or even why it is important. Creating the Profila app gives these users the ability to have control over their privacy. Whether they want it to be public or private. This should increase the amount of discussion on Cardano projects and strengthen the community as a whole. They address the potential risks and give a layout that will help them to mitigate these risks.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team seems to be very understanding of what they are trying to accomplish, and they have to skills to carry out what they are set to do. They have provided a great amount of information in regards to the team and the experience of those members. They have created a clear plan/roadmap that will be easy to implement due to the teams skills. I like that they included a healthy amount of information on each team member. Having a versatile team with lots of different areas of expertise will also be something extremely important that can take this proposal to the next level. For this reason, I strongly agree with this point. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The information provided has exceeded my expectations. I think that this is a great cause and they have provided a very detailed proposal with all the necessary information. The roadmap is very impressive. It describes in detail the timeframe of completing these steps and how long it will take.

This is a dapp that has been funded in fund 5, 6 and 7. Since this is a pretty ambitious project, I think that they need a lot of money for development. The privacy of the users is really important on the internet. With this dapp, users should be able to give specific permissions to protocols and they should be able to earn from brands as well. I feel like this is a great dapp to  have in the incardano network. That said, this proposal is in the scope of this challenge and its value to the cardano ecosystem is clear. For all these reasons, I give this proposal a high rating for its impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Since this is a work in progress, I believe in the successful implementation of this proposal. One big part of a proposal is the team behind it.  When proposers can show the team needed to complete the project and the actual team members, it\u2019s a good sign of a potentially good project. I have counted 12 high profile team members and links to their linkedin profiles. The proposer has done a good job in this area. Another important part of a proposal is the budget, which the proposers have broken into identifiable items. Since I\u2019m a digital marketer and I\u2019m familiar with developers salaries, I think that the budget is reasonable for the amount of work to be done. Altogether, the proposers have done a great job building confidence in the feasibility of this project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Based on the amount of information given by the proposers, I\u2019m confident in the auditability of this proposal. One good way to judge the auditability of a project is to analyze the roadmap. In this proposal, the proposers have provided a roadmap with milestones for up to 6 months. They have precise milestones which I recommend to all proposers. Furthermore, a proposal can\u2019t be auditable if it doesn\u2019t provide clear metrics and strong KPIs that should make it easy for tracking the progress of the proposal. In that regard, the proposers have also done a good job by promising weekly updates on the repository and monthly reports of the evolution of the project.

The proposal targets the \u201cuser adoption in 2022\u201d metrics which is one of the most critical metrics when it comes to these challenge settings. The app this team (which is currently in beta phase) is building will allow people to manage their data access rights, which is currently misused by many organizations on the internet. \n\nThe evolution of the internet and incoming tech giants (e.g. google/meta/amazon) has helped technology evolve faster than we imagined, and privacy and data access rights is one of the biggest concerns/issues that users face in everyday life. Profila app will allow users to have control on their data at one place and manage their digital data such as which company I have subscribed to on my email. \n\nThe proposal goes in depth of detailing out the legal rights consumers have but a lack of understanding and clarity of these rights  is often misused by the organizations. This proposal, if implemented successfully will both allow consumers to be in control and be more aware of their rights.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I strongly agree that this team has the right experience and a very well detailed plan that will allow this plan to be implemented successfully. The team behind this proposal is public, and has a good mix of work experience as can be seen through the linkedin profile links. This is one of those proposals which requires not only technical expertise but also the legal framework experience, and the team has really great experience in that area as well.\n\nThe budget breakdown of total $79500 is provided for a 6 month development project. This budget is further well split into how many days of work is required in which business unit (e.g. development, design, legal, operational work) of the implementation phase. As a senior developer myself who works quite close to Switzerland, the developer rates are justified. \n\nThe team has also given good details on what happens if this budget is not enough for the implementation, in which case they are anyways not dependent totally on catalyst funding and planning to use their token sale to achieve their budget lapses, if any.\n\nThe risks/challenges are described well in detail, both of which are more to be fixed as Cardano keeps scaling this year and also more layer 2 solutions building up. What I find, however, interesting is the privacy risk on blockchain, and the proposer has offered that they will continue to do research on this topic and find a work around as part of this proposal implementation. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal team proposes to keep the community updated with weekly, biweekly, and monthly updates. Additionally, periodical AMAs will be done  by the Profila founders throughout the implementation phase. The methodologies used for project tracking are through different means, such as Github updates, weekly catalyst townhall updates, newsletter, and monthly KPIs.\n\nAdditionally, the metrics/KPIs against which the success will be measured is clearly defined. The functionalities developed during this proposal implementation will be used in the app, which is being tested during next 6 months.The success metrics provided for 3-6-12 months will be a good data points against which the community will have the ability to see the long term progress in addition to the biweekly or monthly updates.
