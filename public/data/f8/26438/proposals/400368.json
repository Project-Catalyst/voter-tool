I think it makes a big impact on the ecosystem IF they can attract enough ADA to the DAO. This part is not explained. The usage is a key factor in the success of this project (especially this project) so I am looking for metrics on user interest, reputable partnerships, and an estimate of how much ADA they will be able to secure. Another potentially concerning factor (related to the previous factors) is how this would impact the user's yield. I expect the prospective parameter change might improve the ability for this DAO to be able to provide a competitive yield. I think this might make a difference in how many users (thereby how much ADA) will come to this Dapp. I expect this proposal to get a positive vote again but I'd like to see more info on this if something similar happens this round. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This is a beautifully outlined roadmap and I have no concerns about the possibility of this project failing because of the experience/talent of the developers. The roadmap timeline looks entirely reasonable. The only 2 things I would like to see different is that I would like the marketing tasks to be included in the timeline. I want to see what the marketing strategy is and how it is executed over the given period of time. For example, scheduling Twitter space updates or discord calls. I would also like to see reputable partnerships established to provide greater credibility for the success of this project. That could be an ADA whale that has committed to staking (maybe IOHK) or a top project that wants to collaborate. There's a lot of time between now and completion, and I think further advancement can be done that's not just product development. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I think it's difficult to quantify measurable metrics in this proposal. They do aim for 5b ADA delegated and 1000 stake pools, which is an amazing long-term goal. However, I wanna know what some of the more short-term goals are before this goal is hit. At what point do they want to hit 2.5b ADA and 500 stake pools? I think establishing a timeframe for this goal would help motivate the active pursuit of the goal.

This is a big project that will add a lot of value to the Cardano Community, will make it very easy for people to delegate their Cardano and be motivated to do so and benefit a lot of community and network members that are trying to do good by providing their services to the network and deserve to be seen.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This project is currently being developed by the members of this team regardless of funding, which gives a lot to say about their commitment to the Cardano Community, their ability, knowledge and effectiveness. THey are all members of the Cardano community with the right qualifications and the right motivation to add value to the community. Regarding the proposal itself, it has been put in a concise, descriptive and auditable way which I'm sure takes a lot of effort. It is easy to understand, raises clear points and explains everything both Catalyst and us the public need to know about how they will make their project a reality. Budget seems reasonable given the amount of work they seem to have already put in and what is yet to get done and they give a clear description of where each dollar will go towards and why, which is very important to know that the money is being used for the right purposes. Regarding timeline, clear milestones have been set in the proposal that can be easily monitored by Catalyst if this project gets funded and the timelines for execution seems realistic. In summary, this is a project that I think a lot of stake pool operators are really looking forward to seeing it become a reality as it will bring a lot of good to the Cardano community and more decentralisation which is a crucial thing for the network. In conclusion, this project seems completely doable given it is already in the works, with some support form Catalyst being the cherry on top which can help this team finish executing the project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "s mentioned above, the proposal and its timeline have been put together very well in a very clear manner, making this project easy to audit and keep track of and follow the progress of it. complete proposal with a game changer idea that understands their challenges and are looking actively for solutions to them.

The proposal provides a solution through a staking DAO. It is well aligned with the challenge question, and I believe this can have a very significant impact on stake distribution and decentralization of the cardano network. When stake is centralized among a small number of multi-pool operators, then over time ada and it's associated voting power is also concentrated among a small number of operators. This is a widely held concern about the design of Cardano, and therefore this proposal that will allow for the spreading out of delegation, and increasing the # of successful small stake pools, will help with mass adoption. This can help to shift the conception and the concern from new users that Cardano is giving an unfair advantage and voting power to wealthy investors and stake pool operators.

They are also both Plutus pioneer graduates, one is a UI/UX designer and the other a software developer. They have already created a website, youtube videos, and appear to have a firm grasp of the tasks required to implement this proposal successfully. The budget is broken down with a clear timeline. I have given 4 out of 5 stars because while I think they will be successful with this proposal, I think their target of 5Bn+ ADA for the community, delegating to over 1000 Stake Pools, is a little over ambitious and may not be feasible within the provided timeline.

During development, it's not clear how the Community will audit the progress and development, as they only plan to open source their work after it is completed. It will be easy to audit this project if it is successful and meets all the given targets, and becomes an open source DAO. However if it falls behind on the delivery schedule, it will not be so clear to the community what is happening with the development and the funds provided.

It\u2019s a fact that it\u2019s not easy to attract delegators when you are a small pools. However, to help decentralize the network and increase its security, we need that the ada be staked across as many pools as possible. I think that the proposers have done a great job explaining the project and the benefits that this will bring to the network. Nevertheless, I know that the vast majority of people will delegate only if they are incentivised in some ways. I recommend to the proposers to emphasize the reasons that should get people to delegate in these pools.
