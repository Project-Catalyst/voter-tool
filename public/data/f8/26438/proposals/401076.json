The overall concept of a Cardano based platform to bring employers and workers together is great however does not provide enough detail to convince me they will be capable of succeeding in such an ambitious endeavor. It would be helpful for the proposer to breakdown the solution into smaller projects all building upon one another.  This would allow more detail and provide more confidence.  Another suggestion to the proposer is do a spell and grammar check.  In my prior experience reviewing proposals most reviewers would review negatively a poorly written proposal.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer has provided several milestones with high level detail within each milestone however the large scope of this project calls into question if the milestones are realistic.  The proposer provides a breakdown of staff cost, development time and costs.  My experience with offshoring development cost make me believe the proposer can hire the needed staff at the substantially lower cost. However, I am not convinced the team has adequately scoped the project and am concerned they have overreached on an audacious project, while a great idea, and will not be able to complete.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposer has provided high level KPIs related to each milestone however the proposal lacks the specific details you expect to track success.  The proposer indicating success looks like thousands of people on the platform is aspirational and not a measurable plan.  I would have preferred to see something along the lines of release of demo with testing from 2-4 employers, recruiters, etc and a community of job seekers, etc.  The proposer would benefit from having users ready to begin testing the platform rather \u201cbuild it and they will come\u201d.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1807", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal fits the challenge idea and can be very impactful for the current community of Cardano and also is a attractive way to make other people come to Cardano universe. There are a lot of people that works as freelancers but don\u00b4t make the amount of money that they deserve because of the dificult of finding a job or because of the platforms fees. This proposal is a great and useful way to solve this problem and also facilitate to employers to find good talents to work.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers explained well the details about the members that will be part of the project. Each one of the professionals that will work on the proposal is indispensable because of the nature of the activity of building a digital product (platform).

The milestones presented helps us CA's to understand the proposal feasibility as possible and plausible because it's well explained and shows the test periods in each fase of the project. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal milestones are well explained and make sense due to the kind of project we're dealing with. Also the problem and the solution were well explained. Despite this, the proposers mencioned that they used the metric of amount of users on platform, but I missed numbers to demarcate the goal. It's easier to audit the proposal success if we have numbers in the goals, for example: in the first month the platform will have a thousand of users.

It is very creative and will help people in the blockchain community to find a job, especially with freelancers, the normal job site does not emphasize the Blockchain job and they find it hard to find one that also does not underestimate their ability. I totally agree with this idea.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal has a clear roadmap with the 4 milestones, each milestone has its detailed activities to build up the proposal in the 8 months period. They also advertise their project on other platforms like Tiktok, Facebook to gain more reputation.

The budget is broken down in detail and very careful consideration, they ask for 78,3k for the period of 8 months to operate the app is pretty reasonable, it might need more maintenance fee after that but this will be considered after they successfully operated. This proposal is very well written and calculated and I believe it can be implemented successfully. I do not have many more ideas to share, great team and good luck.  ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "They provided a Github link to track the team activities, as the final product is the app so it will take time for them to build the app and key metrics and success elements are all mentioned. Although there is no specific number is written but their first job is to successfully build the app and then attract people. Therefore I find the key metrics are reasonable. I hope this project can be successfully built and bring more value to the Cardano community by helping proposers or corporations to find their talents best fit for the job.

' resources to ensure successful acquisition and implementation of many projects, it would be great to have this proposal developed on top of Cardano. specifically, the proponent stated that the website will connect to the Freelancer wallet and the employer's wallet through the Yoroi Wallet Extension to create profile information and add personal skills. Through profiles and search commands, the system will find related jobs posted fr om employers and connect via chatbox / email. After the two sides shake hands. Freelancer will send an invoice to the employer and wait to receive the ADA from the employer and send it to his wallet and the two parties will send feedback to each other. There is a point where the proponent should add more clarity to the automatic conditions for the execution of these smart contracts. I am impressed with the platform that can run sustainably with 0% service fee. The proponent also states some risks and solutions, among which the risk of occurrence of personal conflicts of interest (for example, not paying or reluctantly sabotaging by sending false feedback to cause controversy). This needs to be analyzed for smart contract changes or flagging warnings for non-compliant parties, which can be endless without clear rules.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponent provides the roadmap and implementation time of the contents on a monthly basis for each specific period.
