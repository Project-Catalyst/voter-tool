At first it seems to be the idea that it's \"difficult for newcomers to buy crypto\" which is a decent problem statement, but then it's not clear what the advantage would be of this solution over relatively simple apps like coinbase, etc. \n\nThe most interesting bit (I think) is rather buried in the middle of the impact section, and it is given one line: \"Every time your basket is copied, you earn royalties\" -- now that is unique and interesting! \n\nTwo elements are especially troubling for impact: \n\n1) There is no mention of Cardano or ADA in the entire proposal. The demo video fills a whole basket with Cryptos and Cardano is not one! I don't doubt that Cardano would be one of the options that an investor COULD put in their basket, but in terms of specific impact for the Cardano ecosystem, that does not appear to be in the purview of this proposal.\n\n2) In the risks section, they raise some considerable risks, but no mention is given to how confident they feel in mitigating or overcoming those risks. High marks are reserved for those who are aware of their risks AND demonstrably able to surmount them.\n\nFor a better score, I would primarily be looking for a value proposition for Cardano specifically.

How many people are they gonna target to educate? etc. The team only provides a very simple percentage of how they will use the budget without giving broken-down information on each expenditure. Too much information for the budget is not provided, for example, the proposal stated support team for the core developers cost 70% of the budget, how much of those money goes to the paid developer? Is there any server cost? Is there any hosting cost? or buying a domain name? Since many expenditures compromise engineering, it needs to be written in great detail. The same goes for the marketing, branding, and content creation that need to elaborate more. The proposal only stated the roles need for the team without giving further information on the background, relevant skills, and experience of the team member. They also don't give a LinkedIn profile/GitHub account and thus made the community hard to verify their abilities.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal stated they will use scrum methodology for the project development, also the open scrum board will be made public on the JIRA tool hence making the community easily track the project development progress.

These two proposals (and its assessments) should be merged into one, I have voiced this in the CA telegram channel. Until this merge is complete, I will post the same assessment in both of these two identical proposals.\nProposal 1: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/397957 \nProposal 2: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398556 ]\n\nBasketo is trying to help investors to build and manage their crypto portfolio, they cleverly call a set of currencies for a basket. It allows people to build baskets and let other people use their baskets to earn royalties on. This is enhanced by minting each basket as NFT's and they claim that you can view your positions in 360\u00b0. This stood out as a bit unclear for me as a reader and would like to have this clarified. It seems like a fun gimmick more than an necessity, but overall, the concept is fun and engaging. However, some usual questions come up when dealing with these topics and the authors have acknowledged them to a degree. Security being the primary aspect that is unclear in the proposal. In order for the project to be impactful it has to be functional and secure, this is not addressed fully in the proposals current state. \nAll in all, the proposal is well aligned with the challenge setting and it is impactful, there are some things that have to be cleared up which leads to a resulting score of 4 stars in terms of impact.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The detailed plan is laid out quiet sparsely given the complexity and unknown variables in the proposal. It does not mention the building of the secure wallet and no QA or security aspects are mentioned either. It is hard to assess if the team has the required knowledge to complete the development and implementation of their project. Also, there is no way to further verify their experience which makes the team less credible. To summarize, there are many unknown factors for being such a large project, it is not possible to deem the project feasible. The total score will be 2 stars (1 +1 for providing a good foundation of plan/milestones/budget).", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The project will have a public scrum board as well as published reports enabling the community to audit the progress of the project, this is great in terms of auditability.

There are a few projects doing this(Bishares & Index Coop are a few that comes to mind) so the idea is tested and there is a demand for it. Having Cardano's version of an index fund protocol would be good for the ecosystem. The idea of creating your own basket also reminds me of Balancer and BeethovenX. In short, it's a great idea and will bring a lot of versatility and strategies into Cardano's DeFi. I am curious how the royalties would work out and whether each basket would be personally owned by the user or be a pool anyone can enter in.

Will this allow me to create a basket of tokens that generate yield, and stake them for passive returns? There is also insufficient information on the team working on Basketo.
