The idea in question is about creating a platform (from what I understand, it would be a mobile application), called \u201cArtverse\u201d. In short, it would be like an interaction between digital wallets, that is, users could see the NFTs that others have, interacting through likes, comments and shares (that is, web features2); and in the future, when the project evolves, some web3 functions will also be available, such as the integration of a Game Fi system. I found something very interesting because it is very geared towards arts and interaction between users, like social media itself, but I have some observations to make. First, would the amount of Ada (or other cryptocurrencies) in these wallets be hidden? Because I don't think it's interesting for this information to be shared, users probably wouldn't want that either. Second question: how would people find out about this new social network? I think that for a social network to become relevant, it needs to be very popular, many users interacting with each other and generating engagement; the issue of marketing in my opinion is always essential for the success of any project, but in relation to this one, it is even more so, so I wish the proponents had focused on that since the impact. Another thing, I think it would be interesting for proposers to conceptualize what a Game Fi system is, because not all CAs/proposal readers may be familiar with this concept. I personally don't know so clearly what this is, so I'd better understand what will be implemented from the one if the proponents had attached that explanation. It would be interesting for them to exemplify this with projects that are already being promoted today. I found it very positive that they attached a small video, very playful, that talks about the project, explaining in a direct and simple way what would be done. It's also great that they detail very well how Dapp would evolve according to the phases, punctuating the changes that would be generated, this makes us understand the evolution of the platform well. In summary, I liked the project, I think it is well aligned with the challenge because if this social network bursts, it can organically bring new members to Cardano, who can become interested in the functioning of our ecosystem and get involved with other technologies pertinent to our blockchain. Therefore, I will give it 4 stars, if some doubts that I explained were resolved, the note would have been the maximum. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The attached schedule is satisfactory, although it could have been more detailed. We know that phase zero would start after funding and end at the end of the second quarter of this year or the beginning of the third quarter. We also know which activities will be developed and how many weeks they would last, approximately. I found the temporal notion to be very well established, however, the detailing in relation to some activities themselves could be more in-depth. For example, in \u201cUI/UX Design\u201d, we know into which parts this task would be divided (\u201cLo-Fi Wireframes\u201d and \u201cHi-Fi Wireframes\u201d); we are also informed of the progress that has been made so far, through the link that is made available from google docs. That is, on this task, we have a very solid understanding of what has already been done and what will be done next. However, in \u201cTechnology\u201d, this activity is only conceptualized as \u201cFullstack Web and mobile dapp\u201d. Non-tech people like me don't fully understand what this means. It would be interesting for proponents to attach an accessible explanation of what Fullstack web would be and why it would take around 12 weeks to develop, along with the mobile Dapp. Now talking about the budget, we have to keep in mind that the requested money would only cover the expenses of the zero phase of the project; It would be interesting for bidders to let us know when it would need to be spent in total, with the development of the other phases, and if they will try to fund future Catalyst funds or try to raise the money in another way. The budget explanation is satisfactory, we know into which parts the total amount would be divided. As with the roadmap, some of them are better explained (eg \u201cFullstack Mobile Dapp Development: 360 hours @ $35/h = $12,600\u201d. We know how much the hourly rate would cost for this task), while others are just quoted (such as \u201cWeb Dapp Development: $10,000 flat fee.\u201d Why is this fee flat and why does it cost $10,000?). Overall, I found the budget explanations to be good, but it would be ideal if all parts were explained in the same level of detail. Finally, speaking of the team, I think this part is average. We do not have the same level of detail regarding all team members; Ideally, everyone would have presented their names, a short resume (with previous experience included) and their linkedin profiles, so that we could know their careers accurately. It also worries me that only Sam Jeffrey seems to be a member of the Cardano community, having studied Plutus, it is not clear if other people would be used to dealing with the technologies pertinent to our blockchain. So, I think the auditability is ok, it basically provides us with everything we need to know about how to carry out the project, but it could be better detailed. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Proponents provide good ways for us to measure the progress of the process. According to them, weekly meetings will be held with the Cardano community through Discord (I understood that these meetings would be directly for community members, but maybe they are with some IOG coordinators, I don't know). I think they are quite right when they say that the feedbacks will be qualitative and quantitative, because in my view it is essential that we analyze the projects to be developed in these two ways. It is also important in my view that we can be aware of the work routines of those involved, so here's the suggestion: in these meetings, in addition to presenting partial results, proponents can update participants on whether there was any dissonance in their work plans , and if so, how it was overcome. They provide the link to discord and also state that the gitghub repository will be open so that we can check the more technical issues directly. In other words, in my perception the auditability of the process is perfect. Talking now about monitoring the final results, success will be considered when the platform reaches 100 thousand users and also by the indicators \u201cbring user ownership of social media platforms and use to earn savings\u201d and \u201cimplementing Participatory Decision Making ( PDM) in the user economy\u201d. I think the proponents only focused on Dapp, when in fact we also need to understand how this project would have consequences for Cardano. I would like them to outline measurable ways for us to know if the specific objectives of the challenge were achieved, if Dapp contributed to the popularization of Cardano and what that process was like; if the number of Ada being bought and delegated has increased, if more people have become active members, if there has been an increase in the minting of NFTs on our blockchain and so on. It is important that all this is studied and properly reported to our community, it can be through discord itself, which is the bridge they will establish. Finally, like the other topics in the proposal, this one is good, just needing some improvements. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The idea proposed is innovative and seems like a good implementation to the Cardano Ecosystem, I'm really excited to see its potential.

Since this is an ambitious project which is dealing with some developments that are still in early stages, there is a possibility that the solutions suggested may not hold. On one solution a risk still needs to be explored and another solution relies on technology improving in the future. It is not to say that the technology will not improve or the solution will not be found.

It would be good to understand in future proposals what is novel in their proposal against other applications in the space and then on from that how they will try to drive adoption and usage to get the project started. The risks cover more technical aspects of the project which are noteworthy. The proposals do not highlight the issue around privacy and how by making these wallet addresses public they reveal people wallets that they store NFTs. Highlighting this is a risk on personal security and how this should be mitigated with information in the application and potential solutions to help people keep their privacy would have been welcomed. Another area that is not considered is the impact of the chicken egg problem on this project.
