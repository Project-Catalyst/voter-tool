We know that here we are looking to fund Dapps that can, in some way, promote the expansion of the Cardano ecosystem. This would clearly be done through the \u201cYoublob\u201d platform. It is a kind of youtube, but totally focused on sharing projects in which people would do with their own hands and materials that were within their reach various products (such as DIY, do it yourself, the famous DIY). Content creators could market manuals, as I understand it, in NFTs format. The content created would be sold, purchases could be made, revenue generated and incentives made for their favorite creators (at least that was my interpretation of the activities that would make up the platform). The proponent explains very well about which parts would form the application and how it would work, that is, what would be the user experience. We know that accounts would be registered, and each account would be automatically linked to a digital wallet. Transactions would be done through smart contracts, and there would be artificial intelligence guiding the user experience. Fees of 5% would be charged on top of the value of each sale, so that artificial intelligence could be maintained and progressively evolved. In general, these would be the platform activities. I found it a very interesting and different proposal, focusing on a very specific audience, and that can organically attract new members to the Cardano community; after all, people would not come for the blockchain, but for the tutorials. It would be interesting for the proponent to explain how these users would be instructed in the use of technologies relevant to Cardano. How will they know how to use their digital wallets, how will they transact on the blockchain? It is not so clear whether payments would only be by native tokens or could be made in Ada, for example. But anyway, I really agree that Dapp is of high value and could achieve the specific goals of the challenge, such as increasing NFTs in circulation, (probably) increasing the volume of Ada being sent, number of new smart contracts being done, more people becoming active members of our community and so on. I think the differential of the proposal is, in addition to being very focused on a target audience, it was so well explained both in terms of user experience and the technologies that would be adopted here in relation to Cardano (which are several). Therefore, I will give full marks for the impact, because in terms of the benefits that this project can generate for Cardano, I think they can be really significant. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Unfortunately, the proposal's script is quite inadequate. We know what would happen, the main activities to be developed, but we don't know when they would actually happen. It is said that the whole process would take 6 to 9 months, but why is this time so variable? I think it would be much better for the author to indicate in which month the project would start and what would be planned for each succeeding month. The level of detail of the activities could also be better delved into, for example in \u201cmake a more user-friendly UI/UX in alignment with smart contract integration\u201d; how would that be done? How many people would work here and for how long? How would the platform be created, what design requirements would be studied so that the UI/UX was more user-friendly and ergonomic? How long, more or less, would this activity take to be developed? In fact, the whole process is described by just 4 activities, which are mentioned in a very generic way. I would like the level of specificity of the script to be higher, it is not possible to have a good understanding of what will happen based on the information given. Now talking about the budget, $22,500 is asked, this part is really in need of a good revamp. All we know is whether the money would go towards the salaries of PHP and Plutus developers. But we don't know 1) how many developers would work 2) what their work routines would be like 3) the value of their monthly salaries 4) how many hours they would dedicate each month to the project, whether they would work full-time or part-time. I also wonder, will the designer mentioned in the script not be paid? The project will not have a form of marketing? How will the target audience be aware of its existence? Unfortunately, this part leaves something to be desired, requiring a lot of detail to be included. The team presentation part also leaves a lot to be desired, because we don't actually have professionals being presented here. We know that a Plutus developer, a business developer (designated by IOG) and \u201cAtala Prism people\u201d (developers too?) would be needed to compose the team. And the designer and the publicist? We only know what functions would be necessary but we are not presented with names, resumes, as we do not know who would be involved, we also have no way of knowing about their previous experiences, nor how they relate to our blockchain (if they are experienced in dealing with the technologies from Cardano). As a whole, the feasibility is very superficial, there is no confidence in the process, how the money would be used or the team (as it is not yet formed). My suggestion is that this topic be completely reworked. \n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Regarding the auditability of progress, the proponent states that it would be done \u201cthrough tasks jora and test spira\u201d. What are those things? Are they auditing methods? He says they will also measure traffic, transactions and different elements of interaction. But how would these things be measured? And how would the results be made available to the Cardano community? Unfortunately, all the established metrics are a bit confusing, I can't properly understand how the project development process would be done. I think that, first of all, it would be necessary for the script to be improved. By that, I mean both in terms of temporality (that the tasks were divided into months) and the level of detail of the process (only 4 tasks make up all the explanations about the process, which I think is quite inadequate, it would be necessary for us to understand solidly everything that would be done and how those things would be done). In the following excerpts \u201c3-6 months: Implementation of the new design, along with initial smart contract functionality and light wallet\u201d and \u201c6-9 months: Extended smart contract functionality which Adaptive payments from external vendor currently can not handle, along with NFT handling on Blueprints\u201d, we can see what the short and medium term goals would be. This is already good material that could be monitored. Now, it would be necessary for the proponent to make this information verifiable for the entire Cardano community in a very practical and accessible way. Finally, analyzing the final results, we know what would be considered a success for part of the system, for the traffic of the platform and also how the project could evolve to the next level. Fortunately, this part is much better covered. We have a lot of material to monitor. We know what would need to be achieved in relation to Dapp. However, it is necessary for the proponent to also clarify how the consequences for our blockchain can be easily measurable. How can we see if the specific objectives of the challenge have been achieved? It would be necessary for both quantitative and qualitative data to be measured and forwarded directly and simply to the entire Cardano community. Therefore, I think auditability is average, presenting strengths and others that fall short (mainly on progress). \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 5359, "q0": "This project would be valuable to creators and generate income for makers so could definitely be impactful.

The solution to pay creators is not directly connected to a problem as millions of videos do exist, mentioned in the proposal, so people are still putting forward their ideas.
