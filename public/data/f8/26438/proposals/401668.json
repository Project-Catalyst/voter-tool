We can thus see that the central idea of the project is to use Cardano technologies to reduce bureaucracy in a segment that is highly populated by intermediary agents that mitigate a good part of the gains. With this, the proposal fits the metrics of the challenge in question. And as music is an unrestricted industry, the success of this project could bring great visibility to Cardano's ecosystem, as the idea is highly scalable. However, we found a considerable problem in relation to the budget being requested of $350,000, as it is a very high value given the current characteristics of the project, as we will see below.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "As mentioned before, we have a problem regarding the amount being asked, and in fact yet another contradiction arises. When looking at the budget detail, the total capital required is $80,000, which is contradictory information to what was initially exposed. Considering this last mentioned value, we realize that by the current organization, we have that approximately 62% of the budget would be destined to marketing. It makes sense that special attention should be given to this point, as it is a new concept and should be introduced to the public. But perhaps this budget division jeopardizes the production of other steps that were described in the plan.\n\nIn fact, it is worth mentioning that one of the factors that seems to harm the viability of the project would be the amount of possibilities that the platform intends to deliver. We see the possibility of marketing different types of tokens, multiple forms of profitability, development of regional resources and even plans to launch versions 2.0 and 3.0. Bearing in mind that a beta version of this Dapp is yet to be released, it seems interesting that the number of features were a little smaller, so that there is a beta version that is less comprehensive and more focused on testing public receptivity. Additionally, considering the size of the project, it would be nice if we had the CVs of more professionals involved. Both in the proposal and on the project's website, we find only the curriculum of the founder of the idea. However, it is worth mentioning that the project presents some innovative concepts, such as the tokenization of moments ($MOMENT), as we know the popularity and reach of short videos on current social media. With that, it seems that with the adjustments of some points, this project that has good potential would become more viable.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Given the entire audience that the project aims to reach, it seems interesting that there were more ways to monitor the proposal, which would work concurrently with the commits made on Github. For example, the Miro tool could be used to carry out periodic, perhaps even weekly, updates on the completion of steps. Another idea would be to create a group on Telegram with the participation of developers and the public, so that instant feedback could be collected.\n\nRegarding the team's perception of success, it is positive to see that a desired amount of artists and creators has been established that must be present on the platform in a given period. But in addition, it seems nice to stipulate other quantitative parameters that help in this measurement of success, such as:\n\nExpected engagement goal of the project on social media\n\nMonthly average growth in relation to listeners to be achieved\n\nExpected revenue in the beta version of the app", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1501, "q0": "If succeeded it could bring millions of people to the Cardano blockchain from all demographics.

If you do a quick google search for \"blockchain music streaming platform\" you notice a lot of teams working on a similar idea.

This proposal, if successful, has a huge impact on the community, which is the integration of music and digital currency, which contributes significantly to the development of the Cardano ecosystem. I am very impressed with this proposal, it brings a breakthrough idea in applying digital currency to the music field. This amazing thing has made it possible for musicians and their music to be encrypted and anyone can buy, sell and trade these tokens on the blockchain... In our lives today, the music streaming sector is one of the fastest-growing in the world. This proposed idea aimed at the music world will be very beneficial for the growth of Cardano. Together with 5 years of experience in Game and Software Development, Over 7 years in the music industry, the proponent offers a platform that benefits both creators and consumers. It's the Loozr app. This app, allows artists to distribute music and receive direct investment from fans. Anyone can make money by investing in an artist's BIO or SONG. Artists can also earn money when listeners stream their songs. By using Loozr coin and Loozr coin is the native cryptocurrency of the Loozr platform. This is a new way for musicians to earn money while also being able to share their stream earnings with investors and fans. It empowers independent creators, musicians, and communities to create their blockchain-based digital economy, benefiting all parties in the music industry. This is a great solution, giving all the music community including Musicians, Creators, fans, audiences... the opportunity to earn money and increase their value. From there, this proposal is beneficial to many different levels in the development of the Canadian ecosystem. I strongly believe that this proposal can solve the challenge... Although this is a completely new field, not much experience yet But with the speed of development, cost, interactivity, and reliability they have created for the community...I still believe they will There are ways to overcome the risks to go to success.
