Apart from gaming tools, the team is involved in educating players and developers through guides/podcasts. \nThis proposal from Revelar team is made to enable the general operation of the Revelar platform and fund the expansion its services during second semester of 2022. The problem stated by the proposal is that the platform has been build so far without outside capital. By enabling team members to work full time on the project, outside capital could bring faster development to the platform, with less constraints if this capital comes from Catalyst than from other usual shareholders. The objective is to attract new game developers to Cardano, and the success is defined by a net growth in cardano-based game powered by Revelar of 25 over the 12 coming months. \nThis proposal is aligned with the Dapps and integrations challenge: this challenge is open to competents teams that have already deployed a MVP. Here the MVP is the revelar platform and the Duo NFT Card Game based on Cardano. An NFT Game engine has the potential to have a large impact on the NFT activity on Cardano, has it is a catalyst for game developers. However, as stated by the proposal requests for general operation funding is unusual, and not completely aligned with the challenge that focusses more on engineering and development.\nWhile I strongly agree that Revelar can have a large impact on Cardano, I\u2019m not convinced that it is the right use of Catalyst funds to fund normal operation. That\u2019s why I chose a score of 4 for Impact and Challenge allignement.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The revelar core team is identified and existing developments show that they are relyable in delivering what is promised. Even if this proposal requests to fund general operations for a Dapp, the team has made a good effort to provide a detailed budget breakdown and to detail intermediate deliverables. \nA short risk analysis is given, but I\u2019m lacking details to assess the feasibility with respect to the goal of 25 NET cardano-based game. A partnership with a dev shop is mentioned, but without a detailed roadmap for the platform development it is not easy to understand how critical these external ressources will be. For future application I recommend the team to connect the risk analysis with the goal that is defined, that should help feasibility assessment.\nI agree that this proposal is highly likely to be implemented successfully.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team offers a dedicated space for progress reports about Catalyst funded proposal: https://catalyst.revelar.co. Every voters can check by himself the progress of the 5 funded proposals in Fund 7. A github repos is updated for open source code and projects.\nFor this general operation budget proposal, the team offers to publish on github an open accounting ledger from their bookkeeper, and monthly video updates.\nBased on how transparent this team is since Fund 7 and on the proposed information means for this proposal, I strongly agree that the community will have the possibility to monitor the progress of this proposal.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_78", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you for your feedback, and while we know this is somewhat of a new and fringe approach for catalyst funds.

The Revelar team have worked on previous proposals and have been successful in managing the developers' games on-chain, with a healthy mix of open source resources, business operation transparency, and community engagement. That seems like a useful, indeed, integration that would add some value to the whole CNFT (Cardano NFT) ecosystem and consequently the whole ecosystem of Cardano. The KPIs considering bringing new games on Cardano and this is among the challenge settings. From all view, I believe that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge and I consider it as a great idea to follow-up.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I like the fact that the proposer gives many details about the skills and experience of all the involved team members, which skills are very impressive and relevant for that specific proposal. The links provided are also very useful and I see that there are also the twitter links and a couple of discord channels, something we do not meet on every proposal. The plan that has been provided is detailed and in my opinion, implementable as from the description for each phase I can see that there has been a lot of thought on how this idea is going to roll up. The budget has been outlined and has been broken down into identifiable items. Nevertheless, I believe it would be really informative if more details about the budget categories were available, for the voters not to wonder why the budget will be broken down in this manner. Another area where more information would be welcomed is the programming languages and technologies that will be needed for the project to be successful.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I find it useful that the proposer provided a roadmap and that they define success for this experiment in budget request falls in a few incremental milestones. The KPIs are briefly there (they are not that obvious to someone who does not know any of your previous work) but they some numbers for those metrics may be applied there, in order to quantify the success apart from describing it. Something else that I personally find really useful, is that domain you provided there which consists of all your previous work on Catalyst, so that anyone is able to visit and audit the success of the proposal. It is something that we do not see that often on Catalyst proposals. Among these lines, I believe that the proposal could be a success if only the proposer gives a little bit more information to the points I mentioned above.

In this instance, they are attempting a new approach with their company, where they would like to receive funds to cover their operational costs for the next 6 months, so that they can focus on research and development, brainstorming new ideas, expanding their team and generally growing their business to be able to deliver more and more software in Catalyst. It\u2019s an interesting idea and I personally think it\u2019s worth a shot, since I\u2019ve interacted personally with Jason and a few of his colleagues and they seem to be transparent, talented, good people. I see it as a Catalyst Swarm, but where the Swarm is focused on communication and hosting events to spread knowledge and build up the community, this would be focused on advancing Cardano tech by allowing developers the freedom to experiment. It might prove to have a very big impact on Cardano, because, interesting fact, this is something the very successful company behind Steam and games like Half life or Dota 2 does: they have a culture where people are allowed to spend time on coming up with ideas, gathering people around them and then petition management for funding, if they get enough support. \nAs risks, the proposers identify 3 items: \n- the fact that if they grow too fast they might not be able to deliver all their products and other Catalyst proposals at the expected quality level and some things may break (but they mitigate by testing as ahead of time as possible and they would use the resources here to cover this risk even further)\n- subjective budgeting, which, from what I understand is referring to the fact that with these funds being fully visible to everyone, some people might raise objections to how they are used, but this will be simple to mitigate, as if the community and IOG notice that Revelar fails to deliver, they will simply cut off the funding, which is done on a monthly basis\n- software delays, which are always a risk, in any software project, but as way to mitigate this, Revelar plans to re-use a lot of existing tech (theirs and open source) and they are also partnered with a company called Excellarate, which they can obtain developers from if some projects are more demanding.\nAll in all, this is a different approach to proposals, it\u2019s slightly experimental, but as I described above, I think it\u2019s worth taking a risk and seeing how it works.

They are also inviting members of the Catalyst Challenge teams to follow their activity and act as a \u201cBoard of Directors\u201d, which can hold them accountable for how funds are spent.\nThis proposal will be considered a success if Revelar manages to become fully transparent with their accounting, thus paving the way for other companies as well to attempt to access funding in this way and if they continue to grow the amount of projects they deliver, as well as their own team.\nWith all the information we have been given, as well as the company\u2019s openness to collaborating with the Catalyst community, I think this proposal will be auditable.

Since Revelar has been set up as a profit-seeking company, it should be able to stand on its own and either generate revenue to cover the costs or attract investors to foot the bill.

Here nothing is offered in exchange. \u201cIf there is positive feedback and reception, we may continue this model for future Operational budget requests.\u201c Revelar is not a charity and it should not subsist on community donations.
