The integration of Cardano and blockchain to an African  network that can minimize the amount of data that is required to be transferred over an available internet connection is a great partnership proposal. However, it is worth remembering that blockchain is often a complicated technology for end users all around the world, not just in Africa, even those with the full connection capacity of the Internet. For exmaple, my wife is a software engineer, programmer and math graduate and has full internet access - but doesn't know how to use a crypto wallet and still doesn't understand it. As using blockchain also requires a lot of bandwidth for watching and educating users about the technology, its uses, frequent changes, tutorials, etc... It is hard to secure just bandwidth for connecting web wallets - and ignore the knowledge gap between users and the web 3.0 world in remote and poor areas. The proposer ackowledges the problem by mentioning that \"Why it is not implemented in the poor nations? Because the people of these nations are poor and cannot afford the cost of operations such as big data transfers through internet, etc.\" However, enabling the use of wallets - through Dapp solution connecting to the Lokole network, might seem overly ambitious. The first part of the plan is to consult between Lokole system software developers and Cardano Ecosystem developers to share and learn how both topologies work. However, the question is - whether this will be possible and which Cardano services does the proposer intend to deliver to these regions in DR Congo and is there any demand for them? Simple example. Even if I was able to access a web wallet remotely offline - would I even know how to download it and initialize a wallet and then buy/receive/sell ADA - without the know-how? Finally, the integration of Cardano and Lokole seems like an afterthought - but that seems to be the crux of the proposal - in terms of the idea. There is a lot of information given about Lokole (good idea from a 2017 hackathon) structure, but what is the state of affairs with Lokole five years on? \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The crux of the plan seems a bit bare bones [apart from the extensive presentation of Lokole network - which seems a great idea to be fair]. The first step  is the previously mentioned consultation between Lokole system software developers and Cardano Ecosystem developers to share and learn how both topologies work. Hence, this means to me that the feasibility of the proposed integration - has yet to be explored. if possible, what would this mean for the end user and who is the prospective end user? Yes, the integration may be technically possible - however which aspects do we want to integrate? The full node wallet? The light client wallet? The Cardano catalyst voting? Access to Dexs? Integration sounds good, until we explore the details. Hence, I would advise the proposers to take a step back (if this proposal is not funded now) and try to look at the proposal from the eyes of the end user they are targetting. Then they will know which Cardano components they want to integrate and whether there is real need/demand for this service. Using Cardano - without the accompanying access to the Cardano ecosystem (news, Catalyst, Youtube, AMAs, Twitter, Dexes, Dapps, exchanges) - may be like having a match on Mount Everst, but with no flamable material (wood) around you. It may end up useless. So, if resubmitting, I would advise to focus on what is this MVP product for delivery - what will it achieve for the end user - if there is not broadband internet and a non-tech-savvy user base? The detailed budget breakdown seems at the same time too detailed [for a proposal that doesn't yet envisage the specific type of integration desired between Lokole and Cardano] and too general as it is impossible to go into details yet, because the consultation between Lokole system software developers and Cardano Ecosystem developers has not yet taken place. So no specific integration plan is in motion that could require a precise amount of funding for engineers, software developers, etc. But a precise budget is specified = $67200. The team seems experienced with Lokole, but seems to be not overly experienced with Cardano development, Plutus and Haskell. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Due to the weaknesses seen in the proposal - too general - and lack of specifics about the integration of Lokole and Cardano, apart from the stated desire to explore it and achieve it, the auditability section does not overly impress. The proposers state that the \"most efficient way to properly asses the impact of the service is to consult the users of the Lokole device and email app themselves\" However, we are not able to do so. Also, the auditability would refer not to the quality of the Lokole service, but to the proposed integration of Lokole and Cardano. Checking the stats of Lokole web app users might be interesting, but it would have been better to include the stats in this proposal immediately - in order to support the strength of Lokole's userbase. The team also proposes to donduct digital email surveys to understand the direct cause-effect relationship between our Lokole access and positive social impact, however Lokole's impact survey is something that could have been presented in this proposal as supporting material ... for a decision to finance an integration with Cardano. And so on and so on... The auditability of this proposal to integrate Cardano with the Lokole network seems low, as the Auditability section mostly deals with the auditability of Lokole's network use, independent of its proposed Cardano integration. \n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_35", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Lokole\u00a0is\u00a0a custom device to\u00a0bring\u00a0affordable emails to rural communities.\u00a0\nThis\u00a0proposal\u00a0faces\u00a0the\u00a0challenge\u00a0to\u00a0integrate\u00a0the\u00a0Cardano\u00a0ecosystem\u00a0in the\u00a0Lokole\u00a0network.\n\nGiving people the opportunity to use the Cardano ecosystem, which otherwise aren't able to use the internet in High Bandwidth, is always a step forward to an equal world.
