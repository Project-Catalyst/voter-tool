What is not clear to me is that this will be a decentralized application built with smart contract or is this a centralized app like web 2.0 like? I think that the proponent should clarify this as this challenge is for building dapps on Cardano. Besides this fact, I think that the idea may be a good one. Social media, if it\u2019s decentralized and allows the community to earn money on top of that, can have a great impact on the ecosystem.

It's not very clear how Cardano's technologies would be used here. The proponent talks about DAOs, but who would constitute them? How would they operate, relate? Site members earned cryptocurrencies as a reward for doing what, exactly? The whole is confusing. The proponent explains better the functioning of the site itself - for example that it would have an artificial intelligence that would select the feed of each user based on their experience, similar to tik tok; it also lacks some features of the site, but the most important part for us (how does this all relate to Cardano) is superficial.

The budget is also not well explained. The asking value is high, and is divided into some parts, and these are just mentioned. It is not explained, for example, what \"others\" would be, how marketing would happen, how the work routine of the professionals involved would be, the price of their working hours, etc. We could not reliably understand how the requested money would be used; much more detail and clarity would be needed.

Speaking of end results, the proponent is fully focused on how the platform would be considered a success, and not on how we could measure that impact for Cardano. How has all this benefited our blockchain?
