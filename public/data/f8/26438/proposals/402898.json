It is said that \u201ca vote is a new way to present ideas, topics and vote. By using Cardano and Prism, we can change the world as we know it.\u201d Okay, but how does this differ from the way we already vote, via the Catalyst voting app? It is said that the problem at hand is a lack of trust and that \u201cthere is no easy way to reach a fully reliable consensus outside the chain\u201d. I disagree with this... The Catalyst voting app is very easy to use, I've never heard of distrust and I've been on Catalyst for a lot of backgrounds. I think the proponent does not explain how this Dapp would be built, what this \u201cbroad-spectrum structure would look like and can be used anywhere, from the internal decision-making of a small company to the nation-states\u201d... in short, nothing is said about the practical part of this initiative, how this evolution of what already exists would happen, what would be changed, what would remain, how would it be done so that voters would have more confidence in the process. I disagree that this proposal is interesting to be funded, all the issues I cited should have been properly clarified. I do not agree that the proposal is aligned with the objectives of the challenge, it is not understandable how this application would increase the number of active members in our community; nor, how would it promote increased investment in Ada; we don't know how the idea would contribute to the highest number of transactions on Cardano's blockchai; in short, all the minor objectives of the project are not met in a direct and palpable way here. In other words, to summarize my opinion, the proponent should have explained how the promises he makes would be fulfilled and how this would clearly impact the Cardano ecosystem. Note: I read the slides that were attached, they are very well built, but they still haven't clarified the doubts I mentioned. The idea is good, yes, but the explanations should be greatly reinforced. \n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The script of the proposal is extremely superficial. It is explained which activities would be developed over the course of 3 months, which I believe is the total project development time. We know that in month 1, \u201cteam training: database engineer, systems engineer\u201d would be done; but shouldn't that already be ready by the time the proposal is submitted? In other words, shouldn't we already know who the people are before we fund the project, so that confidence in their ability to successfully execute the jobs is conveyed? In the second month, all we are told is that \u201cresearch and development\u201d would be done; perceive that the proponent does not detail the activities that would be carried out? We know what would be done, but not how it would be done. For this part to be ideal, it would be necessary for us to know how this research would be developed, what topics would be researched, what methodology would be used, how contact with the target audience would be made... Regarding development, the same thing: it would be essential to know how the development of the application would be carried out, in fact this is the part that would need to be better detailed, since it would consist of several activities, carried out by several professionals, and represents the heart of the project. Anyway, the script should be much more detailed. About the budget, the same thing happens; we are informed in a very basic way about expenses, for example in \u201cResearch and Development: with the team: 1 month. 2 developers $8000\u201d. Would each developer receive 4,000, that is, would this amount be shared equally between the duo? How many hours of work would they devote to the project? About building the MVP, why would that cost $24,000? How would this high amount be distributed over the 3 months of work? All parts should be better explained, the way this part of the proposal is presented, we really don't have a good visualization of how the money would be spent. Finally, talking about the team, we do not have the basic information about each team member, namely: the name of each professional involved, a description of their professional resumes, an explanation of how they relate to our blockchain, their profiles from linkedin where we could have proof of the information given... In short, trust is not passed on to the team, since it is unknown to us. Finally, I think the feasibility of the project is very low and needs to be completely reworked, so that all topics are presented in detail. \n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proposer tells us which milestones would have to be reached during the development of this proposal, some of them (finish the system design and architecture and develop the backend database and integrations) are related to a time frame of 1 and 2 months , respectively. However, the ones he reports later are not indicated according to any passage of time, being \u201cdevelop conceptual GUI interface (...)\u201d and \u201cbuild APIs and fork resources\u201d; how can we know until when these tasks should be accomplished? Other doubts I had about auditability are: first, it is said that meetings would be held so that the monitoring of activities would be constant, but would these meetings only be with the IOG coordinators? Would these contents be accessible to the Cardano community as well? Another question I had is regarding the \u201cnight checkpoints\u201d; What would that be? Anyway, I think that the proponent already guides us well in relation to the auditability of the process, but does not provide all the information necessary for us to fully understand this. Now about the final results, this part is much more vague, we know that success would be considered by \u201cadoption by people, companies and governments around the world who want the security of a blockchain consensus\u201d; but how can this be measured? How can we outline objective, measurable and direct ways to verify this scenario? It would be necessary for the proponent to have informed statistics and analyses, both qualitative and quantitative, that would allow the Cardano community to be able to confidently verify that the great objective has been achieved. It is necessary that we have direct ways to understand the consequences of all this for our blockchain, understand if the smaller goals of the challenge were accomplished, and also how all this would reach the knowledge of the Cardano community (which means of communication would be adopted between the team and the community ). So I think the feasibility was going well in the process part, only a few details were pending, but when talking about the success scenario, what is suggested is still quite vague. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 428, "q0": "Unfortunately, I have no idea how the proposal will solve the problems.

There is a soft coupling to the Cardano community with certain keywords but it is hard to see that the proposer is prepared enough to implement their solution by comparing the proposal and slide presentation. \nDespite this, the proposal is aligned with the \"DApps and Integrations\" challenge and it does not seem to be any other perfect fit challenge, this raises the proposals impact score.\nLastly, the idea and concept is interesting of bringing new ways of secure and trustable voting mechanisms to the community, but the proposal is not selling the concept as clear at the moment and needs some refinement.

A short and general plan has been provided but it is not sufficient in order to assess the feasibility of the project. The budget could use some refinement to bring better justify why this amount of funding is needed. The fundamentals are down but it should be further broken down in order to appear more credible. Lastly, the proposer is experienced and seems to sit on the right tools to implement the project, but there is no way to further verify their claims. This could be added in order to increase the credibility of the proposer, this would in turn result in a higher feasibility score. The proposal is lacking in all sections but it has the fundamentals down. It needs some refinement and it is suggested to look at other successful proposals in previous funds to gain inspiration. For now, it is rated 2 stars in terms of feasibility. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "It is not clear from the auditability section how the community can audit the progress and development of the project. The proposers seems to have mixed up where some information should be located in the proposal. The most of the information (milestones, estimates) should be moved to the feasibility section. It should be replaced with details explaining how the progress will be measured and clarified how the community and the project can be audited. Also, the proposal mostly states that it will provide most details later on, if the proposal were to be funded. This is troublesome since it makes it hard to assess the proposal as auditable/feasible when the detail will be delivered after funding. \nLastly, some relevant and clear KPI's should be provided in order to make it easier to evaluate the project after x amount of time. The proposal is too general and lacking in details, it needs to be refined before it can be properly assessed.

However, I'm not convinced of the impact of this particular proposal. Blockchain-based voting is not an uncompetitive industry, so I need to be seeing this project's awareness of the market and uniqueness from competitors. The minimal information given in this impact section does not show me what the tangible impact of this project is. There is only a theoretical concept given of the security of blockchain-based voting. I'd like to know who the target audience is, who the interested partners are, where the project will start, and how many people this project intends to impact in the short and long-term timeframes. Also, since this is a particular area that I am interested in, I noticed that the project doesn't have a reliable defense against double voting. The presentation does talk about how the participation of voting can only be triggered upon request, which is a centralized solution to the issue. The proposal does not address the problems of decentralized identity solutions that enables only one vote to one person, rather than one person requesting access from multiple wallets under the guise of multiple people. I don't find this proposal to be thorough enough. More information is needed on market, need various solutions and uniqueness. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "I am not convinced that this project could feasibly be accomplished, with the information given. First of all, I have no clue who the development team is, if there is one. The proposer is an SPO for a small pool of 320k ADA, so not a well-known name. The proposer claims to have 20+ years in business and connections to a specific developer, but the LinkedIn profiles are not linked for either of these individuals. Even if there was verifiable resumes provided, there is no indicated blockchain experience to suggest that a blockchain-based voting system could be produced. So the information is not verifiable or sufficient. Since no other information is given, I'm forced to assume that there is no development team and the proposal has no assurance of completion. As far as the roadmap goes, I don't have any indication that the given roadmap is created by anyone that is qualified to produce an accurate timeline of development. There's also no detail given in the roadmap, other than research taking one month and MVP taking another 1-3. Which seems rather ambitious for a legitimate quality product. The budget doesn't have enough detail provided either. There's no information on labor hours needed, hourly wages offered, or what the cost breakdown is for $24k to build the MVP and $24k for the package framework. Without that detailed breakdown, I have no assurance to suggest that the funds are being spent efficiently and reasonably. More detail is needed in all these areas.

Even if the team was capable of producing a perfect product, the proposal could make no impact at all on the world if nobody is using the product. I need to know who would be using the platform (which can be measured from who the initial target audience is OR clients that are already secured). I want to know what the milestone goals are for different timelines after the launch of the product. I want to know the objective quantifiable KPIs is that this project is aiming for.

The problem solution is however oversimplified, as it is a difficult problem to solve, and it is not clear exactly how the team plans to integrate Atala Prism into this app. The proposal appears to be more inline with a research project or the \"Self Sovereign Identity\" challenge than the Dapps and Integrations challenge. Therefore it does not align well with the Dapps and Integrations Challenge. The proposal states\" One Vote introduces a revolutionary new GUI that the masses can easily understand and use. This project architecture framework is a broad spectrum framework and can be used anywhere from a small company's internal decision making to Nation States.\" However, after reviewing the presentation slides and the proposal, there is almost no discussion on how to secure the system or the technical requirements of a nation state level voting system.

I would recommend the proposer continue researching this project, and collaborate with others in the space who have knowledge of Atala Prism, and re-apply for funding with an updated proposal. It is also important to understand the expectations/requirements of properly completing each section of the proposal, especially the Auditing/Feasibility so that it is clear how the Cardano community can directly see the results of the funding provided.
