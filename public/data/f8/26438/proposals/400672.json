In this context, we see that promoting a hackathon that encourages the creation of new decentralized tools and increases Cardano's visibility can bring, in the medium/long term, a positive impact to our ecosystem. However, we realized that as the focus of the project is the realization of an event, we have that this proposal is not in the correct challenge, maybe it would be better to post it in Miscellaneous Challenge. The amount being requested of $40,000 seems high for holding an online event, which wouldn't be a big problem if we had a more detailed description of how it will be allocated. But we realize that this is not the case.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Regarding the plan that describes how the event will be organized, we noticed that the general actions were stated, but a little more detail is needed to clearly understand the process as a whole. For example, during the first month (planning stage) what are the main points that will be addressed to attract the attention of as many people as possible? Another question that arises is about the promotion of the event, what will be the main means used for marketing? What is the main target audience category you want to reach? Will the project also be publicized in other projects funded under this or previous funds that aim to increase the overall visibility of the technology?\n\nThe way the information was made available, we are not so sure if the project is organized in a viable way or not. It was also said that the budget will be used to reward the main projects, but it would be nice to know how this distribution of values \u200b\u200bwill occur, that is, if the best placed will receive equal amounts, if the first will receive more or how much more this would be in in relation to the others placed.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The described ways to understand the success or not of the proposal generally make sense, and analyzing the number of projects that were applied during the hackaton and how many managed to deliver a solution prototype is a good way to follow the progress as a whole. But as one of the purposes of the event is to generate greater engagement around Cardano, it would be interesting to use some numerical indicators to help visualize this engagement, an idea would be, for example, to look for the number of references to the hackathon on social networks ( through event mentions with #) and also set a goal, such as an expected number of those mentions being accomplished.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 3, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1520, "q0": "[Note: This proposal is identical to \"Mikomedia Hackathon\" ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/400695 ), except a slight alteration in the problem statement. As a result, the assessments for both of these proposals will also be similar to a degree]\n\n\nHackathons are great events to connect people and bring new and exciting ideas to the Cardano ecosystem. Although, there is little details provided about the hackathon other than that it will help with the deployments of DeFi projects and boost adoption. Questions that arise when reading the proposal are among few: What are your target audience within the community? Existing projects that should be built on top of Milkomeda? New ideas that entrepreneurs are looking to implement but lack the technical knowledge currently? \nThis should ideally be stated more clear in the proposal.\n\nThere is somewhat of an connection to the Challenge setting \"Dapps and Integrations\" where the product of the hackathon aligns more than the hackathon itself. It is hard to assess whether or not this is sufficient enough given the funding details listed within the challenge brief. If we account for the overall quality of the proposal, one star will be deducted from a neutral standpoint and the total score in terms of impact will be 2 stars. Mainly because there is a lot of unanswered questions and low transparency between the two almost identical proposals. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The feasibility section of the proposal is sparse and not much details are given to increase the credibility of the proposal, which is unfortunate. The proposer have submitted their Hackathon idea in two different categories as mentioned. However their \"detailed plan\" overlaps and if both projects were to be funded, it is implied a website would be built (from scratch?) for each hackathon. The same issue can be applied to the planning and promotion of the event. The similarity is strong between the proposals and a lot of assets could be reused. More transparency regarding this matter would be strongly advised.\nAnother issue that is not addressed in the proposal is that the proposers asks for 40000 and 45000 dollars for the two proposals but it is stated that the funding will be solely used as price money for the top projects. That is, the proposers claims that they will spend 4 months of preparatory work + 2 hackathons without any compensation. This should be questioned, and the proposers should clarify why they are willing to spend this amount of time without receiving any compensation.\nThe proposal is not credible in its current state, therefore, the feasibility of the proposal has to be questioned. As a result it, has to be given the lowest score: 1 -star.\n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "From an auditing perspective, the metrics used to measure the success of the hackathon are clear and easily measured. However, the section is quiet sparse in the proposal and success is defined as \"At least 20 projects apply and at least 10 deploy their solutions.\". It can be questioned what the definition of 10 deployed solutions is, since it is a very general statement. Is this 10 successful and completed projects or is it POC's? When are they expected to deploy their solutions? Within a week, month, year? Additionally, depending on the definition of a deployed solution, setting a goal of 50% of all applicants providing a deployed solution sound pretty ambitious. It is not negative to set ambitious goals but it might be challenging to achieve. Overall, the auditability of the proposal measurable but the details provided in the proposal is sparse and the score will be set to neutral. Score given: 3-stars.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_139", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5222, "q0": "Standing on the principle of keeping to objective and fair standards for all Catalyst proposals, I cannot give this proposal a passing score. Even though I know who they are and I know they're trustworthy allies of Cardano, I think it would be irresponsible to approve funding out of favoritism. I do not feel I'm given enough information about the nature of the event and the direct intended impact of the proposal. I think this proposal could even benefit from some explanation of what a hackathon can be and what this particular one is. It could be important to explain why hackathons are important and what tangible impacts come out of it. The only tangible impact I see is \"increase the adoption of Cardano DeFi and improve its TVL.\" However, I don't know how either of things are happening or in what fashion they occur. There's an informational gap between an open hackathon event and greater adoption and higher TVL. These proposals are meant to convince CA's and voters that approval means a positive impact. I do not feel convinced here. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "This roadmap is all bones and no skin. There are 3 bullet points to this proposal but I have no clue when these things are happening or any details about what is happening. In 1 month they will plan for the event but they havent's shown what they will be planning. They've also allocated 1 month, in that same bullet point, to create a website. Is this all supposed to be done by one person? Is this going to happen alongside the planning phase? I think there needs to be a timeline and more specificity on what is being done. Once it's been figured out what will be done, a CA needs to determine if the team has the capability to get it done. Even though I know who the dcspark team is, I don't really know much about their experience and credentials. More importantly, I don't know what specific members of the team are working on this project, so I have no way of evaluating whether or not they are capable of pulling it off. Then there's the budget. Even if the entire budget is going towards prizes, I think more information could be given on the breakdown of that. Is it a winner-take-all type of thing? Or will it be broken down into various awards? These can be important details because a CA or voter might not be so optimistic about the succesful impact of a winner-take-all type of model. This might be the most important section of the proposal because the capability to accomplish the goals is a priori. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The last question of the proposal does not actually answer the question. It's not a yes or no answer. Still, this is the best section of this proposal. There are quantifiable KPIs provided for participation and concrete goals being aimed for. I would like to see sources provided for ways for the public to keep the proposers accountable. It definitely needs more than vaguely written 2 goals. I'm rather disappointed by the lack of detail and professionalism here. More can be done.
