I think it would be a real challenge to create Smart contracts and counter fraud. Every application for Carbon saving projects should be screened. For example, a company could be subsidized by the state and apply for a contract.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The project is in the early stages of development so I understand the KPIs are not that well defined but I would like to see numbers and self-imposed deadlines to measure the success of the funding.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1387", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5906, "q0": "Having a platform for carbon credit trading based on Cardano blockchain is a good idea and helps to leverage its application while solving enviromental issues. Proposal is also aligned with challenge, as it can potentially increase challenges kpis as \"NFT marketplace or facilitator\" and \"Solutions utilising the power of smart contracts\".\n\nI liked that a diagram explaining how it works is provided and some imagems of the UI, to give an idea on how it will look like. Problem statement is also true and solution seems to address that, promoting the trade of carbon from different sources of compensation (not only reforestation) and and possibly in a easier-to use way. This helps also to give insights on how this product will differentiate from others that trade carbon credits.\n\n\nAs suggestions of improvement, the business side of the project could be better explored. How will it generate revenue? Will there be a fee in each trade?\nI understood that the target audience will be ordinary people/investors (not companies). Was there any business case or research that indicated this market need? \nI'd also consider expanding this scope to companies. Nowadays, most companies have net zero target of emissions by 2050 and there'll certainly be a growing demand for that (it is necessary, however, to have a great availability of carbon credit if companies are included).\nAn advertise/communication strategy should also be ellaborated. how to explain to regular people about this app and educate them about carbon credits?\nThis is mentioned in the risk part but not explained how to overcome it.\n\n\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There's a simple but fair. time-framed and relaistic timeline in place. the project would take something around 1 year which seems reasonable for the development proposed. I just wonder which project management approach will be used. If it is an agile, maybe a broken down by sprint could be provided (if not now, during execution, to help track project progress).\n\nbudget is broken down by acitivites/development part and is reasonable. it could just mention how many hours each one would take. I'd also consider some budget for contigency and for marketing.\n\nThe team formed by 6 people have the necessary competencies to execute the project. They include software development, plutus, energy and carbon credits and block chain.
