Discord is widely used in the blockchain space and it makes sense to build this integration. Many users will be able to choose their preferred method of interaction with DC. Either through Discord or through their platform. Giving the end user this choice makes for more onboarding as users dont have to dedicate to one option. They can use both. Making the user experience better in DAO operation will bring more people to Cardano and make them more efficient. Getting more people to use their integration with Discord aligns with the challenge as Discord is a key application in the blockchain ecosystem. This integration will be able to scale because of its simplicity and there is room for evolution in both Discord and the integration itself.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has the relevant experience for the  main project, but they still need a JavaScript developer to build the Discord integration, which they will most likely find in their immediate communities. The budget is broken down into identifiable tasks, each task at a rate of $100/hour. The time allocated to these tasks seems achievable. They explain the different ways this integration will work, using Discord webhooks for their DC platform and building a Discord bot. The bot will be built by the JavaScript developer. They mention a few other resources needed to build this project in the budget breakdown. The way their product is built automatically mitigates some of the most common risks a project like this can face. Their decentralized system operations is a key factor in this and makes it resilient to completely failing.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They provided a 2 month roadmap with milestones to track the  progress of this integration. The KPIs they provided makes it easy to measure the performance of this integration. They clearly describe the problem of DOAs needing integrations with Discord as it is the most used app in the blockchain space for communicating. And archiving the chats for more decentralization. Their solution to this problem is simple and effective. It is an integration between Discord and their own platform. Connecting the 2 platforms and giving the end users options and the chat data is more decentralized.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_140", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 3, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2356, "q0": "\"Putting the problem is clear and so is the proposed solution. The impact of the project is high since having access to talent in the specialized world of Daos is currently not a simple task and is still needed.
