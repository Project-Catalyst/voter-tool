It is still a nice idea, but it not something different than all the other gaming-NFT marketplaces. The description is very clear, there is no bad point in that and it is considered a Dapp, because of the fact that it considers a decentralized space, so is within the challenge settings. Given the fact, that this idea is an existent one, i don't clearly understand the problem stated. Maybe if you elaborate more on that, the whole idea will seem more appealing and one that differs from all the others. For all those points, i can not be sure about this proposal having a positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem.

The plan is described clearly but there is no timetable, it is devided in activities but there is no time horizon. The budget is there and has been broken down into identifiable, very clear, items that don't need further explanation, from my point of view. Good job when it comes to referring to the risks that might emerge when tacking such a proposal. However, be a little more specific to the kind of the resources needed for this purpose and how you would mitigate on the event of a inhibitor considering the proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The fact that there is no clear roadmap and a time horizon makes me think twice of the success of this proposal. The fact that the one KPI described is not accompanied by a number, for example how many people using the platform and purchasing items from the marketplace and equipping them to their multiverse traveler, will be needed to think of this proposal as a success, adds up to that questioning of mine. Keep in mind that the key metrics and how you measure them, is a key for the auditability of the proposal.

The Problem solution however, \"utilising an already existing content solution to drive uptaking in meaningful digital assets, including NFTs\" does not really fit with the proposal outline. The solution \"To offer an affordable, scalable and decentralised NFT marketplace for consumers to purchase items within the multiverse seamlessly.\" Appears to already exist, yet the proposers request a significant budget of $180,000 will be used mostly to build content that they would be able to re-sell then it is used on building the actual marketplace. It's not clear how this would add value to Cardano, when you could argue the NFT market is considered by some to be already saturated, as it consists of almost 35% of the entire network traffic on cardano. It's hard to see how buying NFT's inside a closed source metaverse will add significant value to Cardano, or why this feature costs $180,000 to build. Cardano users who wish to support this project and \"own\" a part of it can purchase the governance tokens and/or utility tokens. It is not clear why this business also requires catalyst funding to get started, or how these funds spent on building NFT's for checkpoint will benefit ada holders.

They should have the ability to deliver \"an affordable, scalable and decentralised NFT marketplace for consumers to purchase items within the multiverse seamlessly.\" However; I question the choice of the word \"affordable\" as they are asking for $180,000, plus selling governance tokens to investors. Another quote from the checkpoint website: \"Initially Checkpoint tokens (Governance and Utility) will only be available for the UK, Europe, Australian and some other territories.\" and \"Investors will be able to benefit from having voting rights on some of the future direction of the business.\"\nThe budget in this proposal is not broken down into identifiable items, and it is difficult to understand how exactly this money will be used. The proposal does not include an overview of the architecture or development work that will be required, but it does include the following: \n\nSmart contract solution for cards - $40,000 (unique evolving smart contract)\nArtwork commission - $18,000 (4 sets of cards, each set containing 20 unique cards)\nCreation of NFTs and implementing parallax (3D versions made in Unity) - $5,000 per set ($20,000 for four)\nCreation of accessories (merch NFT) - $25,000 (this includes avatar customisation as well as pets, etc)\nUnity development costs for accessories - $8,000\nMarketplace integration into existing multiverse - $55,000\nMarketing - $10,000\nContingency - $4,000 \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal does not include specific or measurable KPI's but a more general description of success:\n\n\"The measurement of progress will be determined after the marketplace (which is already available) is implemented. The take up of the digital assets, NFTs and other merchandise will give true insight into adoption and interaction.\nIt appears that this funding will actually be used to create the digital assets that will be sold on the marketplace, and to promote them, and not used to build the already available marketplace. \n\nWhat does success for this project look like?\n\"The success is quite simply people using the platform and purchasing items from the marketplace and equipping them to their multiverse traveler, or avatar.\n\nIdeally, we'd like to sell out of our stuff!\"  (why will ada holders want to fund this business, so they can sell this \"stuff\" back to ada holders?)

With Facebook changing its brand name to meta, we all know that the metaverse is going to be the next big thing and Cardano is currently at a very early stage in terms of projects launching on it, let alone be the Metaverse specific projects.  \n\nThis proposal is bringing an existing web2 based content based solution to extend and revamp it onto web3 and blockchain based solution, bringing a wide variety of domains such as gaming, news content, magazines (e.g. kids magazines), movies, big data and much more to one metaverse solution. All of these domains will be interactive which means users will be able to not only incentivize for their attention and engagement but also would be as close as possible to real world interactions. This proposal, if implemented successfully will bring a lot of users and help catalyze the wide scale adoption of Cardano.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The budget presented is split into various deliverables/parts of this proposal implementation. The Smart contract solution for NFT cards is around $40k, however, it would have been great to further elaborate upon in which terms smart contracts will be evolving.\n\nThe roadmap is available on the orange paper given by the team, which looks realistic, even though a further detailed description would have been a nice addition. The leadership team of this project is well presented and have significant experience in various domains such as journalism, media, art, startup founders, technologists. However, I am unable to find details about if they are planning to hire smart contract developers OR already have them within the team. It is not clear if CTO himself will do the coding in plutus (I think not :)). \n\nAdditionally, the risk section mentions one of the challenges about adoption of such a solution, especially to non crypto audiences. This is a valid risk and I was hoping that the team presents some ideas on how they tend to approach these risks. Overall, the write up is good with some room for improvement and hence I can not strongly agree. Good luck to the team.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I really wished that the auditibility section was more elaborative. For instance, even though the project has provided an orange paper with the roadmap, there is no details on which project management tools/methodologies they will be using to keep track of the progress of this proposal. E.g. Github updates/jira board/AMAs with community/medium articles. \n\nThe final timeline of having NFT marketplace and digital store by Q3 of this year is given, but how we will reach there is missing. The youtube video digs into VR world, which is web2 based, but it would have been great if addition was made to fill the community with the detailed technical gaps and how proposals will reach from point A (current state) to point B (Q3 of this year). \n\nThe success metric is provided and further details on the project can be accessed through the gitbook link provided.

A $40,000 for \u2018Smart contract solutions for cards\u2019 can still be further explained in detail, e.g number of engineers with salary per hourly rate, etc. The lack of roadmap detail, planning, and the technical aspects detail is rather concerning considering this proposal is asking for $180,000 funding.

Selling out of the merchandise does not mean it has created impact. Potentially it created impact for a very small amount of time and then this faded?
