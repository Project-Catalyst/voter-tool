The proposal mentions using Atala Prism for DID/reputation management, but other systems can do something fairly equivalent without blockchain. There is also a mention of tokenizing carbon offsets, but this is not explained much beyond that short phrase. I'd like to see a better explanation of the value of decentralization for this project and really, how it will work. Some acknowledgement that it will start out as centralized -  YOU are building it, and will have some notion of control in the beginning. You mention a DAO but not really anything about how that works. How does this product move from being your baby, to being a public utility? What does that timeline and process look like?\n2) Scaling for future or expanding to other markets is not really accounted for. The discussion here is that reputation scoring would be very localized, so I'm not sure how easily it could expand. I would see a higher impact score if there was some thought given to how this product may eventually be expanded to other markets.\n3) The only risk they identify is that they might not get funded, which is not a thoughtful or probably accurate answer. I'd like to see the proposers show more awareness of what challenges they may face. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I'm honestly not sure what the proposing team is pledging to deliver with this funding. In some places, this is presented as a research project, with the primary output being a fully researched Whitepaper and build plan. (That would seem like an appropriate deliverable for the amount of funding asked!)\nBut in other places, they mention delivering an MVP, and tracking payments on their platform and people signing up to participate in the DAO. I would like to see more clarity about what is being delivered. For the size of this budget, I would focus in on the research and whitepaper phase. Some details of what future phases that will lead to would be ok, as long as we are very clear what is being proposed for now, and what is future.\n\nI have some questions about the budget. It includes \"2 motorcycles\" in the budget, without any explanation. I'm willing to be convinced that 2 motorcycles are necessary, but no explanation is offered. Other budget items also leave out details that would help.\nNoticeably missing from the budget is anything about marketing -- if this proposal DOES claim it will lead to an MVP and the onboarding of users, as it does, then I would assume some effort to advertise, spread the word, create onboarding documentation would be needed - and this would cost something. \n\nOverall, My preference would be for this proposal to NARROW its scope to a fully-researched whitepaper, so that the next thing we vote on for the build is a well-documented and detailed solution for build and launch.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The same confusion continues in the Auditability section, about whether this project is just to produce a whitepaper, or whether we are onboarding users, etc etc.\nMost importantly, this proposal need clarity and focus about what is being offered.\n\nFor auditing a whitepaper as a deliverable, I need to see more detail about where and how we can check on your work.

When we wrote this we were thinking about a functional MVP with minimal components to use as a proof of concept. This would justify then offering the service to users locally in order to test out and provide feedback."}, {"id": 4639, "q0": "The service cost of delivery due to this model may be significantly reduced. The scalability problem that DApps face on any bock chain may not affect this model as the number of transactions may be much lower.

This is not a great problem, at first glance as that impact can be deduced from the impact the project would have on various other players.
