Through this first part, I am relatively certain of the great potential of this project. Unlike traditional trading forms, EternalSwap offers perpetual future contracts helping address the \u201cexpiration\u201d date, which assists traders buy and hold contracts in an unlimited time. Your proposal manages to focus on the functions of the platform. Of course, your key metrics that you introduced also align to those of the challenge. That\u2019s cool! All the drawbacks that you mentioned are down-to-earth and I highly appreciate your proposed solution. They\u2019re expected to be highly effective, from my viewpoint.  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "What should i say now? You know, this section would be the most perfect if you tried to follow the request of the challenge \u201cPlease provide a detailed plan and timeline for delivering the solution\u201d. It\u2019s a \u201cplan and timeline\u201d . You composed a long writing of EternalSwap functions in order to serve Cardano with helpful information, but unfortunately, you forgot the initial request. That is to give a detailed timeline and plan for your project. After skimming the whole part, I can not see any information referring to a specific roadmap, for instance, when you could launch building blocks of the EternalSwap platform and other support softwares. Hence, I hope you can supplement a complete work plan to your proposal, which is crucial for fundraisers to savvy every phase of your project. Nevertheless, it can\u2019t be denied that you got my attention from the eye-catching layout of the budget breakdown list and the high profile of your team members. Most of your core staff have in-depth working experiences in this field, which is likely to speed up the growth of your project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Just with four bulleted lists in the measurement of the progress, can I say that you are doing in a superficial manner? Honestly speaking, when you list four ways to keep track of the project\u2019s development, including branded website, social channels and engagements, finalized whitepaper and V1 product development, you also had better mention what you would provide on each measurement. In particular, on your official website, you can write that you will display the daily number of active users, advertising clicks or traffic, news and updates, and so on. With regard to your definition of success, I admit that you presented quite a straightforward layout for each timeline, namely 3 months and 6 months. In a nutshell, the only shortcoming in this section is the meagerness of information relevant to listed measurements; hence, you are highly advised to add more.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1675", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4435, "q0": "the problem you mentioned is practical. The solution you propose is \"Perpetual Contract\" which is very reasonable. I am impressed with the flexibility of this type of contract and appreciate its ability to limit costly transfers. vAMMs are also a useful idea. Solving the problem of impermanent loss and slippage is a wonderful thing. You also mentioned the risk in the proposal. It's great that this risk has initially found a way to be solved. Your presentation has the full three parts the challenge requires.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "you have outlined the benefits that Cardano and its traders can gain from using EternalSwap. (Though I think it makes more sense to put this part in Auditability). You have also mentioned what products you will deliver if the project is successful. The specification and why the project should be invested are also explained. However, I have not seen you mention a detailed roadmap for the project. How long is this project supposed to take? What stages does it include? In each stage, what work needs to be done? What products will be finished?. The detailed budget is presented very clearly. In addition, your core team is very talented and suitable for this project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "you have described the future development and success of the project.

This would represent a major innovation in the Cardano DeFi space and as such, has the potential to have a great impact on the ecosystem as a whole. The solution is very convincingly detailed and it will definitely add a set of very exciting new features to the landscape if implemented.\n\nThe risk of L1 network congestion is mentioned, especially as the platform intends to be a viable option for high-frequency trading, but since the engineers on the proposal team are collaborating closely with the development of Hydra, the product should be ready to launch as soon as scaling solutions come online.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap and the necessity for creating an encompassing engineering document for technical specification are clearly presented in the proposal. \nTo be clear this proposal is not meant to fund the development of the entire product but is merely meant to seed its development. As such the requested budget of US$70,000 is relatively high but given the experience and track record of the team, it most likely represents a well worth the investment for the Cardano community. \n\nThe budget is clearly broken down, by the number of hours required to complete each task, and all the described steps make sense in the overall pre-production stage of the product. The number of hours allotted for \u201cChange Budget\u201d is a little high at 150 hours, but that's my only objection regarding the estimates.\n\nGiven the proven track record of MLabs in the Cardano space, I have no doubt that they will be able to deliver on the scope of this proposal. Their engineers are some of the best in the space and given their competence and skills, the deliverables outlined on the roadmap have a very high likelihood of being completed.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability section of the proposal starts with a brief list of the KPIs, even though these are not presented as such. I would advise taking greater care of clearly outlining them in the future proposals for this project or in case this proposal needs to be resubmitted.\n\nBoth the overarching goals of the EternalSwap product are clearly presented in the definitions of success section and the specific timeframe goals of the proposal itself broken down by clear time intervals of 3 and 6 months.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_681", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10579, "q0": "Bringing forth a derivative DEX to Cardano ecosystem is a breath of fresh air to our space especially in DeFi. Proposal gave a good brief on what is derivative trading about and how it will look like in Cardano ecosystem initially in form of perpetual contract. An interesting concept of vAMM is also mentioned which I believe our community will be eager to check. We already have good numbers of AMM/Spot DEX, no one is currently serving (or going to serve) this niche yet, while other L1 blockchains have their own derivative DEX already as mentioned in the proposal. Adding this feature of EternalSwap to Cardano will surely give benefit in terms of functionality and popularity, attracting profiles such as crypto derivative traders that will positively inflate Cardano\u2019s DeFi metrics such as TVL, P/S ratio, etc. EternalSwap, if well-executed, could also be the proving ground for Cardano\u2019s scaling solutions and testament to the success of Basho era.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal outlines the concept well and clear enough. Budget and costing are broken down concisely and reasonable with the challenge scope. The deliverables are well-described and highly achievable for a seed project. The time frame is also well within reach while providing enough to gauge the enthusiasm of community in the meantime. Timeline of the proposal could also be scaled well onto the next Catalyst Funds, assuming the team needs any. Moving on to the team, both the people and the companies involved, we get premier developers with proven product already delivered and growing in Cardano ecosystem.

When this proposal is evolving into a real dApp, we can easily check how much it contributes to Cardano DeFi space through its share of TVL, for example. Although, I personally hope they can give some benchmarks to compare with similar dApps or protocol from other L1 chains they are mentioning in the proposal. That way, we can have measurable and fairly accurate estimate of impact that familiar to general crypto audience or even outside of crypto.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_943", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "EternalSwap allows traders to trade on margin without the need for counterparties via vAMMs. vAMMs guarantee liquidity & limit capital loss.", "experience": "Finance and DeFi experts, formally trained economists, and a team of expert Haskell / Plutus developers."}
