The carbon marketplace and exchange will allow other carbon pools to list to provide liquidity to the market. Also the design of carbon marketplace and exchange will open up opportunities for decentralized automous organization later on. The carbon mission will benefit to the whole Cardano community. As DApp challenge for this fund pays attention to the certification of DApps, it is great that they mention this in their proposal. I believe that the Carbon Marketplace and Exchange is an application that will bring the most value for users in 2022 which is the goal of the challenge DApp and integration.

They also address well regarding the budget on creating the exchange that the community engagement and partners will help this project to be cost-effective. The project timespan of 1 year is very implementable despite the big project size and scope of work. They also give the budget breakdown covering the number of hours involved for each functionality of the project. The project requires expertise in commodity and financial markets to come along with the technical and industry knowledge which the team possess. The team is also passionated about climate mission making it very feasible that they will bring this project to completion.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team targets 2 million dollars of TVL in carbon market.

The project aims for the financial system that is regenerative, resilient and decentralized that do not rely on drawback of legacy financial economy. I believe that the team will carry out this project successfully and the project can be audited well using the metrics like TVL, carbon price and pool indices to measure the project progress.

I find this quite strange. But when I read the Challenge statement for DApps and Integrations it seems that now DeFi has been included in this category. I may not agree with that step but I totally agree that this is a DeFi proposal and should then be proposed in this category. In terms of its impact, climate change and carbon are currently \"hot\" (as far as DeFi is concerned I mean, not \"hot\" like CNFTs but more so than, say, stablecoins!).\nSo to answer the question of the Challenge: * most profitable or * most used applications on other ecosystems * solved by new applications * deliver the highest amount of value I agree that climate / carbon tokens are a very good way to bring Cardano to the front of the blockchains for DeFi. Marc Cuban is investing in climate tokens and he is normally quite good about early crypto trends.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It is reassuring to know that the team got funded before and have begun their work and there are team members with LinkedIn profiles and good track record in their business. Otherwise, I would say that the goal is very ambitious, and will most likely require more funding. It is possible, as previous DeFi projects have shown: collect 50k, or 70k, and then build and get funded some more by other funds and investors. But 60k for a DEX is very, very, very tight. Marketplace I am happy with. For DeFi DEX, maybe the team should have stated that this is an MVP or POC or some other wording. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This is a really nice way of making the project auditable: present a mix of quantitative and qualitative goals across a timeline and say what you think you can achieve and how fast the rollout will be. By doing so, blockers can be identified with the funding team and funding can be withheld if blockers cannot be overcome, or help can be sought from other people. A lot of proposals just state \"KPIs are ...(list)...\" and do not say what they want to do by when and how much. If I isolate the feasibility and the possible impact, this is exactly what I look for, so this is a very good proposal for auditing purposes in that sense.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_692", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Trading and staking of carbon tokens backed by a trusted custodian allows liquidity to develop before full decentralization can be achieved.", "experience": "Team of highly experienced carbon and energy traders.
