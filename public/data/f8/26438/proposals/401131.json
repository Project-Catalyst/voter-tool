Artists are reluctant for their work to be displayed next to indecent images", "f6_no_assessments": 4, "f6_rating": 1.5833333333333333, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 401, "q0": "At first glance, we could imagine that this proposal would only bring about the commercialization of a niche art through NFT's and would generate a virtual gallery to publicize it. But when we look at the values that motivate the project (especially the ideas conveyed in the attached whitepaper) we can clearly see that the proposal understands well the pains of the market in which it plans to operate and creates a good foundation that justifies the use of blockchain technology in the business. With this, we see that the project creates an integration to innovate an existing business model, with a relevant use of Cardano technologies, so the proposal fits the metrics of the challenge. However, given the information that was conveyed, we could not find a very clear justification for the large amount being requested of $150,000. And that casts doubt on the possible impact of the project.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "As previously described, we do not have much information about how the budget will be distributed. In the attached whitepaper, we were able to find very well-constructed information, indicating the motivations for the business and also a plan of actions that will be carried out (on page 21 where we have the roadmap). In addition, we were able to find the professionals who are involved in the project as well as descriptions of their main experiences. All the material is very well detailed and makes us believe in the possibility of success of the project, but the fact that we do not have a detailed budget greatly hinders a deeper analysis of the feasibility of the project, mainly because the amount being requested is very considerable.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Once again, we see that, just as in the proposal we do not have any information on the distribution of the budget,\u00a0there is also no information on how the process will be audited. It would be very important that metrics had been established to understand what the success of the project would mean in the short, medium or long term.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 3, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 508, "q0": "Starting with the guiding question of this Campaign \"What applications will provide the most value for end users in 2022?\", this proposal seems like a very poor fit. Far from providing the most value, the value proposition is very narrow indeed, appealing to a poorly explained art market called \"Spiritual Art\". If this is an important, large or valuable market to tap into, I have never heard of it, and the proposer does a poor job of explaining what it is, and what the value of this market would be, for Cardano or otherwise. \nOther Campaign guides start with phrases like \"Key Applications...\" \"Most profitable...\" etc, and again, this proposal just doesn't rise to that level at all.\n\nIf I am mistaken or there is more we should understand, I would encourage the proposer to try again, with more information. What is spiritual art? Are there links or examples for us to understand what you are describing? What is this market, and is the demand for this service real, or only hypothetical?", "q0r": 2, "q1": "There is no information provided in this section.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "There is no information provided in this section.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1180", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5660, "q0": "The problem statement and problem solution are clearly expressed in this proposal. While this proposal would potentially bring in new users, it's not clear how large this group of new users would be. Creating a platform for a \"closed community\" in my opinion should be funded by that closed community, and not the wider open community of cardano holders. I believe the idea has value, and I would like to see these artists working on Cardano, however it seems to contradict some of the open source values held by the funding community of ada holders. Furthermore the budget of $150,000 is alot to ask to deliver on this proposal, and this money could be used for funding other projects that are not closed off to the rest of the world and could have a larger impact on every ada holder. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The feasibility section of this proposal was not completed, therefore I can not rate it higher than 1 star. It does not appear that the proposer has a technical team in place that will be able to deliver on this concept proposal.

The proposer is not aware of all resources (human and non-human) needed for a successful implementation of the project.\n\nThe whitepaper has a timeline with achievable milestones but some of them seem that aren't completed yet (the NFT marketplace isn't launched as noornft.io is not functional)\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "No KPI/metrics are defined to measure the success of the proposal.\nAs it is, the proposal looks more like a concept than as a working product and it lacks in providing relevant information about its implementation.\n\nTo stand a chance for an objective assessment the proposer should provide all the required and relevant info for the implementation of the proposal.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_309", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Marketplace for spiritual verified artists allowing them to mint the physical art to NFT producing a phygital asset, with a digital gallery.", "experience": "25 yrs in information/cyber security & software development for FTSE 100 Companies.
