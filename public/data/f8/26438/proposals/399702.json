Overcoming the consequences of poverty and providing opportunities for the poor to raise funds for the acquisition of property - home / business / land ownership / physical assets / digital assets.\n\nAlthough I like the idea, it remains a good idea without the necessary attributes to become a feasible project.\n\nAt the next application I would recommend the applicant to gather an expert team of specialists to develop the idea and submit it in the form of a project proposal - measurable and achievable goals, activities ensuring the achievement of goals, description of necessary resources and processes, risk assessment and team expertise, measurable indicators to track progress.\n\nIt will also be useful to have described a clear, concrete benefit for the Cardano community from implementing such a proposal.\n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Detailed description of an action plan and timeline is must, in order for project application to be verified according its feasibility.

He has many ideas, but he is not defining  one that then orders him into the tasks that he has to fulfill to carry it out.\n \nThe proposer also does not make a serious budget for the same reason. It is impossible to define the cost of something if we do not know what it is.\n \nAnd although the proposer describes himself as a good candidate to realize this idea, he does not provide links that certify his skills and knowledge.\n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proposer does not write the milestones of the project or the kpis.
