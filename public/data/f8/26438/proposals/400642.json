If its the second once what does development mean, does it include marketing, minting,... Needs more info about that. The same could be said about the other budgets, I think the proposal is asking over what it could be done for. and if that\u00b4s not the case, we need information about how it will be spend. The proposal didn\u00b4t share much information about team members neither, only one website was shared, and didn\u00b4t provide any evidence that it is an existing business, website has no social medias neither.

I also don't see a whole lot of justification as to why this feature is worth $100k. First, I don't understand why a platform is needed for this. There needs to be a clarification as to why an organization could not simply clip their own live performances and mint that into an NFT via an NFT minting platform. It could be helpful to provide an analysis of CNFT competitors and explain why this project does it better than them. Then, they need to explain why this project does it SO much better than competitors that it warrants $100k. Essentially, I'm just not convinced of the positive impact. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "I do not see any blockchain experience on this team. This gives me some doubts about the team's capability to produce a product that directly interacts with the Cardano blockchain, which would definitely be necessary to be able to produce NFTs for clients. The explanation of the experience on the team is by far the most descriptive portion of this section because there's almost no information in the roadmap and budget portions of this section. The roadmap is lacking a lot of detail and is somehow too ambitious. The roadmap is basically 1. create the product (in just 1 month) 2. improve the product. 3. Test the product. All within a 4-month timeframe. Especially since I don't know much about what makes this product different from other NFT solutions, I'm really looking for details on how the product is built in specific details. The budget shares the same issue. It provides broad categories for how money is spent but does not go into the breakdown of labor costs, hardware costs, or marketing costs (which actually appear to be missing entirely). I am able to deduce some salaries if I assume full-time work and the entire budget goes to labor. NFT developers and project managers get $29/hr and developers get $21/hr. I don't dock points for being underpaid, so this is fine if my assumptions are correct. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "There's not much to work with here.

The proposer describes how this will be available to be sold and viewed on a metaverse. It is evident that the proposers first language isn\u2019t English as there was another language written in the proposal. Although it was difficult to understand the English translation, I do believe that this this idea identifies a problem within the challenge which needs to be solved. As a performer it was challenging to attract a large audience to our shows during a pandemic. By onboarding another method of viewing a live show this project\u2019s solution could be the answer. This project would also add value to the Cardano ecosystem if it their platform, metaverse and NFTs were integrated on the Cardano blockchain. There is no clarity on the goals of the project and no key metrics were used to align the proposal with the outlined settings. The future challenges and risks that were addressed were regulations and possible congestion issues on the Cardano blockchain. Although this can be true, the future challenges and risks that were mention are applicable to most projects in the Cardano ecosystem. It is would be more valuable if the proposer addressed the future risks and challenges more specific to their project i.e. music copyright issues, NFT exploitation and licensing difficulties.

What raises concern is that it was mentioned that they had many team members \u2013 and then it followed by only one member being presented in the proposal. Through describing what skills their team encompasses, it is evident that the proposer understands the type of team members needed to implement the proposal. The information of the roadmap was not detailed. Therefore, I wasn\u2019t able to gauge whether it was realistic for the team to meet their set timelines. It would have helped if the proposal had shown more specifics on what they will be implementing and developing in each phase. The requested budget is vague, it would\u2019ve given me more reassurance in the requested amount if it was properly broken down in specifics. For example, what does the \u20182 NFT development\u2019 entail? Is it to compensate designers or is it for equipment or both?
