Its deficiency leads to lost millions of dollars", "f6_no_assessments": 3, "f6_rating": 3.444444444444444, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 5250, "q0": "I am not convinced that this proposal aligns with Catalyst's mission to drive forward innovation and adoption. The main value proposition that this proposal offers is that it will drive forward the adoption of Cardano NFTs, which is a phenomenon that is already happening in a highly competitive space without this service interacting in a substantial way. I think $146k is a big price tag to pay for minimal impact. I'm kind of buying the research that they provide about interactivity with the creator having a substantial impact on NFT sales. But also, creators are doing this now on platforms like Discord and Twitter Spaces in a way that doesn't cost $146k. They also have widespread adoption in place, so technically this platform would be trying to compete with those platforms in this niche. Also, this idea isn't exactly unique to the Cardano NFT space because metaverse/NFT galleries are already being developed in multiple places. So, I don't think this platform would play a substantial role in driving forward the adoption and innovation of the Cardano space if it were to be approved. I gave this proposal a \"disagree\" instead of a \"strong disagree\" because I don't think there's any denying that they have the talent/experience to produce a working product (they already have). I think it's a good team, they just need a better idea OR a better presentation of the value proposition that it has to offer (in terms of innovation). ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The roadmap looks fine. I'm not a developer but 6 months sounds like a reasonable amount of time to create a working product. The development team looks fine. I have no doubts that the team has the required experience and education to make this product work. I do have some issues with the budget. As indicated in my previous concerns, $136k to produce a product that doesn't add anything substantially new/innovative to the Cardano NFT space is quite a waste of money. Specifically, in the area of the marketing budget, I have some concerns. Entering a highly competitive space with only 10% of the budget seems like a dangerous game. Then again, 10% of a very big price tag is a bit of a different story. $13k might be a solid amount to properly spread awareness and they certainly have the talent/experience that makes me think they do have a marketing strategy somewhere in the background. With a high price-tag ask, I definitely need to see the evidence of how they plan to make something like this happen. I want to see a budget breakdown of how that $13k will be spent to efficiently produce proper awareness. A completed project without competitive and widespread marketing is dead in the water and a massive waste of $146k. That's why I feel like I need that proof. My critical in the opinions in the impact section is likely affecting my opinions in this section, but my only real issue in this section is the transparency of the marketing strategy and assurance of reliable success. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "My philosophy on the auditability section (in most cases) is that the production of the completed product has absolutely nothing to do with the success and intended impact of the proposal. So, success metrics 1-3 don't mean much to me (especially 1 and 2). Success metrics 4 & 5 are strange to me, because I don't really feel like I have anything tangible to identify. They use percentages instead of objective metrics, which can mean anything. 15% of 100 people is just 15 people, which is definitely not worth $146k. There's also an interesting, yet vague, metric on the increase of NFT sales. I hope they mean NFT sales on their own platform because that's the only real measure of success as a result of their own platform. The overall NFT market is plenty likely to see more than a 10% increase in a 3 month time period and they can't reasonably take credit for that. My issue with metric #5 is the same as #4, which is that it's not a tangible metric. In this section, I feel like I don't have anything objective to vote favorably on and measure KPIs by. Given the high amount of requested funds, it might also be important to provide a source that is publicly accessible to measure success metrics and be accountable to the community. Overall, I think this proposal comes from a great team with high levels of talent and experience but is without a truly innovate and impactful idea.

The NFT market is certainly one that is rapidly scaling and the team have already shown early traction with their MVP Galaxy of Art which helps validate their ask for over $100,000. The NFT Exhibition proposal has identified and shown value-add across most areas of the challenge criteria, however the team doesn't quite get the full 5 stars due to not showing enough evidence or giving greater assurance to how it will \"attract users to the platform\" as set out in the challenge KPI's. This is due to less than 10% of the budget being spent on marketing, with the 90%+ going to development and project management. Those reservations are not intended to discredit the plan as many have achieved positive results with smaller budgets, however I did not see enough evidence of how that budget will be spent to bring greater confidence to the challenge KPI. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal scores very well in its feasibility test. Budget break down is clear, fair and addresses the needs to bring the project to life. Additionally the team are well experienced, bring existing success and have already deployed an MVP (plus others on an individual basis). The roadmap and timetable is suitably realistic, although it would be additionally helpful to have greater granularity to show how each person will complete their work. We are missing a little more detail on the architecture, language and overall technology they will be using and furthermore what technology (if any) an end user may need. We are missing information and detail regarding foreseeable risks or evidence that there are none and importantly why. That being said, it's not enough to change my opinion of agreeing this project will be implemented successfully, but I hope goes to justify my 4 star rating. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I feel this area is somewhat lacking in detail and comes across as more an afterthought in the proposal. To justify this, the first success metric presented is to \"Get funded in Fund8\" - this metric does not move the dial in value-add to the community and, whilst I can see that metric being important on a personal/team/internal level, it's not a useful one for the community. Additionally there seems to be some strong overlap between success metrics 2&3. Success metrics 4&5 are interesting as it's where we start to see value add to the Cardano community. I would have liked to see how the team will open this up as transparently as possible to ease auditing and keeping trust high. Overall I would have expected more detail to why and how metrics 4&5 will be achieved (touching on my point previously about marketing budget breakdown). Finishing on a positive note, the roadmap is clear with milestones and a timetable to achieve and I do expect the team to deliver the proposal. I'm neutral on the clarity provided to how auditable it is.
