It lays out a clear use case that fits the challenge, and then gives the voter a clear and concise explanation of how and what it is going to take to complete the proposal. They do acknowledge and inform us that they will need more time and funding than what will be given for this funding round. They do a good job at breaking things down for future funding rounds.

It dives in deep about the future roadmap of the proposal, far beyond one funding round. They are letting the community know what they expect to achieve for this funding round, and seem confident in their own ability to deliver on what they say. Based only on the information provided in the proposal, which i did not verify, the person i identify as the team lead is definitely   qualified to do the work and planning for the proposal. There is just a ton of information in this proposal. With a bunch of videos as well talking about the projects they have been involved with, and much more. If anyone is interested in the topic of DApps and integration, i highly recommend giving the proposal a full read through, and then taking a look at the other information posted.

The plan provided is comprehensive however, \u201ctentative timeline\u201d is somewhat confusing. Why tentative timeline? It looks like the timeline is not good enough for the execution as things can be done in a rush or in hesitancy.
