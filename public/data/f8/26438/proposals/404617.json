The overall ecosystem described in the proposal is expected to attract both end users and the development of future projects on Cardano.\n\nThe intent to collaborate with and add features to an existing wallet is an efficient and durable solution to the problem. If this avenue of development is successful (alternatives are considered and discussed in the proposal), exposure to an existing user base will come with any wallets which collaborate with the team.\n\nThe big-picture general discussion of DAOs aligns with the goals of Cardano broadly, the challenge, as well as Project Catalyst itself. Parallel innovation in decentralized governance alongside Catalyst is likely to encourage robust diversity in problem solving. The proposers' intent to keep their IP open and shared boosts confidence in this regard.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal outlines multiple paths development may take. Understandably, no specific wallet has been identified to collaborate with, and no existing agreement is described, necessitating flexibility in the plan to implement the proposal.

This does require leaving some detail open, however.\n\nThe shared credentials and identities of the team highlights their capacity to seek collaboration or improvise if needed.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The specific criteria listed and the indicators described offer a picture of how the project may be tracked if funded.

There is a too simple cost worksheet, that doesn\u2019t contain all costs (eg. Infrastructure, cloud license, etc.)\nThe plan for implementation could have been a bit more specific, but as it is now it's good enough as well.

The proposer addresses the problem of \"A lot of the community members no voting because of the complexity or illiterate about the voting procedure\". There are a lot of CA and VCAs who would want to go past the assessment state and vote for their favorite proposals, also go through others' reviews and see what they have been missing and on what areas they could improve on. This proposal could add a lot of value to the Cardano chain and also to the individual community members. The quality of reviewing and also the quality of proposals are eventually going to improve. This proposal addresses a lot more issues than the ones in the current campaign's brief. It tries to improve the community advisors, also induce a lot of responsibility in community members and their wallet itself could act as a community hub to share important notifications and updates to the users.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As strong the initiative is, the action plan also looks solid. However, the milestones in the manifesto look a little feeble even though they are pretty sleek. The proposer keeps his/her game plan very compact abstracting a lot of unnecessary detailing. But for some readers, it might be underwhelming, and would have liked a little more information on what is the kind of technology the team is using and the amount of groundwork or preliminary coding already done, this would have added some points to the team's credibility. But nonetheless, the points are pretty self-explanatory. The same applies to the budget breakdown too. A minute detail justifying the amount assigned to each sub-topics such as \"Wallet Development Contract\" would have been useful. In spite of all the above indications, the team put together looks very strong on paper along with the skills they are expected to fulfill. Hence, I think a score of 4 out of 5 would the necessary justice.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer provides the community with the necessary tracking mechanisms required to keep an eye on the development process of the project. The usual git commits and reports from the weekly meetings should suffice to track the implementation activities. The success criteria are also crafted excellently keeping in mind only the campaign's expectations and the kind of issue the team is trying to solve. All the success metrics look transparent and on point. The A2T proposal submitted in the Gamers on-chained (if funded) would add a lot of new capabilities to the product and in turn increase its success. Other features such as multi-browser and multilingual support are triumphant features to look forward to. The proposal coming into this round with a lot of modules already funded and prepared, along with many proposals submitted in this funding round can sure make a collective impact and the team since is a proven member of the society, there is no doubt that it will provide all necessary assistance to make sure the auditing process turns out to be smooth and prolific.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1594", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 3, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6624, "q0": "This proposal aims to create a wallet voting dapp for  DAO (decentralized autonomous organization).
