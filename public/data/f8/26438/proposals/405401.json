Most users on Cardano would love to see the value of their assets within their given wallets. This would make for easier decisions while using wallet.

The proposed solution is an open source tool that provides price information on-chain and that can integrate with wallets. \nThe proposal argues that this solution will boost decentralization, solve the problem of relying on the price from a single DEX instead of another by aggregating prices from multiple DEX\u2019s and it would also feed this information to oracles, enabling it to be used by sidechains or layer 2 protocols, like Milkomeda. Furthermore, it would enable new kinds of dApps to be built (it would have been interesting to find out particular examples here).\nThe proposers have also thought about two risks, namely that the DEX's their Oura tool integrates with could fail, being still relatively new, or they could change how they work, requiring them to update their tool as well. The approach to mitigating these risks relies on the tool\u2019s success: since it will be open source, it will be in the interest of the community to maintain and update it, as long as it\u2019s useful. The proposers also intend on developing it further after they finish what they set out to do in this proposal.\nAll in all, I think this proposal definitely addresses the Dapps and Integrations challenge effectively, as it would help boost Cardano\u2019s ecosystem further with new tech (score: 5).\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap provided by the proposal is a bit simple and only stretches into Q3 of 2022, but it gives a decent image of what the proposal aims to accomplish (integration with 2, maybe 3 DEX\u2019s). I think it would also have been useful here to provide details on how Q4 would look like (a retrospective and analysis of how the tool is used, for example, what quick improvements can be made to it etc).\nThe budget is broken down into development costs and infrastructure costs and is very reasonable for this proposal in my opinion, at only 45000 USD. Blockchain developers are very expensive and if the team here were inexperienced, I would say it might even be low, but the proposers of this project are dcSpark, a well known and respected company in the blockchain space. I expect they are good at estimating their costs and possibly also have other sources of funding as well (if this is the case, it\u2019s always good to mention in the proposal, as it raises voters\u2019 trust that one way or another, this proposal will be done).\nMy only observation here is that the proposers should have provided a link to their site, a very short list of the projects they\u2019ve successfully delivered / tools they\u2019ve built (again with references), etc. It\u2019s very useful for voters to have the relevant links inside the proposal, instead of having to google information about the team themselves (it\u2019s highly unlikely the majority of voters takes the time to do that).\nThat being said, I think it is highly likely for this proposal to be implemented, as dcSpark has a lot of experience with Cardano dApps and the tool they propose to build here seems to be fairly simple (score: 5).\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is a bit lacking in the Auditability section. It mentions that progress will be measured by the team\u2019s ability to integrate DEX\u2019s into this price feed system, which is of course an important metric, but it does not present key progress indicators that can be tracked until the end goal is reached.\nFor example, the team could approximate a number of commits per week / month in the project\u2019s github, which can serve as clear evidence that progress is being made.\nAlso, the proposers mentioned that success would look like many projects using their solution, but this is a vague target.\nWhat voters want to see in the Auditability section is clear numbers that can be publicly tracked and which unequivocally show that a goal has been met. For example: within the first month of the solution being complete, have 1 project using this tool; 3 after 2 months etc.\nAgain, however, the tool dcSpark proposes to build seems straightforward and due to their reputation, I am quite confident that it will be easy to collaborate with them and obtain the information needed to audit the progress of this proposal. I am giving a score of 4 here, since we rely more on the company\u2019s reputation than the information provided in the proposal.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_546", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal very successfully makes the case of why the entire ecosystem would benefit from having self-hosted token price feeds for Cardano wallets. The resulting improvements to decentralization and providing reliable information to end-users will undoubtedly have a very positive impact. \n\nIf the project described in this proposal is implemented, it will definitely make DEXs and DeFi in general, more accessible and more credible to many.\n\nI see this proposal as perfectly integrating with the goals of the DApps and Integrations challenge and the overarching goals of Catalyst Fund 8.\n\nThe risks and challenges that may arise during the development of this project are also very well described and addressed by the team proving a very thorough understanding of the project they are proposing.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The implementation plan is solid and it suggests that the first deliverables of the project should be ready by Q3 2022.\n\nBecause the dcSpark team has already developed a wallet in addition to multiple other technical products for the Cardano blockchain I view the implementation of this proposal as very feasible.\n\nThe budget breakdown contains only two lines but given the scope of the project that should be sufficient for now as they describe personnel and infrastructure costs. I would have liked to see an hourly rate attached to the development costs but under the circumstances, I view that as a minor omission, and I won't be deducting from my feasibility score for that.\n\ndcSpark, the submitters of this proposal, has a great reputation in the Cardano community as a team that works tirelessly to improve and make contributions to many aspects of the technical side of the ecosystem.

Most people tend to check or track the value of their assets quite frequently, this feature will give more motivation to adopt blockchain native dApps, which in line to the objective of this and add promote adoption as bonus. I am sure everyone in community would love to see this same feature to our AMM DEXs such as SundaeSwap and MinSwap.

Sebastian himself is one of the people in our community who actually and highly understands Ouroboros whitepaper well, as testified by Charles in one of his Twitter Spaces.
