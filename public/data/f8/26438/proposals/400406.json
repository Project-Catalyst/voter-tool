It looks modern, with a clean look. \nWhen delving deeper, it seems like most of the analysis is price-centric (as expected) with the exception of risk analysis which looks quite useful for any NFT investor.\n\nInteresting enough, I don't see the sentiment/social media analysis in the screenshots. Even though they mention in the first paragraph that the MVP will include it, the feature is mentioned only in the Phase 3 in their Feasibility section (which isn't even a part of the proposal, from what I understand).\n\nSo, the reason for 4 stars is basically:\n (1) I feel the webapp, as I understand it, will be useful for Cardano, but\n (2) there is unclarity regarding the sentiment analysis; they claim it will be implemented within this proposal, however it is not in the budget?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The general feeling is that the authors know what they are talking about and have the required resources and skill sets to see this project through.\n\nThey have explained some parts of their proposals with enough (technical) detail, but other parts they not.\nFor example: I would expect way more detail about the machine learning feature for risk analysis, since it will take half of the proposed budget. From the current screenshots it is not apparent that a machine-learning technique was used. I'm guessing that they will work on this, but it is unclear.\n\nPhase 1 and 3 are not specific to this proposal. Or at least they have not made it clear in what way are they a part of the proposal.\n\nPhase 1 mentions the current state (mid-March is directly stated) of the product which supports only Ethereum at this moment. The Success metrics are therefore not applicable since they concern the Ethereum MVP and not the Cardano extension. \nThey should have reworded it differently, in order to make it clearer.\n\nPhase 2 is what I consider the crux of the proposal and I find it well written. Concise and understandable.\n\nPhase 3 indicates further development which is not a part of the proposal.\n\nThen they continue with the budget which is not detailed at all.\nThe most problematic is the budget (as well as the lack of explanation) assigned for machine learning.\n\nThey mention 8 additional personnel, yet we know nothing about them and if they are already employed, and if they will work on the Ethereum MVP, on the Cardano expansion or both?\n\nAll-in-all: I believe they will probably successfully develop the product, but there is some unclarity in this proposal, which makes it tough to assess. I have to go with my gut-feeling on this one.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "They have provided some time horizon, but no concrete milestones.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't seem like it is an open-source project, but it was also not mandated in this category that it has to be one.\n\nSince it will be a public and free webapp, but not open-source, it will be only partly verifiable. \nConcretely:\n - MVP launch (publicly available).\n - Cardano NFTs are integrated into the service.\n - All Cardano NFTs Data indexed with real-time blockchain sync up.\n\nNot verifiable:\n - whether they are using a state-of-the-art machine-learning technique for risk analysis, or a simple rule-based technique.\n - 10,000 collectibles analysed (user requests) in the first month after MVP release.\n - 10,000 Cardano collectibles analysed by users.\n - 1 mln. Cardano NFTs analysis requests by users per month\n - 200,000 unique Cardano wallets connected\n - 100,000 unique Ethereum users (wallets connected)\n - 100,000 visits per month to Cardano marketplaces from checkNFT.io per month\n - 5,000 Cardano NFTs analysed by the ETH users (initially ETH NFT analysed then Cardano NFT).", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_832", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Proposal has been carefully written as all information related to the solution is provided.

Thus this could be a very important step to preserve the confidence of the new adapters of blockchain products until the governments come to a consensus on the terms to regulate bitcoins.

I do like the idea very much but I expect minimal impact to adoption from ETH NFTs to Cardano NFTs. I think this proposal is missing a couple of key challenges to accomplish this impact. First, ETH NFTs generate a way higher ROI than Cardano NFTs. This is an objective metric that keeps people in ETH NFTs. Second, a lot of ETH people hate Cardano, unreasonably. Third, there are additional barriers to making that transition that includes converting all assets from one chain to another (at least before bridges are completed). While I do think there are advantages on Cardano, like fees, policy ID verification, and easier whitelisting (for now), I don't think this proposal addresses any of those issues. There are also a lot of \"what ifs\" that it takes for this platform to achieve any level of adoption, aside from the concerns I raised above. What if this analytics platform doesn't get a lot of usage? What if ETH NFTs explode even more and the analytics show ETH NFTs as the better pick? I think I need to see better arguments as to why this project will make the impact they are aiming for. I'm just not convinced.

The development team is small but impressive. They've worked for Microsoft and Intel. They have 18+ years of experience developing software and 9 years in blockchain EACH. There's no doubt in my mind that they can accomplish the roadmap. The roadmap more outlines at what point feature completion will happen, as opposed to what/how things will be done along the way (which is fine, I'm not a software engineer). Where I raise some questions of concern is in the budget. This is an expensive budget, all of which looks quite reasonably spent except for $25k to \"Machine learning for risk analysis and fraud and scam alerts on Cardano.\" This may just be what it costs for this kind of feature but I need to know exactly why. Is it a lot of labor? Is it hardware/upkeep costs? These are details I need to see. Everything up to this point is fantastic. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditibility looks great.

The stated goal of having 100,000 visits per month to Cardano marketplaces from checkNFT.io in 1 years time, if accomplished will have a significant impact on Cardano use and adoption.

Some are actively involved in the space and are enthusiastic about Cardano NFTs while most are simply not interested. So then the question becomes not \u201chow do we make them aware of their existence?\u201d, but rather \u201chow do we get them interested?\u201d. Does the proposed solution accomplish this? Perhaps it could, but the proposal itself has left me unconvinced. Especially because the proposal treats NFTs strictly as an investment and its aim is to build a tool to facilitate investment. But the truth is that strictly as investments NFTs on other chains have a much better potential for returns, as such NFTs on Cardano have to differentiate themselves in other aspects to be able to draw attention.\n\nThere are quite a few claims made in this proposal for which no source is given.
