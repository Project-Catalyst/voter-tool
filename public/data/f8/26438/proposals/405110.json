This increases the functionality and potential number of use-cases for cardano and NFT's. The KPI's are aligned with the challenge question: what does success look like? \"Novel and viable applications get built of top of Cardano attracting users. Integrations manage to pull in more adoption.\" I believe this additional use case can bring more business and use cases to Cardano. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team are highly skilled and experienced game developers.

In this instance, ask for funds to build a private IPFS cluster and a DApp called The Revelar Gate, which would allow NFT projects to be built cheaper and faster.\nI have to admit that this proposal is very specific and technical and even though I have over 7 years of experience in the IT industry, I do not yet know enough about how NFT\u2019s are created and what the issues in that space are for my opinion here to be very pertinent.\nI can only comment on how the proposal is written and what information is provided, and in that respect, it\u2019s comprehensive as every Revelar proposal I come across. Regarding risks, the proposers identified 3: \n- this solution, by nature, will introduce a certain degree of centralization, in the form of this service being owned by Revelar, but to mitigate this, the tech will be open sourced in the long term\n- nft standard changes, meaning that currently the standard is CIP-025, but if this changes, it will have to be addressed in the future\n- software delays, which are a risk in any software project, but as a way to mitigate this, Revelar plans to re-use existing tech and they are also partnered with a company called Excellarate, which they can obtain developers from on demand.\nAll in all, in my opinion, I think this proposal effectively addresses the DApps and integrations Challenge. Score: 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers state that the deliverable here is an MVP of the above mentioned app and they also list the functionalities which will be expected to work, so this helps with auditability as well.\nThe timeline is outlined in a professional way through something that as a person with over 7 years of experience in IT I love to see: sprint planning. We are presented with the tasks for the next 12 sprints (2 weeks each for 24 weeks in total) in a very detailed manner.\nWe are also given a very good breakdown of the budget in weeks and cost per hour, my only observation being the calculations seem to be for 12 weeks, instead of 12 sprints. This is only half of the time needed to complete the proposal? Perhaps the rest is covered through other funding methods available to the company. I would recommend that the details here be explicitly stated, however, to avoid any confusion. I will also mention that even though the entire requested amount is large (105250 USD), it\u2019s less than 5% of the DApps and integrations total available amount and I think it\u2019s reasonable for the complex tasks they are undertaking.\nRegarding the team, we are provided with proper descriptions and social links for the company\u2019s CEO, CTO and CCO. The fact that we are not given the profiles of the developers should not be concerning in my opinion, because it\u2019s up to Revelar to do resource allocation based on their workload and which projects get funded, etc. It\u2019s a common practice for companies (note: *companies*, not small projects and initiatives) to not name specific developers in Catalyst proposals (other examples include Five Binaries and dcSpark.\nTo sum up everything I analyzed above, I believe that this proposal is likely to be implemented successfully. Score: 5.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For Auditability, as usually Revelar provided us with their website (https://catalyst.revelar.co), where they post regular updates on all their Catalyst proposals. As they deliver open source software, the appropriate repositories will also be synced with this Gitbook. We are not given specific KPI\u2019s, but the demos at the end of each sprint will be made public, so that will be a tremendous help with the progress of the project.\nThis proposal will be considered a success if Revelar manages to deliver the MVP outlined in the Feasibility section and as a concrete target, they expect to have 35 unique \u201cgates\u201d (or projects) being created during the launchpad which starts in Sprints 10-11.\nRevelar has historically been very transparent and easy to reach, so I believe that with the information they have provided and with their openness, the community can easily audit this project\u2019s progress and success.

In case a particular media has to be private protected by secure encryption. IPFS may not be the ideal solution since without pinning it to a specific node that has the decryption capability, the media is lost. Therefore the proposal is for centralised storage; There is a need for more technical details to explain why this process is selected since there is a much better way to secure data in a centralised manner. The proposal also needs to bring out who will have the capability to decrypt the data.
