No information is provided on any effort/research into short-listing appropriate persons.  Essentially the proposal\u2019s success hinges on acquiring these unspecified Cardano specialists.

No details are provided about successfully launched NFT projects through the platform.  It is not possible to confirm degree of the platform\u2019s development or automation by viewing the website provided.  Is the platform\u2019s backend advanced beyond staff manually minting NFT\u2019s based on a client\u2019s criteria list?\n\nThe proposal provides a detailed timeline and budget spanning 13 weeks.

Or does it check what NFTs a wallet holds and allows the user to claim tokens?\n\nMy guess for what happens: 1) NFT project like Clay Mates wants to distribute tokens so they work with Canucks Publishing. 2) Holder of their NFT connects wallet to claim portal, sees balance available, and claims token. Having a rare NFT, the user gets more tokens than a user with a Common NFT. My question is, why go through this service instead of just airdropping the tokens into the wallet, the way it was done by Pavia, Filthy Rich Horses, and Adaverse?\n\nThis proposal would benefit from clearer communication as it is hard to rate the impact of the project without fully understanding what it aims to do.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team has great experience working in Cardano.
