The proposal does identify the challenge of providing a means to support a living wage and the conceptual thought on how to achieve this seems reasonable however the proposer needs to provide a plan which clearly identifies a successful path and the team/resources which can achieve success.  The proposal has too many unanswered questions such as will tax donations work? Is the volunteer DevOps capable? How the NFT approach will work? I think with additional expertise this proposal could be successful in another Fund.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer has provided an outline of the major steps however this should be provided in a roadmpa associated with a specific timeline (ie Month 1 \u2013 build website domain, design receipt NFT, Month 2 \u2013 identify stake pools, etc.).  By creating a specific timeline the proposer can associate KPIs.  Considering the scope of the project I am not confident the team is sufficient enough to successfully complete.  I would suggest reducing the funding request to get a portion of the project built first (e.g. design receipt NFT) to demonstrate success or to engage an experienced team willing to provide a services on a volunteer basis or low cost.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposer has not provided enough details on trackable KPIs along with a method in which those KPIs will be communicated.

It is funded much like an endowment which means it\u2019s going to take a lot of money to make it happen. Let\u2019s say the goal is to initially provide $12,000 a year per person that increases gradually to keep up with inflation, an average return of 7%, of which 5% will be distributed and 2% reinvested. That would mean $240,000 in the endowment fund to provide basic income to one person to onboard to Cardano and this proposal is only requesting for $50,000. While it is a noble goal, perhaps this might not be the best way forward. Just a thought, but having come across Harmony\u2019s ZKDAO where they provide a decentralized basic income to developers who meet certain growth milestones for their product and number of users, this might be a better way to onboard more people to Cardano via basic income. The wealth generated by all those developers who are able to keep churning out products that attracts lots of users might actually be a faster way to a truly universal basic income.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Both team members seem to have the experience required to build it out, having worked at Google and DoorDash for years.

(\"What needs do users of Cardano have that could be solved by new applications?\" is one of it)\n\nThe proposal seems that is not able to scale and to address future challenges.
