I suggest the proposer provides a chart or a statistic about the cost of problem such as the computing capacity, scalability.\n\nThe proposal solves the problem stated but the solution as a whole does not stand out as unique. Its impact will be improved if the proposer justify that the server rack is the best solution to deliver the benefits for Cardano community such as: why DGX A100 is the best choice (workload), why only 7 nodes needed (decentralization),... Meanwhile Cardano encourages decentralization and scalability, this solution seems to cost much and cause centralized risks.\nData center locations is the main challenge that the proposal mentioned but has not given out solutions for them. It'd be better if the proposer give out some more risks and ways to mitigate them such as: all 7 deployed nodes still could not meet the computing workload, centralization risks encountering if depend on only 7 nodes,...\n\nIn generally, I doubt about the impact of this proposal.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The Author plays role as a Systems Architect and Project Manager but I could not find relevant capacity information for success proposal.

Because this is an AI workload, not provide AI services so it's better if the Author consider to fill experience gaps in network and security experts for building and operating your hardware first.\n\nThis proposal just need budget for one NVIDIA DGX-A100 to try building a not-for-profit Decentralized AI System first so it is easily understand if missing breakdown. But I wonder why the Author just care towards it meanwhile there are many server solutions for AI Infrastructure such as: IBM, Dell,... And why we don't try to use another solutions to share workload on global cloud server to see and evaluate workloads required first, the DFINITY Foundation for example? Besides, this required budget is suitable for incorporated technology or blockchain companies and larger projects with competent teams that already have deployed MVPs.\n\nAll things that the proposer needs now is just a hardware but he didn't provide any measurable set of KPIs. I suggest to give out some KPIs such as: completed AI workload server, number of RealFi or Decentralized Social Media Platform running on,...\n\nIt is also missing the marketing strategy to attract Fintech and AI solution enterprises to know your available infrastructure and joining to try workload by what kind of media and advertising campaign.\n\nFinally, I doubt about the feasibility of this proposal and hope it'll be well improved in next funds.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "It's a pity that roadmap are not listed in this proposal for community tracking.
