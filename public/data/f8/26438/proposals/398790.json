The idea is well summarized in the following excerpt: \u201cEmpower merchants with the easy-to-use Mobile App and DApp to receive payment for goods and services in cryptocurrency as an alternative payment method without additional hardware or software.\u201d That is, the proponent suggests creating a platform that helps small entrepreneurs, as he mentioned in the examples, coffee shop owners, small shops, workshops, etc., to learn how to receive payment for their products or services in the form of cryptocurrencies. This is really something quite revolutionary, my impression is that most of the proposals of this challenge aim to reach startups, entrepreneurs in the technology sector or a more niche audience. Really, we need to focus on who is likely to adopt our blockchain technologies because they already have some knowledge of this technology; with this audience, adoption is more likely to be well accepted. However, I also think it's super important that we invest in ordinary people, those who still don't understand what blockchain is and what are the advantages of working with cryptocurrencies. Most people think that cryptocurrencies are just quick and easy ways to get rich, which we know is not true. In fact, our currency is subject to wide variations, we do have the possibility of making a profit if Ada appreciates, however, the focus here is to help people understand the application of blockchain in everyday life, benefiting at the same time these people and also increasing Cardano's popularity. This challenge aims precisely at that, to promote Dapps that invest in the expansion of the technologies of our ecosystem, and in the present case this would certainly be possible if more people started to market their products or services with our cryptocurrency. I believe that the project, if done properly, would be a solid gateway for new users active in our community, as at first they would be seeking their own benefit with this project; and so, organically, they would increase the reach and use of technologies relevant to Cardano. It is very positive how the proponent explains what the advantages would be for merchants in adopting cryptocurrencies, this demonstrates that he already clearly knows how he will captivate them to adopt this initiative. The two observations I would like to make about the impact of this proposal are: it would be positive if the author made it clear that the cryptocurrency in question would be Ada and only Ada, since at no point in the detailing of the proposal is this stated; It would also be nice if he made it clearer which digital wallets he would work with, since we have the official wallets on our blockchain (Yoroi and Daedalus, for example), so it would be more beneficial for Cardano if these were the options used in the project. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unfortunately, the information given by the bidder about the roadmap is very vague. All we know is that the \u201cproject will take 3 months to 5 months to develop / AND a few more months for promotion and testing\u201d. However, it would be necessary for the proponent to inform what would happen each month. Of course, it will be 3 to 5 months of production, but what activities will be developed and in what order? How long would each action take to develop, who would do what? Within these 3 to 5 months, what are the expectations for partial deliveries? Anyway, I think the way the process is described is very superficial and inadequate, I suggest that the proponent, first of all, divide this time interval into months and score what is planned to be done in each of them. The more detail, the better, in fact, the more explanations are described about the activities, we, the readers of the proposal, will be able to form a more solid understanding of the development process, the steps that would need to be fulfilled for the realization of the whole. Regarding the funding requested, 162 thousand dollars (a very high amount!), I think this part is much better than the script. We know which parts the total amount would be divided into (Software Architecture and Design / Software Development / Database Development / etc) as well as the amount of work hours that would be spent in each of these areas and the price per hour of work of those involved. I think the understanding of how the money would be used is very clear, it is up to the Cardano community to determine whether the asking amount is fair or exorbitant - information to conclude that, we have. Finally, speaking of the team, the presentation of each team member is quite adequate, as we know their names, areas of professional activity and also some examples of previous work they have already performed. They also provide their resumes, so that we can confirm all the information said. I think the only question that could have been better addressed is each professional's relationship with the Cardano ecosystem - are they active members of our community? if so, in what way? Do they invest in Ada, do they already have digital wallets, buy CNFT, use any of our Dapps? This relationship is not clear, and in my view it is essential that we know about this information, because that way we would have more security in relation to the preparation of the team to work with the technologies of our ecosystem. Therefore, I think that the feasibility of the project is average, with some points to improve (the script, mainly) and another very detailed part (budget). \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability of the progress appears to be adequate, as the proponent states that the work of building the Dapp can be followed through the website provided (http://payecrypto.com). However, I went to the site and they ask you to register, I think it would be more interesting if this wasn't necessary, because maybe Cardano community members who want to check how the development process is going don't necessarily want to link to the project, just monitor it. I also think it would be necessary for the proponent to better specify what content would be made available on this site and how often it would be updated. However, the idea is correct, this is what I usually suggest as a way of auditing the proposals, creating a solid bridge between the team and their work together with the Cardano community. What is missing here is just to understand the characteristics of this bridge. Now talking about the final results, the auditability of this part is based on the following aspects: \u201cWide adaptation of our application / High number of registered users / Easy to use by the small company in daily payments\u201d. Again, I believe this is the way to go, but the proponent should have explained how exactly they are going to verify this data and transmit it to the Cardano community. How can we understand the real impact of this Dapp on the lives of small business owners? In my opinion, it would be necessary for a survey to be carried out directly with them, and the results to reach our community through the elaboration of a final report, for example, to be made available in some of the various media of the Cardano community. It is also necessary for us to understand what was the impact of all this for our blockchain, in fact, more people have become adepts of our currency, have created smart wallets, are they actively engaging with the possibilities found in Cardano? In my view, there was a lack of depth on how all this data will be collected and presented to the Cardano community. Therefore, I think auditability is well underway, but it needs more detail and clarity as to how we members of this ecosystem will stay abreast of all updates and information on the final results. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 498, "q0": "Making it easy for merchants at the most granular scale to accept cryptocurrency payments is a good and clear problem to identify for this challenge. \n\nOn the other hand, the words \"Cardano\" or \"ADA\" are literally never mentioned in this proposal. In fact it's clear that the end-solution is intended to be currency-agnostic, to some degree. While that's fine in theory, this campaign is specifically about Dapps that will make an impact for CARDANO, and this proposal avoids that topic completely. \n\nAlso concerning is the though given in the \"Risks\" section -- or specifically the lack of thought. They raise the risk that merchants may not want to accept cryptos because they are volatile. This is a good point and an accurate risk. The only solution offered by the proposers is that merchants must do their own research and decide which cryptos to accept. So again, we are not discussing Cardano at all here, and also we have no real idea how to mitigate risk and fear of the unknown to aide with adoption.\n\nPersonally I don't know the answers to these questions either, but an impactful proposal will be one with some great ideas that could solve it.

This proposal presents neither.\n\nThe team looks to have appropriate backgrounds, although I'd love to know if there is crypto-specific experience among them.\n\nI might advise a phased approach for this project - a smaller proposal to research and design the solution might have stronger legs.

The Solution offered by this proposal does not explain why a mobile app solution is required for business owners, and it does not clarify if the solution is going to transfer crypto directly to the business owner, or convert the customers crypto into to fiat at the time of purchase. This is an important consideration, along with crypto volatility and taxation and the legal reporting implications for both the customer and the business owner. I believe it is these legal considerations that have delayed mass adoption and development of apps like this one, and for this proposal to have a large impact, the proposal should address the legal frameworks of the countries this app will be used in.

This may just be a placeholder on the website, but it does not give me confidence that this team will be able to deliver as promised.
