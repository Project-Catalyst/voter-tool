In general, the proposer aims to create a new platform, it was not very clear to me whether it would be a mobile or computer application, which would be a combination of what we find on job offer/search sites, such as linkedin, and social networks where people could research and keep up to date on blockchain. The advantage for the Cardano ecosystem would be that this platform would be developed on our blockchain, there would be smart contracts and ways to invest in Ada through pools, which would have different functionality between customers/users and companies. The summary of the idea, at least what I understood, is this. Comparing this proposal with the objectives of the present challenge, I think it is very accurate, fitting with mastery into what we seek to achieve in the challenge. Our goal here is to fund Dapp projects that are beneficial to Cardano, that increase the number of transactions on our blockchain, buy and sell Ada and involve, in one way or another, new people in the most diverse technologies of our ecosystem. I think this proposal would do these things, since: 1) the intention here is to create an online space where people looking for a job in the technology area can have access to real opportunities, without falling into a scam, while at the same time those looking to hire professionals can get in touch with their candidates and prove their training and experiences in a non-violating way 2) a place would also be created that would bring together all the social networks and sites that involve the cryptographic world, such as those to consult the price of coins, for example 3) on top of that it would be a good incentive for investments in Ada, through pools. I confess that I understood the users better, they would be paying for access to special resources on the site, about the pool for companies, I found the explanation more difficult. In that sense, the proposal is very good and makes a lot of sense for the objectives of the challenge, but I have a few things to note. Even with effort I found the description of the proposal difficult to understand, I am CA has 4 funds and I am already familiar with several terms in the cryptographic universe and the technologies that surround it, but I have no training in anything that involves technology itself. I believe that CAs, vCAs and voters with a profile similar to mine may have a little difficulty understanding this proposal fully, so I would suggest that the proposer explain the technical parts in a more accessible way for everyone. The complexity of the project worries me a little, as the proponent would be able to gather so many things and utilities in a single application. Other than that, I think the proposal is quite relevant and has a certain impact. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proponent details the tasks to be carried out to carry out the project, but I would like to comment on two things. The first is that, as with the explanation of the idea in impact, several tasks are very technical and complex, so it would be interesting for the author of the proposal to include a small, simple and accessible explanation of what they mean and what they are for in the process as one all. This would serve as a leveling-off for all readers, it's true that this challenge has several very technical proposals but I think it even meets Cardano's goals to make everything as democratic as possible, so the better the number of people who understand and can evaluate this and the other proposals better. Would it also be important for him to align this list of tasks with a temporal notion, that is, how long would each of them take to be done? Most proposals divide the entire development into phases, and the more broken down the better. For example, phase one could encompass the months of May, June and July. The two, August and September (just an example). These months could be divided into weeks, so that the understanding of the process was complete. Regarding the budget, I found the value very fair for the complexity of the project and what needs to be done to make it happen. The author asks for 10k, and explains that part would go to development and part to marketing. It would be interesting for him to better explain the marketing strategies and who would be responsible for it, because I noticed that he does not have any professional in this area working on the project, which I think is a problem, this proposal is based on creating a targeted platform to the public, so you need to make sure that these people know about the project and are attracted to using the platform. And finally about the team's explanation, from what I understand there are 2 people involved: the proponent, who has experience with blockchain and e-commerce, and another developer who also has experience working with Cardano. The detailing here could be more in-depth too: a more complete explanation could be made about those involved, providing some kind of proof of what is said (for example, the other developer has a connection with a University, could we see it on that institution's website? the profile of this professional?). Your linkedin profiles would also be most welcome. Other than that, I'm worried about who will do the design and marketing parts, which are just as important as the computing parts, in my opinion. Overall I think the feasibility conveys confidence, although it can be improved. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The author gives us some specific objectives to be achieved in this project so that it can be considered successful. I believe that the most appropriate thing would be for some members of the Cardano community who understand the technologies being developed here to establish a direct contact and period with the proponent, in order to verify both the process and the results and bring this feedback in a simplified way to the rest of the project. community. This can be done based on the information provided by the author, both in relation to the process and the results. About the process: it can be perceived based on the data provided in the previous topic of feasibility, the tasks to be performed. This would be done more safely if we were told how long each task would have to be done, as I mentioned earlier. And the results could be measured based on the information provided here in the auditability, it would be interesting for all of this to be gathered and taken to the rest of the community on a regular basis. From what I could understand this project would not be fully covered in fund 8, but I think it's better when a proponent asks for a portion of the money in a fund and delivers results before wanting more funding. In this sense, I believe in the auditability of the proposal, as long as there is specialized monitoring by the Cardano community. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2015, "q0": "This is a huge challenge in the Cardano community. Even in the whole crypto space. There are a lot of people out there that are very passionate about crypto with lots of skills that could help grow the space. However, there is a lack of places to go to find careers in this space. I give this section of the proposal 4 out of 5 stars because I find that it is an important challenge in the community and Link Start could be one of the beginning stages of addressing this problem. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This individual has a good amount of experience in this space. I think that it could be useful to create a small team of developers to help with this proposal so that it can be implemented successfully. Cardano focuses a lot on the community and working together can always be beneficial. However, it can still be done by a single individual. It would also be nice to see more people coming into this space and working on this proposed idea. I still give this section 4 out of 5 stars, but I would like to see further adoption of the idea and more of a team working in this space. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The information provided in this proposal is very specific and detailed. I enjoyed reading through the roadmap/plans because it gives specifics on what is going to be done. Something that could make it better is to include an estimated timeframe of completion for each of the ideas. This will help the community to see what the plans are and when they expect it to be completed. This will help ensure that the team is accountable for what they are proposing. The detailed budget breakdown is specific and easy to read. It is not necessary, but you could maybe even write a very brief description in the funding areas. For example where it shows the $5,000 for Dapp development, the writer of the proposal could share why it cost that much. Just so that everyone is aware of where the funding could go. For these reasons, I give this section 4 out of 5 stars. ", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1448", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5202, "q0": "I'm torn. I'm not THAT impressed with the level of innovation that this project seems to provide. It feels kind of like a derivative concept that just operates on the blockchain. Then again, that is still kind of innovative and I could imagine it being an attractive place to go for Cardano developers and other blockchain-based professionals. It's also only a $10k request, so it's not really expensive for most Catalyst requests. I do feel like I need some clarity on the staking to access mechanism. I'm not sure if it requires users to stake to the pools owned by this organization OR just staking to ADA in general. If it's the former, I don't have a whole lot of confidence in the success of this project because I would bet people are more likely to flock to the best yield they can manage (and chase ISPOs). I don't think they will find this service to be worth giving up their freedom to choose their stake when they can also utilize services from LinkedIn. It may benefit this project to produce metrics on how much interest is being generated amount Cardano professionals so that we can see some more assured success. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There are 2 first-priority factors that I look at to determine if the proposal gets a passing score. First, a roadmap that shows me that there is a preconceived strategic plan to make this project happen. This proposal does an ok job at producing that. The roadmap is not as detailed as I would like it to be in timeframe and tasks to be accomplished but it's passable. The second is the development team's credentials, which this project omits from the proposal. The only information we get is the brief few sentences at the very beginning of the proposal, which bears no weight in my decison here. I need to see LinkedIn profiles, websites, references to previous experience, and a brief resume description of all team members involved is a plus. It is these factors that forces me to give a negative score. After these issues are addressed, I look at the budget to see if the breakdown shows that the funds are being spent as efficiently as possible. I can't really make that determination with this budget because it doesn't get very specific on how the money is being spent outside of broad categories. I don't just want to know how much is being spent in big categories, I want to know what is being spent in various sub-categories and labor/hourly rates for development team members. More details needed. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This is not a terrible auditability section but I do have very strict standards for what I'm looking for here. There are clearly measurable metrics given for determining success and not just the completion of the final product. It is my pet peeve when proposals only list completion of the product as a measure of success. This proposal gives goals on user base and tester groups, which tells me that they're paying attention to the actual positive impact that this product can provide. However, I think the goals could benefit from longer-term timeframes and better organization. The reason I end up voting only neutral is that there are no resources provided for the public to watch for updates on these success metrics so that they might be held to public accountability. Goals are good but enforcement is the backbone of goals.
