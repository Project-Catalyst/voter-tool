There is no global blockchain standard for the automobile industry.", "f6_no_assessments": 4, "f6_rating": 4.916666666666667, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 7292, "q0": "This proposal is very different from anything that has been done on Catalyst so far (and I've been here for a while!). It's about creating Dapps that work for connected cars, from what I understand, first located in Germany and then in other countries. It would be something totally new, to introduce blockchain in the automobile universe, and it is a great idea to do this with Cardano, I believe it will be able to attract a new type of audience, increasing transactions on our blockchain and publicizing it, thus achieving the specific objectives of this challenge. It would also be quite beneficial for car owners, as they will have their information minted into smart contracts, in a non-corrupt and untraceable way: their data would remain anonymous. Perhaps the good use of these Dapps also favors the interest of this new niche in the cryptographic world, who knows if they go beyond the use of connected cars and are interested in knowing more about blockchain and even about our ecosystem? One observation I would like to make, however, is about a part of the proposal. The authors state that if funded, \u201cwe will cooperate with a car-sharing services company in Germany as a means of implementing a pilot project\u201d. What is carsharing? I would like this concept to be explained, since it is not general knowledge, this would produce a more complete understanding of the proposal as a whole by the CAs, voters and all those who read this project. It is very positive how the authors set challenges to be met here; demonstrates that they have enough experience to recognize the adversities of the area in which they decide to work, whether for example the lack of professional evidence of the people involved or the short time on the market. With that, they already outline solutions, showing a lot of preparation and planning, which will certainly increase the chances of success of the proposal and the impact will be positive and adequate with what the present challenge seeks. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The authors explain which tasks would be developed in order to build their final product, and divide them through phases (1.1, 1.2 and etc). Each of these phases has a list of tasks, so that it is quite clear what would happen and in what sequence. What I missed, however, was a temporal notion, that is, understanding how long each of these phases and tasks would take to start and be completed, also in which month of the year they are scheduled to happen and etc (we know that the phase to be funded would take three months, but when would it start)? Anyway, yes, there is a highly detailed script and explained in a technical way but possible to understand; the only question would be to place ourselves better in time and space, but the level of detail is so good and done in such a professional way that it doesn't make this temporal part a big problem, as it conveys a lot of confidence in the process. Regarding the budget requested, I believe that the value is quite fair for the complexity of the work to be performed. It is basically the salary of the professionals involved, as the authors explain, the salaries added together give approximately 11k, and in the period of 3 months this would be an average of 33k (which is requested in the financing). This part of the proposal is very clear and I don't think there is any observation to be made. And finally, about the team involved, everything is perfect! We know that the team is made up of the employees of PeakSoft GmbH; we are told their names, main functions, a small work history and links such as linkedin (in addition to their personal contacts), through which we can verify the information that is described. It is convey total confidence in the team, because in addition to a great degree of detail about who they are, we also know the role that each one would play in the project. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Although this part is quite technical, I understood that the project will be funded through a software development method called \u201cScrum\u201d, and that the analyzed data would be made available to the public. The authors also establish what would be the success and acceptance of the project, so that we can clearly analyze the results. It is also very possible to audit the progress/development of the project, through the highly detailed task listing present in the previous topic. It's very positive when the team is concerned with building ways to audit the project and not just providing information for that, because it's one thing for us (the Cardano community) to go after updates, results and feedback, and another for the team to come up with strategies. of analysis and make them accessible to everyone (as happens here). So, once again, it's very good, I would like to congratulate this team for writing such a complex proposal, but at the same time accessible, auditable, with a very well argued feasibility and impact. Just to reinforce: yes, it is a proposal that is totally possible to monitor through the strategies devised by the team and also through the direct monitoring of the tasks to be performed. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 350, "q0": "The idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal in question is the construction of a tool that allows the shared use of cars using Cardano's technology to mainly ensure security for users' information and also agility and reliability with the application of smart contracts. That said, we can see that the proposal fits the goals of the challenge and is innovative for proposing a solution that optimally solves a demand from society.\n\nThe success of the project, as stated in the proposal itself, can, in the medium and long term, consolidate Cardano\u2019s blockchain as a pioneer in this car-sharing car segment, increasing Cardano\u2019s projection not only in Germany, but also in other locations where PeakChain is implemented. . We realized that the budget is adequate because the factors considered to arrive at this value were well explained and given the size of the team and the capacity of the team, the amount of $39,300 seems quite coherent. Another factor that positively contributes to the proposal is that the pilot project will be carried out in Germany, which has a solid and well-developed automotive market, being a good place for product validation.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the steps that explain how the project will be developed, this proposal is extremely well detailed and rich in relation to the explanations of each of the steps organized by the team. Starting with a review of the team members, we see that they all seem to be very skilled and have considerable experience in the technology area, as there are several senior developers on the team. But, in a complementary way, project managers and other people not necessarily linked to technology are also present, indicating a completeness of the team. A positive point regarding the professionals involved is that they work at the technology company PeakSoft GmbH, whose address has been provided: https://peak-soft.de.\n\nThe company's website is very well structured and presents several aspects that professionals approach in the projects, some of which were also mentioned in the proposal. The CVs of all professionals involved in the project were made available through linkedin addresses, which helps to prove their previous experiences. We have, for example, the CTO curriculum available through the link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/abderrahim-issaoui-b3149227.\n\nThe steps defined by the team on how to reach the final result, by dividing the task into sprints and using the agile method, demonstrate the team's compatibility with some of the most used concepts today in computing for project management and also increases the confidence of that the result can be successful, because with this way of structuring the project, the goals can be segmented and the results can be better monitored.\n\nDuring the explanation of the stages of the project, the team was also concerned with illustrating how the general operation of the tool will be, describing the technologies involved and the communications between the systems, thus demonstrating a very detailed plan. As for the project budget that defined the amount requested, we had a clear explanation of the distribution of costs. It was indicated how much each professional would earn and the monthly total was calculated. From all this information it is possible to conclude that the team has a very detailed execution plan and expense control.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "With the methodology and processes chosen for the construction of the tool, the ways of auditing the project are also simpler and more direct. And in line with this logic, the team proposed to show the results periodically. And for such monitoring, a well-known tool for this purpose will also be used, JIRA.\n\nWe noticed that well-defined paths were traced for auditability, such as the use of user stories, frequent meetings and the delivery of new features every 3 months.\n\nWe can thus conclude that the proposal followed a very consistent organization of ideas during its previous phases, and this pattern was also maintained in relation to the metrics for monitoring the result. A point to consider is that it would also be interesting to have the follow-up of an experienced member of Cardano, to validate if the technological benefits are being used to the fullest in the project.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 5, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4227, "q0": "This proposal, in my opinion, fits the requirements of the challenge. The project has a tight layout and is tied together in each section. In addition to assisting consumers who use carsharing with information security, the initiative intends to promote Cardano in entering the automobile sector market. The Cardano community will undoubtedly gain immensely from growing the number of users to expanding the market. All of these are significant and long-term advantages. Even the fact that they want to promote in Germany, where personal information is concerned, is a great option, allowing the project to grow the number of people interested without spending a lot of money on advertising. Using blockchain smart contracts instead of traditional centralized digital contracts would improve fee calculation transparency while also decreasing third-party actions and making personally identifiable information more protected. I am also very pleased by the concrete solutions that closely address the challenges they anticipate. Overall, they all deserve a perfect score for this segment.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The members that are supporting this initiative have pretty great backgrounds in my opinion. They are all persons with several years of expertise in distinct but connected professions. They are all highly qualified or work for reputable organizations. And they have all been explicitly allocated tasks to perform in this project. This is a feature that just a few projects can demonstrate. Also, they have deployed prototype with some success, demonstrating that what they aim to perform on this project will yield the desired results. The budget list also states the purpose and who will utilize them. The honesty and transparency in the usage of financing undoubtedly make investors happy. Maybe all I need is a brief request that the proposer gives each action a specific amount of time to complete. While this listing is excellent for the time being, I feel they may do much better.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Huge congrats to the entire team for successfully completing the final step before officially making this proposal. The information in this section is described very clearly, completely, and coherently. They also include some links such as a summary, a feature analysis, or information about their staking pool. This is a testament to the investment in time and quality of the entire team. Once again, many thanks to the proposer for making such a great suggestion", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1713", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 1, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5877, "q0": "If fully developed, this Dapp will deliver a great value both to Cardano and users. As stated in the problem, connecting vehicles and fleets to the internet and users, indeed need extra security and data privacy and blockchain would be an adequate solution for this. This Dapp, which is already in prototype/validation phase, can certainly do that and is completely appliable for car sharing services, becoming more and more common nowadays (specially with pandemic and war effects on constumers habits and oil and car prices). Moreover, this solution can be scalable for other types of car services and cabe part of a whole market segment. Imporant to notice that is aligned with challenge as it can address directions mentionted such as \"Solutions utilising the power of smart contracts\"  and \"Novel and viable applications get built of top of Cardano attracting users. Integrations manage to pull in more adoption\". I also pasticularly liked the diagram ilustrating the way the app and hardware will work. Moreover, team seems to be using the right methodology to develop the project, supported by Scrum, which certainly will enhance the final deliverables. The main reason I'm not scoring 5 star here is becuase the proposal aims to do only a 3 month increment and, hence, as I understood, will not deliver the final product at the end, and the impact will be a little lower.\nAs suggestions of improvement, it could be provided more details on the business side once the service is fully developed. How to get money from it? how to engage with costumers (B2B and B2C)? how to integrate/engage with different typs and brand of vehicles? what business model will be put in place? These questions could be better explored as I see a great business potential in this project.\nIt would be nice also to see some risk management part here, thinking about both the technical aspects (software issues that may arise, integration issues, etc) and in the managerial side (scope, time, cost, resource etc) and with a mitigation plan for these risks.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team is highly experienced both in technical terms (software development, quality, hardware integration) and in project manegement so I see great chances it will be a success. Moreover, Linkedin links are provided together with team qualification, experience and roles, person by person, so information can be verified. This part is really complete in the proposal.\nTheres a detailed timeline in the spreadsheet provided. and a full description on accpetance criteria with some final develiverables help to understand what is going to be developed here\nFinally, budget breakdown is detailed and fair (based on team members \"wages\"). Imporant to highlight here that people costs in Germany are indeed more expensive than in most countries, as mentioned in the proposal.\nAll in all, I see this project is likely to succeed with a competent team to develop the solution, using an agile approach.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As this is more a software development project that will still not put commercial product available, it is hard to set some KPIs. However, the way proposed to assess project progress and success seems to be enough to audit it. Scrum method allows to verify what was delived at the end of each iteration and the scrum board that will be made avilable can help track that. The sprint reports mentioned and backlog already provided are also essential to follow up with project progress.  The only thing that Id better detail here is the \"relevant KPIs\" that will be present in these reports.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_298", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "To build connected car platforms and DApps on Cardano.
