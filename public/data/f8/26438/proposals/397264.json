There is no global blockchain standard for the automobile industry.", "f6_no_assessments": 5, "f6_rating": 4.666666666666666, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"q0": "This proposal is very different from anything that has been done on Catalyst so far (and I've been here for a while!). It's about creating Dapps that work for connected cars, from what I understand, first located in Germany and then in other countries. It would be something totally new, to introduce blockchain in the automobile universe, and it is a great idea to do this with Cardano, I believe it will be able to attract a new type of audience, increasing transactions on our blockchain and publicizing it, thus achieving the specific objectives of this challenge. It would also be quite beneficial for car owners, as they will have their information minted into smart contracts, in a non-corrupt and untraceable way: their data would remain anonymous. Perhaps the good use of these Dapps also favors the interest of this new niche in the cryptographic world, who knows if they go beyond the use of connected cars and are interested in knowing more about blockchain and even about our ecosystem? One observation I would like to make, however, is about a part of the proposal. The authors state that if funded, \u201cwe will cooperate with a car-sharing services company in Germany as a means of implementing a pilot project\u201d. What is carsharing? I would like this concept to be explained, since it is not general knowledge, this would produce a more complete understanding of the proposal as a whole by the CAs, voters and all those who read this project. It is very positive how the authors set challenges to be met here; demonstrates that they have enough experience to recognize the adversities of the area in which they decide to work, whether for example the lack of professional evidence of the people involved or the short time on the market. With that, they already outline solutions, showing a lot of preparation and planning, which will certainly increase the chances of success of the proposal and the impact will be positive and adequate with what the present challenge seeks. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The authors explain which tasks would be developed in order to build their final product, and divide them through phases (1.1, 1.2 and etc). Each of these phases has a list of tasks, so that it is quite clear what would happen and in what sequence. What I missed, however, was a temporal notion, that is, understanding how long each of these phases and tasks would take to start and be completed, also in which month of the year they are scheduled to happen and etc (we know that the phase to be funded would take three months, but when would it start)? Anyway, yes, there is a highly detailed script and explained in a technical way but possible to understand; the only question would be to place ourselves better in time and space, but the level of detail is so good and done in such a professional way that it doesn't make this temporal part a big problem, as it conveys a lot of confidence in the process. Regarding the budget requested, I believe that the value is quite fair for the complexity of the work to be performed. It is basically the salary of the professionals involved, as the authors explain, the salaries added together give approximately 11k, and in the period of 3 months this would be an average of 33k (which is requested in the financing). This part of the proposal is very clear and I don't think there is any observation to be made. And finally, about the team involved, everything is perfect! We know that the team is made up of the employees of PeakSoft GmbH; we are told their names, main functions, a small work history and links such as linkedin (in addition to their personal contacts), through which we can verify the information that is described. It is convey total confidence in the team, because in addition to a great degree of detail about who they are, we also know the role that each one would play in the project. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Although this part is quite technical, I understood that the project will be funded through a software development method called \u201cScrum\u201d, and that the analyzed data would be made available to the public. The authors also establish what would be the success and acceptance of the project, so that we can clearly analyze the results. It is also very possible to audit the progress/development of the project, through the highly detailed task listing present in the previous topic. It's very positive when the team is concerned with building ways to audit the project and not just providing information for that, because it's one thing for us (the Cardano community) to go after updates, results and feedback, and another for the team to come up with strategies. of analysis and make them accessible to everyone (as happens here). So, once again, it's very good, I would like to congratulate this team for writing such a complex proposal, but at the same time accessible, auditable, with a very well argued feasibility and impact. Just to reinforce: yes, it is a proposal that is totally possible to monitor through the strategies devised by the team and also through the direct monitoring of the tasks to be performed. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 6, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal in question is the construction of a tool that allows the shared use of cars using Cardano's technology to mainly ensure security for users' information and also agility and reliability with the application of smart contracts. That said, we can see that the proposal fits the goals of the challenge and is innovative for proposing a solution that optimally solves a demand from society.\n\nThe success of the project, as stated in the proposal itself, can, in the medium and long term, consolidate Cardano\u2019s blockchain as a pioneer in this car-sharing car segment, increasing Cardano\u2019s projection not only in Germany, but also in other locations where PeakChain is implemented. . We realized that the budget is adequate because the factors considered to arrive at this value were well explained and given the size of the team and the capacity of the team, the amount of $39,300 seems quite coherent. Another factor that positively contributes to the proposal is that the pilot project will be carried out in Germany, which has a solid and well-developed automotive market, being a good place for product validation.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the steps that explain how the project will be developed, this proposal is extremely well detailed and rich in relation to the explanations of each of the steps organized by the team. Starting with a review of the team members, we see that they all seem to be very skilled and have considerable experience in the technology area, as there are several senior developers on the team. But, in a complementary way, project managers and other people not necessarily linked to technology are also present, indicating a completeness of the team. A positive point regarding the professionals involved is that they work at the technology company PeakSoft GmbH, whose address has been provided: https://peak-soft.de.\n\nThe company's website is very well structured and presents several aspects that professionals approach in the projects, some of which were also mentioned in the proposal. The CVs of all professionals involved in the project were made available through linkedin addresses, which helps to prove their previous experiences. We have, for example, the CTO curriculum available through the link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/abderrahim-issaoui-b3149227.\n\nThe steps defined by the team on how to reach the final result, by dividing the task into sprints and using the agile method, demonstrate the team's compatibility with some of the most used concepts today in computing for project management and also increases the confidence of that the result can be successful, because with this way of structuring the project, the goals can be segmented and the results can be better monitored.\n\nDuring the explanation of the stages of the project, the team was also concerned with illustrating how the general operation of the tool will be, describing the technologies involved and the communications between the systems, thus demonstrating a very detailed plan. As for the project budget that defined the amount requested, we had a clear explanation of the distribution of costs. It was indicated how much each professional would earn and the monthly total was calculated. From all this information it is possible to conclude that the team has a very detailed execution plan and expense control.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "With the methodology and processes chosen for the construction of the tool, the ways of auditing the project are also simpler and more direct. And in line with this logic, the team proposed to show the results periodically. And for such monitoring, a well-known tool for this purpose will also be used, JIRA.\n\nWe noticed that well-defined paths were traced for auditability, such as the use of user stories, frequent meetings and the delivery of new features every 3 months.\n\nWe can thus conclude that the proposal followed a very consistent organization of ideas during its previous phases, and this pattern was also maintained in relation to the metrics for monitoring the result. A point to consider is that it would also be interesting to have the follow-up of an experienced member of Cardano, to validate if the technological benefits are being used to the fullest in the project.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 5, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "As we all know the car industry is never an outdated industry.

The group has also outlined strategies to reduce risks quite fully and specifically. as mentioned above. I am satisfied with the presentation of the project.\"\n\nMy Answer:\n- The CA seems to be very satisfied about all parts of the project and didn't mention any single problem regarding Impact/Alignment. Execuse me, but i think it is unfair not giving 5 starts if you are totally satisfied and you haven't mentioned any issue\n\n\n\nFeasibility\n-----------\n1- The CA said: \"However, about the goal of the project. the group presented very specifically, there are many goals stated in the project. I found the group to be very specific in preparing for these goals. However, the progress of the project is not easy to be monitored by the community. \"\n\nMy Answer:\n- But this contradictory with what the CA already said in the Auditability section below: the CA said there: \"About the description measure the progress and development of the project. The group identified six metrics. The metrics are also easily checkable and trackable by the community. about the successful presentation of the project.\" So, the CA admits that the goals could be easily monitored by the community.\n\nFurthermore, In the feasibility spreadsheet mentioned in the proposal, we have mentioned all activities and detailed acceptance criteria (project delivery). Of course, the most important KPI to check is the accomplishment of all acceptance criteria. I think also the detailed acceptance criteria are not very technical, anyone with basic understanding of the blockchain can assesses if an acceptance criteria is meat or not. \n\n\n\n2- The CA said: \"I see the group has raised more than 10 members.\"\nMy Answer:\n- We have 6 team members.\n\n\n\n3- The CA said: \"However, the group needs to have a contingency plan in case there is a lack of additional budget. \"\nMy Answer:\n- We have already mentioned in the feasibility spreadsheet that not all costs of the project will be covered by the requested funds. A big part will be also by the treasurery of the company. We have already an established company with sufficient resources. So, in the worst-case additional costs in cases of emergency will be covered easily by the company. \n\n\n\n\nAuditability\n------------\n- The CA said: \"About the description measure the progress and development of the project. The group identified six metrics. The metrics are also easily checkable and trackable by the community. about the successful presentation of the project. I see the group has mentioned certain successes to be achieved very specifically as stated in the project. I see this success closely related to the challenges of the campaign. however, this project so far has not been Test Run. Since this is a new project, it has not been funded yet. However, the ideas in the project I think are also very good. I hope the group will have much success in the future\"\n\nMy Answer:\n- The CA admits that we have set clear metrics and that could be easily tracked by the community. \nBut it seems that the only factor that the CA sees to give us three Stars is that the project i new and is not already funded in previous rounds. Is that means that any new catalyst project could not be given good rate, just because they are applying for funds for the first time? Even if they deliver good metrics and it could be easily trackable?\nIn this auditability section, i think the CA should check and rate the auditability of the project and not if the project is new or not.\n"}, {"q0": "This proposal, in my opinion, fits the requirements of the challenge. The project has a tight layout and is tied together in each section. In addition to assisting consumers who use carsharing with information security, the initiative intends to promote Cardano in entering the automobile sector market. The Cardano community will undoubtedly gain immensely from growing the number of users to expanding the market. All of these are significant and long-term advantages. Even the fact that they want to promote in Germany, where personal information is concerned, is a great option, allowing the project to grow the number of people interested without spending a lot of money on advertising. Using blockchain smart contracts instead of traditional centralized digital contracts would improve fee calculation transparency while also decreasing third-party actions and making personally identifiable information more protected.

Also, they have deployed prototype with some success, demonstrating that what they aim to perform on this project will yield the desired results. The budget list also states the purpose and who will utilize them. The honesty and transparency in the usage of financing undoubtedly make investors happy.

Moreover, this solution can be scalable for other types of car services and cabe part of a whole market segment.

Moreover, team seems to be using the right methodology to develop the project, supported by Scrum, which certainly will enhance the final deliverables.

How to get money from it? how to engage with costumers (B2B and B2C)? how to integrate/engage with different typs and brand of vehicles? what business model will be put in place?
