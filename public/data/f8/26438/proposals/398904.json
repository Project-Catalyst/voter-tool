On top of the existing functionality they want to add a neural-network/machine learning (you were expecting something else from SingularityNET?) component now to get it closer to its actual goal, in conjunction another proposal they are seeking funding for that is bringing in an SSI build (and that proposal deserves your eyes as well).  Altogether the platform will be able to allow users to create a digital twin that learns as they learn and has all the privacy protection that they do in an SSI environment, all biometrically (and I'm not talking fingerprints here...this is BRAINprints, folks) rooted in reality.  The use cases are tremendous, but just consider the uses for managing metaverse identity, or pattern matching collaborative teams (the team anticipates this one, check out their litepaper), or providing persistent, secure personalization of mental and physical well-being resources...  And all of this infrastructure is tied to the wider SingularityNET AI market that runs on their $AGIX Cardano native token.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is stellar, with neuro phds and collaborators from across the SingularityNET community.  Its one of those \"good\" network resources where its membership extends deeply into the margins of border communities, so knowledge \"nodes\" keep getting added as the scope of the project opens up to realize the full platform vision.  The budget highlights a couple of important risks that the project faces going forward that they are trying to address early:  the first is the scarcity of neural-net developers, so they are pricing that in at a premium in this budget.  The second is the long term viability of the project outside of the more dependable AI community, so they are already targeting a marketing budget so that they can establish a plan and protocols to approach this risk area as the project develops.  Their timeline details excessively the milestones/deliverables as they are coming due, but doesn't really cover the architecture buildout needed for each component.  I'm not finding much fault there as they need both 1) the input of a neural-network engineer, which comes in phase one, and 2) a lot of what I'm seeing outside the AI mapping is more mundane systems integration with things like the biosensing equipment.  I don't think either of these issues is reason to doubt the project's ability to be implemented.  It is also worth noting, that the engineer brought in on this part of the project will then be considered a part of the team, not mercenary development work, and thus available to other arms of the project like SSI (they will need to be involved in what passes for a trust registry for the DID issuance, and possibly any DAO or governance design, as well).\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The success metrics list that they provide is the quickest way to get a handle on just what they are rolling out in this proposal, and how it weaves into the past proposal via platform API integration.  The list could be used as the progress reporting metrics, and based on what is included I would say the funding term here is 6 months to project completion, with a 12 month window for full platform functionality.  At six months the included beats are more than adequate for the reports, and with opensource roots for most of the project (if not all, it wasn't clarified explicitly, but it would not surprise me) there will be repos to track and sprints to follow that can give %complete metrics.  If a project like this suffers, it is from sprawl, given that there are no industry guard rails to prevent some edge idea from gaining traction, but so far they seem to be hewing to a straightforward (as far as emergent AI is concerned) path and this API integration should be able to stay on track too.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 8, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal aims to integrate cognitive assessments and well-being practices to help individuals gain insight into their cognitive styles and strengths. The proposal builds upon the existing work that already has an MVP. However, the Pathform summary slide deck and whitepaper docs can\u2019t be accessed and need permission, it would be very great if the community can access these documents easily. The team has a clear plan and consisted of an experienced team, with the resource they have the proposal has a big chance to be successfully implemented. The team gives two main potential risks, the difficulty of hiring an AI talent and not reaching the target number of users in 12 months, however, the team has elaborated reasonable ways to mitigate both risks.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal has clear milestones, a roadmap, and a timeframe to work on the stated milestones. In 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. However, the proposal has many milestones each month that can be more easily read if those milestones are stated on points rather than a paragraph. The team provides a detailed and reasonable breakdown of how they will use the proposed budget, from machine learning engineer remuneration, Cloud computing costs, to the Biosensing equipment, among others. The proposal gives very detailed information of background, relevant skills, and experience of each team member. Furthermore, they also provide LinkedIn profiles/Personal websites for further information.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal gives concise information on metrics to track progress by three points.

The proposers have stated clearly the problem of missing tools used for human growth and development and the solution to the problem is an AI-assisted cognitive assessment, skills mapping, and insight. The project promises to increase users on cardano ecosystem as well as build a novel application on cardano ecosystem.  The KPIs of the proposal match the ones in the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This is a complex project that requires lots of expertise.  Members of the team have extensive experience, but the team is not complete yet as they have open positions for collaboration. The proposer has provided detail information of the team and links to their profile.   The budget is well aligned with the KPIs and is broken down in detail.  The amount requested is representative of the complexity of the project. The proposer has also identified potential risks that may be encountered during implementation of the project.
