A payment processor that would allow seamless P2P financial transfers via QR code or payment links would be useful and effective. \n\nEase of payment is an essential component of massive mainstream adoption. Even if ADA is never used as a true replacement for fiat, the ability to easily transfer ADA in exchange for products will still be useful to a significant number of ADA holders.\n\nThis proposal does however need a better description of how this particular payment processor implementation would be a significant advantage over simple wallet to wallet transactions. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "From the roadmap that is laid out in the proposal, the pacing of the work seems on par with what will be feasible given the size and experience of the team. The team already has a website up and running, with work already done and code already written. This is a good indication that they have both the ability and drive to push to project completion. The roadmap is not too ambitious, but lays out a reasonable timeframe for delivery. Also, the technology backing this proposal is not something entirely new and innovative (as similar projects have already been completed on the Ethereum chain), which further assures its feasibility. \n\nThere are also attached images of a proof of concept layout, showing how the payment  processor intends to look from the client side. This adds a lot to my faith in the project. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability section in this proposal features the same roadmap as the feasibility section, which I think is a mistake. It makes the proposal look low effort and reduces trust in the team\u2019s ability to bring forth an auditable product. \n\nThe ability to look into the progress of a project such as this, especially with the request of $80,000, is essential to securing funding and reducing the incidence of fraud on the Catalyst platform. \n\nMore work should be done here to create a mechanism of showing progress made on the project.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1398", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal is about creating a ada payment system for merchants. This can be a good idea in some instances, but I think that doing commerce activities with ada can be very risky. I think that stablecoins are more suitable for certain commerce activities. I don\u2019t know how the proposers take this into consideration but it is a question worth outlining. Besides that, I think that it can be a good idea to create payment in ada and integrate it into the most popular ecommerce platforms like shopify and woocommerce.

They have done a good job by explaining how they will tackle the problem. They have provided a roadmap with a timetable to complete the work.
