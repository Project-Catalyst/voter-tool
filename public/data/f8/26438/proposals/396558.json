Blockchain gives control back to creators, eliminates middlemen & enriches the experience of being a fan", "f6_no_assessments": 13, "f6_rating": 3.871794871794872, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 763, "q0": "Creating applications that can attract musical artists of all variety to the blockchain is a powerful use case; one that holds tremendous potential to grow Cardano because Cardano is uniquely capable of accomplishing this in ways other blockchains are not. This proposal addresses the challenge for Dapps and Integrations, proposing a system where record labels, musicians, and fans can receive value. The core application sounds like it would house all of the content and, using APIs, other web or mobile-based platforms would stream music from this centralized repository where the audio files are stored to their respective apps or platforms where the user could connect their wallet(s).\nIt makes sense how the project could use Cardano to make payment systems more efficient, both the royalties to record labels and to artists. The proposal seems to convey to its reader that it is trying to help musical artists; but overall it tends to lean more strongly in favor of record labels, which historically have not been known to act in artists' best interest; and this proposal seems especially interested in the relationship with record labels.\nThere are a LOT of musicians in our Cardano Community already. I think explaining to them how the proposal can bring benefit directly to them might help the reader considerably.  Music sovereignty is mentioned a couple times, but I did not find where it was explained how this proposed system contributes to sovereignty for artists. Typically, the struggle between artists and record labels is over their sovereignty.  The proposal describes how artists will upload their music to a centralized streaming service.\nThe statistic about spotify that artists are paid $0.003 per stream is powerful. At that price an artist would need to have 1million streams to make $3000. That would be tough to make ends meet for 1 month living expenses for many cities. And that is a really high number.  Another figure is provided that the average spotify user pays $9.99 per month. It is not clear to me how lowering this already low cost to listeners will put more money in the pocket of artists. I think that it would be really helpful to the readers of this proposal to have a bit more detail about how this proposal substantially helps talented artists make a living with their music without having to be signed by a big record label. When I am looking at Catalyst funding, I know that something I am looking for is how the seed funding will support a project that will bring value to those who have been marginalized under legacy systems. So more explanation of this part may help other readers as well. \nLastly, I found the video about music blockchain rights that was spotlighted as part of this proposal a little confusing since it doesn't seem to be connected with the project your proposing. And this proposal doesn't reference a structure quite like what is represented in the video anywhere. Perhaps clarifying what you want your viewers/readers to understand from that video would be helpful. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I don't believe there to be any disagreement among musicians who are aware of Cardano or the benefits of blockchain that solutions on blockchain are inevitable. And probably in numerous forms. Music professionals do want the automated royalties and control over their business. I think more clarity about how your proposed solution provides that to artists is important. The statement that \"we must build this music platform on Cardano before it is built on a competing blockchain,\" is not compelling.  We know that Cardano has the greatest capacity to make any venture like this successful, so if business savvy companies and people are looking at the options they will choose Cardano, or realize their error in short order and return. The statement that \"we only have a small window of opportunity\" does not come across well either. \nWe have plenty of time to do it right.\n\nBased on some of the listed partners for this project, their well known technical experience in programming on Cardano, it seems probable that this project could be successful. \n\nIf it should receive funding I think it would go a long way to explain to the community in greater detail the pain and struggle for musicians in the current industry and how your project and the progress you make is working to remedy that, specifically. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The music industry is notoriously not a healthy industry. The statement about connecting Cardano with an established industry is a little concerning. So much of what Cardano stands for is about changing and moving toward new and more mutually beneficent systems.  \n\nThere is a statement about your strategy eliminating the need to market to the public or doing work with individual artists, but instead empowering record companies. Again, this is not selling me the reader on the value of this to individual artists or to transparency or decentralization. The very statement of eliminating need to market to public sounds very centralized and possessing control. \nThe KPI's mentioned in this section also state that you intend to measure and present to record labels about the revenue stream improvements. So your primary stakeholders it sounds like are the record labels and not sovereign artists. \n\nThe demo video and public demonstrations of progress is helpful and if funded will be really important to continue to provide those demonstrations. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1195", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 4204, "q0": "This proposal tries to create the DEMU Jukebox Dapp, a financial platform for the music business that will provide tools to assist music in effortlessly entering Web3, beginning with automated royalty payments for artists.

However, I would expect this type of proposal to include relevant facts to back up that claim. Personally, I believe that this idea answers the problem statement appropriately. The clear intention, as well as the full explanation of how the dapp works, is highly applauded. The proposing team discusses why such a platform is necessary, as well as elaborates on how that would be achieved exactly.

Budget-wise, it appears to be appropriate, yet the actual design may cost more than mentioned. I would have liked to see additional information presented in the budget to further explain the budget and the proposal in general. For example, how many hours per week will be devoted to platform design, and how many individuals will be on the design team? How many developers will work on platform development, and will they all be paid the same hourly rate?

The proposer also give a solution to solve the problem, which is the solution to batch the transactions and send it to the Cardano mainnet, although it is not clear, but the proposer has considered this problem that is a very encouraging thing. I have 1 suggestion for the proposer to solve this problem, which is to use Hydra. Hydra is designed as a specialized payment channel for micropayment transactions on the Cardano network. The proposer can completely build a hydra head for the DEMU platform itself, through that DEMU can fully control its microtransactions.

However, I have a few suggestions:\n1- The work items in the roadmap are divided into weekly units, but it is not clear whether these phases are consecutive or implemented concurrently. I think the roadmap should be designed to divide the work by month to make this issue clearer.\n2 - POC section: it said completed but proof is not available. It is also difficult for me to give an assessment because it is necessary to see it to be able to evaluate it.\n3 - The proposer also has not provided evidence for reference such as a website or some product interface design images while in the roadmap and fund allocation, he can come up with a very detailed plan and it is worth to mention that He also pursues this project for more than half a year if we only count the time at fund 6-8. If he can deliver then it will convince a lot of voters.\n3- The final point may not match the roadmap, but I think the proposer should give goals about the number of users who will use the product at last phase. Regarding the goal of the number of music products, he will probably do very well because he has 20 years of experience in the music industry, but to assess the feasibility of a Dapps product, it is necessary to have a number of users to accurately assess the feasibility of the project.\nThe project team is no different from the proposed fund 7 and in the early stages of DEMU it is also feasible for such a team like that.
