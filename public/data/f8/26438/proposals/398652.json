One of the main differences of the project is its premise of promoting savings for its users. We are often used to seeing people make a correlation between cryptocurrencies and high risk, so it is interesting to see that this project has a different proposal promoting the concept of reserve. And we also see, from what is negotiable in the portfolio, its possible relationship with assets from other Cardano projects. Added to these factors, we see that the project's focus will be on African countries, where there is a lag in financial services.\n\nWith all this, we can see that the proposal fits the goals of the challenge and that its success can have a very positive impact on Cardano's ecosystem. From the description of the steps and also because of the professionals involved, the requested amount of $40,340 seems feasible. We will see more details on this later.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The idea has, as one of its main objectives, to operate in the African market and we see the previous experience in this market by some team members such as Odosu Josiah, who founded two companies in the IT area in Africa and Loveth Chukwu, co-founder of a financial services company on the continent. We note that all the professionals involved have their CVs available in the proposal, and together they have experience in several important areas for the project such as finance, technology and banking.\n\nA very positive point that helps to differentiate the project, also increasing its viability, are the functionalities for using the wallet, which are not simply limited to savings and simple ADA transactions. One of these is the future implementation of the smart financial savings assistant. Regarding the details of the plan, we see that a clear division of the tasks that will be carried out has been established, with the number of hours allocated to each stage being indicated, which helps to explain the total amount requested. It remains as an observation that it would be nice if the hours for marketing campaigns were also made explicit. But overall, the steps seem pretty comprehensive and don't just focus on development.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the project has a well-structured website, where it is possible to find a clear description of the objectives of Thrift Mobile, as well as the professionals involved.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Regarding the ways to monitor the project's evolution, perhaps the most positive point is the period of time defined for the periodic dissemination of results and KPIs, of 2 weeks. We also see that the total time to complete these KPIs is set, 7 months. Allied to this, we have that the KPIs are good parameters to monitor the application's functionalities.\n\nAdditionally, the team also defined community interactions and reporting as project goals, in addition to exploring Cardano tools that might meet the project's needs. With this, we can see that not only the current objectives will be followed, but also new objectives will be traced. This proposal has several factors that make us believe in its possibility of success.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 5, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 775, "q0": "I think this proposal is a great fit for this challenge. It aims to create a wallet and DeFi savings application for mobile aimed at users in Africa. Africa is home to many young untapped talent and many unbanked so growing Cardano's reach towards the continent has  been a goal in the community. An increase in adoption and utility for Cardano is a major aim in this challenge and this proposal certainly aims towards that goal. The target focus of this proposal is the African people which scopes the project to focus on who to reach and who to develop for. With that aim, if successfully implemented, the addition of the application could be of help to many in need and a worthy cause at that.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team seems well balanced, consisting of community members, finance people and developers including ones who have worked before in Cardano ecosystem. They are also planning on adding to their team by hiring more Haskell and Plutus developers.  The project is in its infancy and the team has not explicitly stated exactly which team members will be responsible for the tasks. However, their implementation plan is very detailed and it looks like they have thought out each part of the execution process. With being part of an incubator program, they clearly have identified the deliverables of their application. The budget seems acceptable for the amount of work presented and the hours of engineering it would take has been roughly outlined. It would have been nice if they were clear on the number of team members needed for each area of the project and how many people they are planning to onboard.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal clearly has set KPIs that the community can use to assess the progress of the project. The KPIs focus on the wallet in the app and clarify importance of security in that goal. Most general wallet activities are expected to be integrated within the time frame of six months.\nMost of the team seem to be active in the Catalyst and the Cardano community and they plan on reporting their progress to the community every two weeks. With that in mind, following the projects progress and auditing the success should not be difficult.

I think a good argument could have been made for both. Depending on how you are basing your measurements of impact, and what impact means, would really determine what challenge this proposal would impact. Just thought this was interesting, and really there is no wrong answerer when talking about positive impact a project would have on the cardano sphere regardless.\n  This particular proposal does effectively address what is proposed in the challenge. That is not the only thing to assess however. When assessing a proposal were are also required to base our assessment on the amount of impact the proposal will have. This is somewhat difficult to measure because it is almost always a different answerer for each proposal. I like to think of impact in a couple different ways. One is to say to yourself is, will this project be collaborating with other projects, and if so, does it play the role of the team that is integrating or are they going to help the other team integrate with them. this helps me get an idea if they are vital for the challenge to be built. Another thing to ask yourself would be the question i proposed at the beginning of this summary, and that is, would this project be more impactful within another challenge.\n\n  I would tend to say very possible. If you think about it like this, so how big of an impact would a DApp built on the cardano ecosystem, along with a fair ammount if integration, have on this challenge as a whole. I don't think much. Yes, it does have a positive impact, but what if there was a way to make the project stand out, and this is with the assumption the team creates what is visioned of course. That's where I believe if they would take this proposal and make more of the fact that their main focus will be on implementation on the continent of Africa. Then phrase your impact question such as, this project wants to successfully build a DApp yes, but they also want to bring some of the poorest and non financial literate people on the plannet into the global economy. \n\n  Either way the outcome would hopefully be the same. There would be an easier path to support and proposal impact if it were to be focusing on the other challenge. Just another way to look at it. i may not even be correct, and their could be something I'm missing in my assumptions as to the reason you chose this challenge. I am not even really critiquing the proposal which i think is great. It has a lot of information on how they will deliver on this, I just feel torn personally when i think of trying to address this project on impact. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This project is very well thought out. The proposal lays out it great detail, without having to be too technical, the roadmap of implementation. The only thing I would have to say in critiquing the feasibility is maybe underestimating the time that it will take to complete this project. The proposal explains in great detail the allocation of funds and  are explained in a way that keeps in mind not everybody is an expert on crypto.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "If this proposal ultimately ends up being funded I believe the community will be well informed on the progress of the project. They give a detailed list of expected project milestones and expect the project to take about 6 months. This is the only thing that I really disagreed on about the feasibility of the project. The writer of The proposal states that they do not see any major hurdles that would put the success of the project in jeopardy. It's always a little worrisome when someone is overconfident in what they are doing. Nothing in life ever goes according to plan and when you're talking about concept as big and complicated as crypto then I think that there should always be an understanding that things could not go our way. But overall I agree that for this particular proposal not to be possible to implement would be near impossible giving where cardano is at in its stage of life. It is just good to acknowledge the issues you will be expecting and understand that there are always future funding rounds if your wrong about your time frame of completing the proposal.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1959", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5633, "q0": "The proposals problem statement is worded as a description of the proposed solution, not the problem it aims to solve. It is unclear how another mobile wallet will add functionality to the ecosystem, when there are several mobile wallet applications already available globally. Additionally the challenge includes the phrase: \"We expect all dApp projects applying for funding to aspire to the highest possible levels of certification.\" However, there is no discussion in this proposal around certification or auditing of this wallet. For this new wallet to add value to Cardano it must be bug free, and work flawlessly, otherwise it could potentially have a negative affect on Cardano adoption if new cardano users of the wallet experience problems. The unique value proposition of the proposal is to create a \"smart financial savings assistant\" to help users save money. However; there is very little discussion in the proposal about what this will look like, how it will work, or how it will be created. It is unclear how the KPI's in the proposal align with the challenge, therefore I have given a 3 star rating. I would have given another star if they could articulate how the \"smart financial savings assistant\" will work and be built, and how it will provide value to the user. Another star would be given for a description of how they will market and reach more users, and why new users will choose this wallet over other available mobile wallets.

Despite this, I believe the team will be able to audit their project as described, and report back to the community.
