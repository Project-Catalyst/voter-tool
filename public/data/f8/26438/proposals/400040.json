The nature of this audit implies that if this security audit was not funded, then Cardax may launch without a security audit, and this could potentially lead to an exchange hack or loss of funds, and damage the overall brand/reputation of Cardano as being one of, if not the most secure defi platform. On the other hand, a successful audit may not have a significant positive impact, as the average user does not notice when things work as they are expected to. The Cardano ecosystem will have several Dex's available to Cardano users, so it is difficult to assess how many new users this Dex will bring into the Cardano ecosystem. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal is highly likely to be implemented successfully, because there is a generous budget, and the audit team selected is one of the top software engineering/auditing firms. The team has acknowledge the risk that the audit may take longer than expected, but this is unlikely to prevent the team from completing this work. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The final report will be a complete security audit that will be available on the Cardax website. Therefore it will be easy to audit the success of this funding. The proposal does not provide milestones, however the overall task is simplified into 3 main parts:\nA full external audit of the on-chain Plutarch code of Cardax DEX.\nThe focus of the audit will be to find potential problems or vulnerabilities such as:\n1. Unclear or wrong specifications that might allow for fringe behavior.\n2. Vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker\n3.  General code quality comments and minor issues that are not exploitable.\n\nThe only reason I have not given 5 stars, is because there is little discussion of mitigation strategies should the audit exceed the timeline or budget, and the community will not be able to audit the progress of Tweag as they are working, only if and after the final results of the audit are delivered. If there are unexpected problems with delivering the final audit, such as lack of funds, the community may not receive sufficient information to determine what the issues were, or the best way to move forward.

The challenge settings are perfectly suitable for big projects such as Cardax. The Cardax Dex is already a well known Dex in the community and soon going to go Live on Cardano.\n\nAgain and again we have seen millions of dollars lost on DeFi hacks, and even after a security audit this might occur. As we already know that any major project such as decentralized exchanges have to go through a series of audits to make sure that the entire code base that will run on mainnet is provably secure and clearly this is in the huge interest of both Cardano investors and as well as future users of this Dex. \n\nThe end goal of this proposal will be that Cardax will have the audit results public and the funding from catalyst will allow them to do so in the given 5 weeks of timeline. In my opinion, supporting such projects is one of the reasons catalyst funding exists and this can be also verified by the second paragraph of this challenge settings. Good luck to the team for their upcoming launch.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal is mostly about the security audit of the Cardax team dex. Having said that, we can see that the team details are public and we have seen already that they have done all the hard work with the implementation of the Dex. \n\nThe budget is clearly outlined and the details are provided on how the $96,000 number is reached. A total of 5 weeks of engineering time is asked for, and results of which will be made public to the cardano community. As an active community member and myself being part of some security audits in my career, I know that these things often cost a significant amount of money to the enterprise businesses. Therefore, I believe this budget is totally justified.\n\nThe risk/challenges section clearly mentions that the expected 5 weeks of timeline may not just be enough if the entire on-chain code base has to go through the auditing process.  Although, I believe it would have been a nice addition if the proposal also mentioned about if they will do a second audit after the issues are fixed ? and if so, then would they need funding again from Catalyst ? \n\nOverall, I believe that proposal write up is really good and has provided details to all the dimensions feasibility section should address. Hence, I strongly agree that this proposal is highly feasible to finish successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability of this proposal will be easy to track, as the proposer has mentioned that complete audit results will be published on their website. This is in fact important for not only the community, because of the catalyst funding, but also to the investors and future users of their dex.\n\nThe success criterion is also mentioned and that the issues found during the audit will be implemented by the team right after. Moreover, I think since the community is funding the proposal security audit, the auditability scope of this proposal will be finished once the results of the security audit are published (even though as a community member one can still track the progress of the fixes that are going in post security audit). Therefore, I strongly agree that the community can easily track the progress of this proposal.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_454", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8600, "q0": "I understand that this proposal is not for the Cardax platform itself but for security audit for its smart contracts but still, I would have liked to see a lot more details included in the proposal about the Cardax platform itself. Because even though the entire budget of this proposal is to go to the auditing firm, ultimately the Cardano treasury, and thus the Cardano community would be funding the development of the Cardax platform.\n\nThere is a video attached to the proposal, but unfortunately, it's a recording of a podcast that's more than one hour long and not of a specific presentation of the Cardax platform itself and what sets it apart. There is a section covering Cardax in the video, but it doesn't nearly go into enough detail to make up for the almost no details provided in the proposal. Furthermore, the video is from August of last year, I would imagine a lot of things have changed/evolved since then.\n\nOn top of that, the requested amount is quite large and I would have expected more diligence from the proposer team considering this.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal doesn't feature a roadmap per se, but given the nature of the proposed project, an audit, that's not necessarily a problem. The deliverables are presented pretty clearly, a bit sparsely.\n\nThe budget breakdown is minimal but in this case, that's understandable as the entire amount is set to go towards the auditing company, Tweag. Even though I understand that Plutus is still very new and there aren't a lot of companies specializing in it, still the amount requested seems pretty high for auditing 2000 lines of code.\n\nI have checked out the website of the company that Cardax is planning to employ for the audit and according to the information, I could find I am quite confident that it will be carried out successfully. But ultimately as I mention before the funding is to go towards the Cardax project and unfortunately there isn't enough information about it in the proposal to be able to properly assess its viability overall.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability section is very minimal, almost missing, and I would argue that simply writing, \u201cwe will publish the complete audit on our website\u201d, is not nearly enough to satisfy the auditability criteria required for the catalyst community to be able to easily monitor the progress on the proposal. No KPIs are given and no verifiable metrics are present. I would definitely recommend including these in the next iteration of the proposal. \n\nThe definition of success makes sense in the current context,  but as I mentioned, the overall auditability section is lacking.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_681", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10106, "q0": "Cardax are requesting funding to audit their code before launching their DEX. I wanted to refresh my knowledge of this project, but I couldn't find their whitepaper on their website and the link was broken on their Discord. Cardax has already won two lots of funding from Catalyst and has raised $9 million from their public sale. I think that the funds raised from investors should be used to pay for continued development, as they are the ones who will benefit most from a successful launch. I'm not aware of any plans from Cardax to give back to the community in the way of airdrops or an ISPO. As far as I know, the DEX is a Uniswap clone and doesn't seem to be doing anything innovative, while they are launching a little late, and might find it hard to get liquidity. For these reasons, I don't think funding this proposal provides good value to Cardano. Asking for a percentage of the costs might have been better.
