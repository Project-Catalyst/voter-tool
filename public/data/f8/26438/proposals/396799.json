The fundraising budget is $40500, however, according to the information provided by the proposer, although they have experience in dealing with coupon companies, in terms of human resources, up to this point their team is still incomplete, a few positions are still in the search stage such as Marketing. Furthermore, the proposer did not provide us with any records that could prove the competencies of the core personnel as described. Therefore, this required budget level does not match the requirement set by Challenge as \u201cFor smaller teams (4-5 people) with proven competence, relevant experience and technical skills with sketches/whitepaper detailing how they would go about to launch their proposal, the budgets would typically be in the range $40,000-$80,000.\u201d However, I still appreciate the core idea of \u200b\u200bthis project, the proposer also worked hard to provide us with the operation, method of use, and core features of the Couponium application. This is an application developed on the Cardano platform that can attract users because of its convenience, this application can provide a high amount of value with a low level of technical complexity. It would be better if the proposer could complete their team because basically, the proposal outline is quite complete, the proposer already knows what he/she is going to do to develop the project.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I enjoyed the presentation of this proposal's solution delivery plan, in addition to the necessary information such as milestones, key activities and goals to be achieved, the proposer also calculated the number of hours working on each activity. However, this is a drawback for the budget section, the budget is allocated on an hourly rate, $25 for an hour, but the working time is still being estimated, so the budget is still undetermined by a specific number, this will affect the auditability of the project. As for the personnel, as I mentioned in the Impact section, their team is still incomplete and there is no record that the proposer provides to verify the qualifications of the members involved project. In addition to describing members' biographies, the proposer should provide members' Linkedin profiles to back up their claims.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The plus point in this section is that the proposer has a plan to report on project development progress every Monday and Friday. However, it is not known how the community can access these project progress reports. The proposer should provide the community with some tools/environment so that they can access information about project development. The outline of the project's success that the proposer draws is too general, there is no roadmap with specific goals and KPIs to measure the success of the project, for example, such as the number of people using the app every month or the monthly positive user response rate.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1724", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4438, "q0": "Your ideas are very creative and interesting.

A DEX for a coupon? This idea is fresh, I never thought about it. SO, Proposer explained about his concept about Coupon DEX with a general terms, not too technical. We know that this platform will create a coupon as NFTs and have a token burn process for used NFT coupons, which I have not find that (NFTs burn) concept in any references. As proposer wrote about that, maybe adding a links/references will be more helpful for us to understand the concept proposer have mentioned.\n\nWhile we read what will this platform do for consumers and Coupon creators, what will DEX's team got? As we know DEX always have a team to maintain the platform. A more detailed Whitepaper for this Couponium Platform before asking a fund to Catalyst.\n\nIf the project succeeds, it would be a great gateway for new users to the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I love this idea. But usually if I assess proposal who will create a platform, they already have a simple whitepaper first before asking a funding in Catalyst. I don't want to generalized about this, but creating a whitepaper will be great.\n\nProposal's roadmap is realistic, but the budgets seems not. Why proposer hourly rate is just $25? While I cross-checked it: an average hourly rate for Software Developer in the US was $42 (source: ziprecruiter). Is it enough to implement this fresh idea with only $40,5k? Or maybe that budgets are for phase 1? But Proposer was not mentioned anything about it.\n\nProposer wrote about his experience but not provide any link to check his credential. Also, in-house Developers were not mentioned too. At least, if Proposer really have 10+ years working with his team, adding some links to your company's website will make us (readers) easy to check your credentials, because we want to make sure that your team are capable to implement this idea.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Proposer was not explained any key metrics and success criteria about this platform. It is rather difficult to publicly auditing and track the progress and success.

High costs are mentioned as one of the friction points in the existing coupon distribution system, but the proposal fails to acknowledge that transacting on the blockchain also has costs associated with it. For instance now approximately 1.5 ADA needs to the sent with every NFT in addition to the tx fees, this would very quickly add up in case a business wishes to distribute thousands of coupons.\n\nWhiteout further details I have to say that it isn\u2019t clear at all from the current proposal why this project would benefit from being built on top of a blockchain, specifically Cardano.\n\nClarifying these aspects would be needed before and encouraged for a resubmission of the proposal.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal does present a roadmap, but the steps on it are very general. I would definitely recommend including a more detailed and project-specific version in the future.\n\nThe budget section is just a copy of the roadmap, with what seems to be a calculation based on the estimated total number of hours it would take to achieve plus an hourly rate. For a more complete proposal, I would recommend that the author includes a clearer breakdown of the expected cash flow based on activities that are to be undertaken for the project.\n\nA description of the team involved with the project is unfortunately not present in this version of the proposal. This makes evaluating the feasibility of the proposal extremely hard. \n\nWhat should have been included in the proposal:\n- a clear description and short bios with credentials of the team members currently involved with the project, with links to the professional profiles (LinkedIn)\n- a description of the team members that need to be hired, if any.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "In it\u2019s current form the roadmap does not have exact dates attached to it, only estimates of the times it would take to complete.

This will make verifying the progress of the project much easier for the Catalyst auditing team. It will also help the Cardano community understand if the proposal is delivering on its goals.\n\nIn the current form, the definitions of success included in the Couponium.io proposal offer a brief overview but they don't describe in sufficient detail what the team hopes to achieve.

Proposer call it is  the couponium decentralized exchange. I really like this idea when it takes advantage of discount coupons, if this dapp is successful, it will create great benefits for the Cardano community as users can buy the products they need with lower price. The proposer also describes the platform's detailed workflow. However, I think the solution of proposer that just a idea. To solve the problems of this Dapp, the proposer needs to provide more detailed solutions. I dont have enough experience and time to advise a full solution, but I have a few suggestions:\n1. Put coupons on the blockchain through NFT and price it with couponium tokens, which is like a synthetic asset trading platform. So need a solution on how to determine the price like getting real-life price information from which API source? how to aggregate and transfer price information to the blockchain (Oracles, price feed). NFT will be just a record of coupon information and it is static information for the exchange to work, it needs to have up-to-date price information at the time of transaction.\n2. The source of the coupon will be taken from and by whom. Is there a solution to ensure that the coupon is real and if there is a fake, how to solve it?\n3. The proposer needs to provide a solution on the product market in which the coupon will be used, where it is used and who the users are. For example: Coupons can only be consumed in Europe, but the dapp solution only reaches users in Asia, so no one will buy the coupon. I know Dapp is a decentralized and borderless application, Proposer also outline this problem like a Risk of project but if the proposer can give a solution on building a specific market then this suggestion would be great. I think the proposer needs more preparation to make the solution more complete. Hope my suggestions can help the proposer", "q0r": 3, "q1": "According to the detailed plan given by the proposer, the Dapp will be completed after 8 months. In general, I think this roadmap too sketchy. To complete a Dapp, the amount of works are a lot and it is necessary to make a very specifically plan for each month to be able to complete the project. Months 1 and 2 in the roadmap I can agree with the proposer because it is his choice. the 3rd to 5th month will be the time to finalize the basic product (MVP), this is a very important phase in the progress of this project. Briefly, I think the proposer should give a specific plan on the execution time of the back-end, front-end, UX/UI, API integrate, smart contract, wallet integrate. The final stage should include additional goals for the number of users or coupon providers.\nFund breakdown, the proposer should also build in the direction of detailed work, especially work related to programming. According to the fund allocation, I think the proposer calculates the cost based on the number of hours worked with 1 person. However, the proposer has not provided proof of his experience to prove that he can carry out the entire project alone. If many people do it, then the cost calculated as $25 multiplied by the total number of hours is a bit unrealistic.\nNew proposals are often difficult to convince the community because it is difficult to measure their effectiveness. So the proposer needs to give the initial plan as detailed as possible, this will make the community realize that the proposer has carefully researched and prepared even though the project has nothing.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I also don't have too much comments on how to track project progress. To track the project progress according to the roadmap proposed by the proposer, it is probably not difficult because the proposer just only needs provide weekly reports as it has stated in the proposal or according to the timelines in the roadmap . However, in order to effectively test and measure the success of the project, the proposer should provide specific sources in advance so that the tracking can be done objectively (Examples (website, github or some demo images). The success of the proposal will open up a very cool and impactful business model for Cardano.
