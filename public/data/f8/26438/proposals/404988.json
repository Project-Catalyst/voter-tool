It allows disputing parties to find a suitable mediator to help resolve their dispute in a timely and cost-effective manner outside the court system.\u201d This idea is launched by the team at Loxe Inc., a company based in the United States and previously a Catalyst winner (I was able to verify all this information through the link attached in the proposal description, which takes us to the company's website. it is possible to obtain other information about it, such as: the team that composes it, other projects that are being developed, the whitepaper and etc). I thought that is an excellent idea and that it perfectly meets the objectives of the challenge, as it will involve our blockchain technologies (smart contracts) in an unfortunately very common situation today: conflict resolution. The difference, however, is that all unnecessary bureaucracy would be dispensed with, and as the proponents explain, often expensive and expendable fees would in fact be excluded from the process. It is very expensive to file a lawsuit, regardless of the country. If there's a faster and cheaper way to do this, it's certainly an interesting option. In addition to the practicality and reduced costs, the alternative way that is proposed here also takes advantage of all the security that surrounds cryptographic transactions. All data that are recorded, that are part of the resolutions, will be duly minted in the Cardano blockchain, so that they are transparent, non-corruptible and non-tampering. All of this, obviously, would make a lot of use of the technologies relevant to our ecosystem. With this, the objective of popularizing Cardano to the greatest number of people will certainly be contemplated. I believe that there is still a lot of misinformation and prejudice about blockchain, and practical applications like this are certainly one of the best ways to make people understand what blockchain actually is and what its use cases are and how it can be advantageous. Thus, the number of Adas purchased and delegated will certainly increase, as will the amount of transactions, smart contracts and active tokens minted on the Cardano blockchain. In this case, this proposal is the evolution of the project already launched, so this further increases the chances of the impact being very positive. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponents explain which tasks would be done in which months of the year, and the process of developing this proposal involves contacting the companies that will audit the smart contracts of this platform, and then the audit would be carried out by the outsourced company. chosen. In my view, despite being a succinct explanation, it is done in a very enlightening way, so that we have a good view of the steps based on the information provided. As a continuation of a previously funded proposal, the proponents are already well on their way to the work they will do, and this is a new phase to be tackled. Speaking of the budget, the requested value is 80 thousand dollars, it is a high value compared to the other proposals (in fact, we have proposals asking for much more, but I still consider it a great investment), however, it is justified because the project is of a extremely technical; the activities to be developed here would be carried out by an outsourced company, and the proponents claim to have already carried out a survey to find out how much money would be needed for this work to be done. According to them, it is not possible to give an exact value, so the amount requested is an estimate of how much would be needed for the project to be carried out. It is positive that the proponents claim that even if the real value of these audits is greater, they will pay for it themselves, completing the remaining parts; and also that, in the (difficult) case of being needed less than that, what would be left over would be reinvested in other parts of the platform development. Therefore, I consider that the budget explanation, even though it is outside the curve, is quite satisfactory. Finally, speaking about the team, we know the names of the proponents, their professional roles and a series of activities they have performed so far in their careers. They are active members of the community and have already proven in practice their capabilities and responsibility in developing projects and tools inside and outside the Cardano ecosystem. In addition to the fact that, as I said, this proposal is an evolution of something that already exists, which in itself already conveys a lot of confidence in the team's ability, as this idea is already a reality. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The progress auditability is perfect. We know exactly how this project can be monitored. According to the proponents, the third-party company that will audit the smart contracts will provide reports, probably monthly, on the work that has been carried out. The proponents state that they will make these reports available to both IOG coordinators and all members of the Cardano community. That is, we will have a practical way to monitor whether the service that was promised was also fulfilled. I don't think I have any suggestions to make, as this part of the proposal is already exactly as I suggest it is. Now talking about the success scenario, this would be when third-party companies audit smart contracts. The proponents claim that these companies had a technical problem that ended up hindering the performance of the work, but that this will be resolved, audits will be carried out and that the results will be disclosed to the Cardano community later this year. I think it's a proposal where success can be perceived quite objectively, since the proposal is totally focused on a single action (auditing the smart contracts of the platform in question). So, if this is done properly, success will soon be achieved. Therefore, I consider it a very auditable proposal, it is enough for the proponents to actually forward the content that they claim they will make available to the community and to IOG, and I believe they will do so.

By auditing the smart contracts on their platform they will gain the trust of users and drive more people to use their product, which in turn ads value to Cardano by bringing more users. The goal aligns with the challenge by being a new viable application on Cardano. Since the smart contracts will be audited and are somewhat automated the final product will be able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "They don't mention who will be doing the auditing. Sure the  team behind the original product is skilled enough to deliver the product, but who will do the auditing. For proposals like these, it would be beneficial to see quotes from the auditors or profiles of potential auditors if a quote is not possible. Showing the community who you have considered for the job will ad more confidence in the outcome. The budget seems reasonable and is a once off payment and can be less or more depending when the smart contracts are ready for review. If they get funded the auditing should be complete before the end of the year, which seems reasonable and achievable. It is explained what is being done, but because it is being done by a 3rd party it is hard to explain how it is being done. The risks they considered involves the budget that might change in which case they will carry the extra costs or fund other aspects of the project if less is required. Also the possibility of a delay caused by the workload of the 3rd party.  No mention of mitigating this. Having more than one auditor in mind and getting feedback from them on when they can deliver can mitigate this problem, but you also want to  make sure you choose quality work.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Since the project is being done by a 3rd party they will gather reports from them and provide them to the community. They are not sure how these reports will look, so they cannot provide a roadmap with milestones. Success would be the completion of the auditing process by the end of 2022. The problem and solution is simple and clear on this proposal. The targeted problem - is lacking the trust of the community due to their smart contracts not being audited. The targeted solution - is to get a neutral 3rd party to audit their smart contracts in order to gain the trust of end users.

This helps to increase confidence in Cardano also, as a global solution for many problems. In this case, conflict resolution.\n\nProposal is well strucutred with a clear problem statement and a sensible solution.\n\nAs suggestions, It could be mentioned here what is the current status of the win-win platform. At first at thought it was already running but after visitng company website, this service is still \"coming soon'. It would be nice to see what its launch date is and if it is only depending on this project to be finished.\n\nAs for the risk management, it is well done. Risks seem in general unlikely and with low impact so no need for a proper mitigation strategy in place (it is possible just to accept them).\n\n\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As the project involves basically hiring a 3rd party company, its ok no to have a very sophisticated timeline (there are only 2 itens/acitivites on it). However, it would be nice to see what would the criteria for selection the external company. Cost? Quality of service? size of the scope? reputation? A weighted average of all of them? This would add more transparency to this procurement part.\n\nBudget involves only the hiring of the company and a a previous research on the values was already made so this part is ok. Its good they mention what will be done if price is either higher or lower than expected. Apparently, no cost is considered for the hours spent on selecting the company and following up with them during the auditing.\n\n\nIn regard to the team, it doesnt leave doubts on their competencies to execute this project. The company already exist with a committed team of 4 people. they have competencies on software engineering, plutus, cardano and catalyst. It is enough to run the project and assess if the work executed by the external company was well done.\n\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The monthly reports provided by the 3rd party company should be enough to audit the project, as proposed here, in a regular basis and once it is done.\nit would be nice though to include some space to receive feedback from the community to assess if the work perfomed by this company was well done and where it can improve.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_298", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10597, "q0": "Mediators.ai is one of the highest impact projects we have in Cardano trying to resolve a real-world issue by utilizing the power of smart contract and advantages of blockchain technology. Cardano with its peer-reviewed and formal verification ethos that put security as a paramount consideration and not compromising it for other aspects attracts many aspiring and promising builders with their solutions, lincluding Loxe Inc. with this mediators.ai. It is just fair that they follow Cardano\u2019s ethos by having their smart contract audited and certified by experienced and proven third party to guarantee a high-assurance, reliable, and secure code. As mediators.ai would seem to be one of the early real-world utilities dApps from Cardano this 2022, we as Catalyst community need to support them by ensuring that they are completely and actually ready for launch with no risk of exploit, guaranteeing no harm will be done to our broader community and their hard-earned money, both inside and outside Cardano.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Due to a bulk and the most important aspect of this proposal will actually done by the appointed 3rd party auditor, not so much can be said further until we know how their smart contract design and who is the appointed auditing company. Above being said, the necessary information for a standard Catalyst proposal is all there. Roadmap with planned action is fine and clear. Since they have been in communication with few companies and obtained some ballpark figure from them, the requested budget is reasonable and comparable with the market rates of similar service and application (e.g. Minswap audit fee was around USD 75k, Liqwid budget was USD 119k, Milkomeda was 40k just for quick glances since comparing between projects without knowing further information is kinda pointless and not apple-to-apple). Loxe Inc. also commits to cover the shortage if the fee turns out to be more expensive and will relocate the remaining funds to further development if the fee is cheaper. Lastly, no concern whatsoever with the usual quick resume Loxe Inc. team puts in all their proposal.

We will eventually read on their web and social media about whom they are working with regarding the audit. One thing I need to make voters and general audience aware of is Loxe Inc. had done a Token Generation Event on February 27th 2022 and public sale should be happening right around now. This should raise some independent and fresh funds that can be utilized for the audit. I hope voters can utilize this fact to gauge the urgency of funding this proposal, considering we have yet to see the WinWin or mediators.ai MVP on the testnet (Fund 6 proposal suggested this should be delivered last November).", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_943", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Get an expert 3rd party to audit the smart contracts of the Win-Win platform.", "experience": "Loxe Inc. team, experienced and hackathon winning group of Plutus and AtalaPRISM developers, Gimbalabs PPBL veterans."}
