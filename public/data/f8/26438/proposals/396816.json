And the solution to this problem is integrate basic tokenomic features into the developing computational infrastructure. In general, the Impact section is presented pretty clearly and coherently. In the proposed solution, the author provided us with an overview of the project. Then, the given objectives and goals are also clearly defined (\"create the correct infrastructure to incentive mass adoption of cardano-based protocols in the computationally oriented scientific communities including academia, industry, start-ups, and individual community members\"). The target audience as well as which industry that could be benefic are also clearly outlined. In addition, the proposer described the challenges that will be encountered and has a clear plan to deal with them. At the same time, the proposal also demonstrated the impact of the project on Cardano, which could attract more users if implemented in the future. Thereby, I highly appreciate this author's presentation, very detailed, clear and apparent. My rating for this part is 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\"For this section, I would like to have a few reviews and comments as follows:\n-First, in terms of time, this part of the proposal should be described the work they are expected to implement in bullet points. Likewise, I suggest that this section should be a bit more detailed about their timelines and milestones. Instead of provide the information about which task will be done after one to two month, you could make a smaller allocation such as specific days or what week to spend on which task. Remember to give an explicit schedule for the project. Proposal must show a reasonable plan not only in terms of what they will accomplish, but also how it needs to be accomplished.\n- Second, about the budget, it is disappointing that the budget is not well defined in financial statements. A detailed budget allocation would increase the credibility of the proposal, so my advice for this section is that proposer should go into details of the budget for each work item. For instance: How much will it cost to hire employees? How do the team members will be paid, time-based (month / week / hour) or the amount of work they are in charge of? How long will they hire those people? Will there be any rental costs or other payments required? These things I have not seen the author mentioned.\n- Third, regarding to team members, the proposal only describes two key team members. Many descriptions of these people are given, what they are capable of, what their experience is. And of course, I feel these people are quite trustworthy when there are links to their information and biographies. This makes it easier for the community to verify the identities and abilities of these people. However, the proposal would be better if it could mention the total number of team members, who were included and what positions were still needed. Similarly, what job they will take on. These ideas will make the proposal more detailed and clear.\n\"", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Long-term and short-term goals are carefully considered by the proposer. The time period to cover all the goals is within 3-5 years, which is not a short period of time. Therefore, if these goals are analyzed more carefully and given a roadmap for completion, it will make it easier for the community to follow. Besides, KPIs are also given (Increased number of transactions on Cardano due to SingularityNET AI service calls.) consistent with the key metrics of the challenge, which is quite rare in the proposals. Also, at the end of the two months of funding, they will have prototypes to call specific computational algorithms, the number of CPUs, GPUs, and virtual nodes from the Cardano mainnet. The author has a strong vision for this project and the field in which he is engaged. I strongly agree that if this project is implemented, it will bring high results to the community. With the above comments, my rating is 5.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1717", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10847, "q0": "(To set the record straight, I don\u2019t pretend to know anything about physics. I can only evaluate the proposal by its merits.) Justin and the team had a proposal already in Fund7. They got enough votes but they were not funded. Now they are trying again with three different proposals. Their Decentralized Physics Simulations proposal for $28K is in the Miscellaneous Challenge (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404576) and there\u2019s another one for Decentralized AI Drug Development and $ 56K in the Business Solutions challenge (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396820). It would be a good practice to cross-link related proposals.\n\nThe issue they have identified is that \u201ccentralized infrastructures are rather limiting in developing AI-centric frameworks for improving the efficiency and accuracy of physics computation and knowledge extraction\u201d. They wish to create a Cardano-based decentralized alternative infrastructure to benefit the \u201cacademia, industry, start-ups, and individual community members\u201d. Leveraging NuNet computational resources and SingularityNet for AI enhancements, their Hetzerk protocol will one day help in the simulation of physical systems, faster than many of today\u2019s supercomputers. The scope of this proposal, however, is limited only to introducing basic tokenomics into the protocol by hiring a Plutus developer for two months. The protocol\u2019s long-term impact may be mind-boggling, but its completion is expected only 3-5 years down the line. The impact of this proposal is quite limited. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "It would be good for the team to have a marketing/sales/strategy oriented person involved to hone and simplify their communication. Now the proposal oscillates between the five-year vision and the immediate reality, making it difficult to estimate what is relevant right now. The budget is basically nothing but the developer\u2019s salary cost and another $1,000 added for \u201cconsulting\u201d.

The proponent states very well what the problem is, for example, that after the simulations are carried out, all the information is stored in an impractical and antiquated way, and if they were minted on the Cardano blockchain, in addition to being incorruptible, it would also be possible that a much larger amount of information was recorded and stored. In fact, it is a very interesting use case that takes advantage of the cryptographic universe very well, I found the idea very promising, being able to bring a new type of audience (companies, groups of scientists and etc that are interested in simulation) to our blockchain . With this, the objectives of the challenge of expanding Cardano would be fully achieved. The target markets - Biotechnology, Artificial Intelligence, Chemical Synthesis - are growing, that is, we have the possibility of reaching more and more people from this project. In my view, the potential for a lot of impact is high.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal does not have an exact roadmap. Partial results are given for the first 2 months, but what activities would be necessary for these goals to be achieved? I don't think the proponent explains the development process well, he exposes the results facet but not what's behind it. As a result, we were unable to understand well what the work routine of the professionals would be like and what small actions they would be developing. Regarding the money, I also think it is poorly explained. The asking amount ($8,000) is split into two parts - the developer's salary and possible miscellaneous fees (what, for example?). The proponent writes \"Blockchain Development (Plutus) 2 1 $3,500 $7,000\". What does this 2 1 mean? This part is a little confusing. Finally, speaking of the team, we have two people involved, one of whom provides a much deeper detail about himself and his resume (Justin Diamond) than the other. It would be ideal for both to explain about their careers with the same level of specificity. There is a lot of trust in Justin, but not so much in Floriane since we have little information about it. Anyway, the topic is average.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The only thing the proponent says about measuring progress is that it would be done by integrating basic tokennomics into their platform. Other than that, quantitative or qualitative metrics are not traced to understand how the project would be developing. It is complicated to audit this proposal also due to the fact that it does not have a detailed roadmap. That is, in general, it is not traceable and measurable. It is necessary for the author to review this part, giving objective formalities for the Cardano community to monitor the progress of activities. When it comes to ultimate success, short and medium-term goals are said, we know better what to expect; I think it is necessary, however, that all this is easily accessible to the Cardano community. Would monthly meetings be held? Prepared reports that would be sent to the community through the communication channels already used? How would this information reach everyone (and in accessible language so that everyone could understand it equally?).
