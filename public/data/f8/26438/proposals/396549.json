Therefore, I think it will be a great idea if you can give a brief introduction of these trial applications, or even name them, if possible. Another tip that I want to give you is that even though some of your key metrics align with the challenge\u2019s, they are too short, indeed. From this section, I believe that the investors will not appreciate your team due to the lack of keenness on this challenge.

All five stages of the progress are described with necessary information for people to follow. Especially, you even list every budget needed for each milestone in a transparent manner, which makes me surprised. Indeed, $217000 is certainly a high amount of money, and you are doing great when noting down both big and small expenditures.

Indeed, it solves a lot of problems for users in the Cardano ecosystem. This is also one of the problems that fit the challenge.

In the centralized IT world, nowadays serverless SaaS (software as a service) is a big benefit for new developers who have built some software (may be an MVP) that can scale up or down as their user base grows or lessens. This proposal wants to target dapp developers the same way in the Cardano ecosystem. \n\nAs a Plutus pioneer myself and senior developer I know that setting up cardano development infrastructure is tedious both in time and financial terms. The goal of this challenge is how can we basically help more developers on board to build dapps and allow seamless integrations with Cardano. This proposal essentially wants to provide a serverless equivalent environment to the dapps developers, so that they can simply just focus on the business logic of their smart contracts rather than worrying about setting up Cardano Node, and then writing querying/writing boilerplate code to interact with mainnet.\n\nThe KPIs mentioned here are clearly outlined that they want to also measure energy consumptions in terms of hosted dApps vs independently hosted dApps, as I also believe they will have more room for optimizations after such data and comparison is available. Additionally, the goals of this proposal in SDG sections are well explained, covering both mid term and long term goals, where we will see more sustainable energy efficient goals coming into play. \n\nOverall, a very well written proposal and good luck to the team.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has provided the public profile links of the main developers and technical advisors. Additionally, as a senior developer myself I can clearly see that the technical and architectural points described by the proposer in this proposal are top notch. This is a clear sign of very good expertise in the proposed topic. Additionally, the developers and team members are very experienced, and not only with the development but also in Haskell. So this is always a positive point.\n\nThe  budget outlined is a little bit on the higher side. However, when we look into the details of the milestones and where which funding amount is going to, it all makes sense. The amount asked for is very well distributed and explained. Clearly since this proposal is about providing infrastructure to the dApps the team has to incur costs of running kubernetes clusters on AWS (around $18k). I am therefore very satisfied with the amount they have asked for and hence in my opinion the budget is reasonable.\n\nThe milestones M1 to M5 are given as in when they can be expected, so the timeline is realistic. Additionally, the challenges and teams ideas behind solving/addressing those challenges are provided. I totally support the idea of dogfooding the service, as in my own work experience I have seen that this is very helpful in finding the potential issues before the product/software is launched to the outside world. Very nicely written proposal, and therefore I strongly agree that this proposal is highly feasible to be implemented successfully.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I strongly agree that this proposal is highly auditable and therefore the community can easily track the progress of this proposal. What I like about these milestones is that there will always be something for all the community members, e.g. front end running and showing things such as ADA transaction volume. Things such as online documentation of REST API interface and online functionality test can be done by any community member (Also the dApp developers can see what is happening and perhaps could provide quick feedback during the implementation period as well). Additionally, the milestones and other statistics will be shared via blogs with the community. Therefore, these trackable milestones items will have something interesting for every community member, whether coming from tech or non tech background.\n\nThe KPIs/success metrics is defined as in to see how many dApps developers will eventually be able to use these services and I believe this will be the main metrics to measure against the success of this project.\n\nThe targeted problem is well defined and the solution is explained in very easily understandable terms. Oftentimes I see that technical people use a lot of tech jargon, making it difficult for non technical users to understand things. This proposal, however, is written in a way that everyone can take away the big picture of what is the main goal of this proposal.

It will help the community easily understand and more confident.
