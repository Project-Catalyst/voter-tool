The proposer has provided a detailed cv of each team member. The timeframe of 6 months might be a little ambitious.  There are a number of tasks to be implemented until the platform is fully set up and running (maybe a couple of more weeks could help refining - just my opinion).  The budget is appropriate for all tasks.  What is unclear to me though is how to market the platform? How it will get known to musicians? This is a feasible project with a good team to implement it, but it needs to be known to people so that they can use it, therefore I suggest that the proposer and the team come up with a clear marketing plan to promote this wonderful platform.

The application of NFTs in the music industry is practical since Cardano is secured and efficient.

This does not constitute a significant obstacle due to his proven ability to lead succesful projects, in addition to being accompanied by an outsourced team with extensive experience in the development of applications and software.\nHowever, if the proposal is successful, it will need much more than a good Dapp because it will participate in a market that seeks to break heavy structures of the world of music and its operation.\nThe proponent understands this problem well, and although the project is in its early stages of development, it is possible to create the described platform to host the artists who see in Cardano, a launchpad for their projects.\nIn my opinion, the biggest challenge of this project will be to gain traction among artists as well as the consumer public, and that is why I would have liked to see in the proposal a thorough marketing plan or some partnerships already in place for the launch of the platform, as well as adressing  the importance on socials to get the ball rolling. \nI understand that there is a complementary proposal but if only this one gets funded, it should be able to guarantee sustainability on its own.\nIn summary, I believe that everything described is technically achievable by the team, however making this economic model reach the masses will be a task that cannot be measured within this proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The KPI's and milestones are clear and would allow clear monitoring of the project's objectives and achievements, as they are well defined.\nOn the other hand I consider that if approved, this project should establish a communication channel with the community in order to have a more direct communication, maybe participating in some Townhalls whwnever ther\u00e9s some milestone to watch. \nThe means provided to follow up on the results are social accounts that were created just a few days ago, including the proponent's account.
