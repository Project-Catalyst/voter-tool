It is about creating a DAO, which will revolve around the music world, where there will be various activities such as connecting musicians and services, promoting the bridge between studios (these first two activities are already happening); to play the role of a social network focused on the music world (this could be better explained here), in short, to promote a decentralized economy where investors, musicians, recorders and consumers could interact and establish agreements, sales and various types of contracts. This is what I understood would be done in the application. Regarding how all this would relate to the Cardano ecosystem, this part is explained briefly in the following paragraph: \u201ccreate use cases for DAO Governance, Payments, NTF, Smart Contracts for Gigs, DeFi, Services\u201d. Unfortunately, the explanation, as you can see, is very short, it is not explained in detail how the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem would be used. We know that they would be, because it is mentioned that NFT would be in play, smart contracts (which would logically be done on the Cardano blockchain), but not explained, for example, NFTs of what, would it be something that musicians would make available to their fans? Like unique album covers, artwork related to your work? What would these smart contracts be made for exactly? Who would be selling what service/product? Could this DAO be a kind of cryptographic Spotify, where musicians would receive a fairer amount for playing their songs? Despite being an idea that theoretically is promising, the explanation of the impact is still a little abstract, in my perception. If the internal workings of the application were better explained and how exactly it would use Cardano's technologies, I believe it would be easier to measure the impact, if the proposal is in line with what we are looking for here. I sincerely believe it is, but as I am not entirely sure about it due to the lack of more precise explanations, I will give 4 stars for the impact of this proposal. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There's a script here and it's a good level of detail, but it's organized in a somewhat confusing way, in my opinion. Starting off that I'm not sure what M1/M2 etc would be, I believe it's month 1 and 2, so I'll start from that assumption to continue my analysis. The proponent starts by explaining the main activities to be carried out from month 1 to 6, but this is done in a somewhat loose and superficial way. First it states what would be focused on the first and second month and then it focuses on the third to sixth month range. Below he writes some more activities to be developed in this period, at least that's what I understood (that these activities would be part of this block of time). But it is not possible to know exactly what would happen in month 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on. That is, I would prefer that the proponent had organized these activities in a linear and clear way, in order to resolve any doubts about at what point in the process each thing would happen. It would also be interesting to include the expected time to perform each task, this would also help to visualize more clearly what is to come. The same explanation format continues to follow, ranging for example from months 7 to 13, 14 to 20 and so on. In short, my opinion about the script is that we even get to know what is going to happen and roughly when, but not exactly when. The level of detail is quite complete in some time intervals, raising the level of this proposal. This makes understanding not the best possible. Moving on to another point of analysis, when it comes to the budget, this part is very problematic in my opinion. From what I could understand, each time interval would need a lot (a lot!) of investment, for example only in M1 and M2 it would be 131,396 USD. This is very expensive, the total project would cost more than 2 million dollars, which is close to what IOHK decided to invest in this Dapps challenge, which is an extremely high value. How would the project be financed from now on? If it was successful in the current fund, would it also be submitted in future funds? The first two months, which cost 131k, would like an explanation for the need for this money, that is, the bidder should justify it in parts (amount X would go to design, Y to programming and so on), in order to argue because it is a necessary amount. And finally, when it comes to the team, this is said in a confusing way. We have the names and linkedin profiles of some professionals, which allows us to get to know them in practice and is very positive, but we do not know who will do what in the project. Some functions are described below, it is not possible to understand if these would be the functions of the professionals mentioned above or of people they still want to hire. Therefore, I think feasibility has a lot to improve in its 3 analysis aspects. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I think the auditability of this project is better in the sense of verifying whether success is being achieved than following the application development process, but in general it is possible and satisfactory. It is said that the achieved milestones can be verified in a public gitlab and also through the already active products, this would require a community effort to follow the project. I think it would be more appropriate if the team itself made reports with a summary of monthly progress, for example, and made them available to the Cardano community. In terms of success, it could be easily verified because the proponent makes clear numerous of his objectives and goals, both numerically (he wants to increase the number of current users of his application by 10x) and qualitatively through what should happen (in case of success) until the year 2030. KPIs are also traced, that is, there are several ways to exercise auditability. It is, in a way, possible to monitor the process also through the activities mentioned in the viability in the respective months, but as I said, because they are not located in time exactly, this is a little more difficult. If the schedule were revised and improved, I would give this item the highest score, but as in my opinion the analysis of the final products is 100% possible and the analysis of the processes is not, I will give it 4 stars; improving communication between the Cardano team and community and establishing probable dates for the start and end of each task, in each of the phases, would improve the monitoring of the proposal. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The difficulties encountered by new musicians at the beginning of their careers are quite notorious, especially for those who do not have many resources. The proposal in question is a platform (already functional in some aspects) that seeks to demystify this scenario, by offering features that make funding and earnings for new artists more democratic, even benefiting those who are not artists, but use the platform. These new services and features offered by AMY use blockchain-related technologies to make processes more transparent and eliminate intermediaries. In this way, the use of Cardano technologies in this process makes the proposal fit the goals of the challenge, as well as the success of the endeavor can bring positive visibility to our ecosystem, driving more exponents and possibilities for solutions using Cardano.\n\nHowever, one point that counts negatively for this proposal is the amount of funding being requested. We see that $250,000 is too high a value (even because there is a certain divergence in relation to this later on, as we will see) which undermines the proposal and its possible impact.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The main reasons that indicate a good feasibility for the project seem to be the following topics: The organization in well defined periods of time for the actions to be carried out; The consequences of these actions on the project's own ecosystem.\n\nRegarding the first topic, we see that the steps are organized in a logical way, starting from simpler actions such as research and planning, to more robust steps such as marketing and development of what was planned. This is a positive point as it demonstrates a good understanding on the part of the team about the path to be followed in the development. And about the team, we noticed that they generally have extensive work experience, and they also made their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s available to confirm this. We also observed the existence of a very well structured website, with the project concepts being transmitted in a simple and cohesive way.\n\nIn relation to the second topic, we noticed that with the adoption of the users, over time, of the ideas proposed by the project, the tendency is for new artists, normal users or even partnerships to be established, strengthening the project token and generating greater visibility to this way of supporting and also profiting. It is possible to see that this would happen due to the format of social connection that the project promotes. We even see that there is already a considerable base of users of the service.\n\nSo far, it seems that we have mostly positive points to believe in feasibility. But unfortunately, when we consider the detailing of the budget, we see that immense amounts are being asked to carry out the various planned steps. The sum of these amounts is even totaling over 2,100,000. And we see that this is approximately 84% of the fund, making funding this proposal quite unfeasible. We also note that this value is different from the statement in the impact section.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "We see that the team demonstrated good manners for following up on the different stages of the project. A very positive point is the existence of a roadmap on the site that indicates the main actions to be carried out, and in addition to that, the team demonstrated here that the results can be monitored in a public gitlab (which helps people in the tech area to analyze the evolution ) and also in the products already developed.\n\nIn addition, the team's perception of success is well defined, we can see this by defining the number of users of the program that you want to reach and also by the ideas that the team aims to convey to prove that the service is beneficial, such as demonstrating the savings obtained in compared to other similar services. With that, we see that this proposal seems to have good potential, so it would be interesting to try to readjust the amounts being requested to increase the chances of success of the project.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The AMY Music DAO-Decentralize economy proposal want to connect musicians, studio service providers, investor by creating decentralized experience in DeFi, NFT, payment.
