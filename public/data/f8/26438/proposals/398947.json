Several features are considered in the solution tha may raise audicence interest and that are not easily found nowadays in current food apps and increase product value proposition.\nAt the same time many possibilities are offerered to end-costumers, it uses Cardano smart contracts and blockchain to generate revenue to kitchens, chef's and whomever has its product in this market place. \nMoreover, proposal addresses challenge as it follows Dapp challenge potential direction of \"NFT marketplace or facilitator\" and \"Solutions utilising the power of smart contract\" and createsa new viable application build on top of cardano. The 12 benefits list make sense and helps to show the value to voters.\n\nAs potential insights for proposal, I'd consider:\n1) creating at least draft of a business case. Have some numbers on how many people would the plaform have to have to be profitable, how to generate revenue, what range of prices costumers would be willing to pay and etc. This is imporant to confirm is economical/commercial viability (as imporant as the technical one). The business case would also work as an input for the business model, to be developed in this project.\n\n2) As I mentioned, I really appreciated having all the said features/possiblities in one market place. it is just important not to have a scope so broad that it delivers a poor quality in all of them (lack of focus). Maybe it would be good to start small, with one or two, possibilites and grow as they mature. A lot of food apps/market places did this (some started selling food and after some years they sell airplane tickets and travel packages as well).\n\n3) I also see space to consider some sustainbility aspects in this proposal. optmize delivery packge routes and transportations (CO2 emission reduction),  reduce the use of packaging in deliveries (reduce waste), incentivize the use of renewable and reusable materials. All of this can be optimzied in a more integrated value chain as blockchain allows. Not saying this should be in the proposal at this point but it is something to consider later on.\n\n\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There's a plan composed of 2 main acitvities with duration of up to 3 months. I know it is is a short period of time but they could be detailed a bit more on how they would going to be executed. For instance, the first activity a business model a pitch deck but before doing that, maybe some research has to be done, and maybe for carrying out this research a 3rd party would have to be hired - just an example as how these acitivites can be complex. This kind of detail is imporant to understand the level of depth these deliverables will have. \nHowever, I agree with the strategy too divide this project across 3 funds. It is a lot work to do, and, developing it little by little will allow to show results before asking for more fund and increase the chances of not being left out for asking a high amount of resources at once.\n\nBudget breakdown matches exactly the plan, which should be good at first,  but, as I said, the plan isnt much detailed and so neither is the budget. Here proposer could break it down a bit more, provide also the amount of hours required for each deliverable how much the hour costs. It helps to bring transparency to the project.\n\nAs for the team, there are 7 people already committed, with their expertise/role mentioned and 2 to be hired. For these 7 people, more information could be provided on their past experiences and competencies and/or bring their linkedin links (it is only shown here for the advisor). \n\nSummarizing my score, as plan and budget aren't much detailed, there's still 2 people to be hired and only few information of the committed team is provided, I'll score the feasibility as 3 star.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are clear final deliverables for this 3 month work: the white paper, business model, pitch deck, Ux Ui detailed Case Study and so on. \nThis is all auditable and will be available in their github, as I understood, which is good.\nIt would be nice though to have some way to evaluate these deliverables quality. For instance, what is considered a good pitch deck? what is a good white paper? is the case study developed for UX UI detailed enough?\nProposer could provide here some insight on how he thinks these things would be good enough or, somehow, collect feedback from community/stakeholders/potential users/costumers/experts to get their perception if what as developed is meeting the needs for this project and is ready to move foward, to next phase.\n\nLast, in case this project uses an agile approach, sprint reports and product backlog updated could also be made available to track progress  and collect feedback while project is on going.

Some things in my view, like \u201ctext, video and relevant metadata like nutritional information, ingredients, cuisine genre, etc\u201d are pretty simple to understand as they could be converted to NFT. However, the meals themselves (experience NFT?), I didn't understand how this would be transformed to the format in question. In the excerpt \u201ctry NFTs with your favorite chefs, enjoy prepared meals delivered to them by API-connected cloud kitchens and restaurants (also potential content owners), and even pay private chefs in your area to cook for them on-site.\u201d proponents talk about this experience, but it's really not very clear to me how this could all be converted to NFTs. A very positive point of this proposal, in my view, is how the exploited market is in fact multifaceted, that is, there are many possible users for this application (\"farmers, food brands, delivery aggregators, food tasters, service providers, etc. kitchen inspection services\u201d). This could generate a large number of new active members for the Cardano ecosystem, which already meets one of the objectives of this challenge, which is to generate Dapps that help popularize our blockchain, increasing the number of transactions on the Cardano network, such as would be the case for the NFTs coined here. Another positive point of the proposal is how the user experience is described. From what I understand, people would access the platform on the web2, that is, it would already be something they would be familiar with; however, there would be an artificial intelligence guiding their searches, so that a rich repertoire of options would be presented to them. This actually seems to be a way to generate a very interesting and engaging user experience. The proponent also details how the possible uses of the platform would be through B2C and B2B offers, that is, he details very well how the application itself would work. He also outlines several uses that could be made on the platform and possible challenges to be overcome, which I think is very positive because it demonstrates that he has the maturity to determine what the possible problems would be; this generates more preparation when it comes to overcoming them. The only observation I would like to make is about how chefs, brand owners, food tasters, in short, how service providers in this area would be able to transform their products/services into NFTs. I didn't understand very well how this would be done, if who would do this technical part would be other people/artificial intelligences. Otherwise, I think it's a great idea, a Dapp that can really help popularize the Cardano ecosystem due to the wide range of uses it will offer, and with that, the diverse group of end users it can reach. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The script of the proposal is rather superficial. We know the phases and the main activities developed in each of them. However, it would be more appropriate for the proponents to place us more precisely on how the whole process would take place. In the first phase alone, it would take about 3 months to complete the work, and several activities would be done (a detailed business model, pitch deck and white paper + a Ux Ui Design case study on the backend for content integration /creation of NFTs for content). But how long would each of them take? Who would work on each of the aforementioned team members? It would be better for him to divide the time into smaller intervals, either monthly, or to inform exactly what time to expect for the development of each step. For example, would the UI/UX design case study be done in 1 month or more? It would also be interesting for proponents to better detail the activities themselves, this case study itself, how would it be done? How would the case to be studied be selected, and through what factors would it be studied? Now going to explain the financing, the amount requested is 9500 dollars. In my opinion, this is a very fair value, as the project is complex and involves many professionals and different activities. However, the explanation of how it would be used is superficial too, as is the script. Let's use this excerpt as an example: \u201c$5,000 for website development, white paper, detailed business plan and proposal submission, which will be essential for seed and venture capital funding\u201d. It's very similar to what happens in a screenplay: we're given a lot of information together, but how much would each piece of information cost in isolation? It would be necessary for the proponents to specify this better, the way it is presented to us, the budget division does not allow us to understand, for example, what salary would be attributed to the professionals involved. We also don't know how much time they would dedicate to the project, which means that we have no idea whether the hourly rate charged is fair or too high. It's probably fair, as there are a lot of people involved and the project can range from 12 to 18 months in length. In other words, a lot of work will have to be done. However, I would like this information to be passed on more securely. Now speaking in relation to the team, we do not know individualized information about each professional involved, all we know is what functions are necessary for the project to be carried out. But it would be important for us to know the names of those involved, what they have done so far professionally (a small resume that demonstrates their experiences) as well as how they relate to Cardano. So viability isn't bad, but it still has a lot to improve. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I was a little confused about how to audit the process, because proponents say \u201cThe goals are to have all funding requirements and materials ready before the Fund9\u201d, and we know what requirements and materials those are (Ux Ui detailed case study + Pitch deck, etc.). However, once they are funded, how could we measure the development process of this project? I think at first it's essential that they better detail the roadmap, so that the community knows exactly what to monitor. In the background, it is important for this team to keep the Cardano community always up to date on partial results, that is, the small goals that will be achieved over time. It is necessary that they define new requirements and materials that would be conquered little by little, and also that they establish when (at most) each thing would have to be delivered. My advice is that some members of the Cardano community, who feel engaged in monitoring this project more closely, can follow along with the technical team and provide periodic feedback to the rest of the community. Now in terms of the final results, the proponents provide a very detailed picture of what success would look like, and this is very good as it gives us solid insight into what needs to be achieved. However, it is unclear how this information would reach members of the Cardano ecosystem. I think it would be necessary that somehow (either by a written report or by a meeting after Town Hall, for example) the proponents would explain whether the intended results were obtained through direct surveys with the service providers who used Dapp; we also need to know how this project impacted Cardano in practice, if an increase in the number of transactions on our blockchain was observed; if indeed the number of NFTs minted in Cardano has grown significantly; whether we have new Ada holders, and so on. All this must be observed, reported, proven and made available to members of the Cardano community. So what I think about auditability: it's on track, we know what to monitor, but proponents need to define new metrics to be noticed during progress and specify how the community will be able to know the information mentioned as final results. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 7, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1332, "q0": "The proposal tries to create a Food NFT Marketplace that enables content owners and creators to secure and monetize their content (text, video, and relevant metadata such as nutrition info, ingredients, cuisine genre, etc).
