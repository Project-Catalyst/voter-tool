Success of the project is defined as deployment to production in mainnet and testnet, which is effectively a good way of ensuring whether the product has been completed. However, the team could have provided some other quality parameters about the expected solution... The team is expected, as every proposing team in Catalyst, to the periodically report progress to the community. dcSpark does not explicitly state a way of reporting to the community, however I would draw attention to the fact that the developers have been massively present in the Cardano community channels, accessible aslo through their available Twitter and Discord channels. They have taken part in multiple online sessions (Youtube,Twitter spaces) discussing the limitations of current Cardano technology and how to improve it, so I believe that the team expects to use multiple channels for informing the community about progress.
