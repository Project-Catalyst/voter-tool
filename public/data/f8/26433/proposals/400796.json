One can easily build apps that will generate zk-proofs and be saved in the Cardano blockchain. Through the proposed solution, the proposer wants to make building zk apps easy for developers in Cardano by eliminating the hard stuff, no need to learn so much of the intricacies of zk, no need to learn Rust language. I strongly believe that this proposal will address the requirements that the challenge poses to reduce the barrier for developers to participate in Cardano, create a great experience for developers to encourage them to create, increase productivity, and contribute to the Cardano ecosystem. As for the presentation, there are a lot of technical terms related to the solution that is clearly explained by the proposer and are relatively easy to understand even for non-technical people. The author also analyzed and clearly presented the core features, the implementation structure of the module, the positive impacts of the solution on developers in particular, and the Cardano ecosystem in general. I strongly support the core idea behind this project.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "We can find the necessary information in their project development plan, including timelines, key tasks, parts of the project to be completed, release time of beta version/official version. With the plan and work experience described earlier, I realize that the probability of this project being realized and successful is very high. The proposer lists the key resources in developing the project including personnel positions, number of members in each position, software/tools. Budgets are allocated per resource so the community can easily see what the budget is going to be allotted. To increase the legitimacy of the budget allocation plan, if possible, I encourage the proposer to allocate the budget at an hourly rate, which means that the pay budget is based on the hours worked by the members. The proposer put a lot of effort into the introduction of the team members. He/She provides us with a biographical description of their team, core members, and projects/works they have been working on (link attached). The members all have multi-disciplinary knowledge, areas of expertise suitable to the field of the project, and considerable work experience that can ensure the feasibility of the project. However, authors should attach Linkedin profiles of members to increase the authenticity of their descriptions.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers describe that they will track the work and progress of the project through GitHub, and this will also be a tool for those interested in the project to track ongoing activities. However, the proposer has not yet provided us with a GitHub link for the project. The KPIs proposed by the proposer are the tasks that they set their goals to be achieved, but without a roadmap and actual KPIs, it is difficult for the community to measure the success of the project and verify the project is worth the investment or not. For this proposal, the actual KPIs could be the number of projects using their module and the user experience feedback.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1724", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7758, "q0": "Zero-Knowledge Proof is basically a mechanism to verify one\u2019s credential without actually revealing those information to the verifier. This proposal explains ZK in detail and it\u2019s explained clearly and easy to follow. This proposal addresses the problem where ZK is still not available within Cardano, and their solution is to create project Know Zero. Know Zero is a project to make ZK technology is readily available on Cardano. They will build a zk-enabled module complete with APIs. To ease up development even further, they will provide SDK for Javascript devs as well, so the devs can just focus on building zk apps without having to learn extra stuff. This will further bring more people who are interested into ZK technology into building on Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Know Zero project team has developed a ZK based project before. The team consist of 10 man team with relevant experience ranging from Web Development to healthcare systems expert. The budget is broken down into identifiable manner, however it would be useful to include their expected work hour, this is to let the community know what their weekly hour are. The team already have various experience with past project, such as Hippocrades dApp that has been selected in Ariob Incubator program by Cardano. Overall, this project have a high chance of success, given the team experience and their past project. However, I\u2019d only gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because of their roadmap and goals that doesn\u2019t have further detail and goal. Although this is a new venture to implement ZK into Cardano, at least give it an idea on what to expect for Month 2-4 rather than just \u201cStart of Development\u201d without exact goal provided.

They explained well about the description of targeted problem and how to address it, which is the solution to create ZK module and APIs for Cardano. However, the roadmap doesn\u2019t have a concrete milestones and goal for each month. It would be helpful to include a concrete metrics/KPIs to measure success, because it will make the community able to track their current progress, like do they meet the target or not.

Most important of which is \u201cWhat are the tools that we need to prioritize first?\u201d As the submitters of this proposal also note zero knowledge proofs  are a very hot topic currently in the Blockchain world, and with good reason. It allows for much more efficient use of the L1 chain, while also not compromising on security. As such, if funded and implemented successfully, this project has the potential to have a significant cascading impact on the Cardano ecosystem as it will allow developers to implement zero knowledge proofs into the project much more easily by using the API that is the focus of this proposal.\n\nIn addition the proposal answers another very important question set by the challenge setting namely: \u201cWhat do developers want, and how do they get it from the Cardano dev ecosystem?\u201d. There is currently a great interest in the topic of zero knowledge protocols in the crypto developer space, thus the implementation of this project will bring the Cardano ecosystem one step closer to aligning with the needs of blockchain developers.\n\nThe proposers also have previous experience with developing similar zero knowledge APIs for healthcare applications, and as such, this project will benefit from the experience that they already have accumulated in the field making it potentially even more impactful.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I would have liked to see a bit more detail in the implementation plan, but as it stands now it's very robust and offers a great overview of how the team plans to build the project over the course of six months.\n\nThe budget breakdown is straightforward and covers different development tasks for the necessary periods indicated (between one to 6 months).\nThe developer pay might seem very low by Western standards but it should be feasible given the team's location in Africa.\n\nThe team provides extensive proof of and references of their previous relevant work and describes in detail the experience of the top three members of the 10 person team.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The contents of the Auditability section of the proposal reveal the fact that the team has experience in meticulously tracking the deliverables of a project and progress towards them.\n\nHowever, I would have liked to see more emphasis on the way development on the project will be reported to Catalyst and a clearer set of KPIs and quantifiable metrics that will be the focus of those reports.

But as we advance, it won't be easy as other chains are progressing towards supporting the needs of people with not much technical expertise. Hence, it's necessary for us to bring certain mechanisms into place to draw this crowd into our ecosystem. The proposer provides one such way to tackle this issue at hand. The \"Know Zero\" as they call it would be a great start and on standardizing and benchmarking the APIs created, the quality of support we could provide to all kinds of users would be massive. This could accelerate the contributions on the Cardano chain and could do a great deed in advancing Cardano as one of the trusted and easiest chains to build on. The team seems to be aware of the security and credibility challenges involved and has the necessary measures to overcome these, considering they have already developed a ZK-proof called Nightingale. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has mentioned being very prudent regarding the timeline in their proposal and it looks like they have carefully laid out their plan for the same. The team has briefly mentioned the milestones they intend to reach within a span of 6 months and be ready with a ready-to-use prototype. The budget breakdown shows almost all the funds raised being directed to the developers and all the figures look promising and justifiable. The team provides the community with all the references to their previous ventures and how well they have progressed and laid out a strong foundation coming into this funding round. However, the milestones being very vague and also taking into consideration that the team still have some shoes to fill looking at the number of developers they need to get it going, I would hold myself back from giving full marks but have no doubt in the capabilities of the team.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The KPIs listed in the manifesto all are simple complements to the development activities undertaken and the challenge's key metrics. However, apart from the basic best coding practices and tracking development through git and sprint boards, there is no quantifiable measure available to the community to monitor the impact the product could attain on completion. The success criteria and outcomes do not justify the possible result the community could expect, there is no evidence to draw a conclusion on whether the success of the product would be on the similar lines as of the campaign's success metrics. Being a fairly new proposal and a great initiative, I feel the auditability section could have been more stronger and lucid.

This might come handy, especially for small teams, however, in my view impact is limited to a quite narrow selection of apps. They do not plan to propose adding any zkSNARK as a primitive to Cardano base layer (in fact, no specific zkSNARK is mentioned, and there are many different alternatives), so both creation and validation of the zkSNARK would happen off-chain. Therefore, the candidate app would need a trusted off-chain component that verifies some information and store a proof on-chain. That proof could then be validated, also off-chain, by an independent third party that do not trust the issuer (if it did, a simple signed message would be enough). I find it hard to come up with examples of such applications, and the proposer seems to have the same difficulty, as the problem statement of the proposal does not in fact present any problem. It's important not to get carried away with buzzwords, zkSNARKS are a technology with a great potential for scaling (see Orbis proposal in the Scaling challenge), or private transactions (see zCash), but this proposal feels like a solution looking for a problem.
