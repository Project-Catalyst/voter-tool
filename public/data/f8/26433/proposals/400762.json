Therefore, they just give a very brief description of their solution\u2019s goal, which is to provide off-chain data feeds for developers. The community can get more specific information about their solution in the related proposal. Instead, they focus on clarifying the reason for this proposal, which is to expand their current treasury fund to effectively operate their solution. They also discuss their problem with costs, their current status in fundraising and expect a specific number from the community ($50K). The expected outcomes (more data feeds for longer)  from this project and its impact (make it easier for developers to build on top of the Cardano, thus expanding the Cardano ecosystem) are also stated. The community can see that their purposes are very clear. \nAs the purpose to expand the funding, the main challenge they are encountering is the cost of running their project. There have been interests from other partners, so they will continue to raise more funds. They can provide specific steps taken to stretch the funding from other partners, so the community will know their plan works or not to ensure the operation of their feeds.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "They are already on month 1 of the detailed timeline, so the community can base on their timeline to see future steps taken after receiving funds. Their timeline is very clear and split into specific periods of time, allowing the community to follow and track if there is any astray sign. The data feed specification remains unknown, however, this has been clearly explained in the proposal.\nThey present why they request a fund of $50K and how they gonna use it. However, the breakdown could be hard to provide as they mentioned and this is clearly explained with specific examples for better understanding. Although there is no budget breakdown provided, the community can obviously see their efforts to make it clear as much as possible. The team is professionally presented on the Charli3 website.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They have provided well-aligned KPIs to measure the progress of data feeds and set a clear goal for this proposal. Their base to identify success is also clear with specific periods of time and expected deliverables. This good visibility of success will allow them to keep focused and set the right direction for the project development.

Originating from the demand of developers to get access to off-chain data feed which is costly to afford to build Dapps. So, this solution met that demand and ultimately  will encourage developers to build Dapps on Cardano. This solution is somehow what the challenge is looking for. The proposal did a great job in adding information related to how this solution operates, its main activities by explaining how the fund requested would be used and why it requested for that amount. For example, the section mentioning where the fund goes to, it indicated how and where this solution chooses feeds to provide for developers. In fact, it will employ DAO, so voting members of the public can decide on what feeds are available. And the data feeds are from industry leading data partners . However, it could be improved by indicating how developers could get access to and use the feeds provided. Some risks that this project was given in great detail, and the plan to get over them was developed as well. Besides, the proposal also did a great job in describing some risks when delivering this project. They were given in great detail, and the plan to get over them was developed as well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A detailed, step-by-step plan was given. In each step, a detailed description of what would be done in each step was presented. Despite the fact that it gave an explanation why there is no timeline is because there are some factors that are unknown. However, it should estimate each step should be executed and completed in how long. No need to give the exact number but the estimation time would make the plan more specific. Similar to the plan without a timeline, it explained why giving an estimated cost is impossible because its nature is different from other projects. In fact, there are a lot of unknown factors that will alter over time and change the cost. An example to support that reason was given. This is the biggest problem of this proposal as there is no estimation in terms of time and budget, so it makes it hard to say that this project could be operated with the requested budget as the cost would fluctuate as it mentioned. About the team working on this project, it provided a link to their profile. However, it would be better to list here some outstanding points of human resources. That would be more convenient.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Without a timeline from the plan, then to this part of auditability, it is unclear and unsure to measure the progress of the project. It stated that it has the internal KPIs in different categories, but no detailed information was provided. The good point is it determined the most important KPI,  but again, there is no timeline, so it is difficult to track the progress.However, the success of this project was described clearly with a clear KPI including specific figures and timeline.

I think they very thoroughly proved their point and explained the impact this proposal could have on the entire Cardano ecosystem. It's an expensive ask, but it's an impactful one. PLUS, approval is to be matched by Charli3 AND IOHK. So, approval here technically means $150k is provided IF the $50k proposal is approved. Besides the evaluation of the money, I think this is a MUST approve. I think this proposal implements a major element of efficiency that Cardano projects can utilize (even if just temporarily) to create functional applications on Cardano. Since the price feed would be free, it opens up the accessibility options that startup projects might have available to them. I think this serves the Cardano ecosystem in a very substantial way, that nobody else is doing.
