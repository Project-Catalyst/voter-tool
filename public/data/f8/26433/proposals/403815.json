This challenge has a number of key metrics as well as guiding questions specifically referencing tooling for developers, incentive structures and developer needs, none of which are addressed in the proposal. \n\nThe plan as set out for the proposer also does not provide any information regarding the value to the Cardano ecosystem. The main topic for the conferences are NodeJS, PHP and Java. While these languages are popular tools among full-stack developers, the benefits to the Cardano ecosystem specifically are not clear. It looks like the proposer is requesting for funding to host events which have little overlap with the challenge setting.\n\nEven if the proposer decided to host a Cardano specific event targeted at on-boarding new people into Cardano, that proposal would be more appropriately placed in the New Member Onboarding challenge.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "As a South African myself, the budget does not seem to be feasible in light of the cost of goods and operations in South Africa. The event staff members will each be paid close to half the annual salary the average engineer is paid in South Africa. \n\nThe proposer\u2019s plan also indicates that Free Venues will be utilized. This means that $19938 USD (+-R300000) will be put towards non-venue expenses for each event. To put that in perspective, that money in South African currency could pay for roughly 160 round trip tickets to fly from Johannesburg to Cape Town. If the requested funding amounts are truly reflective of the actual costs, there is no proof provided or anyway for an adviser or voter to know where the funding is to be allocated beyond a couple of bullet points. The funding requested also excludes the revenue generated from ticket sales.\n\nBudget aside, no information about the organizational team beyond a website is given, or beyond a subjective statement about the proposer written by the porposer. The website also lists the UX South Africa event as being online, however the proposer is requesting Catalyst funding for what seems to be in-person events. As an adviser I cannot with any confidence say that this proposal would be successful if funded because there is just not enough to go on.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proposal lacks any clear project plan, KPI measurements for internal auditability or any kind of external audit metrics by which community members can audit or track the progress of the project.\n\nBased on the provided information, there is no way for me as an adviser to know how this project can be audited. Additionally, there is no measurements by which the project progress can be verified or checked besides an after-the-fact look at how many people arrive at each event.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1248", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 2, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "For adoption we need to be able to train more skilled developers to develop smart contracts for the Cardano ecosystem. What I'm proposing is extending training at my developer and User Experience Conferences in Africa. I've built an ecosystem since 2013 where developers attend our conferences in person and virtually. Designing a conference specifically dedicated to developers on Cardano will take years to build and attract the correct developers. The overlap will be having a dedicated track and workshop to Cardano smart contracts. The feasibility is a long term focus. What will the ecosystem look like in 5 years rather than here and now. \n\nWith reference to free venues. Once funding is confirmed the conferences will be free. The cost will go directly to venues/food for 3 days. If the assessor require quotations for international speaker costs/accommodation and venue costs that can be provided.

The proponent wants to apply his conferencing platform to spread the word and group the developers about the Cardano ecosystem. Aims to teach its young developers and designers about the ecosystem.

The budget requested for the proposal is reasonable. But unfortunately I do not understand how the proposal will be implemented with the team.
