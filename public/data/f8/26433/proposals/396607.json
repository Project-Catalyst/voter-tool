Their approach is to create a library that would provide browser-based support for transactions, making it simple and straightforward for developers to integrate into crucial infrastructure. This proposal's purpose is nicely matched with the challenge, which is to provide a favorable developer experience and attract developers to the ecosystem. The idea demonstrated that the author had carefully considered their solution. They investigated the advantages that Ethereum offers in terms of user experience that Cardano does not, and then devised a thoughtful solution to bridge this gap.\n\nThe proponent had expected obstacles in the development process: dealing with type differences and resolving discrepancies in UTxO management among wallets. These technological concerns were resolved, and the proponent team made some early headway. As a result, I believe the project's delivery is at low risk.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponent provided the goals of the project and an outline of how they would proceed to achieve the goals without a timeline.

For clarity, I recommend that the proponent include the milestones in their delivery plan.\n\nThe budget breakdown is quite comprehensive. It includes major items in the development phase of the project, together with an estimated working time to complete each item. From my understanding, the proponent calculated the final budget based on the total time needed and the wage of $79.95/hour. I performed some wage research and discovered that the indicated pay rate is within the pay range for a Senior Software Engineer in the United States. As a result, I believe the proponent should provide additional evidence of the team's experience in order to make the needed budget more convincing.\u00a0\n\nThe team is from MLabs, one of the leading development businesses in the Cardano Ecosystem, so they do have credibility.
