Success of project can be measured by back tracking the principle against previous fund distribution data and possible rules to be built for fund distribution. Manual method always has the edge in participating with project teams and trancking/monitoring progress and releasing funds accordingly. This depends on the level of understanding of the fund distributor to project (trust in system) and the experience of the fund distributor from past funds (Each individual is a continuously learning and adjusting and growing within system). To mimic by automation is a tough challenge and hope the team can bring some basic rules to help the funding team to work faster.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1461", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "According to the proposal team, the current funding process for Catalyst Project is manual and takes a lot of time and that will be the cause of the delay in project development. The team proposes a solution that uses a smart contract for Catalyst funding to speed up the funding process. I do believe in this statement and support the idea of the proposal team. However, proposers should set a clear solution for the project. For example, the project should be more clearly described in terms of functions. I wonder who are the potential users that the project targets? and How does this project affect those users? The good point is that the project shows specific results when completed. But these results have not shown that they are consistent with the project's KPIs. Currently, the project has not anticipated challenges, but the team is committed to updating more information and publicizing the project's activities in the community.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project roadmap is divided into 3 parts (3 months, 6 months, 9 months after funding). The progress of the project is also shown in great detail with each timeline by logically divided bullet points. That makes it easier for readers to follow up on the progress of the team. It seems that we already have a basic spending plan with a total estimated cost of about 33,100 USD. If possible, it would be better to have a more detailed spending plan for each item and present it in a clearer way.\nThe project is led by two Vietnamese developers, Nguyen Anh Tien and Nguyen Van Hieu. They have many years of experience in the Cardano piece and Crypto space. With their knowledge, background, and experience, they promise to create the project that benefits the Cardano Ecosystem.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The plan for clarity is rather sketchy. The plan only shows the time and the work completed during that time. The proposal team should show more clear indicators to track the progress of the project. It should include the number of users and the amount of traffic the project intends to achieve. The team has determined that the successful goal of the project is to help the donor team save time on disbursement. They will focus more on creating products for Cardano Ecosystem. It would be more effective if the team provided additional proposal information of previous funds project or an entirely new one.

Through the project, the proposer expects to shorten the funding time, motivating developers to develop the project in a faster time. I appreciate their ideas, if the project is successful it will have a positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem and the developers. They described the core feature of the product and the dApp's workflow very well. I have full confidence in their project implementation, they have received FUND6 and FUND7 grants, so I think they have a good grasp of how to present the project logically and convincingly. I just wonder if Catalyst's funding for developers is completely free or have to pay a fee to make the transaction. I also want them to focus on customer identity verification and security risks. Overall, the project's core idea matches the Challenge KPIs, I'll give this section 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "They have developed a very good project development plan, they identified the main goals/activities in 3 timelines of 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months, they also gave a timeline for completing the product and plans to try out smart contract features before running the contract on the Mainnet. The plan shows that they are confident with their Blockchain-related knowledge and experience and ready to execute the plan at any time. The budget breakdown is also presented in detail, full of information about personnel positions, main jobs, working time, salary paid, it would be better if they fully added the number of employees in each position. They have made an effort to assemble a team consisting of members with a background working in the field of Blockchain technology and understanding of the Cardano ecosystem, which can be easily authenticated through credentials, Linkedin, affiliate addresses that they provide. Since they have had experience and successfully raised capital in previous Funds, they understand very well the importance of providing complete information. In this part, I will give 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The plus point of this part is that the team has come up with a roadmap with milestones and information that can track the development progress of the project. However, this information is more like key activities than KPIs so that the community can determine auditability and measure project development progress. True KPIs are reflected in specific numbers, such as the number of people using the platform, the number of transactions over a period of time that the team expects to achieve.
