Developers and other workers will be able to filter the list of bounties based on \"skills match and possibly other factors\".  This will allow developers to easily find web3 work, bridging the gap between the needs of organizations and developers. \n\nWithin the potential directions highlighted in the challenge brief, this proposal falls into support structures and incentivization structures categories. A bounty board is an important piece of communication infrastructure. It allows the community to find the necessary skills, reducing friction and improving efficiency in finding personnel. Such communication infrastructure is missing within the Cardano ecosystem. Currently, developers must look through Catalyst proposals to find projects to contribute on. This process is inefficient. It requires time and effort by the developer to delve deep into the project, look through its documents and decide if that is a worthwhile project to contribute to. Having all that information in one place is important and nothing solves that problem at the moment.\n\nThe proposers believe that is the major way they will improve on existing bounty boards: \"... connecting those bounty hunters directly into the working groups and projects, and review their missions, their clearly expressed goals, plans and success criteria.\".  This means connecting values, enabling web3 workers to find projects they feel truly passionate about. This is a worthy project that solves an important problem. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal covers 2 months of development. The end product of this development will be a bounty board with context filtering, allowing web3 workers to find relevant and skills matched work. These features are simple in terms of software complexity. They can be implemented without issue by a capable team. \n\nMore complicated to implement will be blockchain based features: payment of bounties, creating bounties that lock funds away (presumably). These will require Plutus work. These features aren't mentioned in the proposal but I assume they will be developed at some point even if not within the first two months. \n\nThe proposers are an experienced group. The intro paper they link to lists 4 people and many partners and advisors. Collectively the team has extensive software development experience. They have developed many production level systems and it shows. Their partners include Gimbalabs and ADAO, so any expertise they may need is never far away. I have no doubt the team has the necessary technical skills to carry this project to completion. \n\n\n\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This is the only part of the proposal that leaves me wanting more. It's somewhat difficult to pinpoint the proposal down to specifics. I'm not sure what all the features of the product will be at completion. Will bounties be implemented as smart contracts or will they simply be information and we have to trust the poster to make the payment? What will bounty payment look like on the platform after the two months and beyond? It's not entirely clear.\n\nThe roadmap includes this statement: \"Add mechanism for synchronizing \"advertised\" bounties from inside a DAO's scope to the global scope of bounty boards, for aggregated presentation\". This implies integrating bounties specified on other platforms. What other platforms? What type of integration? What's the scope of this feature? These aren't very clear so it won't be easy for auditors to tell at the end of two months.\n\nThat isn't to say the auditability of this proposal is poor. The main features, implementing a bounty board with skills based matching, DAO context with mission, values, etc. are clear and easily auditable. Some other features do need to be defined better and for this the proposers have highlighted the importance of market fit studies. They will conduct 6 sessions, which we can presume will help shape the product and clear some of the questions. Also, it's quite simple to audit 6 market research sessions, either with videos, or study reports detailing the findings.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1323", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 4, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "thanks for the comments.  The platform overall will include task-and-bounty planning, so connecting those planning elements to the aggregated bounty board might be the missing link for you.  : )"}, {"q0": "The proposal stemmed from the issue of lacking prestigious and popular bounty boards to help people find a good source to earn a living without waiting for Catalyst. It did a great job in describing what the solution, the Done Collectively Platform, is all about, its functions, features, and how it will benefit users. It showed some comments of users about how different and outstanding this platform is, which directly emphasized its impact on the community. It also emphasized how different this solution is in comparison with existing bounty boards to show how impactful it is. Besides, it also showed the potential of this solution by providing a roadmap of some upcoming integrations. It also explained how suitable it is to the challenge as it is providing a supported and incentivized structure for new community members in Cardano. Another highlight is that it gave a detailed description of the challenges this project may face while delivering. And the plan to overcome them was well-given as well", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal stated that its big project is occurring well and the plan provided in this proposal is an additional part to build additional components to enhance everything in the platform, which shows that this proposal is highly feasible. This plan was written in quite great detail. It did a great job in mentioning details of each time milestone. In fact, it provided what would be done and how things should be done in each timeframe. The budget breakdown was quite well-given as it showed the unit of cost calculation, the total, and the detailed breakdown cost of each activity. Regarding human resources, this project is led by a software developer with  10+ years of experience as a remote worker, having a background in a variety of different fields such as database, API, other server-side applications, UI software, accounting, to name a few. This person is quite trustworthy to lead this project to success.  Besides, it also gets support in terms of market-fit and work validation from a group of designers, facilitators, and practitioners of organizational planning and development practices.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal did mention some criteria to measure the progress and the development of the project. However, it didn't mention how to track, trace, and audit this project. It could be improved by providing a timeline with specific KPIs numbers for each mentioned criterion. And it should state the report of the progress would be provided how many times in some weeks or months.  About the description of the success of this project, it did give the key criteria of the big project Done Collectively with some explanation about it and then listed the details of the success of this small project of this proposal, which is well-done. However, if some figures would be added to the success criteria, it would be clearer to evaluate the level of success of this project.

Through the team's hourly prorated budget allocation, we can know about \u200b\u200bthe key tasks, key resources and hours worked on this project. The budget is presented in detail, easy to understand, consistent with the objectives stated in the project development plan. The proposer provides sufficient verifiable evidence of the core members' competencies and skills required to implement the proposal.

Instead of listing goals, proposers should develop a roadmap, set goals in the suitable milestones, and estimate realistic KPIs, so that the community can measure the success of the project. In the previous sections, the proposer provided us with a google drive link to update the project's progress. However, I think this tool is not useful for those who want to monitor the project, because every time they want to update the project progress they have to search for the link and click on it, I encourage the proposer to build some tools/environments that can proactively", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1724", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "As a relatively small project proposed on top of otherwise well-working platform, it's hard to justify putting a lot of effort into deep transparency.
