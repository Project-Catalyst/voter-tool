This is quite aligned with the challenge given.

The budget allocated for server infrastructure was not mentioned to be used for how long.Overall, this project shows a high level of feasibility as it is operated by a talented team. For example, the product manager has 10 years of experience in software architecture and cloud computing.

Through the project, the author hopes to reduce the barrier of entry to develop on Cardano, which will allow developers and enterprises to focus on building their business model and growing next-generation software without worrying about infrastructure and operational responsibilities. The author has defined the object of the project, given and explained clearly the specifications. Providing details about the core functionality of the product, linking their team's previous projects, these have very high reference value. It can be seen that this proposal is consistent with the project's KPIs/Key metrics, positively affecting the Cardano platform if successful. However, I would like them to delve into the analysis of the impacts and benefits the project will bring to Cardano. As for What main challenges or risks do you foresee to delivering this project successfully?, the team only raised challenges when developing and operating the tool, but did not offer a solution, I hope they will research and come up with it early solution.

Their team has considerable experience in this field, they have also worked on many related projects before, I believe that their knowledge and experience make it possible to develop this project well. Readers can consult the information about qualifications, work experience, project personnel capacity through links + very detailed contact information. But I see a disparity between the budget allocation (3 people) for personnel and the number of people participating in the project (4 people).

The project roadmap was built in 3 months, the author gave specific user indicators. But I think the author should build more milestones and long-term goals, 3 months is quite a short time, it is difficult to evaluate the success and development of the project. The plus point in this part is that they have launched a product promotion campaign through Youtube and blogs, so I hope they will recalculate the cost of product marketing to make the promotion plan more complete.

A javascript SDK to the same effect. I couldn't be sure how big would the impact be from such a proposal since there's already a way to use the IPFS so I'm uncertain about the impact on the developer cardano community.\nOther than that the key metrics are on point and it has to be said this is one of the few projects that have actual numbers on their metrics and are not just listed as a bulet point. The project is in line with the challenge settings, and considering they will do the JS SDK from the API open source, I'm all for this proposal. \nAs a developer myself I always try and find the easiest way to do a job and can verify that a wel through out API makes the job a lot easier. Even with that said, I wouldn't call this proposal the missing puzzle piece, but it's usefull none the less. Making something convenient is always a good thing, because once people get used to you, there's no going back.\nOverall a good proposal that might have some impact over the community.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "From all the links and references provided I have no doubt about this project being implemented successfully. The team has the skillset and I managed to verify that skillset from the links provided in the proposal. Bringing real names and real links always helps the credability of the project in the eyes of the voter even if the voter is not tech-savvy, because anyone can recognise a a team member that stands behind a project with his or her name.\nThe budget is outlined clearly and is average compared to other proposals so no overpaying will be happening. There's a broken down roadmap that could have included more technicalities for any interested party, but overall there's a good plan of action and the right people with the skillset to execute.\nThere's a pretty good explanation of the deliverables, concretely the API endpoints and sdk functionality. The timeframe for completion of the project is reasonable to me as a developer and the team has already a funded proposal so they have a benefit of proving themselves once in the eyes of the community. I was a bit discapointed the team didn't think too hard about the possible challenges. I would say a big challenge for them would be to be known and get people to use their API instead of the regular IPFS operations. Or simply being on equal terms with the regular IPFS API in future. The Javscript SDK would be implemented by at least 2 other projects as well, so that's a reason for concern as well.\nOverall this is a feasible proposal and another tool in the pocket is always a good idea for any developer.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is a mention of the JS SDK development happening on github, which is great. On the other hand I didn't see any form of channel for communication with the community on the API progress if things don't go as planned. Keeping in mind the proposers have a site and a twitter account the message will get through.\nAbout the KPIs, I already mentioned that this is one of the few projects with actual numbers to measure future success. I love the idea of the youtube channel, because this is the way to grow a community and keep with the times at the same time.\nThe problem and solution are clear and understandable.\nOverall the project is auditable with the small caveat not specifiing a channel for communication for the API.
