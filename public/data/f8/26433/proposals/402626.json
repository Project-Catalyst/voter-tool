Hackathons are very popular ways to bring developers together. the prizes offered here are very generous. There is also budget to pay advisors and judges which should attract many applicants. \n\nThe proposal does not offer much direction for the kinds of projects and problems the hackathons will try to solve. \n\nThere is some mention of Haskell and Plutus, but it is unclear if this is going to be an open source project or if hackathon participants will be encouraged to make their work open source. There is no github repo to refer to. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It is a little hard to assess the team. The links given are to LinkedIn and I could not read them. The social media links do not link to individuals. \n\nThe focus of the Konma website seems to be product sales. It is not clear how this focus meshes with the hackathon and developer purpose. \n\nThe timing of the plan is not clear. There is a 6 month timeline. On one hand it seems like the hackathon will last 6 months which is a very long time. Hackathons are usually from 1 day to 1 week. It could be that the 6 months includes marketing and planning - this is just not clear in the proposal.\n\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditing goals directly relate to the proposed timeline. This should mean that the project is easily auditable. However the timeline is not clear about which part is the actual hackathon. \n\nMeasurements of the hackathon participants will give much more useful information. For example, the application calls for attracting quality projects. What is quality? It would be very helpful to know what quality means in this context. Is it bugs in the code, is it how the idea addresses a problem. Is it some measure of the team that emerges from the hackathon? \n\nMore measurable statistics, beyond time, would be helpful.

The measurable unit of each cost in the budget breakdown should be mentioned. For example, the money spent for developer experts would be calculated by time or weeks or month, and how long that amount of capital would be used for. The human resources of this project were mentioned but lacked detailed information about them. Profiles, skills, and related experience of all staff should be listed to show how suitable they are to the project and how well they will handle all the tasks of the project.

This is a follow-up to a previous successful fundraising project in Fund7, the main aim of the proposer is to host hackathons on Cardano where groups of developers come together and develop smart contracts and dapps as per challenges. This is a great event to find and provide a learning environment for potential developers looking for a way to join the Cardano ecosystem and a stepping stone to the development of future catalytic proposals.

The budget allocation is brief, the expenditure items suitable for the organization of the contest are mentioned in the roadmap, but I encourage the proposer to be more clear about the prize cost including the award structure and how the prizes are distributed to the winners, this will be more beneficial for the project's audit. Through the Konma organization website provided at the beginning of the project and the information that their team has participated in many hackathons, I have found that their team has considerable knowledge, experience, and skills in the software field and the possibility of project success is very high.

But they are missing an important piece of information in this section, which is an information channel/tool/environment so that those interested in the project can track its development progress. In addition, they also give KPIs with specific indicators, but this is only a short-term KPI during and after the end of the contest, I want to find out more about what plans they have to expand the size of the contest, increase the number of times the organization and the number of participants later does not.

Their iniciative are great and can gather a lot of programming related professionals, through this kind of entertainment competition can promote more innovative ideas and increase the fun of the competition, they mentioned that they will develop some DAPPS or smart contracts through Hackathons.
