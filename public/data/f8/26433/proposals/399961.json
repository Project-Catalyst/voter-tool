This is one of the barriers for programmers from other languages \u200b\u200bto switch to using it. Limiting the development ability of projects in the Cardano ecosystem\n- The proposal also targets a very large set of customers who do not know anything about programming but have a passion for programming as well as the Cardano project. This helps to train new programmers with new ideas, making the Cardano ecosystem richer. Each new project will attract new people to the Cardano ecosystem.\n- Proposing specific content for each learning module and built a video channel with 30 videos in the past 2 years\n- Suggestions are already available in the community\n- The project has a solution to care, interact, and solve users' problems after taking the course, which is a plus point.\n- The video is publicly uploaded to youtube. Besides, the exercise is freely downloadable on github which is a plus point for the proposal. This publicity would be very effective, making the Haskell language accessible to more people.\n***Suggestions/ advices:\n- The proponent already has a community and these 2 communities are Vietnamese. Vietnamese people have a rather large barrier in terms of technical English language. Therefore, if this proposal can make more videos with Vietsub, it will be much more effective for the existing Vietnamese community.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "- The proposal has a clear work plan for 6 months\n- Modules have been divided into each level to make it easier for users to absorb. A youtube channel is available to share basic haskell knowledge in English\n- There are already 2 Vietnamese communities who love the Cardano project\n- The budget allocated for each video is reasonable because the video can be used by many people and many times\n- Team with the right experience and suitable skills to develop the project\n-  Mr. Curtis D'Alves is someone with many years of experience with the Haskell language. Mr Curtis D'Alves has also built a youtube channel with 30 videos available on Haskell basics in the past 2 years.\n- Ms. Hannah is someone who has experience in building Vietnamese communities. Currently managing a community with 40,000 members in Vietnam\n***Projects that need improvement:\n- There are already 2 Vietnamese communities, but there is no specific plan to exploit these 2 existing communities\n- Proposal does not have a Marketing plan\n- Time to complete the job is a bit long. According to the proposal, 1 month will publish 2 tutorial videos, 2 exercise videos, 2 exercise solution videos. Total is 6 videos. Estimated time to complete these 6 videos is: 6x2 + 5x2 + 5x2 = 32 hours. Minus the rest time, holidays, 1 month is still quite a long time\n***Suggestions/ advices:\n- The proponent recalculates the monthly work allocation time to get a more suitable time period. With 6 videos as in the proposal, the completion time of about 15 days is reasonable.\n- Need more ways to take advantage of the existing Cardano-loving Vietnamese community\n- Add more specific marketing plans to reach more people, to increase the feasibility of the project: For example, you can cooperate with reputable Haskell teachers in Vietnam\n- Zoom meeting every 2 weeks requires an additional interpreter if taking advantage of the available Vietnamese community.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal already has a Github link, a youtube channel and a community facebook group that loves Cardano.\n- Proposal has a clear commit metric and can be easily checked through youtube views, github downloads\nThe proposal sets out a clear objective of describing the success of the project.\nIt can be easily measured through the number of students attending the zoom once every 2 weeks.\nThe number of students participating in the Plutus Pioneer Program can also be measured through student testimonials.\nThe number of proposals submitted on Catalyst through Haskell Course For Beginner is also easily measurable.\n***Suggestions/ advices:\n- The project has an additional option to record the zoom participants every 2 weeks to evaluate the number of new participants and the number of old participants. From there, it is possible to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the project in a short time.\n- The project can also offer rewards to students with good results or with proposals funded by Catalyst to encourage students to study as well as accurately measure the amount of funded proposals of course students.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1192", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you very much for taking the time to assess our proposal.\n\nImpact: \"Vietnamese people have a rather large barrier in terms of technical English language\" I agree with assessor about this. But our course is for beginners all over the world not just Vietnam. That's why we made the video in English. There are a lot of people in these Vietnamese communities who want us to do a Haskell Course for Beginner and they have no problem with English.\nWhy don't we do vietsub for this course? Because we have also submitted a proposal \"Haskell Course for Vietnamese\" (link: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/399969) that can solve this language barrier issue.\n\nFeasibility: \"Proposal does not have a Marketing plan\" We made it very clear in the proposal \"We are also admin for several communities interested in Cardano who want to become developers to create projects on Cardano. We will be sharing this course with these communities.\" We will share video lessons and exercise links will be in the description of the video.\nThere are many people who have participated in IOHK's Plutus Pioneers Program and they have a lot of problems with Plutus because they have no knowledge of Haskell. They talked to us about their problem and wanted us to create a Haskell Course for Beginner (50+ people). That's why we have the goal \"After 6 months we will help at least 50 people join the Plutus Pioneer Program course\" and it's doable.\nAssessor said that: \"Time to complete the job is a bit long\" I think this makes our proposal more feasible, doesn't it? Because we will have more time to edit the content and get more feedback from the community. We only charge for 6 working hours per video and 5 working hours per exercise. But we put a lot of time and energy into making this course. So I think this is a good thing for other proposals because we're just trying to get a small cost, not a problem that needs improvement.\nYou can see that IOHK's Plutus Pioneers Program also only publishes 1 video/week. Because, learners need time to practice and review knowledge. If we publish more than 6 videos/month, learners will not have time to review the knowledge they have learned. Because beginners need more time to learn Haskell than experienced programmers\n\"Zoom meeting every 2 weeks requires an additional interpreter if taking advantage of the available Vietnamese community\" Ms. Hannah is Vietnamese so she can help us\n\nAuditability: The assessor suggested that: \"The project has an additional option to record the zoom participants every 2 weeks to evaluate the number of new participants and the number of old participants. From there, it is possible to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the project in a short time.\"\nBut we create Zoom Q&A sessions every 2 weeks to answer learners' questions. Learners just need to leave a comment with the problem below the video. We will show them how to solve those problems in the zoom meeting. This means that these zoom sessions are only used to help answer some of the learners' problems, if any. Only those who leave comments on their problems below the video have the need to join the zoom session. But if no one has a problem (no one attends the zoom session to get their questions answered) then this means that the lessons and exercises have helped learners fully understand the knowledge. Thus, \"evaluate the number of new participants and the number of old participants.\" cannot be used to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the project in a short time\".\nThe assessor also suggested that: \"The project can also offer rewards to students with good results or with proposals funds by Catalyst to encourage students to study as well as accurately measure the amount of funding proposals of course students.\" This is an interesting idea, but if we give students a reward, the total amount of funding needed for this proposal will increase, but the effect will not be significant. Because those who can learn effectively and truly grow should learn for themselves, not for rewards. When they really want to learn Haskell to advance their career with Cardano, they don't need a reward in this course. The most valuable thing they need is knowledge, not reward. If we have a reward for learners, it can create a few problems such as: They will ask others to do the exercise to receive the reward, they only attend the course for the reward,......"}, {"q0": "Cardano is using Plutus as its programming language, which actually is based on Haskell. While it has been developed since around the 80s, many people still haven\u2019t heard about it. The book Learn You a Haskell is a very good book with just the right analogies and illustrations and a lot of examples that can help someone new to functional programming like Haskell up to speed with ease. This series of videos, exercises, and Q&A sessions will be the perfect complement to that book. Onboarding new developers into Haskell (and naturally to Plutus) with ease, will have a huge impact on easy adoption of the language, and hence the smart contract in Cardano.\n\nThe proposer had done a great job in outlining the idea, as well as put the complete package: video tutorial, exercise, and the answer to the exercise, plus the Q&A in the end. This proposal could be extended with discussion on new real-world, updated implementations of Haskell in the future.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "On the following explanations, anyone can see that this is very clear and detailed plan with all timing, materials, reasonable budgeting, and capable team to deliver it.\n\nThis proposal provides a complete package on each of the topics to be covered, complementing the book with video tutorials, exercises, and also the discussion on solutions to the exercises. The proposer also has already foreseen that even with all the detailed explanations (as can be seen in the YouTube channel link provided), the audience might have problems, and therefore planned bi-weekly Q&A sessions. \n\nBudgeting is simple, uniform, and clear, while the amount is reasonable for the amount of experience the team has. The only improvement that can be made is actually to put it into the calculation, for example, 23 videos * 6 hours (average) * $ 60/hour = $8280.\nThe timing proposed is perfect, allowing the audience to complete the whole series in 6 months. Feasible enough to let audiences with diverse backgrounds to adjust their time (e.g.: full-time workers). In a flash, some might consider 6 months too slow, but one should take into consideration that this is a new field for most people (functional programming) and people might need some time to adjust to the way. Need to be mentioned that there will be several videos, including exercises and solutions, plus the Q&A sessions.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the proposer did a great job in foreseeing that after all the explanations given in the videos, some people will get stumbled and will need help, thus Q&A sessions will be yet another value to this proposal.\nThe team is small yet just enough, one can focus on the technical aspects, while the other is experienced enough to handle the crowd.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In terms of deliverables, this proposal is using public platforms.

The learning process is also open to the public by providing content on Youtube which has been carried out by the proposer. We can see the Youtube content that they have produced so far is quite good and there are also some that talk about haskell. The explanation of how to evaluate the participants who take part in the video is still not very clear because if many viewers from all over the world are interested then of course it is necessary to make a place to gather, for example by creating a website to facilitate questions and answers, providing an assessment so that prospective cardano developers can be formed. as desired.

Furthermore, they will have the opportunity to test their skills and sharpen them by doing some exercises. I really liked the piazza idea as people will have the chance to help each other and create strong bonds.
