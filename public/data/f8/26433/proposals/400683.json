Providing a dApp store that allows users to see all the apps in the Cardano ecosystem deployed on Milkomenda would assist users in the exploration stage when they join Cardano. This is aligned with one of the key metrics of the given challenge. Besides, this solution will have a certain influence on developers as this app will be a platform for them to build up their projects and list them on this app to introduce them to potential users. Therefore, this project will impact both users and developers, encourage them to join the Cardano ecosystem. Also, it determined some challenges when executing this project, and solutions for them were given as well. However, it could be improved by providing more detailed information related to technical aspects about the main features, functions, and how this app store operates", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan given was not detailed enough. The timeline was given, but it is too general. It should mention what should be done, what needs to be done, and how to do each task in each specific course of time, for example in a certain number of weeks or months. The timeframe should be more specific and detailed. Especially, it should mention the preparation phase before implementing the dApp store. The budget breakdown was not detailed. It should separate the costs into small sections. In each section, what the cost would be used for, and for how long. Also, it should add how the cost was calculated, by working hours, weeks, or months. It stated that the cost may go beyond the requested fund, but the detail of the cost was not given, so it is very difficult for sponsors to evaluate whether the cost used is appropriate and sufficient enough or not. About the team working on this project, it listed the related experience of the staff that would be beneficial for executing the project. However, it should include the profile link of its team as evidence so that people could evaluate the reliability of the given information. Also as mentioned in the beginning, the firm leading this project used to build dApps such as Fracada for Cardano or the co-author of the Cardano dApp Standard, so it has a lot of experience to build this app successfully.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "How to measure the progress and the development of the project was unclear. It should show the KPIs for each period of time, what should be achieved at those milestones, so that people could easily follow and evaluate the process of executing it, and how it is gradually completed.

They also provide us with descriptions of the product, its core functionality, and how the dApp store works. Risks are also mentioned and the proposer confidently asserts that they can address these risks. According to the information they analyze, I feel their product will be another suitable environment/tool \u200b\u200bfor the community to follow the projects they love. But as far as I see it, the publicity of dApps will be selected and implemented by the proposing team, it would be better if they could provide a way for developers to nominate their dApps to the store, of course, there will be entry standards for dApps to be updated on the store set by the proposer. Overall, the core idea is very good and solves the problems of the Challenge, so I will give it 5 stars here.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project development roadmap includes necessary information such as timelines, goals/products to be completed fully presented by the proponent. I think the budget section should be more specific, although they guarantee to cover all costs beyond the $20k funding requirement, a detailed budget would easily spark more sponsors' enthusiasm. I encourage them to budget at an hourly rate, update more information about their working hours and marketing plan. They give us a brief description of their dcSpark team, their work experience, and achievements. I know they already have a definite reputation in the Blockchain field and Cardano ecosystem, but it would be great if they could provide us with links to their website, Linkedin profiles of those key members of this project, records of the projects they have successfully worked on.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Unfortunately, in this section, the proposer has not presented information channels/tools/environment so that project enthusiasts can access information about the progress and development of the project. I think the KPIs they give are not specific, although they have a plan to release the MVP by the end of the second quarter of 2022, and the KPIs about the number of projects listed on the dApp store do not have specific indicators, for example. For example, they might say that 6 months after the store is up and running, we calculate there will be 100 projects listed on the dApp store.

Besides, your presentation is very clear.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "regarding the detailed plan and timeline, you should provide a more detailed roadmap. You can suggest a month-by-month plan or what work needs to be done to improve the dApp store. Anything a little more specific would still be more persuasive.

I would only ask if I can see some specific number in the Key metrics section although I know it may be very difficult to do so. Nonetheless, I see a lot of room for improvement here, particularly in providing a little more information about how this dapp will work. As the current description is quite abstract, a high level of feature sets and workflow OR functionalities information would have been preferable. This proposal covers a highly desired feature and, in my opinion, will provide a significant boost to developers building dapps on the Cardano ecosystem", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan should outline how the deliverables will be achieved, what skill sets are needed and the budget allocations to work items, however, it hasn't been added to the proposal.

I struggled to find a concise answer to the question, \"How will I implement the project?\" The solution appears to be excellent, but I am unclear about the plan for actual implementation and business incentives.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1772", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6071, "q0": "dApp store it is something which is missing in the Cardano ecosystem now. dApp store for Milkomeda will enable users can see all the apps in the Cardano ecosystem that are deployed on Milkomeda, the well-known brand for all advanced Cardano users.

Milkomeda is ushering in a new era of interoperability between key Layer 1 sidechains by facilitating wrapped smart contracts. Cardano, as a major player in the L1 blockchain space, will now serve as a coordination (p)layer that will allow for movement in and out - through the use of the Milkomeda sidechain. The proposers intend to help the Developer community by creating a  a dApp store for their Milkomeda sidechain that would allow users to visualize all the apps in the Cardano ecosystem that are deployed on Milkomeda. Excellent. Developers would be able to list their Dapps in the DApp store to attract users - which creates a new entry point for players wishing to benefit from the synergies of multiple blockchains, one of which is Cardano. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The dcSpark team is the team that left Emurgo to set up their own company that developed  Milkomeda and is now a core contributors to the Milkomeda environment. The team consists of major players in the Cardano environment - such as Nicolas Arqueros (Cofounder - CEO, ex-Emurgo and ex-board member at Cardano Foundation), Sebastien Guillemot (Cofounder - CTO, ex-Emurgo), Robert Kornacki (ex-head of research at Emurgo and ex-board member at Ergo Foundation) as well Nicolas Di Prima (the former lead developer of Jormungandr at IOHK). The Milkomeda protocol will initially launch on Cardano, with Solana support being worked on in tandem. Taking into account the personal and team-wide capacities of the dcSpark team, I am certain that the feasibility of this project is not in question. The stated goals of implementing the dApp store in Q2 2022 and launching an MVP before the end of Q2, are realistic. I would commend the team for committing to continue managing the dApp store beyond the timeline of this Catalyst proposal. The proposed budget is modest as it also envisages additional funding from dcSpark to cover additional expenses for further content moderation and marketing. However, I think that the proposal would have benefited from a more detailed breakdown of the budget in order to improve transparency. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability of this proposal seems to be based on the two key pillars related to project delivery: (a) MVP release by the end of Q2 2022 and (b) number of projects listed on the dApp store. THe proposers do not provide information about whether and how they intend to keep the public informed about the progress in implementing the project - directly. However, it is worth remembering that dcSpark has easily available Twitter and Discord channels, plus has been expanding its footprint in the community - which indicates that the team will be able to use multiple channels for informing the community about progress.  Sebastien has been a Cardano Improvement Proposal editor contributing to the creation of new standards inside the Cardano ecosystem and the teams high visibility and understanding of problems serves as a guarrantee for the projects auditability.

In this case, they are proposing to create a DApp store for Milkomeda (the Cardano sidechain for Ethereum applications and tokens). I think this is a great idea and I agree with their assessment that a lot of FUD about Cardano is linked to the fact that people say there are no DApps on it. When we will have DApp stores, it will be very difficult for people to claim that anymore, since the applications will be there for anyone to see (without having to manually search for them on Google, Twitter and other places).\nThe risk the proposers identified is that the DApp store would not have many users, but this can easily be mitigated since it will be public and everyone in the ecosystem is incentivized to use and advertise it. Furthermore, the DApp store will eventually integrate with the Flint Wallet and any other wallets that want to do it, so it would soon be available anywhere.\nI agree this proposal effectively addresses the Developer Ecosystem challenge.

As a recommendation, I think it would be useful to always share a link to your site (https://www.dcspark.io/) so that voters can easily see who you are and maybe to list a few of your achievements, just to make it more convincing.\ndcSpark has worked on developing infrastructure for Milkomeda and has also created the Flint Wallet, so I believe they are very capable of implementing a DApp store on Milkomeda.

The company has also grown since its inception and they now claim to have over 40 employees, which is very close to the number of employees Emurgo, one of the founding entities of Cardano, has.
