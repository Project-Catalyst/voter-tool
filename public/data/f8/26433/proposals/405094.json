This makes it easier for readers to understand and follow it even if they are new to this field. In this part, it also showed a high demand for minting NFTs with a large number of NFTs minting on the Cardano blockchain. After that, it listed the issue related to NFTs to make a concrete foundation for explaining why this solution was produced. It mentioned 2 problems that will have an influence on running an efficient business model and ultimately hindering innovation on the Cardano ecosystem. They are related to Bandwidth Costs and Infrastructure burden. They were explained in great detail including statistics to illustrate and make it clearer and more persuasive. The special, as well as the strong point of this proposal, is that it summarized the main idea of each section, which is quite generalized to understand. It could be seen that the issues mentioned here are that large NFTs image files require a huge amount of bandwidth to view. This costs a lot for the service providers or developers to bring this content to the users and the users who view them via mobile get limited access due to internet speed. Besides, other costs resulting from running and maintaining infrastructures to deliver high-quality content matter a lot. In fact, in order to do this, there would be developers to keep up with the evolving protocol, doing research, design,... distracting them to focus on their core activity, leading to not being able to meet user's expectations. Therefore, this solution was produced to solve all the above-mentioned issues. The solution, a Platform as a Service (PasS), was clearly described with its functions that will benefit a lot of stakeholders such as wallet, DApp and app developers,  users and help solve their problem mentioned above. Besides, it clearly mentioned how beneficial this solution is. Several specific benefits were given to prove how suitable this solution is in answering the question of the challenge: how to improve developers' experience and help them focus on building apps contributing to the whole development of the Cardano ecosystem. It listed several benefits such as reducing operating costs, reducing computational burdens, improving product's speed when using Cardano NFTs, allowing developers to pay much attention to developing value-added activities, and providing end-users seamless using experience. All of them answered that question so persuasively. Besides, it also gave the plan a future feature of this solution showing its potential and a huge impact in the long run", "q0r": 5, "q1": "When it comes to feasibility, this proposal did another great job too. About the plane, it first illustrated key milestones to help people visualize the whole process through a well-designed and colorful graph. After that, it went into much detail about each small milestone. Each milestone, it mentioned the general description of what to do in that time, then listed out detailed tasks that needed to be done. This is such a great structure to give a clear and understandable plan to easily follow. The budget breakdown was well-written as well. The cost was distributed for several small activities and the way to calculate some costs was given as well. The team operating this project is another thing that is worth mentioning. The tech leader with over 18 years of experience would be a treasure for this project. Besides, the project manager with over 13 years of experience in diverse fields is also another important factor to prove the high feasibility of this project.

For agile aspects/tasks (e.g. backend development), these will be managed in sprints of fixed time periods, ensuring velocity is tracked against estimated efforts required per capability / feature / user story.

The results of this metric will also answer the challenge question(s) for \"F8: Developer Ecosystem\".\n\nAs detailed in our proposal, the two main Commercial Risks that we have identified depend on the expectations of our customer base. Their rationale to subscribe to our services would hinge on our baseline performance meeting their acceptance parameters & criterion in conjunction with our cost being competitive to their current expenditure - which will be determined and agreed by the end of month 1 as per our high-level milestones. We've taken a data-driven approach to plan our infrastructure setup that would give our customers the best value for money. Our aspirations are that our initial customer base will ideally, make profitable, if not sustain, the business in the short term as additional customers are acquired over the lifetime of the endeavour by virtue of the benefits our solution provides to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThe relevant scope of audits within the Catalyst Proposal (https://cardanocataly.st/en/faq/#governance-and-legal) extends to bi-weekly reporting, new user surveys and growth metrics. We are committed to delivering these and have highlighted them in the [AUDIT] section of the proposal.\n\n-- Weekly project reporting: Published in the public domain and to include project status against milestones listed in the proposal, RAID (Risks, Assumptions, Issues & Dependencies) Log to capture non-conformances and budget overview (expenditure & projected cash-flow).\n-- User Feedback: This will be acquired from our prospective-customers after the testing & feedback phase.\n-- Growth Metrics: The metrics list at the start will enable us to achieve our primary objective, that is: delivering a sustainable business model as a PaaS that would generate growth in the Cardano ecosystem. At a high-level, the best indicator of this would be the number of potential-customers who turn into customers pre-release and would be reflected in our Y1 - Y5 projections that will be produced at that point.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your time and feedback!\n\nMost sincerely,\nThe \u201cNFT Content Delivery As a Service\u201d Team!"}, {"id": 6219, "q0": "The proposers have indeed gone the extra mile with this well-thought out proposal.

They propose to facilitate the provision of instant visibility of the NFT image files  - which seems like a given from the point of view of a user, however as users we do not see the associated costs behind the scene. Well, these high costs are staring in the face all up-and-coming developers who wish to display NFTs in their apps or projects. It's a market hurdle for Developers and this proposal effectively aims to slash the entry cost by NFT developing and running an optimization service. Well done. Essentially just as Cardano optimized Proof of Work with its PoS model, this proposal aims to cut costs - by optimizing the delivery of NFTs through the lowering of \"entry fees\" for smaller projects. Well done. I think the proposal is smack bang in the bullseye of the challenge: \"create a positive developer experience that helps the developer focus on building successful apps\".

Hence, I commend this team for specifying the key elements of auditability - especially as they announced the intention to implement a hybrid waterfall and agile project management framework to monitor and control project activities. This will allow anyone auditing to have a less haphazard approach to auditing the project. Crucially the team intends to implement a \"best practices\" approach of project management weekly reporting on a public website. One last issue that I have with transparency of many projects - is that the teams do not specify what will be revealed in the weekly reports. Fortunately, in this proposal the team specifies that their report will include budget updates, a RAID log [I didn't know what this meant - so ad to look it up - it is a tool used in project management to help leaders assess the key risks, assumptions, issues and dependencies of a project], product backlog  and progress with respect to milestones.

For waterfall aspects/tasks (e.g. customer communications, reporting, etc), fixed budgets/hours will be detailed against the respective tasks, detailing start/due/actual dates. For agile aspects/tasks (e.g. backend development), these will be managed in sprints of fixed time periods, ensuring velocity is tracked against estimated efforts required per capability / feature / user story. Assuming we have understood your request correctly, we have not seen this LOD being provided up-front and believe the high level milestones and sub-tasks within (i.e. our Scope-Of-Work, \"SOW\") should suffice as an indication to (or assessment of) feasibility of work(s) to be conducted across the lifecycle of our fixed-price proposal to the *fixed* SOW.\n\n\u2022   With regards to additional funding request under the [Feasibility Note Feedback] section: Presently, we estimate that the hours budgeted in this proposal is suitable to successfully deliver on our end-to-end solution. Should the need for a *substantial* amount of additional funding arise due to any unknown-unknowns issues faced, we would propose this only after we have exhausted all other possibilities.\n\n\u2022   With regards to the request to \"specify the identity for the community to authenticate\" under the [Feasibility Note Feedback] section: We feel that our work(s) in the Cardano ecosystem to date should hold as a solid reference as to the authenticity of capability and delivery quality. Of course, should we be successful in securing the funding of this proposal, we must comply with the legislative framework of the countries we intend to commercially operate in and would therefore be willing and required to share our respective identities at that point. While we acknowledge that some people may wish to have this information up front, we do not see that it would lend any *additional* value to our proposal at this stage.\n\n\u2022   With regards to the request for more details behind \"What does success for this project look like?\" under the [Auditability Note] section: We acknowledge the level of detail given in the proposal may not have been enough for yourself/others in this section. This has been done to prevent duplication of content as we have already explained the successful outcomes under the \"Please provide a detailed plan and timeline for delivering the solution.\" section of the proposal against each milestone. Furthermore, we intend to provide transparent weekly reporting (to be made publicly available on our website) behind the activities in each milestone to aid in project progress tracking and auditability.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your time and feedback!\n\nMost sincerely,\nThe \u201cNFT Content Delivery As a Service\u201d Team!"}], "solution": "We propose to establish an NFT optimization & high-speed content delivery service to all at competitive rates to current market pricing.", "experience": "@Smaug\nOwner & creator of pool.pm\nBlockchain Dev, Full Stack Dev and System, Network & Security Engineer\n18+ years Tech Lead experience\n\u00a0\u00a0\n@Rocky\nOwner & creator of BlockchainArt.Works\nStrategy development, execution & operational delivery\n13+ years Project Management experience"}
