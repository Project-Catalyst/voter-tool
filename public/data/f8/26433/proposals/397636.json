It's the big deal that comes with it, which is the scale of the impact.. The issue you raise is essential for the development of a Cardano ecosystem. Because developers are an integral part of any ecosystem, including Cardano. It would be great if your solution with the right approach attracts developers from all over the world to the Cardano ecosystem.. I understand that some of the issues of the challenge were not easy to define, but you did and made a reasonable argument that addressed the requirements of the challenge.. You are rightly targeting the problem of technology personnel that is the shortage of technology skills, technology developers around the world. Not only that, you also have a solution to find and develop the talent that the digital economy is in need and encourage developers to learn Cardano technology. This makes sense because it will contribute to solving the current and future Cardano ecosystem. Through the Blockchain-based incentive network, you can do this.. Several risks were mentioned by the team as a result of careful study of the problem and its associated solutions to it.. Obviously, you have outlined some of the risks and have come up with solutions to limit them. The risk arises from the beginning of building a product until the establishment of a system, to prevent people who just want to \"hack\" without adding value to the system, and then you come up with a solution. I completely agree with the risks that you have raised with the accompanying solutions, it is comprehensive and constructive. I recommend adding some of the other risks that you may face while undertaking the project. Because the more risks you list, the more readers will appreciate you because you understand your project well, understand the specific things that must be done in the proposal.. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I think the team has done serious research to map out a clear and reasonable timeline with specific goals. I appreciate this of you. I am pleased when you break down the milestones by month to clearly show the progress of the work. That proves the auditability of the proposal. However, I have a suggestion that you should attach the work progress to specific months of specific years (month/year). Thus, it will be more convincing to the readers of this proposal. In my personal opinion, this is a very reasonable and feasible funding request. But it depends on other factors to propose funding. The presentation of the allocated budget request is one of the important criteria for evaluating the auditability of the proposal. You guys did a pretty good job of this. Pretty detailed, including asking for an extra $25,000 as a reward. Such a detailed presentation creates good conditions for the reader to have a deeper understanding of the proposal. The amount you ask for each piece of work is reasonable. The only thing I regret is not seeing the clear identities of the team members. You have specifically assigned the work of each person along with their expertise. But I only see Parahuari's public identity. What about the identity of the Leader, Web Designer, Web3 Architect for Smart Contract and DIDs architecture...? I recommend that you fully disclose the identities of all team members to increase the auditability of the proposal. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "KPIs are always the metric that the proposal reviewer is interested in. They would love to see the easy measurement of KPIs in your proposal. The KPI is a parameter to show whether the proposal is realistic or not. You have mentioned KPIs, but it seems that these indicators are difficult to measure, or if measured, it also takes a long time to survey and collect data. On your team, who can measure this metric? I wish you could come up with other KPIs that are easier to understand and implement?. I look forward to a practical test of your proposal. That is the best way to demonstrate success. Your success is simply measured by the number of new developers that were onboarded to the Cardano ecosystem. This is very understandable and practical. Because it is the result of the proposed implementation. A proposal made in good practice will attract new developers. Your proposal is similar to many other proposals that have never been funded by Catalyst. I think that's completely normal. I understand this is your new proposal. But its feasibility can also be seen through the specific presentation in the proposal. The lack of funding makes it new to everyone, but that doesn't make it less viable and doesn't affect the success of the proposal.

This proposal is in line with the challenge posed... The solutions given are reasonable, solving the problem of the challenge.\nThe Tech Talent system develops both to find talent in the software industry and to contribute to the development of the Cardano ecosystem. . .\n\nFor the project to be successful, the Teach Talent system needs to overcome existing risks and challenges. Building a product in itself is a challenge for all programmers. However, with 20 years of experience as a developer, bringing technology solutions to learning has played many important roles as teacher, programmer, author, tutorial designer, administrator. product managers and researchers...

Therefore, this project will have a huge influence on the Cardano ecosystem not only in the near future but also in the long run. This solution was explained in great detail including two stages with specific KPIs. Besides, it listed its features clearly and compared with the case of GimbaLabs and Catalyst School to emphasize and differentiate it from other projects. This project specifically looks for talent, provides incentives and guidance to new developers, or even cooperates with other projects to help develop the Cardano system. The roles of all related stakeholders involved in this project were also clearly mentioned to better clarify how the project will operate. Another good point here is that some challenges and the way to solve all arising issues when delivering this project were listed.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As the proposal mentioned earlier, this project will experience two phases and why they will have to do so. Therefore, it could be improved by providing the plan separated into two phases and giving detail of what needs to be done in each stage, adding how long each stage would last. Then, everything would be more synchronized and easy to follow from the beginning to this part. Also, the proposer wants to seek advice from the Catalyst community on whether to proceed with the full proposal with two phases or split it into two projects. So, if the detailed plan was given clearly for two phases, then it would be easier for the catalyst community to evaluate the feasibility of executing two phases in one project or divide into two. Similar to the plan, the budget breakdown should separately mention the cost for each phase. Now, it is good to see that the budget was given for each task in months. However, it could be better to indicate how these budgets were calculated, whether they are done by times, hours, months,...It is highly evaluated that this proposal listed the additional fund apart from the requested one. Regarding the human resources mentioned, It did a great job in outlining the details of a number of team members, their roles, and how long they will work for this project. It also provided background information of the leader with 20+ years of developing tech solutions, which is a strong point to persuade its feasibility.
