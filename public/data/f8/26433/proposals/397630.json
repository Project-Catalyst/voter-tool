The proposer needs to expand on what the specific shortcomings are and what content it will produce to address those. It is difficult to judge the impact of a Youtube channel proposal if there is no plan given for what the content will be.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer requests funding for 12 weeks of youtube content, but what content? The proposer needs to add a high-level breakdown of what will be produced when.

Every project has risks that need to be identified and mitigations need to be planned at least at a high level before the commencement of the project. Hence, I would not disagree that the proposal is feasible, however, neither would I agree as I think it needs a content plan at the very least to provide some confidence of feasibility.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal needs some auditability metrics. All the metrics provided by the proposer measure the success of the proposal after-the-fact.

I agree that every ecosystem need its thorough instructions to help people get to know it easily and make the ecosystem friendlier to user. This idea seems to be simple but yet very crucial. However, I don\u2019t find that you have addressed the problem clearly, it looks more like an outline of an idea to me. In my opinion, you should describe the problem in more details. Same problem with your proposed solution. I want to ask \u201cHow can your solution help in detail? Who are you going to help and what are you going to help them with?\u201d If you can answer these questions, your impact aspect will be rated a lot higher. At the same time, you have done good with listing a long list of key metrics, and that helps us a lot with understanding your idea. I also totally agree with the difficulty that you have pointed out, but i also want to add another point that i think it should be considered. It\u2019s the accuracy of the instructions. Besides your own experience, don\u2019t forget to have your own collection of other people\u2019s experience and tips operating the ecosystem and make sure that every information you have on your instruction video is correct and up to date.

If anything I would like to see more of this proposal, it\u2019s some expected numbers.

This is a pretty smart project, the author chooses and takes advantage of the youtube platform - one of the most popular platforms today to develop their project, their proposal is also consistent with the KPIs of the challenge create a positive experience and attract developers from outside the community to join the Cardano platform. They also provide a link to their youtube channel as a sample product for readers to refer to. They also recognize the risks when creating video content, but they are not sure how to solve those problems, the measures taken are only temporary and intended. I will give this 4 stars because I think this is a project with a pretty good core idea, with potential in the future if developed in the right direction.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proponent is still inexperienced in presenting the project, the information is still quite messy and does not have a high reference value. The first part is about the channel development plan, I recommend they present each milestone, each milestone briefly describing the activities and goals they will achieve. For a Youtube channel to grow can't just rely on luck, channel promotion is one of the core activities, I would like to see them come up with a detailed media plan to introduce their channel to people in need, activities for them to attract developers interested in their content and subscribe to their channel. They mentioned in the project that they will post 1 video per week, I hope they will come up with a plan on content + video topics each week. The second is about the budget allocation plan, I won't judge the budget for each video as high or low, I just want them to dive into the analysis of what activities and resources will be required to build a video, and the costs allocated to them. Moreover, I still have not seen the budget for the personnel involved in the project, if any, please add information about the number of personnel in the team, the working positions, the working time of each person. and costs allocated to each member. Regarding the cost of paying for equipment and studio decoration, to increase the auditability of the project, I think they should provide more detailed information, for example: quantity of equipment, equipment manufacturer to buy, reference price, what are the types of equipment for studio decorations, will they decorate it themselves or hire a professional, risk of equipment damage and replacement costs. Finally, regarding personnel, I do not find similarities in terms of working experience, specialized knowledge of the members with the activities they are trying to implement. There is no clear division of work here, information about the person in charge of content development, video editor, and communication team is still vacant. There is no information or link for readers to refer to the experience, working skills, and educational background of the team members as described by the author.

The process includes timelines, goals to be achieved, and specific KPIs, eg after 1 month, viewership count, channel subscribers, growth rate per month. What is expected of the month? Furthermore, I would like to see them proactively put out a plan to report the progress of the project through social networking sites instead of asking readers to visit their channel to see the metrics.

I have seen the video and read the comments thus far. This project will undoubtedly benefit those who do not have enough time to obtain the education they require. They also assist in the formation of new developer relationships and provide a forum for them to communicate with one another. However, I know that being a youtuber took a lot of time and effort when you first started and your works might be not noticed enough. So how will you deal with this risk? And the potential of a video being delayed due to a lack of time is discussed, and I am curious if the lack of time influenced the content of the video. If that is the case, what are your strategies for when you need more time than normal to make a video? So far, those have been my concerns. It will be wonderful if the proposers make it more obvious how he handles risks.

I think it would be fantastic if you could summarize the program for the 12 videos. As a result, you will appear to be more prepared in terms of what you will teach new developers, and new developers will be able to see what they will be learning.
