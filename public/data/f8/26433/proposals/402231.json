As a developer learning Haskell and Plutus for the past three months, I've been following PPP in the current iteration and have first hand knowledge. The proposer points out the problem with PPP - it is difficult to follow, lacks depth of exercises and grading. The PPP has little supporting documentation, not many exercises and doesn't explore the larger scope of tooling. I must agree with this assessment. The PPP can be a much more hands on learning experience: supporting the developer in all its Plutus related learning, guiding them through exercises and becoming a knowledge base.  \n\nExtending the PPP is a very much in line with the goals of the challenge. This will fill in gaps in the learning stage for developers, making learning Plutus and hence building on Cardano easier.  \n\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers are a team of three bringing in expertise in Stake Pools, Software Development, Plutus Pioneers Program, Coaching and Online Courses. I think these backgrounds do apply to creating a good PPP extension course. In terms of technical skills to create videos, edit, and create a course on gitbook, I think the team can succeed without issue. \n\nOne thing is not clear though: the level of expertise the team has in Haskell and Plutus. There are two developers on the team but only one is a Plutus Pioneer. Another team member with a non-developer background is also a Pioneer. The Pioneer developer has no linkedin or other information source available, so we don't know the extent of their expertise. The other developer does not list Haskell or Plutus as an expertise on their linkedin. It's not clear if the team does have a deep expertise in Haskell and Plutus. \n\nI think it would be difficult to implement some of the more advanced topics in the proposal without extensive experience. This is especially important, since the proposal sets 2 weeks for developing Plutus exercises and 2 weeks for scripting, drafting and recording all the modules for the course. This seems a blazing pace for such a comprehensive and complicated topic as Plutus. \n\nEven with these questions, I think the team will still be able to build most of this course in a reasonable amount of time. They have relevant experience and can get expert support if they need it. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal outlines some of the topics that will be covered by the course. When and how these topics will be covered will be decided in phase 1. The proposal covers 10 weeks with 6 phases. Planned phases are 2 weeks each with the exception of the last phase which covers course release and onboarding. There is little detail provided as to what each phase means beyond a general idea. There are no clear deliverables for each phase. \n\nBut there are some information that will be useful for auditors. The phases do give a general sense of the project. After phase 1, the proposal should produce some plan for the structure of the course. What will be taught, What chapter will be taught first, etc. After phase 3, the proposers should have videos for all the course. These deliverables are not defined well but they do give a good idea of what to expect.  \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1323", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3646, "q0": "The main goal of this solution is to better assist developers to engage in the Cardano faster and more efficiently. And this is what the challenge is looking for, solutions that enhance developers' experience and encourage them to join Cardano. The proposal described clearly its solution, an on-demand course teaching Plutus with exercises, challenges, and more content related to all Plutus tools. By pointing out some drawbacks of the Plutus  Pioneer course, it is easy to see all of the improved features and functions of the proposed products. This is indicated clearer by providing an outline of some course material. All of the mentioned factors contribute to emphasizing the impact of this solution on developers that help them better understand Plutus and its tools to create more projects and better design contracts. All the benefits offered will bring more developers to Cardano. Another highlight here is that it determined what may hinder the process of delivering this project and how to overcome it.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The detail of how the project will be executed was well-written. It separated the process into 6 different small phases and described what should be done in each phase with a deadline for each task. So it is quite easy to follow this plan. The budget breakdown was listed but did not mention those costs would be used for how long or the measurable unit of them. A team operating this project was given, However, it should add the information about the background, the skills, and related experience along with a link to their profile. This will help build trust in the sponsor about how feasible this project is. Now, it is really hard to claim that this project is feasible to operate because it is unknown whether all people involved have enough expertise and experience to successfully build this course.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "No KPIs or key metrics were given to measure the progress of this project. It is unclear to say that we can track the progress through the roadmap and timeline in the plan without any figures or criteria to evaluate whether the project is going on track or not.

It would be helpful if the proposer could break down how the $20 fee\u00a0can be spent on each course. I just have one more question: how will this course differ from other\u00a0courses?
