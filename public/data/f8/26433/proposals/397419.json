The platform will use a mentor-mentee eLearning marketplace with workshops, bounties, and hackathons to build a broad developer community. As a senior developer myself, I have myself interviewed dozens of engineers for the companies I work(ed) for. We often struggle finding developers that are ready to be onboarded with minimal training, which is an absolute requirement in this fast changing world. Finding Engineers is not as difficult as finding good Engineers. The reason for this is that there are many developers out there who do not have a university degree OR come from a country where learning opportunities are limited. \n\nNowadays, companies are going global in search of talent and still finding it hard to onboard developers. Catalyst proposals are also one of such places where I often see this problem, so many good ideas exist, but they are either from people who are not technical OR they need a strong set of developers with whom they can partner. We are in a high need of a common marketplace, where not only we can provide a learning environment for the new developers (no matter where they are located) but also onboard experienced developers as mentors (and get rewarded) for their work and efforts. \n\nAdditionally, the proposal gives an example on how much the No-code-setup Cloud IDE will help the new Cardano developers to skip the initial painful setup for plutus dev environments, as a PPP enroller myself I still sometimes have to struggle with it when I am setting it on new environments. This might even be scarier for new developers, and hence the proposal details how this will help to quickly on board new developers to join more development projects and quickly build up their practical on-chain resume instead of getting stuck with infrastructure issues such as setting up development environment.\n\nThis proposal precisely addresses such issues, and therefore if successfully implemented will add and bring a lot of value to the Cardano ecosystem. Therefore, I strongly believe that this proposal (along with the Quadratic voting proposal) is essential to build Cardano a hub for strong open source culture and hence has a huge impact on the Cardano ecosystem.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal outlines the team details behind the company Snapbrillia in a detailed fashion.All the public links of the company itself are given and one can easily navigate to them and not only read the details of the team  but also reach out to them any time on discord. This is really nice and gives a lot of confidence in the successful implementation of this project. The links and technical skills of the team are public and I can confirm that they have the experience that would be needed to fulfill this proposal implementation. The proposal has clearly laid out the risks associated with implementation of this proposal. It would be nice if the proposer could add a little more details about if resources are not available to achieve this goal then what is the backup plan e.g. talk to the cardano community and look out for additional resources. Nevertheless, given the strong foundations of the team I am very positive that they will keep those risks in mind during the entire implementation phase and since the cardano community is one big family, they will be able to find any help which is required to fulfill this proposal. \n\nSimilar to their Quadratic voting proposal, Budget allocation not only clearly mentions why they need 4 web2 and 2 web 3 developers (as they have to hire additional senior developers to upgrade their IDE and need Plutus developers to help build SC on Cardano), but also have done their homework on Cardano gas fee calculations (based on the GitCoin historical data from Ethereum - can be seen in comments on how they reached the gas fee number on Cardano). From my own experience as Senior developer in both Asia and Europe, the developer rates are justified. \n\nThe timelines are clearly articulated in Q1 and Q2. While Q1 is more focussed on the open-source bounties and IDE setup, with fiat currency payments (absolutely needed to make use of this system), the Q2 will bring on-chain specific features and decentralization to the project. What I also like about this team is that the proposer has been outreaching to other teams proactively for any potential collaboration, which shows a very empathetic, welcoming, and learning work culture. This is absolutely needed as together teams can achieve these goals in a less obstructive manner. Therefore, I strongly agree that this proposal will be implemented successfully and hence full points from my side.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap and milestones per quarter are explained in terms of how the community can track and measure the progress of the development of the project. The project has been separated into stages so that first it starts onboarding mentor-mentees based on the fiat-based payment systems and later focuses on decentralization and on-chain features.\n\nThe how success looks like section gives a detailed outlook on how the community can measure the vision of this proposal and its impact on Cardano ecosystem. The long term goal to build a platform that gets 1+ million people into tech via open-source is a very ambitious vision and in alignment with this challenge (key metrics to measure setting).\n\nThe targeted problem is very well defined, and the solution to it is very well explained by the proposer. The new SDG rating section gives a very detailed breakdown on main goals and subgoals of this proposal. The long term goals mentioned in the SDG section is just one of the indicators which explain how well thought through this proposal is and addresses some of the major problems such as gender pay gap, unequal opportunities, high unemployment rates. Some of the issues mentioned there are common both in the world and Cardano ecosystem and some of them are the ones that Cardano is meant to solve. Therefore, I strongly agree that the proposal fulfills the auditability criterion laid out by the challenge in a very nice way.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_454", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1108, "q0": "This proposal takes the route of the Developer Ecosystem by targeting how to develop developers through an e-learning platform and training.

Although the goals setting is quite big, I believe it is achievable because they are very well prepared and experienced professional.

Another great idea that would greatly benefit the community and the cardano ecosystem would be the organization of hackathons. As a developer myself I'm a big fan of hackathons and workshops because that's the once place where you're learning while you're doing, which is the best longterm solution for learning.
