This is a great idea, with helps to discover important data which could really be helpful, especially for those writing proposals. But regarding the challenge setting, it is unclear to me if this is a good fit: As the proposal name suggests, the focus is more on catalyst and not attracting developers or helping the developer ecosystem. These topics might be related but are still different. The team will collaborate with the community to answer the questions most important for them. The data will mostly consist of results from the idealscale API, funds used (tracking of wallet?) and voting data. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It seems the proposal is at least partially based on another proposal called \u201cWolfram Governance Analytics\u201d proposal which tries to get data from the Idealscale API which is problematic. In case, this other proposal will not be voted for and/or the access of the idealscale API is not possible (atm) this proposal will be left with only access to the on-chain-data, which in turn will make this proposal less useful or impactful. The proposers acknowledge this as a risk, but no solution is presented.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The idea of integrating the community and the clearly defined outlined steps and the timeline gives the project a good score in auditability. As mentioned before, the challenge-setting is not really the best choice. A better fit might have been the \u201cImprove and Grow Auditability\u201d-Challenge.

However, the proposal itself does not seem to be entirely inline with the challenge setting. The Developer ecosystem challenge setting is quite clearly focused around the development community of Cardano, how to on-board more developers and how to improve the tooling for developers. From the proposal, it is not clear how this would be achieved, or what benefit it provides to developers specifically?\nThe proposal and comments seem to suggest that this proposal is trying to make data for the submission of successful proposals available, however I would argue that this data is not necessarily specific to the developer community. The provisioning of this data into an API or dashboard I suppose brings it closer to the dev ecosystem but again, what is it specifically providing benefit for to developers. This makes it very difficult to judge the impact on the developer ecosystem. \n\nAs to the content of the proposal itself, the team have identified an opportunity in the Catalyst ecosystem that can be addressed and could augment the ability of proposers in the future (both technical and non-technical). If not funded, I would advise the team to resubmit the proposal albeit in a more appropriate challenge.

As both an engineer and tech founder, the presented levels of auditability would not be considered detailed enough for my own teams. e.g. What about measures of time burned performing analyses, surely this is itself a KPI for auditing of progress given that it is also one of the risk areas for this project? \n\nI would advise the team to remember the context of the community. There is a certain level of auditability that the community themselves expect which need to be considered. Audibility is not just an internal measure of project progress, it is a method by which trust is established in the community to say: \"Yes this project got funded and here is their progress\".", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1248", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4404, "q0": "The main product of this project is a set of dashboards to display a snapshot view of the entire Catalyst impactful for Project Catalyst users ecosystem, so new users can get up to speed quickly and easily.

In addition, regarding the staffing budget, in addition to listing the number of employees in each position, I encourage the proposer to present the total number of hours worked in the project by these members. , which means that the cost of paying staff will be distributed on an hourly basis, which will increase the auditability and quality of the project. As introduced in the previous sections, their company Wolfram is an expert in providing intuitive data discovery and has a long history of experience.
