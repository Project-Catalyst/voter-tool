The proposal team create a library based on Typescript can easy integration and built-in documentation while coding. I personally love this idea. The proposal team pointed out the context. However, I suggest that it should be more specific in explaining the problem. The strength of the proposal is it showed clearly the solution with examples, so the readers can easily follow up. The proposal also showed the functions of the project in detail. But I wonder who is the objects that the project will aim at and how the project affect to these objects. It would be better if the project make clear these things and present in an easy way to follow.\nIt seems that the proposers have not shown what results the project will bring. It will be difficult to predict that after the project finished, it will suitable for key metrics or not.

The library will mainly strive to make it easy for developers to implement integrations with other wallets and query the chain without having the inner workings knowledge, meaning it will all be abstracted away and simple to use. It's a good idea that would make some javascript developers happy if it gets implemented. No doubt the community will benefit as well. I have a bit of an issue with the missing KPIs and metrics in the proposal. They're an important part of any proposal because they provide the voter with the intentions and knowledge of the propser. A process that is not monitored is hard to optimize and in that train of thought, if you don't know what's the adoption of the library or number of downloads you as a proposer or developer wouldn't know how to improve! As a developer myself I really liked the core written in the proposal although I think it's more missleading if you're not tech savvy. Making the code reliable and secure is a good goal to have, but a percise timeline would have been nice as well. \nOverall I think the proposal could have been polished a bit better and be more detailed. To be honest I am positive this project could have an impact with the community, but not sure if it's feasible.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I didn't like the fact no links or skillsets were provided. There's no way of verifying the proposer has the necessary skillset to implement this proposal. It's good that there's an idea of a future team and working on such a big project alone for six months is very brave. One persons average job for 6 months does come above 50000$ so that's a good price point given the time thatt will be spent, but without a clear roadmap with an attached timeline it's hard to say if the plan is reasonable and achievable. 15 000$ for \"further maintenance costs\" sounds like it needs to be broken down into more specific items. Building on top of other open source project is the best course of action when you're alone in developing a project so kudos for that decision. In the place of a timeline in the feasibility part there was more of a checklist for things that need to be done. Unfortunately this list lacked proper detail and explanation. \nThe idea of integrating with the browser and mobile applications is a good one, but it's not the first or the best described or explained so my suggestion for the proposer would be to find one simmilar proposal and colaborate with the other team on creating a typescript extension.\nThe proposer has considered some risk to the project and has a good solution of making the core reliable by tests, but I think the real challenge for this project would be on building a community around it and getting contributions and usability. And in order for this proposal to be known after it's funded is marketing and there was no mention of any kind of advertisement, which doesn't make the project less feasible, just less discoverable.\nThere was a bit vague description of the problem being solved and there are currently other integrations querying the chain like blokfrost that have plenty of documentation, so I must partially disagree with the author.\nOverall I'm unsure about the feasibility of this project for the reasons mentioned.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "\nI must agree that if there's a github repo, there could be no problem with any interested party to follow along with the progress of the project. A github link could have been provided to all interested community members to follow. Even an empty git repository will provide the project with more credability. Maybe the project would have been a better fit for the open-source developer ecosystem if it\u2019s open source.\nOverall this looks like an idea that if implemented in a full open-source manner would be auditable, no question.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Dear assessor thank you for your time reviewing the proposal;\n\nIn my defence, this was the first time me submitting a proposal and I recognize that some fields could have been written better\n\nI really enjoyed your suggestion about the empty repository that I made it real also in order to provide a solution for the lack of a precise timeline \n\nthis is empty github repository where the project will be developed in case of founding; here's the link:\n\nhttps://github.com/HarmonicPool/plu-ts\n\nhere I provide a (hopefully) more detailed timeline.\n\nregarding your concerns about the adoption, I'm seriously considering to open a YouTube channel in order to bot build a developer community around it and also provide one more way to stay updated with any progress made.\n\nI would like to sincerly thank you for your time!"}, {"id": 10654, "q0": "the proposal of the problem report fits perfectly with the proposal .so the proposal fulfills an important need to develop the developer ecosystem with smart contracts and the development of several major websites, this will pave the way for the developers to challenge for the future.
