This is clearly stated in the Problem Statement and the proposed solution is reasonable, suitable for the challenge.\n1) I understand this course will be entirely online. It's great because it has a greater reach. Cardano L-EARN is a Learn to Earn platform designed to enhance developer education with learning incentives.\n2) I love this course they provide structured lessons that anyone with access to computer and internet can follow.\n3) ID also evolved more in the media plan proposal. If the intention is to have blockchain knowledge for those who don't, a communication plan to reach people outside of this world is crucial. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal represents the core team that seems to have experience in the Cardano community, although the current team does not have a funding proposal behind them. If the proposal includes these, the team will be presented in a much more reliable and clear way. I am by no means an accountant, but from my experience in managing organizations and communities, I know how important it is to have professionals work on the economic side of things. Cardano L-EARN recommendations are presented in a very clear, step-by-step manner. Since the proposal focuses on working time frames, the budget allocation seems reasonable. Budget allocation also includes estimated work hours and resource allocation, further increasing the credibility of the proposal. I agree that it is very likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "It seems that the product's audit will be based on adoption. We will measure progress and provide auditability by providing monthly KPI reports. Clarity on the audit proposal can be better achieved by queuing up a user base or trial program ahead of time to verify how well it works.\nThe system can be tested by users on the released product for validation and tested to see if the outcome of the proposal is successful.\" ", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1477", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal addresses the problem about the steepness of Cardano learning curve. It is trying to lower the barrier by introducing Learn-to-earn aspect into the part of learning which supposedly motivates a lot more people to learn Cardano, further growing the developer community. \n\nHowever it has a lot of challenges to tackle, both in short and long terms. Some of them have been listed in the proposal. For example the proposer planned to handle the problem of plagiarism in answers by using long and unique answer, which might not work well in technical questions. There is also the idea of utilizing 1-on-1 sessions between the learners and the test administrators, which might reduce the scalability. The proposer themselves have stated that this might require further funding or donation after 12 months which is considered risky for any new project. It is a solid impactful idea but it requires a lot of effort to execute them well.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer have outlined the budget based on the number of lessons and tests that would be created, the team members involved, and the rewards for the learners. However there are no explanation on how would the rewards scale with the number of learners. If the amount of learners are bigger than anticipated then its possible that a lot of learners would not get any rewards in future lessons simply because the lack of budget. The proposer indeed have relevant knowledge on building learn-to-earn project before so it would be better if they explained where do some of these numbers came from and justify why it is just the right amount. Personally I think the proposer could plan the budget better and execute the program more smoothly if they limit the amount of participants in the first place. That would clear out a lot of implementation details such as identifying sybil attackers and the problem of rewards scaling.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer provides a clear 12 months roadmap with their expected metrics, which includes the numbers of contributors, lessons created and more. The metrics that are being used do aligned with the goal and they are all achievable within the timetable.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1522", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "I believe that this proposal does not directly address the challenge as it is aimed at learning developers rather than helping developers build dapps. Incentives are a strong motivator. The learn to earn plan is a great initiative that would onboard new members to the Cardano ecosystem. The main benefit for the community would be that most new members would enter from the path of education rather than the path of speculation or investment. Meaning that the new members will join Cardano through learning rather than through trading or investing in projects.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The budget indicates that 50% of the rewards being giving a rewards to students which incentivize more people to learn about Cardano. There were errors for the budgeted breakdowns for \u201cTeaching and Testing\u201d and \u201cCommunity Development\u201d. The costing did not add up to the totals. I would suggest that the proposer separate the items in the cost breakdown clearly in order to eliminate errors and/or confusion. A longer budget breakdown is better than an inaccurate or confusing one. \nThe coordinator, Antoine De Vuyst\u2019s, LinkedIn page does not display any work experience or educational record. This is a bit concerning as you would want the first member in your team that you decide to present to so show at least some background. His Github account is somewhat active and has created BDU L-EARN which appears to be the father of L-EARN. BDU L-EARN educates on the Etheruem and Polkadot blockhain with the same learn to earn system that is being proposed with L-EARN.  I could not find any statistics regarding BDU L-EARN in terms of students taught, funds paid to students, lessons per student etc.\nThe lesson creator, Lucas Macchiavelli, has a more detailed LinkedIn profile. Regarding the other team members, I could find very little to no information about their education, background or projects. I would suggest the proposer add links of the teams projects for easy navigation. \n\u201c7 Years organizing and teaching crypto communities with Bitcoin Bay\u201d - Only one (Antoine De Vuyst\u2019s) of the team members from Bitcoinbay is part of the L-EARN team. I would have liked to see more of the L-EARN team instead on just one.\n\u201c4 Years experience organizing hackathons (Https://blockhack.ca)\u201d - the https://www.blockhack.ca/#people link does not take you anywhere so one cannot inspect the people involved. There may be others ways to find out who they are but then one needs to play the role of a detective instead of an assessor.\nThe team are the ones that will do the work and make this a success. Little confidence regarding them is conveyed, suggesting that this proposal will not be successfully implemented.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "There are milestones indicated in four month periods. The milestones are simple and achievable if there is a dedicated team. The KPI\u2019s are easy to measure since all of them are quantitative. The proposer says that monthly KPI reports will be provided but does not state how. I would suggest to, increase auditability, that the proposer make the monthly KPI reports available on their Github. \nThe risks have been well identified and solutions for them have been suggested. By using the suggested solutions, the prosper can protect against these risks. One of the risks are running out of funds to pay the students. The proposer can have a donation wallet and display that address on the website and encourage people to donate. That address can be made public for extra transparency and the then proposer can use those funds to pay learners.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1602", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "It's very interesting to read about this learn to earn idea. Proposer provides a very clear picture of what will be done and the risks that may arise and how to overcome them. In general, the subject matter provided must of course be related to the development of the cardano ecosystem, especially as a developer. All risks listed are common in an online learning system except for the earn section, where all those who successfully pass will receive an ADA earn. This is certainly very good because it will increase the number of ADA holders, but the solution when it runs out of funds still needs to be improved or made more creative. I think there needs to be a business unit formed to be able to continue giving earn to students. It could be by making the lessons video-based and monetizing through Youtube or collaborating with local technology companies, forming a single SPO or collaborating with certain SPOs and others so that the earning process can continue.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The work team looks complete with all the division of tasks so that the goals are achieved. It may be necessary to add technical or non-technical qualifications for each person involved to make sure that this idea can be realized as planned. The timeline is well stated along with a reasonable amount of fees for each subject content production process, assessment and earning.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In this proposal, the team has provided an explanation of the evaluation of program implementation with items referred to as KPI reports. I hope the reports that are made can be collected on github or the website and continue to be updated and disseminate reports on the implementation of this proposal to the cardano community.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1681", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The main purpose of the project is to raise funds to develop a  learning platform Cardano L-EARN. This is a learning-to-earn platform designed to enhance the education of developers, encouraging learning by rewarding ADA for those who pass a test relevant to the lesson content. Essentially, this proposal aligns with the Challenge's key metric of creating a great experience for developers outside of the community, incentivizing them to participate and contribute to the Cardano ecosystem. The proposer provides us with links to know the lesson content and lesson structure on the platform, in addition, other necessary information about the platform is also clearly described by the proposer such as languages \u200b\u200bto be taught (English and Spanish), how to enroll, learning incentive structures, risks and mitigations, the positive influence of the platform on developers and the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project development plan presented by the proposer is like a roadmap that includes actual KPIs to measure the progress of the project. So I can't tell for sure if the Cardano L-EARN learning platform is available or not. The budget is allocated based on the 4 main resources of the project development process including lesson development, teaching and testing, community development, learning rewards. In general, the budget allocation table is suitable for developing a learning platform, additionally, I recommend the proposer to allocate budgets to staff positions on an hourly basis, for example, Which Community Manager, how many hours does this person work in 12 months? Through the descriptions of the key members of the project, we can see that the majority of members have experience in teaching and developing online learning platforms, and they also have many active contributions to the Cardano community. Most of the members are attached with a reference profile to be able to verify their qualifications (Linkedin, GitHub, Telegram), but a few members have not yet had a complete reference profile updated.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "For this project, auditability is easy, most of the information needed for this section has been mentioned by the proposer in the previous sections. The first is a tool/environment for the community to monitor the progress and development of the project, is through GitHub and Telegram that the proposer has linked in the Impact section, in addition, they also plan to provide monthly KPI report. Second, their project development roadmap is also considered a roadmap with specific KPIs that we can rely on to measure the success of the project.

Overall, your presentation is pretty perfect.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan that you draw up for the project is very detailed.

My doubts are about this incentives model which, overall, tends people willing more to earn and less to learn. Maybe promoting a hackathon (or a similar competition) with the participating people after they complete some relevant courses, they will be able to leave something useful for the Cardano ecosystem (a dApp, a framework or even some ideas with potential). After the funds are exhausted, people will move on, as the will to learn won't keep them around. What si to be done?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The given references emphasise the ability of the team members to create content and offer it to the willing people. However from the links provided seems that there are not much people willing to learn (the Telegram channel has only 3 members, and the GitHub repository, even it was created couple of months ago it doesn't show too much of a learning material.)\n\nThere is a timetable defined with achievable milestones. It is recommended to create a detailed curriculum for the topics that will be presented to the audience and what platform will be used (Marlowe or Plutus). \n\nThe budget is broken down into identifiable items and seems reasonable to achieve the set goals. Could be a typo for the \"Lesson Creators\" item as it seems to be $250/lesson x 20 lessons = $5.000. Being in LATAM region maybe will be wiser to keep the incentives for the Spanish speaking natives.\n\nAnother unclear aspect is the budget item that is necessary to pay the \"hired Cardano developers\" as is stated in the proposal. Clarifying the unclear aspects could make the proposal a viable working product.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The roadmap is well designed, there are deliverables/milestones that make auditing the proposal easier.\n\nThe defined KPI/metrics seems that are not enough to measure the success of the project.\nHaving 20 lessons to be created and 5 topics/levels to cover, an even distribution will make 4 lessons available for each topic/level. This means that, based on the incentives allocated for each topic/level, the maximum potential audience could be 200 per lesson. This value should be set as a KPI to measure the success of the proposal.\n\nAnother metric that can be used is some kind of user satisfaction questionnaire that could point to what is done well and what needs to be improved.\n\nWith some fine tuning the proposal, as it has potential, could stand a chance to be in the spotlight to get funded.
