After referencing the UI on youtube, I am completely convinced, the UI is very clear, looks very professional and attractive. I believe the project will bring a large number of users to use ADA for smart contracts in the future, which will be a breakthrough for the field of P2P payments. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The UI design is almost complete, the step-by-step plan is clear, everything is ready for a great project. What the project prepares, I think that the members of the project are very enthusiastic about the project, experience in programming, project management is also very professional, giving me the feeling that the project will be successful. than expected. The proposed plan is very reasonable for each stage, neither too long nor too short, and the proposed budget is completely appropriate.

It definitely aligns with the challenge and also very crucial for an ecosystem. It\u2019s the huge advantage that the proposer has done a few examples of the solution. With the huge debate that it created among people about the example on Youtube, it\u2019s certain that the proposer has gained a lot and can use it to improve this project. Since the proposer has been working on similar problems, I can see that they not only could address accurately the foreseeable difficulty but also have solution to fix them. In conclusion, this proposal is well researched and presented and it has fully delivered its intentions and potential.

Or at least, an estimated amount of each phase is recommended.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposing team has a clear vision of what they wish to deliver and a clear pathway to deliver it. There is a clear and understandable explanation of what they want to achieve. Their proposed solution is rational and makes a lot of sense. However, it still needs a better key metrics that help to audit it in the future.

The team is experienced in smart contracts and have other relevant credentials to work on a project like this, which also provides peace of mind when thinking of how feasible it is that this project succeeds. Other important factors are the milestones which are set very clearly and descriptively which gives the proposal both credibility and auditability and sets the length of the project to approximately 12 months which seems realistic for a project of this magnitude. ANother important factor is the budget which is also very thoroughly explained in the proposal how much is going to be used for what purposes and over which periods of time. All of these give credibility and feasibility to the project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Information provided in the proposal is clear and sufficient for both catalyst and the public to be able to audit the success of the project and keep up with the different milestones set out in the proposal.
