It directly speaks to the developer experience in being drawn from feature requests of not just users but other developers, and these cover a lot of use case that would fall under developer ecosystem. In addition it is predicated on existing proven work, with specific aims to be fulfilled that would help the developer experience of Cardano as a whole. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Similar to the first assessment note, due to the previous experience and proactive integration in and with the Cardano community and ecosystem, there is little doubt that the initiators of this proposal could complete further work on an already operating piece of software (the GameChanger). However the roadmap milestones in this proposal are quite nebulous (\"Combining all together with other new features being developed in paralel from other proposals.\") when they could be far more directly succinct because that they were inspired from specific feature request feedback and should reflect that specific request feedback for instance as being the iterated set of objectives to complete and be measured against (at least, then it is possible to say \"Combine it all and make sure it works with parallel development\" and mean something). As any software project can succumb to technical debt let alone the million of other factors developer's face the objectives/roadmap detailed does not inspire much confidence as it is too general; not only is it too general, more specifically, since this is coming from an established project there should already be concrete metrics available from (d)app usage that should be a part of this proposal given how specific the rest of the proposal is: this is why I can't give it 5 stars. \n\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Following the comments from the above assessment note, there main problem with this proposal is that its objective milestones/objectives are not measurable nor do they provide concrete numbers to provide a base line when they could because the GameChanger wallet is already widely used enough to have the feature requests used that were the very source of motivation for this proposal: that is to say definitive, concrete numbers could have been added to this proposal to offer both a point of reference and validity in terms of wanting to be accountable other than \"us\" assuming that if it works, it must be fulfilling said objectives when this doesn't have to be the case at all (those features could be dumped and substituted for something else, \"we\" wouldn't know). Furthermore, how could these objectives (such as \"Finalize classes and methods.\") be rendered as anything measurable to anyone who wrote or has read enough of the code base to know what this would even look like, let alone look like if it actually worked. What I'm getting at is, core to any functional software development is standardized quality assurance testing which this proposal provides no evidence of and is particularly important (if not necessary) for emerging technology and standards that change quickly; \"we\" don't know if the next update to cardano-node (or what would be equivalent for GameChanger) is going to break all the work that's been done. I'm talking about the green or red indicators you see whenever you are checking out a github repo (PASS / FAIL): having these kind of tests would also provide a key metric for not only success of fulfilling the stated objectives, but show explicit evidence the development team is commited to making quality software that enriches the development ecosystem (for itself and as a model standard for other projects/developers). I --strongly-- encourage that a systematic set of tests be integrated into this proposal/project in future rounds/work for it to get the funding it deserves.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1238", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 970, "q0": "From the problem statement it is not clear what the proposer is trying to solve. The problem statement also does not match with the rest of the proposal content. The problem statement can be interpreted as :\u201cWe have bugs, we want non venture capital money\u201d, however the rest of the proposal says \u201cWe have this new unique wallet that performs more than one action with each transaction.\u201d\n\nThis proposal aims to provide its users with an interface to facilitate minting, create multi-output transactions and native token minting, however I struggle to see what the specific benefit is for developers. The latter portions of the proposal describe the solution as \u201cSometimes we have been referred as an easier (low-code and automated) *cardano-wallet-cli web alternative\u201d.*\n\nAs an engineer myself, I struggle to see the benefit of this proposal to developers, given that it is posted in the Developer Ecosystem Challenge. I would consider this proposal more appropriate for the Dapps and Integrations challenge. It is also not entirely clear what the problem is that the team is trying to solve. Are you wanting to make the cardano-cli easier to use? Are you making a wallet with an API? What is the developer problem/need that you are solving?

I would strongly advise that the team define success at smaller intervals.

The purpose of auditability is to answer the: \u201cHow can a community member make sure you are not misappropriating funds, if funded\u201d question. I do not think that question was answered in the Auditability section of the proposal. (Hence a 1 star deduction). \n\nPlacing your first measure of success at the 4 month mark in a 6 month proposal, means that more than half of your work would need to be done before your first progress check.

The proposer, in particular, emphasized that their GameChanger wallet will allow users to mix many Cardano features at once into single transactions from day one, allowing for sustainable network usage and lower costs. This functionality will significantly enhance the Cardano ecosystem's wallet quality while also increasing user trust and pleasure. However, I don't see what is required to foresee future hazards. The proposal just highlights the product's characteristics, but the necessity of this part is to indicate probable future issues as well as concrete remedies.

And of course, to make such a complete plan, it is indispensable for the efforts of the team members. The group comprises five people, practically most of whom have more than ten years of industry experience. Finally, the proposer plans to use the budget split to compensate full-time and part-time engineers.
