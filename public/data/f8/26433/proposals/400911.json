It just mentioned some tools of this gateway. It could be improved by adding technical information on how this gateway operates or the functions of each tool, or its main features. The benefits of this solution should be emphasized in more detail so that it would show how impactful it is to developers in particular and the Cardano ecosystem in general.

For example, The cost of $400 monthly could be divided into how much for computing, how much for traffic, and how much for disk. Besides, this proposal requests one-year funding, so it is necessary to add a detailed plan of what's going to happen in the next year after being funded as the points mentioned earlier. This project is operated by a Cardano pioneer which launched a lot of previous projects. It also stated that it was trusted by the community and many customers, namely Emurgo, Trezor, or Cardano Foundation. It has already funded over 20 proposals in the past.

One thing, I think they should mention what activities the project will do other than providing monthly updates on the amount of data transferred, this will help those who don't know anything about IPFS gateway it's easier to imagine how it works and to trust proposal more And they also mentioned stopping the service if it cannot be funded, I think this is not a brand new project and has been used in several wallets and tools so the project has the potential to be successful.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In this section, they have not yet outlined a specific plan and important milestones in the implementation of the proposals.

I wonder how they do all of this, like how they're going to keep it going, how they can get community support, Or what they've done to make developers use it at an affordable price? if funded, do they do anything to further develop their project?. Anyway, for me, it is better to provide a specific roadmap than general ideas. Because of that, it is difficult for me to determine if the budget they want to sponsor is reasonable or not. According to what they provided, this proposed team has had experience related to this project, and being the pioneers of Cardano was also able to achieve certain achievements so they are able to complete the project.

As such, they requested funds to continue operating this for 12 more months, meaning 26400 USD, which is a low amount in my opinion, for the benefit it offers to the ecosystem by enabling the above-mentioned projects and more to function.\nRegarding the budget, my only observation is that, as a voter, I would have liked to see an idea here for making this IPFS gateway self-sustainable (such as a staking pool or something similar). My reasoning is that project Catalyst is intended mainly to kickstart new projects. I\u2019m not sure if we want to get a part of the budget stuck just for maintaining existing infrastructure (although I repeat: the sum at the moment is small, this would only be a problem as we keep growing in the future). \nThe proposers are the team behind the well known Five Binaries company (https://fivebinaries.com/), which has been building infrastructure on Cardano since the beginning of project Catalyst and that recently have implemented native support for Cardano on Trezor hardware wallets: https://blog.trezor.io/trezor-suite-update-march-2022-3e1823fa22d7\nThey have created https://blockfrost.io/ along with a very impressive portfolio of projects funded and delivered from previous Catalyst funds: https://catalyst.fivebinaries.com/. I have no doubt whatsoever that they are capable of completing this proposal successfully. Score: 5.\nI have one recommendation regarding the information about the team, however, and that is that it would have been nice to add a person of contact here along with a LinkedIn profile, to help people associate this project with a human being that can be easily contacted. It might help convince voters to view an otherwise purely technical proposal more favorably.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability section does not contain much data, but I think that is perfectly fine, because this is a very simple maintenance proposal after all. The team stated that progress will be tracked via monthly reports posted on their Twitter page. I think those and the continued usage of the IPFS gateway by projects on Cardano will be all the proof we need for the success of this proposal. Score: 5. Congratulations to the people at Five Binaries for their work and for this proposal, keep it up and I hope you get funded! Also, as a suggestion, in the future, when mentioning any social media or any type of external resource, add a link to it, to make it easy for voters to see what you\u2019re talking about (your twitter page in this case: https://twitter.com/fivebinaries).", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_546", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Continue the support of ipfs.blockfrost.dev gateway, which is a widely used IPFS gateway in the Cardano ecosystem.", "experience": "We are the creators of Blockfrost.io, creating services and tools lowering barriers to entry for developers.
