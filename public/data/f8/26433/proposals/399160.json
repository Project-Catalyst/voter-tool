The tutorials are given with a story, gamifying the learning process and rewarding the developer at the end with a certificate NFT. Reading over it reminded me of Crypto Zombies. A tool on which a newcomer Solidity developer can learn how to code Solidity while coding zombies that eat cryptokitties. It was fun learning and got you to learn quickly. I got through those courses in a few weeks and felt I could read and understand Solidity contracts. It got you ready to develop in a few weeks. \n\n\nCardano is missing such an easy on-ramp for newcomer developers. Haskell is already a paradigm shift for most newcomer developers and on top they have to learn Plutus. So there is a large gap from coming to Cardano to producing deployable code. As a developer who's been learning Haskell and Plutus for the past 3 months, this proposal got me excited. It should be easier to get into developing on Cardano and this proposal attempts to do that. \n\n\nIf successful, the proposal will add much value to the ecosystem by serving as an on-ramp and a teaching center for developers. This is in line with the challenge metrics, as critical knowledge gaps in the learning phase will be filled, the number of developers on Cardano will increase and network effects will provide more benefits from an increased number of developers. \n\n\nOne question for me is why the focus on youngsters? The problem statement states:\nLearning blockchain is not an easy process for youngsters, especially secondary school or college students, at least not fun enough. It's my opinion that Haskell learning isn't fun - at the beginning at least - for most developers. It's not what you're used to, you have to think about problems in a new way, and the syntax is absolutely wild. It takes time to get used to and it is at times frustrating. This is true if you're a 25 or a 35 year old developer as well as a youngster. It would be amazing to have a gamified experience walk you through all of that no matter the age. \n\n\nI suggest shifting the focus of the project to be age agnostic, with the aim of onboarding as many newcomer developers to Cardano as possible. That would maximize the impact of this proposal in my opinion.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team behind the project have developed many different web applications. You can their portfolio on their website. It includes many different projects ranging from one page websites to e-commerce, mobile apps with admin systems. They are a capable developer of web2 tools. In this way I see no reason they would not be able to implement the technology necessary to build the Playground. They have the knowledge of Frontend and Backend development necessary to build a website that allows users to write code, compile into Haskell and run basic tests to see if the code is correct. \n\n\nOne concern I have is if the team has extensive expert knowledge in Haskell and Plutus. The team's website says they are working on Cardano projects. The portfolio they link to also says they have an NFT minter that also works on Cardano yet the mint page only allows minting on Solana. Maybe it is a feature that they're working on or maybe it is somewhere else and I failed to find it. \n\n\nThis is an important concern for me, as the educators must have an extensive grasp of Haskell in order to bring to a level for youngsters to understand. Maybe the team already has this expertise, but it is a commercial company and neither their website or the proposal tells us who the person with relevant Haskell experience is. The proposal doesn't even name a single person who will work on the project. It also doesn't mention any Haskell & Plutus specific teaching challenges, which I know from firsthand development experience to exist. Haskell is a challenge :)\n\n\nThese reasons make me think the team doesn't have the necessary experience. But this is not an insurmountable problem, as they could hire someone with the expertise if they lack it and they have the necessary experience to build the tooling if not the teaching tutorials.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "While I loved the vision and the aim of the proposal, I felt it was lacking in specifics. There are no feature lists, or the types of tutorials that will be implemented. I imagine they will implement a Haskell learning tutorial with lambda expressions, syntax, walking through each Haskell feature and building out code blocks. Though I'm not sure as there aren't many details in the proposal. As such, I think it will be challenging to audit this proposal. \n\n\nGoals and the solution are defined very loosely, meaning it will be challenging to pin down the team to deliverables by specific dates. As an example the detailed plan only includes 3 months and 6 months goals and has goals like:\n- Develop the playground for Cardano new-comers,\n- Engaging and interactive website for basic knowledge of blockchain and cardano\nThese are not defined well enough to be audited easily. \n\n\nThe proposal also doesn't give any information as to where and how an audit could happen. There is no github repository, or any information to make life easy for auditors. There will be a demo at the end of month 2 but we don't know what the deliverable of that demo is. It can simply be a website built on Wordpress and the auditor wouldn't be a able to tell if the team has actually delivered. \n\n\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1323", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1730, "q0": "Students are a foundation for future development.

This project seems to have an impact on increasing the number of Cardano developers because it is providing a learning opportunity for students who are young and curious about new things to learn and write codes on  Cardano. They may be the next generation of developers in the Cardano ecosystem. The proposal did a great job in describing its products, functions.

The cost distribution was built from the number of staff needed to operate this project, and then distributed the given budget based on that.
