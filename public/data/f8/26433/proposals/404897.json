The aims of this project is well presented with its targets and how it will benefit the ecosystem. Since this project is run on a very stable foundation of an ongoing work, it can give the community a very clear picture of how the product comes out and and make the idea very doable. Not only the team has a clear and very positive goal, but also the challenge is addressed very accurately.

Along with mentioning the previously successful project in 2020 - The TopologyUpdater, the author also clearly and detailed the goal of this next project. It is still in the works as an additional API service that will track individual block propagation times in the Cardano network. I appreciate proposer\u2019s presentation about features of their project: Participating operators can compare the performance of their nodes (topology, network, CPU, configuration) with the average and best in the entire network as well as immediately identify and address errors of unnecessary delays / inaccuracies in the generation and distribution of blocks from specific pools. In addition, another feature is to provide the collected data for optimization projects to substantially boost the transaction throughput and net capacity of the Cardano Blockchain. A link to API visualization is given and the new BlockPerformance Dashboard to be developed is currently in a preliminary research state. Moreover, the author has a strong vision when giving two clear goals. They are supporting the ongoing improvements, quality control and performance tunings as well as reaching at least 150 participating nodes for the BlockPerf tool, but are designing the system so that 1500 nodes can also participate if there is interest. The target audience is Operators and Application designers. Another commendable point is that Proposal shows how the community and ecosystem members can monitor, analyze and use. And lastly, in spite of the lack of clarity in the challenges or risks, the solutions provided are pretty detailed and explicit. All in all, the basic idea is incredibly relevant and great, and If it is successful and properly developed it might be beneficial for the Cardano Ecosystem, which I agree that this proposal addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In this feasibility section, despite the analysis of Markus Gufler (who is he? What skills and experiences does he have?), proposal has not mentioned the total number of members participating in the proposed project, who they are as well as what roles and responsibilities they have in the team. From my perspective, the team experience mentioned here is too faint and should include more details - both of the individuals and of the team as a whole on it, with their resumes and links (if yes) or ways to verify their skills (capabilities or experience). As a consequences, this will make this project a bit risky in terms of technical feasibility. Furthermore, there is a reasonable budget estimate compared to the plan set out in the proposal. Clear bulleted and broken down budgets are used for specific month-by-month activities. However, in my opinion, the author should allocate the budget in a bit more detail. For example, how to pay fof staffs? Time-based pay (hours / weeks/ month) or pay based on the work they do? And will necessary assets and expenses be covered? Is there a backup budget? This section could be clearly stated so that the project can be more clearly communicated to the community, investors and developers, which would help to understand the rationale behind the number and assess its plausability. Additionally, though having a realistic timeline for completing the given tasks in a logical manner and listing the tasks to be done in time periods, the proposal should be analyzed in more details that how those works will be accomplished.

Nevertheless, in this section, the proposer was able to show and explain clear quantitative indicators and KPIs for community  to monitor the project's progress.

For very clear and strict security reasons, the clear names of these people will never be mentioned. Without them, however, the highly available provision of services such as TopologyUpdater would not be possible. For this reason, the costs have been divided into those for the ongoing provision of services and those for the development of new parts.

I could see Decentralized Exchanges benefiting as well due to the better data that could be ontained. The proposal proposes an extension and improvement of the existing TopologyUpdater API in order to advance its capabilities with some very exciting additions such as creating an additional API service and exploring the individual block propagation times in the Cardano network. When realized we could expect a much better overview of what is really happening at the network level in terms of block propagation, allowing for the further optimisation of the network AND its individual nodes. Until full P2P kicks in, TopologyUpdater is an important tool that helps maintain the SPO network alive and kicking (although it is an optional tool), as it is a tool in the toolbox that is available. Making it better will strenghten our knowledge of the network's performance and probably help to finetune performance of the Dexs... The proposal is able to scale as the open source script is given to every SPO free of charge and the proposal aims to complement all existing capabilities with a new BlockPerformance API and Dashboard that will initially go for at least 150 participating nodes for the BlockPerf tool, expandable to a thousand and a half nodes. The Developer Ecosystem challenge does specify among its Potential directions - the development of Dahsboards, API's, and support structures - so I would say the proposal fully meets the challenge. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has experience with the matter at hand.

What could have been improved slightly is the ongoing Auditability of the project as it progresses - in terms of allowing an outside non-technical player to easily audit the results and progress. What do I mean specifically? What I think might be missing is something along the lines of  providing some kind of project management weekly, or bi-weekly (or at least monthly) report on a public website. Even if in the form of  3 or 4 paragraphs. This would allow the community at large, not just the technical segment of the community, to follow progress. I mention this as Cardano is a unique amalgam of techies and non-techies, all of whom are learning from each other - so providing a public window to the implementation progress facilitates the sharing of crucial information even for non-technical members. Apart from that personal viewpoint, I agree that the four KPIs have been well selected and the idea of developing a web-based dashboard for BlockPerformance and the loads of data that it will generate - is a fantastic idea.
