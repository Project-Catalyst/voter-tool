I completely agree with this idea, it helps to add value to the Cardano ecosystem and increase the income for students. After going through the details of the proposal, I've found that adding a job report to show Haskell's coverage relative to other languages would make it more convincing.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap is quite simple, but it is enough to clearly show the success of the project with the accompanying metrics and milestones. I have a little question about the budget you guys used for the production of the course. I wonder what knowledge will be provided in this course, how long is the course and how much is the salary for the instructor? The same goes for budget details for approval incentives.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding KPI achieved, I will agree with you more if you can add more criteria to measure the extent of the project.

They focus on the problems needed to confront during this project, not the expected results, and whether these results can achieve the key metrics of the challenge set.

The budget breakdown is matched with the solution development, which includes the total cost for each important task of the project. It would be more convincing if they could give a more detailed spending plan according to their building strategy (for example, how much for hardware and how much for software infrastructure).

Base on my understanding, the proposers want to run a project to not only promote an understanding of the ecosystem but also incentivize students to continue blockchain education and build a source of talents. The course is in Spanish - on the most 3 common languages. I actually find this idea makes a lot of senses. Since most of the courses and programs are in English, having one more language can totally bring the blockchain education close to a lot more developer who don\u2019t speak English and enlarge the talents pool. The idea is described very detailed in terms of targets, contents and expected outcome. I\u2019m sure that the proposers has fair reasons to worry about recruitment, infrastructure maintenance and scaling, however in my opinion, if they start with an effective recruiting and marketing program to build a foundation then the expectation of the program can totally be met, hence it will attract more support from the community", "q0r": 5, "q1": "With this promised solution, the proposer has provided a very detailed plan with short term, mid term and long term plan.

It will put this proposal in a strong position when it comes to considering the justification of the amount request. Secondly, I really appreciate the team\u2019s introduction.

The proposal aligns with the Challenge's Key metrics, with what Cardano is pursuing is attracting developers from outside the existing community to participate in Catalyst.

Currently, the number of university students interested in the Blockchain field is increasing, with the educational background, dynamism, and curiosity of students, the propaganda and project implementation to this class will receive positive feedback. . The plus point is that the team has built up preliminary course content, has a plan to test and promote specific products, but it seems that they have not focused on clearly stating the core functions of the platform. One of the challenges of the project is getting approval and support from the local government, I would like to see their research and come up with a more concrete solution to this challenge, as this will be a major roadblock that impedes the project development if not resolved.

In addition, I would like to have a clearer budget and cost allocation plan, for example, the salary for that position with the number of employees, for how long, the total number of employees.
