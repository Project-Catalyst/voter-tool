Cardanoscan.io is the preferred tool that all developers and users use extensively: whether it be used for inspecting a transaction, monitoring the number of NFTs minted, examining the supply of tokens, or tracking down movements of ADA, the one-stop website serves more developers on testnet than users on mainnet. \n\nThe upgrade of Cardanoscan.io to Babbage era and mempool support will make sure the no.1 tool used on Cardano will not get left behind and will not leave users in disarray of needing to search for a better or develop a better tool. \n\nWith a full redesign of the website, it will improve the user experience because there will be an improvement of querying/search capabilities which are used extensively by users. The adding of human-readable and user-friendly labels will remove a lot of noise for the users so that they can focus on reading only the transactions they need to.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is asking for a cost of USD$128,000 as salary of 3 developers and a designer for 8 months. Given the team has already built a successful tool, the team will be paying for the infrastructure via their advertising revenue. I am very sure this proposal will be implemented successfully. The team has delivered 3 catalyst projects successfully and has been developing since the Shelley era. \n\nThe timeframe of 8 months is very possible with 3 developers and 1 designer. The on-boarding of a designer will certainly help with improving the UI/UX of the cardanoscan.io website. However, a full redesign of the website may make or break cardanoscan, this has happened to another project in the ecosystem which made the user experience worse by doing a full redesign.\u2028I believe there should be a testing period of 1-2 months taken into account to gather the feedback of the users.\n\nThe primary concern is the project will be using the same developer for this project who is already working on the 2 projects that are still in-progress namely:\n\t1) cardanoscan.io API service\n\t2) Ouroboros Networking lib in JS\n\nThis may cause some delays in this upgrade project.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The timeline has been clearly specified.

All these benefits will  give a better experience to developers when building apps on Cardano. Besides new features added, this solution will also bring about improvements that make the explore faster. All of these factors help emphasize the intensive impact of it not only on users but also on devs in Cardano.

It actually brings about key features that developers use on a daily basis, which makes it easier and more convenient for devs to build their projects on Cardano. Furthermore, this solution will be highly appreciated by new devs and will also encourage them to be on board Cardano as well. All in all, everything was clearly presented.

The plan was given with a timeline of what step should be done each month in quite a clear way, but it would be better if more description related to technical aspects in each step was provided.

The cost was calculated based on the number of staff needed, but it could make it clear by mentioning the salaries paid for staff are calculated by months, or hours of work, or weeks.

Babbage Upgrade, Mempool Support and Plutus Script Verification are crucial elements which we\u2019ll need to have in the future version.

The big deal comes with it, which is the scale of the impact. Reading your suggestions, I realize that the technical side has not been explored deeply affecting the development of smart contracts and dApps. If the issue is resolved it will have a major impact on smart contracts, dApps, and the Cardano ecosystem now and in the future. This is the basis to be able to scale and continue to improve Cardanoscan.io to suit the volume of technology later. I agree with your question. I understand that some of the issues of the challenge were not easy to define, but you did and made a reasonable argument that addressed the requirements of the challenge. Your challenge in this proposal is what you have to do: Upgrade Cardanoscan.io. This is inevitable for Cardano's development. Cardano wants to develop more, to go further, Cardanoscan.io must evolve more. Hopefully this time I will see the appearance of mempool, advanced Plutus support, re-design, contract label, etc, these are all incomplete versions of the old version and are essential to the development of the Cardano ecosystem. I recognize the risk of the proposal, the proposed solution to the problem is not always listed. This requires in-depth research while writing the proposal. You insist there is no risk to the upgrade. I hope that's true when implementing the proposed implementation. I think it's very rare that a recommendation is risk-free.

I advise you to look closely instead to find the risk in the proposal of confidently asserting that there is no risk. In my personal opinion, this is a very reasonable and feasible funding request. But it depends on other factors to propose funding. You have listed expenses with a total required amount of 128000$. I just wonder why you guys don't list in more detail what Devs and Designers have to do to get results. Doing so will further increase the reader's confidence in the proposal. In addition, is the amount of $ 128000 for 4 members to develop a high price? I need you to explain on what basis to make such a funding request?. Your team is professional, cooperative, and works with good quality. The division of work, available experience, public identity will attest to this. With what the teams have done, I have to say that you are professionals. The fact that you have done well your proposal in the past Funds.

I took the time to look for it, but it's not in your proposal. I recommend adding KPIs soon to further improve the auditability of your proposal, convincing readers that this is a doable idea. It will be a significant omission when your proposal lacks KPIs. The team has a serious and professional spirit in doing work. This is reflected in what has been done, from defining success to successful testing. This is one of the few proposals that has had a successful trial before. I am sure that special upgrades to support mempool, upgrade the view of the Plutus smart contract, are the main features that you have done and succeeded in boldly writing this proposal. It is not difficult with the professional team of team. I think this is a confirmation of the feasibility of the proposal. I am always intrigued by proposals that have never been funded but have been funded in previous Funds. Because it has a basis to trust the proposal and can contain unexpected interesting things.
