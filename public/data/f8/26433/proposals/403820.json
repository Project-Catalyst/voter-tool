Without such a service, the developer must setup and run a node themselves. As a developer, I can tell you that will probably make 90% of developers quit before beginning the project. This is especially true for hobby projects and learning. Fixing this issue will thus remove a barrier to entry and allow developers to focus on what they do best.\n\nThe proposal solves a real problem. The impact depends on the alternatives available. A quick search for Cardano Blockchain APIs leads us to cardano developers page: https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/dandelion-apis/. Here we find several APIs developed by IOG and others but they need setting up. Gimbalabs Dandelion offers these APIs for developers to get started on but that is just for basic usage. Nothing production level can depend on them. The documentation also leaves you wanting more. I even got timeouts while trying it out, so they didn't work for me. \n\nAnother alternative is the blockfrost API, which is a larger suite of API endpoints for developers to use. At first glance it might seem like Blockfrost already provides all the functionality the proposal is looking to deliver. But the proposal's metadata search functionality is not available in Blockfrost. Just that functionality alone is very important in my opinion. Also, competition is good for developers: More features, cheaper prices, better developer experience. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project at hand is very simple in terms of software development. This is because the proposer have already implemented the difficult parts for their main project. Their website (https://bi.stakepoolcentral.com/) allows users to browse the blockchain data. The proposal will use the same systems to implement an API for developers. Seeing that they have already implemented the features on their website, it's almost a certainty that they have the skills necessary to implement the API. \n\nHowever, the proposal leaves a lot unanswered in terms of personnel and necessary skills. The proposer has the username CENT. This is the only information we have about them. Neither their current our their past proposal has information on who the people behind the project are, what skills they have etc. As I browsed their features I did notice CENT was their Stakepool name but that information still didn't let me find who is behind the project. I ask the proposers to give this information in future proposals. We can't be asked to rely on past performance alone to assess feasibility. \n\nThe proposers do have a funded proposal from Fund6, which they note is already up and running on their website. The proposal is for an enhancement of their metadata search functionality. Most of the features mentioned here have been implemented: display search hit list, paging, popular phrases are some of them. Extra filtering options like filtering with month or key has been skipped I think, or requires some specific knowledge to use the filter properly. Either way, we can conclude they deliver on most if not all of their promises. I think they'll deliver the API without issue.\n\nThe proposers note there will be 6 API calls only. This is an arbitrary number. An API call is a relatively simple piece of software, especially since these features have already been implemented on their website. I would expect them to deliver almost all features on the website, not an arbitrary number. They also ask 2K for development and 1K for documenting each call. With 1K for documentation per API endpoint I expect the most comprehensive, detailed piece of documentation ever written. I do ask the proposers to give justification for this part of the budget.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal states: \"Our test site (https://bi-testnet.stakepoolcentral.com) will always be running the latest development version of the API. \" So we can expect them to update the test website to include API documentation and have a backend that can serve those requests. Having an actively developed test site where we can see progress is great for auditability. The proposers will also send bi-weekly updates to the Catalyst community reporting the status of deliverables. From where such communication will be made is unclear though.\n\nThe API calls that will be implemented are only given as suggestions within the proposal. The final 6 calls will be decided in May and specified in the Detailed Design document. Assuming that document is comprehensive, auditability is not an issue. It is relatively simple to make sure the API does what it's supposed to do. The team should however provide extensive documentation for every detail of their functionality, which will allow even a developer who's not familiar with Cardano or blockchains to verify the functionality works as intended.

Overall, I highly recommend this project's traceability and testability. Proposers outline the project's success as when developers can use our search results in their solutions.
