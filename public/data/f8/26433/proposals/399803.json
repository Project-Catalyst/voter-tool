Gamblers are not interested in currency, they just want to feel the adrenaline. Our company has the highest revenue during the pandemic because the real casinos were closed.\nThe proposal is very clear and well explained. Proponents know how their idea will help the community - \"We know the gambling industry is moving billions, we hope to bring a significant amount of negotiations ...\".\nIt is not very clear how the bet liquidity will be provided? At a certain moment, the winners can be much more than losers. Where will the money come from?  The proposers should know the answers to these questions", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers provide links to their LinkedIn accounts with further explanations of their experience. They are a very experienced and reliable team. The other good part is that there are different roles in the team. This is the definition of a complete team. CEO, full-stack developer, journalist, and marketing assistant. They are able to manage many areas of the project, not just development.\nThe budget is very well separated into different phases - that is why there are several questions that can be asked. \n1. What happens if the full stack developer can't / refuses to participate in the project? How will he be replaced?\n2. There is only one developer why the budget is separated in front-end and back-end??\n3. Only the fourth and fifth months are set for development. This means that the payment for one developer for two months will be 14k + 16.8k = 30.8k or about 15k per month. What is the salary of a regular/senior developer in Brazil?\n4. Is it possible for such a project to be made by only one developer? How about deployment, networking, security, maintenance, technical support and etc? \n5. What exactly is included in Amazon AWS support? Why should the project be deployed at AWS? There are many other cheaper hosting services.\n6. What is included in this marketing assistant and social media? Nothing mentioned in the \"detailed plan and timeline\"?\nThe proposals do not explain technical aspects such as architecture, language, and technology. There is nothing about how they will attract new people.

We will provide liquidity to the main betting groups, as they will be binary, we will always have the same ratio of winners x losers wins. We currently have 2 full stack developers with us, both with qualities in both front and back.\n\n(Feasibility Note) - The salary of a senior developer in Brazil is around $4K/month. We believe that it is possible to use only one developer, but we think it is safe to have more people on the team to guarantee delivery. We already use AWS in all our projects, we have many resources already optimized and prepared. We will try to detail more information about user acquisition.\n\n(Auditability Note) - With the feedback received, we will make the project follow-up public in JIRA, as well as posts on social networks and also a development release through news.

This is indeed an exciting and creative idea to attract users to Cardano. The form of betting is simple and close, the way to pay prizes with smart contracts is also very potential for development.

But if possible, please add a few lines to describe precisely how this contract works (e.g., what will be in the contract, what the terms will be or if there are any restrictions). And I also hope you can explain more about how you will protect users' personal information when they participate in betting.\nFinally, and also the reason why I give this part 3 points. I'm commenting as a non-expert in this field, or possibly because you haven't been clear on this, and I haven't been able to understand.

Will ADABet be able to \u201ccreate a positive developer experience that helps the developer focus on building successful apps\u201d?
