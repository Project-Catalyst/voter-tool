Coming from a place where I had to set-up a company myself, having this would have been extremely beneficial, therefore I strongly agree that this is a needed deliverable for the community.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project promises to deliver: 1.1) document templates for teams members KYC to avoid team conflicts and know who each of the members and; 1.2) a multisig solution for distributing funds to team members once the funding from catalyst is received; 2) continues research and curating relevant legal information on incorporating DAOs into a bespoke website.\n\nThe document templates for agreements between team members (1.1.) is definitely deliverable by the proposers given their strong background in legal as presented on their website. Delivering (1.2) will be a little more challenging given the core competencies of the are in legal rather than tech and this would be a tech solution, for which they will need to recruit; 2) creating a website and curating with recent news and updates to regulatory guidance certainly deliverable given experience of the lawyers (https://lexfuturus.io/our-team/ for full team).\n\nHowever I do feel that given the team's experience there could more delivered, particularly in section 2, where what the community needs is a turn key templates and set of specific steps on how to incorporate in different regions. The team includes a lwayer in Russia, a lawyer in Nigeria, a lawyer in Malaysia, a lawyer in UK and a lawyer in the US. So it would be good to see templates on how to incorporate in those regions and/or specific guidance on regulation with a formed legal opinion.

I found a refreshingly positive surprise that the proposer discloses all the other projects in Catalyst that they had in the past and the ongoing ones - this is rare to see in proposals and a good upfront disclosure that shows how this continues from the previous proposals and if lets the voter decide to what extent the proposer and team might be overextending themselves if there are too many proposals in the current fund.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1076", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 4, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Regulatory compliance is very important for crypto projects.

As a way to improve, on new proposals and also if funded, during the building of the website, I think the language and angle used to describe the solution can be more simple and direct, as it took me at least three readings to really understood what was the purpose and committed in the proposal, but the basis are there.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team brings great experience, suited for the task to be done. Len is also a well known and active member of the community, with great contributions and a critical thinking, also the provided materials out of the first part of this project (Funded in F7), even being drafts are well thought and have great value.\nThe budget requested is aimed to cover costs for two main tasks:\nOn one side to pay for 4 roles at an average of $2.000 each per month for 6 months, which it is ok with market and catalyst usual rates (even less than average I will say, which shows commitment from the founders to serve the community). That adds up to $48.000 total, even though no detailed breakdown of costs were provided, I think the intention for the funds is clear here.\nOn the other side, to build a website and hire a researcher, with $16.000 being requested, stating that $10.000 will be spent on the website building, with a timeframe of 6 weeks. As no detail is being provided on what type of site is going to be built or the team involved in the building, is hard to properly assess if the funds requested are adequate, there's no mentioning of what is going to be paid with the remaining $6.000. So feasibility is at risk here, even though there's a note, that the founding team will cover any extra expenses if the funds are exhausted, as the site required for this type of project/service is not a complex one, it is more likely that there could be an over-budget here. The plan also is very broad and lack of details. The allocated time for building the site might not be enough.
