The proposer\u2019s proposal is certainly in line with the challenge brief in that if completed, could see some valuable research into Petri Net based programming design.\n\nI would have like to see the proposer expand into how this solution could benefit developers within Cardano specifically. The proposal is very technical and certainly presents a good breakdown of the usage of Petri Nets, however it is not clear how the proposal would impact the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nI would advise the proposer in future to look at the impact in light of the impact the proposed solution would have in addressing the problem. The idea of the impact is to say: \u201cThis is what the problem is, this is what I want to do about it, and this is what the impact will be of the solution I propose if successful\u201d.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has an impressive resume however it is not clear from the proposal how this project will be implemented besides some very high level time estimates. I would highly recommend the proposer provide some kind of project plan, with time and resource allocation as part of future proposals. These need not be design level project plans, but rather just give reviewers and voters and idea of how the project will proceed at a more granular task based level.\n\nThe lack of implementation plan makes it very difficult to objectively provide any confidence in saying that this proposal if funded will be implemented. However, the proposer appears to clearly possess the needed skills, as such I can neither disagree nor agree that this proposal will be successfully implemented.\n\nAs a South African Community Adviser, the following advice I will write in both English and Afrikaans as a show of camaraderie from one Afrikaner to another:\n\nThe proposal contains solid technical information and is very clearly well researched in that aspect, however the project part of it does need to be detailed more clearly. I would recommend the proposer add some more detail from a project management perspective to this proposal and submit for future funds if not approved here.\n\nDie voorstel bevat soliede tegniese inligting en is baie duidelik goed nagevors in daardie aspek, maar die projekdeel daarvan benodig verdere uitbreiding.

It should focus on clarifying that this solution can bring about developers and how it will have a certain influence on the Cardano ecosystem as well.
