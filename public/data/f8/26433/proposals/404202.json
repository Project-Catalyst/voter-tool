Especially, Haskell is a difficult programming language for even those who use English as their native language.\n- Japan is a potential market with many technology developers, but technical English is very limited in Japan. This makes blockchain technology enthusiasts especially the Cardano platform inaccessible to project development.\n- Translating a basic book on Haskell into Japanese will motivate the blockchain-loving community in Japan to develop widely. From there, build and develop more projects on the Cardano ecosystem.\n***Suggestions/ advices:\n- Translation of books is just the first basic solution to help the Japanese community have more reference sources. If the proponent can combine more periodic livestreams, community care groups such as telegrams to answer readers' questions or give advice, share more learning experiences, and apply them to readers, the solution will more effective\n- The proposal mentions the amount that will be shared and only shared with developer communities in Japan that the proponent knows, this number is limited.

If there is a translation team, the proposer should mention it in the team composition to increase the feasibility of the project\n- If the project can name the developers in communities in Japan that the project targets, that would be great. That shows that the project has been carefully prepared and has a clear direction\n- Marketing solutions have not been clearly stated.

My English is also not at the level I want it to be. However, I do not think it is a good idea to translate and read technical books in other languages. It is better to be created English language courses for Japanese developers who do not understand the language than reading the text in another language. I have two books in my native language and I have not completely read both because there are translated terms that should not be translated.\nIf the translation will be made, I strongly recommend that technical terms not be translated. This means that most of the book will not be translated. The explanations and algorithms will be translated, which will be great.\nStill, in my opinion, it seems more useful to do Japanese courses about the book, with the teacher being technically literate. These courses can be only the first step to the Cardano ecosystem. After that, more advanced courses can be created", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The translation of the book to be done in one month sounds absolutely achievable. 200 downloads should not be a problem either, since the book will be free, every developer in Japan will want to see it. But how many of these developers will really start dealing with Haskell? And how many of them will enter the Cardano ecosystem? There should be a more detailed study here for developers who want to learn Haskell and enter the Cardano ecosystem. Maybe it would be good to make 10 publications in advance in the respective communities. If the programmers point to the language barrier and the lack of Haskell training as the main problem, then this translation will be extremely necessary.\nIt is very good that the translators are a technical person and a person with 10 years of experience with translations and is part of the Cardano ecosystem. Without a technical person, quality translation will be impossible. If they are approved, I do not think they will have any problems with quality translation. As I said above, I would recommend that the terms remain in English.\nThe budget absolutely corresponds to the work that will be done by a programmer with 5 years of experience and a professional translator.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The plan is good, but there seems to be no further study and explanation of the numbers.\nWhy exactly in 3 months?

Why exactly 2%?\nIn my opinion, it would be a good idea to have a marketing plan in place or to introduce people to the Plutus Pioneer Program and Catalyst.

People who only know the language of their country of study actually face a language barrier when accessing books in English. It is possible that a book translated into Japanese cannot represent 100% of the book in English. But 95% of the knowledge in these books is completely understandable without problems (there may be some concepts that are not found in the Japanese language). Therefore, when we translate terms, we explain them in a way that is easy to understand.
