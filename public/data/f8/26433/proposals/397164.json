While most of them focus on bringing in more developers to the ecosystem and providing all amenities required for them, this proposal makes sure that the existing developers stay and tries to make them land the right job for the right pay, so that they are happy doing what they do. This in turn increases the productivity, user satisfaction, adaptability, and capabilities of the entire ecosystem. The proposer sure has read between the line, and come up with an intriguing scheme to keep the developers involved within the chain. Bringing more players is surely important but retaining them is equally important. Most projects have failed due to the unavailability of experts to guide them, and this proposal clearly addresses this issue to an extent by making sure that the right talents reach their deserved destination. The proposer knows what needs to be done and is also conscious about the challenges involved and makes sure that the community realizes that they have a plan to overcome them, which makes the proposal all the more trustable and effective for the readers.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The idea and the detailed plan provided by the proposer have left quite an impression on me as a reader. The plan itself seems crystal clear and feasible in every way. The quarterly game plan with visible goals set at each stage makes the proposal practical and viable. The dedicated team put together for this looks apt for bringing this product to life. The experience the members have is immense and everyone seems to be an established identity in the ecosystem. The requested budget is very reasonable and the breakdown of it is very acceptable. The requested fund does not take up the majority share of the allocated fund making sure that equally effective proposals get a chance too. The proposer also mentions the project is a part of another project, which makes the chances of the team implementing very high. Thus, I would personally feel giving full points on the feasibility metrics is the only way to appreciate such researched and well-thought plan.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Both the individual success metrics from the development and business point of view are clearly mentioned hence making the auditable process easy and fruitful. The detailed breakdown of how and where every penny of the budget goes makes the auditor's job more joyful. The proposer provides a lot of quantifiable metrics that can be used along with the development tracking metrics that can be used to audit the progress of the project regularly. The Git can be used as a visible repository to manually track the development activity as the proposer mentions doing automatic push regularly. The success KPIs and the well-defined success metrics at various levels such as product development, product delivery, and business outcome standpoint make it measurable from every angle possible. With such a detailed plan and team being an already proved player in fund7 and with many proposals in fund8, the entire proposal has all the traits of being a winner and making the entire developer ecosystem merry soon.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 3, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10777, "q0": "I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. The proposal wants to solve - \"elephant in the room problem\" - in project catalyst (not limited to this however). e.e.g Non technical proposers struggle to find developers who could help them with the implementation of their ideas. \n\nThe telegram, discords and other channels are filled with such requests, and there is just too many gap areas which needs to be addressed as soon as possible, so that we can match the right developers to the right jobs, making proposers succeed, developers earn and grow their skills, and help Cardano evolve at faster rate. This proposal essentially tries to address this area, and will come up with an application (both off-chain and on-chain) that will bridge the gap between developers and project proposers.\n\nVery unique proposal, and good luck to the team.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is well versed in the technical capabilities that would be needed to fulfill the implementation scope of this proposal (with public profiles on github.

The team has put good efforts on writing up this proposal and this is visible as the technical implementation details and architectural deliverables are mentioned during the entire implementation phase of this proposal. .\n\nAs a senior developer myself, and based on the technical details provided I can say that  budget requirements ($54780) are well justified.  The budget is very well broken down to the little pieces including both technical and non technical split. \n\nThe team has provided detailed identified risks  and additionally provided solutions to the those potential risks. e.g. Things like looking for off chain solution to the risk of limitation of current smart contract capacities to execute the complex payment model is one example of that team has thought through at a deeper level of potential risks.\n\nOverall really good written proposal and hence i strongly agree. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I strongly agree that this proposal is highly auditable. The team has provided a working demo on how the front end may look like, which gives a good impression on that from features perspective what deliverables and big picture team is targeting. \n\nAdditionally, the public links to the github repositories and project website are given. Also the detailed breakdown of functionalities therefore will be easily auditable. Additionally KPIs and how success looks like considers not only the implementation but also the performance of the features sets so that the app is actually usable  under high load conditions.

I think such platform would be used by many, both people seeking and offering jobs, could accelerate the development of many products, form new collaborations and strengthen the community. I think it is a very good idea, which would find its application - yet - one question seems unanswered. The proposal states, that money is paid only when the product is delivered (for proposer), and that they guarantee the payment (for seeker). But who decides whether the project is delivered?

Suggestion - ask for funding on multiple rounds, dividing the job by 2 quartiles, and possibly look for another funding in the meantime. The budget is calculated based on tasks planned to be performed, using hourly wages, which seem fine. \n\nThe team profiles are posted, with stated required experience and skill, also with their LinkedIn and telegram profiles. \n\nNevertheless, there are some parts that might be contrary - 1. the demo displayed appears that most of it is already done. 2. Q2 22 - \"project outline\", \"setup github\" - I would say that these are already done. Or I have misinterpreted what I have seen?

Also they plan to measure satisfaction of users, among many other metrics.\n\nOverall this section is very vast, and anyone interested on how it can be audited fill find an answer to their question.

At this point, it seems there are more projects than developers but having the matching platform will give the attractive projects the ability to reach developers. As a nontechnical proposer, I will use such a platform myself.\nThe proposal clearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem.

For example, with all the info it is difficult to understand the roadmap in connection to the budget. Would the budget be sufficient until the beta release? So the project is spread over 1 year (Q2 2022 to Q1 2023)? It would have been helpful to connect the budget with the timeframe and tasks. \n\nThe proposer asked for multiple funding and for different models of the solution. It would have been good to further explain how each model is independent and how they work all together. If all proposals get funded is it possible to have efficiencies and cost reduction? if only one proposal gets funded, will it impact the success of the project? It will be good to share more information about it as they belong to the same project. It would be good to consider a business model and other funding sources for the future.

My experience in Catalyst, is a long time as Catalyst is more of an ideation platform, and I see an advantage in shorter cycles which also support Auditability so many of the users KPIs will be long before it could be evaluated by the community.  You do provide also detailed information on how to evaluate the development process and mention \u201cWeekly report that lets everyone be aware of the whole process.\u201d The community will be able to see it Github? \n\nThe feeling is that you tried to include all the information and it could be confusing especially for nonprofessional CAs. While you can have a detailed white paper/project doc, my suggestion is to focus on key most important parts in the proposals and have the rest as an attachment (ppts, doc, github\u2026), too much info could be actually confusing for the audit.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_636", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Create smart contract based job services that actively offer developers right jobs, commit payment and provide them valuable data to grow.", "experience": "Practical blockchain engineers, software experts, product design, software engineering management, QA/QC.
