Elm is itself a purely functional language, so an experienced Elm developer would be comfortable with functional logic, which is what Plutus and Haskell is. Then it just becomes a question of learning syntax. \n\nThe idea of shared state throughout the development stack is also not necessarily a big feature. API driven applications are examples of apps that do not contain shared state however they are very widely adopted and provide a number of valuable features. \n\nWhile I agree that this proposal fits with the brief of the developer ecosystem challenge, I do think that a identification of clear needs first needs to take place. As an adviser, and engineer, I can neither agree nor disagree that this proposal directly addresses the challenge because it is not entirely clear what this proposal is trying to solve.\n\nThe creation of a new language with associated tooling is a very time expensive endeavor therefore the acquisition/inception phase of the project needs to have a decent amount of time dedicated towards evaluation of feasibility. My advise to the proposer if this is not funded would be to submit a proposal to evaluate feasibility and then use that to augment and motivate subsequent proposals.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The provided information seems to suggest that the proposer possesses the needed competencies to tackle a project such as this.

It clearly mentioned its target audiences and how this solution will impact them. In fact, it gave a detailed explanation of how this solution will benefit users. It also stated that along with other proposals related to educating people in Malawi about Cardano and Dapp development, this proposal bringing one language to build applications would make it easier to teach people about how to build apps on Cardano and ultimately help bring more people into Cardano. This is how the solution impacts not only its audience but also the Cardano Ecosystem. However, if more information related to the outcome of this solution and emphasis on how it is appropriate to the KPIs or key metrics of the given challenge, it would be more persuasive.

The budget breakdown was written but not in great detail. In fact, it just showed how to calculate the total cost for 6 months. And no indication of what this cost will be used for. Besides, As the plan stated every 3 months would be spent on different activities. Therefore, It should separate this total cost into the different small amounts for each activity every 3 months.

It should provide specific KIPs or key metrics for each period of time. What should be done, what should be achieved in each time milestone should be listed with specific figures so that the sponsor could see how to track the progress of the project, and what to expect in different timeframes. And as the proposal mentioned, regular presentations should be held to report these things. About the success expected for this proposal, it mentioned general things. For example, success is based on the quality of information and ideas presented to the Cardano community. But how to measure the quality. It should add some criteria to measure the quality to decide whether it achieved what was expected or not. There is just one positive point here is that it mentioned the long-term expected success.

The authors have a specific timeline to use the funds for, and I think this is a crucial key to success.

As an advise to the proposer, you shall provide more details or evidence on your profile/experience so those claims can be supported. In terms of timeline and milestones, the proposal aims for a 6 months first phase to research and create the basis of the POPLAR language, clearly stating that the total effort will be far more (2+ years), which the proposer indicates he is more than willing to continue working on the language after the first 6 months without any further funding. So the scope and time seem reasonable for this type of objectives, but no further details were provided, and this will be a very technical and complex project. Regarding budget it requested $18.000, based on. a $30 usd/hour, working 25hs per week and a 6 month duration, which is in line with the market and Catalyst ecosystem for this type of roles and project and well specified. Some risks where identified and some mitigation provided, such as patching existing tools as a way to start and make progress in the short term (as it will be a long effort).
