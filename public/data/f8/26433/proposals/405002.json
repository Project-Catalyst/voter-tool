While the impact of the proposal alone may be moderate, for the amount of funding it is asking for, very little can produce that much impact or \u201cReturn on Intent\u201d at the expense of funding remaining available for other projects. \n\nWhile this proposal may help make tools easier for certain developers to work within Cardano, which may enhance the number of devs building on top of Cardano, what I do not see much of is attracting devs from outside our current community. Increasing a dev\u2019s engagement within the ecosystem does meet the \u201cwhat would make a dev motivated to grind\u2026 no matter how hard\u2026?\u201d component of the Challenge, which is awesome, however, everything I am seeing remains largely in the sensing phase or stage, seeking to \u201cidentify\u201d current issues, so basically information gathering, rather than actually building out the IDEs, APIs, etc. for incoming devs to actually work with. Further, the mention that of the solutions their team identifies, programming/coding will not be made and provided by this $150k request but will seek future funding as other proposals, encouraging engineers and devs to form teams rewarded by the community, that gives me pause. \n\nLeveraging the learned experience from the Swarm for team building is awesome, and increasing dev engagement is awesome. Those goals are great. However what appears to be mostly a research project to \u201cidentify and plan\u201d projects without execution, may not fully align with the goals of the Challenge by actually truly making it easier for devs to build\n\nIn order to increase Impact I would encourage splitting into smaller, separate projects, as well as having the proposal actually building out the software, not merely focusing on information-gathering. \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Only two members are shown to consult to make this product, and neither links to their CV or resume or credentials, but one to what appears to be a private company website, and the other to what just kind of appears to be a collection of Catalyst info, but not necessarily evidence that would boost one\u2019s confidence in the team\u2019s ability to create what they are proposing. \n\nThe bullet-points provided seem respectable in concept, however should have been broken down into more concrete, actionable steps in order for voters or assessors to feel confidence that a plan has been better laid out. The plans don\u2019t seem thought out, so much as more wishy-washy abstract goal concepts, which aren\u2019t individually actionable. \n\nI would have liked to have seen a larger team spelled out, along with credentials shared more directly such as via LinkedIn histories, rather than external websites that are practically advertisements and/or verging upon self-promotion. I likewise would have wanted to see the two months provided \u2013 June and July \u2013 ambitions explained more in detail to be able to understand more than an abstract, nebulous concept of what the team plans to do during that time. \nFor a project asking for considerably more than an average person\u2019s multi-year salary or the cost of a house, this project needed to have had far more work put into explaining exactly how the team could explore, set up, and create what they aim to before requesting the future funding that they already hint at needing. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Much of following along in June or July appear to be somewhat auditable, although again they are left somewhat vague, and not quite concrete enough to truly measure and follow along.

In my personal opinion, this is a very reasonable and feasible funding request. But it depends on other factors to propose funding. Regarding the detailed budget analysis, perhaps you need more specific explanations of your expenses. Such listing is great, but it would be better to explain more.
