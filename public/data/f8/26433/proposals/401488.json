Having people around to talk with.\u201d Cardano and Project Catalyst might be seen by the newcomers to blockchain as yet another barren desert, with no one to talk to. By launching HeartBeat on a weekly basis, newcomers can feel the heartbeat consistently pulsing and conversation is started. From then on people can catch up and participate easier. \n\nFor those interested in creating proposals, this will be the perfect ground to get the correct idea about proposals should be created and presented. Other people who have resources but do not yet have the courage to start a proposal can team up with the proposer that they are interested in.\n\nThis essentially creates IdeaScale, but in live-streamed videos. Imagine the interactiveness created! People who love to interact in person will definitely choose this media rather than the written one like IdeaScale.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "On the realistic results they aim, the active team members that are well-known throughout the Catalyst community, and also clear plan they laid out, this proposal shines feasibility all around it.  \n\nThe team members regularly conducted events in Catalyst environment filled with discussions, and they even provide the mock-up recording of what an episode of this Heart Beat will be conducted.\n\nBudget-wise this proposal is simple yet understandable, asking just enough funding to get the engine running. Although for additional funding that they may require, they have no plan. The bright side is, with all these clear plans, they will not need the additional funding. \n\nThe timing presented is realistic enough with only 1 session delivered weekly, and with max of 10 proposers to be presented on each session. They laid out the plan for each of the session, putting 3 rounds started with each of 1-minute pitches by each of the proposers, and continue on with rules for interactivity, by giving thumbs to determine the continuation of the session.\n\nWith all the rules set, the proposer captured the concern that if this movement gain momentum, they will be in the situation where they will have to define, who are the 10 proposers given right to present on each of the session/episode.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal is very clear on the roadmap, as well as milestones given through the Metrics and the numbers provided.

I would just suggest creating it in a way that still encourages CA's to thoroughly read proposals as there is really benefit in doing so. This proposal could align more with the challenge perhaps if hackathons are integrated in. Maybe Catalyst HeartBeat could do some match-making amongst developers pre-proposal submission stage and then follow them through to the end to which then they'd include the pitching in 60 seconds.

", "q0r": 4, "q1": "12 episodes over 3 months seems quite small considering how many proposals there are. Though, I appreciate it may be more time-consuming in the early stages. So it may be great to think of a way to make the process more efficient to a point where the proposing team for Catalyst HeartBeat can do more than 12 in 3 months. This could include increasing number of team members and having reps from several countries to be able to record content and 'host' the proposers. Subsequently, though it is not explicitly clear by first seeing \"12 episodes\" there is an aim to do 10 proposals per episode.\n\nGreat to see that Peter has experience as a podcaster and Rhys had done Plutus Pioneer. The bigger their team, however, the more they can reach and in an efficient way. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I think the team should be clearer with what their \"success\" looks like as right now it vaguely suggests that 10 proposers filling in the google forms per episode and 100 views each, is success. However, maybe success could also be accounted for in the form of viewer engagement beyond views. This invites the idea that perhaps the team need to spend some time and funds on marketing too as this a two-sided process that would require them to converse with proposers and potential CA's at the same time - this is where the real engagement comes in. They may even want to consider a quick post-episode survey (this could be anonymous if needs be).\n\nNevertheless, the team mention that all deliverables are public facing channels and this is the best way to see if they are reaching their targets.

What content is involved? They mentioned the challenge of finding participants to take part in HeartBeat from all areas of Project Catalyst fairly, But, they haven't mentioned a detailed number.
