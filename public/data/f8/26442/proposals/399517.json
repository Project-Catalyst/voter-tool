In the present case, online meetings would be developed between developers who speak French and come from Africa, this would certainly benefit the continent, as it would provide education for professionals in the field of technology, opening the door for them to work in one of the various opportunities. jobs present in the Cardano ecosystem (which can be found, for example, in Catalyst itself); this would give them more preparation for them to become future proponents, if they wish, build Dapps, in short, this will allow them to work with a company and a technology that is growing and popular, which will generate many opportunities for a stable income in the future. And for sure the project will also be great for our blockchain, for two basic reasons. First, because it will prepare new professionals to work on our projects, and manpower is something that is sometimes still lacking here, from what I understand, especially in specific tasks, such as programming in Plutus, for example. And, in addition to generating a skilled workforce, this series of classes (so to speak) would popularize the Cardano ecosystem for a community that, as the proponents themselves say, is often excluded, French speakers in Africa. It is very positive as the proponents already have a defined destination for where they will start this project - Congo - this gives us a more solid view of what is to come. It is also positive that they will record the meetings and post them on youtube, because the internet connection can often be a problem for those involved here, so that would not be an impediment for them to participate in the project. Another positive point is that they already have a base, a telegram community with more than 130 developers, if everyone fits the characteristics highlighted here, that is, whether they are Africans and French speakers, there is already a very considerable amount of people to participate. from the project. However, I think some important details were left out, such as: what content would be covered in these meetings, in what order, with what strategy they would be passed on, what amount of meetings are expected, what amount of developers is expected for each meeting, if after the conclusion of these meetings there would be some way to follow the development of the professionals involved... Finally, details, which, if provided, would certainly add even more value to the impact of this idea. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is ok, but it can improve in some aspects. Let's start with the script, there are some tasks that would need to be fulfilled, such as \u201creconstitution of the English classes in French in pdf, powerpoint\u201d and \u201ccreation of a small promotional video for the invitation to participate\u201d. We also know what general issues would be addressed in each month of the project. However, the script could have been better organized. The activities that would take place monthly could be divided, and each one of them is very detailed. For example, in the first month, the focus would be to take these classes in pdf/powerpoint, right? How long would it take to prepare each class? Who would work on it? What is the approximate size of these classes? As the proponents explain to us the areas to be studied each month, the theme of each class should also be defined individually. For example, in \u201cJune 2022: Introduction to Cardano, Blockchain and Smart Contracts\u201d. This topic is quite extensive, how many meetings would take place this month? And what specific topic of each, within this universe of introduction to Cardano and etc? In other words, the script is still a bit messy, in my opinion, because we know what would happen, but not when, how or who would carry out each activity. Regarding the budget, I believe the asking amount of 9k USD is very fair, and would be money very well invested. However, I would like it to be better explained, its explanation is quite superficial. 3k would go for content creation in French and creation of a promotional video, would the content be the classes in pdf/powerpoint? How many would be created, to understand their individual value? Who would receive this money? The rest would go to video editing and pay the trainers. How much would go to editing, and how much to the coaches' salary? How many hours would these coaches work, what would be the value of their working hour? And in relation to the team, I think this part is very good, they are apparently very qualified people and very involved with Cardano, in addition to a small CV of each, the proponents attach their linkedin profiles, of how we can have concrete proof about what is said. However, I think it would be even more interesting if the roles of each of these members in the project were defined, we don't know who would do what. But that's all that remains pending, otherwise, I think this part of the proposal is very good. Therefore, my suggestions for feasibility here are: improving the script, establishing greater detail and a more detailed time division; explain better how the money would be used and define the tasks of each team professional in the project. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditability here is above average. Proponents are concerned with outlining ways to monitor both the project development process and the final results. I think some improvements can be made, but let's go in parts. Regarding the monitoring of the project, this could happen by checking the videos posted on youtube, which would correspond to the weekly meetings; from what I understand these moments (or the contents taught?) would also be available in text form on another site. This already gives us good content to be audited, we have material to analyze in relation to the progress of the project. It would be even better, though, if the team's professionals could provide some input regarding how the developers who are participating in the meetings are responding to the events; how many are going to each session; if there is a good interaction during this synchronous moment; if they are having difficulty learning about a topic; in short: to understand how these meetings are going, not only if they are happening. I think that, since they have already opened a communication channel through the website https://uptodatedevelopers.com/our-trainings, a small analysis of each meeting could be posted there, I don't think that video meetings are necessary, for example, if that platform is already being used. Perhaps the follow-up and engagement questionnaire, cited in the key indicators, is exactly what I am suggesting; in this case, I consider that the auditability of the process is perfect. And speaking of the final results, the proponents choose good indicators to see if the project would be having the intended impacts, such as the number of participants per session; whether they would come out prepared to develop a Dapp, for example; whether the Congolese developers would be effectively using this \u201cgateway\u201d that is being offered to them and so on. I only had one question: how would the project team collect and disseminate such information? Would it be through the same website as the project's progress? I would like to understand this, in order to have complete confidence in the question of whether the final results will be well audited. I think the best way is to contact the developers directly and apply a quick questionnaire, asking things like if they are participating in a project at Cardano and so on. So I think the auditability here is almost perfect, with few things to improve. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 474, "q0": "Increasing the understanding of Cardano in Africa is the aim behind the Grow Africa, Grow Cardano challenge and the proposal has been well developed to achieve that.

And as a member of the francophones, I certainly appreciate your ideas. To reaffirm that your project ALIGNS with the challenge, I commend the goals you have set when you want to establish this community in DRC. You presented well how your team will reach French-speaking people in Africa, how you will help them learn about blockchain and how the project will facilitate African developers actively active in Cardano. Moreover, the risks you put out are close to reality, and the solutions are also reasonable. With the available capital from the developer community on telegram, I believe your team will realize this project very effectively.

When you haven't specified what you are going to do to accomplish these items and how you will do it with the allocation of resources. Furthermore, the detailed plan section is still pretty sketchy, and I wonder which two steps you mentioned here correspond to which timeline in your plan.

Second, I commend you for seeing what this project's success looks like and listing the key metrics you aspire to achieve. However, it's a pity that you can't give a more specific thing than the word \"number\". How many people do you want to attend the session? How many will new developers join?

Plus, in order to understand the situation and handle difficulties in a timely way, the proposer suggests plausible alternatives for future challenges. Although it is a bit short, it is typically satisfactory. The major activity has been recognized; although, it is unclear who the target clients are, in general, the DCR. Those who are appropriate for this project should be specifically addressed, such as new enterprises searching for growth possibilities or students interested in learning about blockchain.

However, the lack of consultants from France or expertise in utilizing French is a mistake for the objective of teaching and passing French knowledge to the DCR.
