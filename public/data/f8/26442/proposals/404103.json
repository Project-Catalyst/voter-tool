If this proposal succeeds, it will help to spread blockchain knowledge to the students of these universities faster. In particular, it also helps students of these schools have a deeper understanding of the Cardano ecosystem, thereby seeding the talents who can participate to develop the Cardano ecosystem in the near future. It can be said that this is a very good proposal and completely suitable for the challenge posed.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I believe that with the experience of organizing similar seminars at universities for big brands like Coca-cola, Unilever, etc., you will do well in this proposal. However, unfortunately the community did not find any other information about you or your team to be able to prove what you have given is true. I think it will be better next time you can give links to your and your team members' experiences and skills through giving to the Linkedin community, Twitter, Facebook, Telegram,\u2026 or Anything that helps the community get to know you and your team better. In addition, you also need to include the possible risks that make this proposal unsuccessful. For example: If for some reason you cannot organize outdoor sessions, do you plan to organize online sessions to bring knowledge about blockchain, Cardano to students of these universities? What is your solution in this case? In case there are too few students interested, what will you do? There are too many people involved, how would you handle this? I believe that if you come up with a solution to these problems, it will help the community appreciate you more.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "You also need to come up with more specific, easy-to-measure numbers about the goals you'll achieve. Example: How many schools will agree to participate in your proposal? How many students will participate in each specific session at each school? How many students are needed to join the Cardano ecosystem? How many people will develop their careers on Catalyst?... The numbers you put out will help the community be more willing to support you.

This proposal asserts that the young Ethiopian community is missing out on the early introduction of the Cardano Blockchain System and its opportunities, so the proposer proposes to hold seminars and workshops on university campuses that will allow blockchain to be adopted as part of the university curriculum. The workshops and seminars are intended to give an introduction to blockchain technology as well as a guide on how project catalyst works, with the goal of forging partnerships among attendees in order to address real-world problems that are encountered in our daily lives. This leads to considerable growth in Ethiopia, as the educated population learns about the relevance of blockchain and what they can accomplish with Cardano blockchain, increasing Cardano awareness and contributing to the objective of making Cardano a preferred blockchain.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provides evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal.

This proposal actually fits in the challenge and would of course bring value to the cardano ecosystem in the sense that this proposal seeks to bring onboard a mass number of people through workshops and if this proposal is able to achieve this then we would be talking about a large number of people coming to be in the know of what cardano is and hence adds value to cardano. \nI will like the commend the team for stating the challenges that they would be confronted with, it prepares the team to take necessary steps to find solutions to these challenges.

The proposal\u2019s problem is clearly within the challenge \u201ccontinue to seed and grow Cardano in Africa country in 2022\u201d. The proposal also clearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano system: Bring knowledge about Cardano to the youth is the key to create a human resource potential for the growth of Cardano ecosystem. I found interesting with the proposer\u2019s vision: he/she seizes the opportunity to propose this idea when seeing the changing rapidly of the academic curriculum in Ethiopia universities to catch up the growth rate of education in the world, and the available of workshops in campuses recently. I also agree that students who are in university are always the best choice for the seminars because they have basic academic knowledge and the \u201chunger for new technology\u201d spirit to be interested in Cardano blockchain system. Additionally, the proposal is able to scale to address future challenge: if success it will be a good foundation for projects in future.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The author describes pretty detailed about experience and skills relevant to conducting the proposal. The plan and timeline are understandable clear with the fair budget which broken down quite detailed, helps us easy to see what the fund is asking for.

Moreover, the team that is required to complete the project is also explained about their experience and skills needed and suitable for the work in plan. However, it would be greater if the author could make two things more clear: the content of seminars in details and the information of the team. I believe what we bring to students now, will inspire them to join Cardano community later, and raise the meaningful participation into Cardano ecosystem and Catalyst project in future, it is one of the key to the success of the project. Additionally, it\u2019s always benefical to know about the information of each member of the proposal\u2019s team: who they are, their names, their fields of work, examples of previous work, ect. I believe making all of  them clear will raise the trust from readers.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In my opinion, the aubitability of the project is pretty simple.
