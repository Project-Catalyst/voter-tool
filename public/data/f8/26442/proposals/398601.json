Specifically, they mention aiming to take 5+ calls per day in response to Billboard call to action. Who is taking these calls? Are they getting paid? If successful, 5+ calls a day (could it be more??) has the potential to be a significant investment of somebody's time to take those calls, and this is not explained or addressed anywhere in the budget. \nIt's not actually clear what the call to action  on the billboard would be, either.

On the other hand, the cost of this is quite large, the long-term and far-reaching impact on the community is not high.
