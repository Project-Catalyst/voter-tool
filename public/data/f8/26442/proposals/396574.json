Since the 'Grow Africa, Grow Cardano' challenge aims to increase Cardano awareness in Africa, this proposal is appropriate because as Wada becomes a sponsored organization, Cardano will grow even as more communities in Africa anticipate more workshops and outreach activities that will onboard more members: exactly what Wada aims to accomplish (increasing the size of its network reach) which will go a long way towards ensuring that Cardano is the blockchain of choice in Africa by 2023. The introduction of WadaDEX, a two-tier liquidity and capital-raising platform for African businesses, will boost Cardano awareness and minimize friction while fundraising.

As we can see, Wada and Partners are listed right in the \u201cRationale of budget\u201d section of this challenge. So the transformation both in terms of brand and operations of Wada is essential because a worthwhile project like Wada needs to take newer and bigger steps than being a non-profit organization as before. But the change here is to specialize in changing the way to approach the market and developers, not the vision that Wada laid out from the beginning. From the main product, the by-products under research, and the preparation of the leadership mentor partner, this proposal clearly shows Wada's seriousness in this innovation project. I really appreciate this.\nProposer fully understands the Key metrics that the challenge offers and follows them closely to highlight the impact Wada did, does, and will bring to the Cardano ecosystem. The \u201cmedium\u201d level of Cardano technology usage in Africa is a vital clue to show that the Wada innovation project is indispensable to focus on this area. Moreover, I feel that the goals proposed by the proposer are not too many, but they can be kept close to reality and highly enforceable. However, if possible, I would like to see growth statistics more specific, rather than just \u201chigh,\u201d \u201cmedium\u201d and \u201cvery high\u201d.\nFinally, regarding the anticipated risks and solutions, the proposer makes me, in particular, and of course all investors in general, very reassured about this innovation of Wada. Since the explanations and arguments presented are compelling, a fully grounded Wada will be able to deal with generalized risks with relative ease.

I appreciate that the proposer sticks to the key metrics of this challenge, but that doesn't mean you can just state the topics, with words that have broad meanings like \"numbers\" or \"growth\". Investors will care more about numbers than sentences filled with such generic terms. You show me what success looks like, but you give me no basis to believe it will. Therefore, I hope the proposer can add to this section. And please write a few more lines to introduce the old projects related to the new one briefly.

Therefore, they have proposed a solution that is to turn Wata into a technology company that generates revenue but does not change its mission and vision. In addition, the proposal mentions the main product and other products. The proposer also states the main results that the proposal has and the specific goals set forth with indicators to measure. One thing that the project does very well is that they can list the risks and for each risk, they have a plan to deal with it, such as with the risk of sustainability in the future, they ensure the sustainability of the project through revenue-generating technology products, or product development won't be an issue because of the growing network of developers and strong relationships in Wada.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal team has given a roadmap to implement the proposal but the timelines only indicate the results, I think it would be better if they mentioned the implementation process such as Wada's product roadmap.

However the success of the described project corresponds to the key metric and is specifically described as being a sustainable business that does not need to depend on Catalyst funds and once funded will develop a Cardano based MVP for the African market...

This clear division of funds shows that the proposers have calculated and made a reasonable budget spending plan with the current situation of the development team. The costs have been calculated in detail for each job position and investment item.\nThe project's management team includes experienced members in the fields to serve the project's management positions to the fullest.
