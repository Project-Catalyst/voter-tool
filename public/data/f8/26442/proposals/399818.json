But the financing shortfall re agriculture is staggering at USD 65 billion p.a. [1]", "f6_no_assessments": 12, "f6_rating": 4.027777777777778, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"q0": "The proposal is very good and smart, addressing exactly what the challenge is looking for. It is a platform that, using Cardano technologies, will connect small farmers and businesspeople with creditors. This is important because many times micro entrepreneurs cannot earn enough profit to keep their business active and they need external financial investment, this is difficult to achieve anywhere in the world, especially in Africa, where the economy is still developing and I believe that the range of investors should not be so vast and accessible to ordinary people. This platform would include several things, the most interesting thing I found here was the process of preparing the person who will benefit (they will invest in it in some way). This person would be educated about entrepreneurship and blockchain, and would also go through a sort of filtering, which would indicate what type of lender would be best suited for them. I found it very useful and necessary on the part of the proponents to include this type of guidance, as they go beyond establishing the bridge between the entrepreneur and his financier. This project would certainly benefit the African continent, as it would help a fundamental part of its economy, agriculture, to develop, boosting small businesses. It would also help the local population (at first, this project would be developed in Kenya - another positive point in the proposal is that we are located in the country that would be the pioneer in this project, otherwise we would get a little lost in the giant dimensions of the continent). This would be done based on the instruction that would be passed, as the proponents speak, the teachings about entrepreneurship and also about what Cardano is, how our blockchain can be a gateway to different opportunities, either through direct funding on Catalyst or through education. (if people are interested in studying some of our applications, which could generate employment and income in the future). Therefore, I think it is a proposal that aligns very well with the objectives of the challenge, mutually benefiting the African continent and the Cardano ecosystem, through its dissemination and possible adoption by new people (perhaps the investors themselves too, other than agricultural professionals). With that, I will give a maximum score for impact, because I believe that with the correct orientation this project can generate great results. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Unfortunately that part of the proposal left a lot to be desired compared to the impact. We know in a very basic way what is necessary to carry out the project, whether through information about the roadmap, team or budget. Starting with the script, there's actually no timeline here. What is revealed are all the activities to be done, and they are only mentioned, not explained individually. As a result, we were unable to solidly visualize the process. The total time interval required for the development of the project is also stated, but it is not possible to understand how long each part would last. To make the script better, it would be necessary for the proponents to change two things. First, detail each of the activities in greater detail. And then, situate them in the total space of time. How long each would last, in a matter of weeks, for example. Most proposals split the roadmap monthly, this is the minimum necessary to have a better understanding of the process. Regarding the budget, your explanation is also quite superficial. 75k USD is requested, quite a high amount. This money is divided into several parts, and even with many divisions, I did not find it possible to justify the amount requested. For example, 3k USD are requested to create content about cryptocurrencies. Who would raise them? What kind of content would it be, in video, text, pictures, a mixture of all these? Why does website creation cost 2k USD? And finally in relation to the team, the same thing happens: lack of detail. The names and positions of those involved are said, but many things need to be improved. At first, it should be established what relationship these people have with the Cardano ecosystem. Would they be experts, would they be active members of our community, how did they discover our blockchain and the type of work they currently do on it? What has been your journey so far at Cardano? Other than that, we would need to know what each one would do in the project, the previous job positions are told but not what roles they would perform in the present. It would be important that we also have some sort of proof of your CV, for example your linkedin profiles. From the way the project's feasibility is presented to us, I couldn't quite understand the process; justify the need for the 75k USD requested in the quotes; feel that the professionals that make up the team are technically prepared to successfully execute the project. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Proponents indicate some ways to audit their project, in addition to some more humanitarian objectives that dialogue with their project (such as the fight against hunger, decent work, economic growth, etc.). I think the information present in the proposal about your audit is good but not enough to track the progress of the project in a total way, because the proposers focus more on results than on the process. As a result, the following metrics would be used: \u201ccreating a platform that adds tangible value to its stakeholders\u201d + \u201ccreating a considerable and vibrant community of followers who read our posts and debate them\u201d, in addition to the launch of the agribusiness financing platform, amount of blog posts about blockchain and the amount of followers they would acquire over time. I think they think very well about how to analyze the results both quantitatively (although I missed the following statistic - number of financing closed from the platform created); also in a qualitative way, as they seek to interfere with the way the population knows and relates to blockchain, which could generate a change in how Cardano is seen and people could start to get more involved with our ecosystem, whether by simply investing in Ada , or maybe studying our programming languages, participating in Catalyst and etc. I think there are many ways to measure the final impact of the project and proponents exploit them well. But they also need to think of ways to audit the process, that is, ways that would allow the community to monitor the execution of activities, partial results, and so on. I think this could be done, first of all, by establishing a detailed roadmap, a budget that involves dates and deadlines. In the background meetings could be held between team members and some active participants from the Cardano community, it would be even better if they were natives of Kenya itself. Through these meetings, the Cardano community would be aware of the progress of phases. In this way, auditability would cover all the fundamental parts of the project, in addition to the final results. So I'll give it 4 stars because I think the team covers the results very well but forgets about ways to measure progress. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 7, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "With the aim of increasing knowledge about finance for small agro-entrepreneurs in Africa and remedying the lack of access to finance and quality content for them, we see that the proposal fits the current challenge well. The concepts of this proposal are explained in a clear and cohesive way, and the importance of using Cardano technology in the project is also evident.\n\nOne of the problems to be solved is the bureaucracy and the lapse in scope that traditional means of financing have when it comes to serving small entrepreneurs, and understanding their needs. The proposal in question is innovative, because, among other achievements, it will develop an algorithm that seeks to classify the needs of these entrepreneurs through a questionnaire, to then generate information on how to help them. The success of this initiative brings good visibility to Cardano in Africa and one of the project's goals is also to spread knowledge about cryptocurrencies. With this, a great path can be opened for future uses of Cardano's ecosystem on the continent.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "One of the most interesting points in the feasibility plan is the understanding that this historical problem on the African continent is too complex for a solution to be unequivocally presented. In this context, we realized that the feasibility plan was quite strategic in acting on different fronts that aim to 'shape' the project's operating environment so that, in the future, the problem can be truly remedied.\n\nWe thus perceive an adequate budget distribution, in which capital is being allocated both for the agrifinancing.com platform, for marketing and also for the generation of NFT's that aim to increase engagement in relation to the project. It is interesting to mention here that the use of NFT's may seem a little outside the main scope of the idea. But in the feasibility plan itself, it is mentioned that this is a source of extra income, and will not be a main 'engine' to leverage the project. Materials will also be prepared to intuitively teach the population about concepts that the project aims to use in the future. This also seems like a correct approach, as directly introducing ideas such as smart contracts to solve the difficulty of generating credit for the target audience could hinder more than help the cause at first.\n\nDue to the quality of the materials presented in the proposal, the organization of ideas and also the team involved, the asking value of $75,000 seems reasonable. In the team, there are professionals specialized not only in computing areas, but also people specialized in finance, social media and NFT's. One of the great differentials of the project is that the team behind the proposal belongs to a company, Moving Frontiers, specialized in finance in the field of agriculture. Even one of the professionals involved in the project, Maarten Susan, has a high degree of experience. Through a quick search, it was possible to find your linkedin:\n\nhttps://ke.linkedin.com/in/maartensusan.\n\nWe see that at this stage of the project, one of the main objectives is the construction of the Malengo algorithm, which will help to identify the needs of farmers. And accordingly, the largest portion of capital at this first moment, $34,000, is devoted to its development. It remains to be noted that it would be interesting if the CVs of the professionals involved in the project could be more easily located in the proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In terms of auditability, three main metrics were established that really address the lines of action indicated in the feasibility stage. The main focus of this first phase of the project was the development of the Malengo algorithm, and there is a forecast of the launch of the platform with the algorithm working.\n\nRegarding marketing, a number of posts were established to be published as well as a number of followers to be reached. These parameters for measuring engagement are very much in line with the project proposal in this first phase of \u201cpreparing the ground\u201d for future deeper changes in Africa's agriculture.\n\nAdditionally, it would be interesting to include, as one of the ways to measure the results, the follow-up, at the end of this first phase of the project, of a Cardano member who would help to validate whether the moment for the use of tools such as smart contracts has been reached.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 4, "ng": 9, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Access to reasonable financing options is a huge problem in Africa, as it affects access to the most basic human needs. Farmers in any part of the world need access to financing to scale and sustain food growing operations. This proposal wants to get right into this gap, and start connecting African farmers with lenders, providing a trust and security layer that helps more lenders work with more people who need those services. They are working with high-impact partners and have the ability to raise awareness about Cardano while building critical financial services infrastructure that Cardano builders will be able to build on as more DApps projects come online.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is a small discrepancy in the budget, which totals 76K, and the funding ask, which is 75K. This is a minor miss, and inconsequential overall for this proposal.\nI am favorably impressed by the attached business plan and the bridging the gap flyer. I would absolutely like to see this group get the chance to work toward this important and impactful vision. \nIn terms of judging Feasibility, I would prefer to see a little more evidence about who this team is and what they do. We have a link of 5 names and titles - no linkedin profiles, no website links. It seems like a lot of \"Taking their word for it\". A little more evidence of their work and capability would go a long way.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Some of the outcomes are clear and measurable: Social Media following of 100k+, 50-75 Blog posts.

Does it include onboarded lenders? How many? Does it include a trial run with a few end users - because that would be great! \nBlog posts and social media are great, but this big investment here is in the Agrifinancing platform, so I'd like to see a little more focus on results and auditability there.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1180", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Impact Assessment:\n\nI believe the proposal addresses the challenge, nevertheless I would entreat the team to affiliate with the \"Landano Land Registry System\" to better assure themselves of their various farmers not complaining of land registry and litigation issues when funded.

Because a good proposal needs to clearly define the positions and the number of people required to carry out the project, as well as show how the team will complete the work items, within what detailed timeline and what support will be needed. Moreover, the introduction of the team members still does not fully describe their qualifications and experience. Just the title name is not enough for investors to see your team\u2019s talent.

The idea that was proposed to solve this problem was to create a platform that connects agribusinesses with lenders by directing these agribusinesses to financiers that fit their business.
