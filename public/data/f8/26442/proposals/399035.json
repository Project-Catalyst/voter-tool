Indeed the back-lag challenge in the different folds of development being faced by Uganda is a problem in the African continent. This problem is actually not facing only Uganda but some other African countries as well who unfortunate for one reason or another, have not even heard or discovered the Cardano Ecosystem being a hub of solution. The problem, I see to be affecting about 80% of African countries and if this solution, which is kind of following the footprints of Wada, is successfully implemented, gradually Catalyst would receive a greater onboarding and adoption experience from Africa as it extends. I see the bigger picture of this proposal is to onboard software engineers to adopt the Cardano Dev Ecosystem even though the target audience for this proposal is local developers and especially for those who are still in colleges and the universities. That alone, addresses the Catalyst Fund goals of accelerating the developer and app ecosystem, preparing a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem and in all, it makes me strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal seems to have about 90% understanding of which resources are needed to enable a successful implementation. The missing 10% has to do with the lack of information on topics that they intend to teach participants who join this initiative and also the required partnerships to ensure delivery. This is evident to statement made in the risks/challenges that \"We anticipate to face huge challenges with the man power to walk the students through the most relevant tutorials for Cardano.\", \"Whereas we have two experience devs in the Blockchain Club of Uganda, they are quite busy with an availability of about twenty hours a month.\", and \"Otherwise, we hope to push this as possible as we can through good use of the available tutorials on the Cardano Academy\". From the comments, I realized a community member suggested that they reach out to either Wada, ABCD, or POA as a point of either information or collaboration but unfortunately that suggestion, I see to not be utilized. However, those organizations in the community could really be of great help to this proposal and the project as a whole and I suggest that the team reconsider their thought about that and further reach out to Gimbalabs or MLabs as well as they're more of Cardano Devs education and building.\nAnyways, I see that the team has had a success in hosting a Cardano event in Kampala even though the attendees weren't many but at least better than zero and it probably gives this proposal a heads up as those participants can be utilized positively as described in the proposal.\nThe team, I think would be feasible enough if they're able to partner with Gimbalabs or MLabs and/or Wada or ABCD or POA. The idea is that, Gimbalabs or MLabs would give them that technical educational experience while Wada, ABCD, or POA would help them with the organisation of the various events needed for successful implementation.\nAs for the budget, it's unfortunate that I'm unable to tell whether it's feasible or not. Reason being that, from this proposal, there was a reference to an event that has been hosted by the team but there's no information as to whether or not it's a catalyst funded project. An information on that, with a link could've helped my investigation into the budget. But a random research that I performed on event spaces and their costs in Uganda tells me an average range of $182 for a 5,036 sq. ft. event space which's enough room for successful hosting of the events. I am unable to verify for the other logistics as details like total number of expected participants, and banners to be printed aren't provided in this proposal.\nHaving in mind all of the above raised concerns, I remain skeptical about this proposal being successfully implemented if funded but I want to urge the team to kindly take into consideration working on the concerns raised in my comments and by so doing, they will come up with a great proposal in next iteration and probably get funded if not in Fund 8. Good luck! and great job!", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This proposal provides a clear roadmap with concise definition of success and metrics to help me assess its progress towards the stated goals. It's unfortunate that there's no communication on where exactly the community can track the progress of this project. A typical example could be a particular YouTube channel where videos of these event recordings would be posted for as to track, a website or blog where articles about held events will be posted for tracking purposes, social media channels, etc. However, a website link is provided but nothing was said about it. After accessing the website, I realized it's not a fully grown website as all buttons eventually leads to homepage which has no information about this particular proposal. I suggest the team should consider building it completely or better still set up a Discord channel and provide the link to it as a point of contact for auditability in the next iteration of funding cycle. As it stands, I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress of its goals.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_69", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 790, "q0": "Cardano For Ugandan Universities is a great initiative to develop the Cardano African community in general and the Cardano Ugandan community in particular.

The information you give is quite sketchy, it makes it harder for the community to understand you. Also, I think you need to put in more details about the risks you might take in making the proposal fail. Example: Too few final year students at major Ugandan universities are interested or they don't know about your project. How will you solve this problem? In addition, in the case of too many participants, do you have any solutions?

What is missing is that you need to give KPIs clearly and fully in terms of numbers so that the community can track the success of the project.

Uganda has suffered a technological gap that has caused it to fall behind in several aspects of growth; as a result, its education system has recently supported progress through steps to reorganize in order to boost innovation.. In comparison to its East African neighbors Kenya and Tanzania, Uganda falls behind in blockchain-related innovation. To solve the aforementioned issue, the Blockchain Club of Uganda will launch a campaign to expose Cardano as a legitimate opensource platform for developing Ugandan solutions to students studying software engineering.

The timetable provides sufficient time to realize the project. It is good that 3 large meetings are held with representatives of the university. Virtual meetings will be held with developers who are already working with existing ecosystems from Africa (Wada). By inviting these people, detailed projects will be shown. It is good that a Cardano hackathlon is being held in the sixth month in order to make even more contacts. A budget overview is available. This contains the material items, location rental, transport costs,\u2026 . The budget overview is fully and clearly described in the proposal. The switch from web2 to web3 has been taken into account. It is also difficult to have the 2 developers from Uganda's blockchain team available for 20 hours.

So that would help the proposers to connect easily with the group through that person.\nThe time frame is detailed and budget contains most relevant expenses, however they are some sections of it that would be important to clarify. The $200 of venue, is this for the office venue or workshop? And if workshop, which one?

This is my personal belief regarding where Cardano should focus on, something that this proposer also focuses on. This proposer also understands that you can not just barge in and force Cardano onto to people through grand events but rather through a systematical and thought out process. This proposer starts with 6 (six) technical events at pre-determined universities, ensure continuous engagement by establishing a study club at each university. This is then followed up by 3 (three) regional meet-ups than closed of by a hackathon. All in total a 6 (six) month process. Now this is how I personally feel the method you should deploy to increase engagement. Growing it small, maintaining it and then celebrating it. The reach of this proposal is holistic which if executed with the proper budget can have solid reach. By having a solid reach, most likely the amount of onboarded developers will be moderate to moderately high. This is a thought out and on paper most likely successful proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Where it falls a bit short is in the project admins. The team in this proposal might seem insufficient but after viewing their website, they have enough team leaders that can act as the core team.

One would be a history/some form of credentials that we could look through to validate indeed they have the technical background and the managerial background to drive this long term project successfully, second would be a history of collaboration between the core team and third would be their other sources/materials they will use to educate and onboard developers. Though what makes this uneasiness subside is their identifying the need to collaborate with WADA. I appreciate the thoughtfulness and thoroughness of this proposal.\n\nIn terms of the action plan, they have done a good job, almost everything is there. Having these milestone events can only be effective if it is followed up by engagement plans. Where they will initiate through a mix  use of Twitter, Telegram and social media which culminates to their hackathon. Budget wise although imperfect, especially the details for the 2 (two) big ticket items; the Regional Meet-ups and University Meet-Ups would have been great if it were more detailed to mirror their action plan.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I enjoyed going back and forth with this proposal. Everything although not perfect, it's almost all there. One aspect they should have considered is documentation as a method of reporting back to the community. This though is not well portrayed in the proposal, not even for one instance. I am assuming the budget for this is lump summed in their 2 (two) big ticket items though it does cause a bit of concern for documentation is standard for these type of events. This though is eased by the fact they are using a bit of documentation in this proposal by attaching a photo of their previous work. What also further eases me is their intent to use GitHub, monitor media coverage and engagement metrics through platforms such as Telegram and Twitter.

There are some challenges or risks stated however I don\u2019t really see the measures employed by the proposer to handle or mitigate them although the bullet 4 is a general mitigation measure, but I think it does satisfactorily address all of the risks/challenges. For example, the first challenge stated has to do with the challenge of walking students through Cardano tutorials but there is no specific mitigation measure directed to addressing that challenge.  Without the measures of mitigation, per adventure these risks arise then it means the project execution will be curtailed.
