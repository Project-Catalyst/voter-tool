This gives students the opportunity to receive Plutus, Atala Prism scholarships and importantly also helps students see the opportunity to start a business and participate in Catalyst. This will help the Cardano community grow stronger and deeper in the Africa region.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Paul Mupenda, Manfo, Nkalla and other team members are all experienced in the technology field. More than that, they are both enthusiasts and are contributing a lot in the Cardano ecosystem. I believe that with the capacity and experience of the group, you will do well in this proposal. A big plus for you is that you have given very detailed and complete information for the community to see the capacity and experience of each group member through the links. It is also a good idea to provide refreshments or provide travel money for students to come to you as it can get more people to participate in this proposal. However, I think you also need to be prepared for the situation where there are too many people involved. If this happens, how will you handle it?", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I think the roadmap you give needs to be more specific and detailed about each stage so that the community can monitor and evaluate the progress of your work. Phase 1 you give in the first 3 months. How long will phase 2 and 3 take? In addition, some expenditures in the $12,000 budget also need to be clarified. Example: $5000 for speaker motivation. Specifically, how will this money be spent? The more transparent you are about your finances, the more the community will support you. The KPIs you give are also very clear and completely easy to measure in numbers.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1213", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Auditability: Phase 2 and 3 are more geared towards support being received from the Cameroon hub's hackathons. Therefore the timeline for those phases is based on their timeline and can be found in more detail in the linked proposals. We tried to make it clear through the proposal that we would be joining the two initiatives and the financial support received through this proposal would be towards supporting DRC participation in these events, plus 3 in person events (with travel costs to cover visit from Cameroon Hub Leads/Trainers). "}, {"id": 2436, "q0": "The core aim of the 'Grow Africa, Grow Cardano' initiative is to increase Cardano awareness and understanding on the African continent. The goal of this proposal is to establish a student hub in Goma to inspire young developers to choose Cardano through conferences and hackathons promoting Haskell and Plutus. Students in Africa, particularly those in the DRC (Francophone), are lagging behind in the development of Blockchain and its usefulness. By 2023, this will have gone a long way toward making Cardano the blockchain of choice in Africa. This proposal illustrates Cardano tech use-case solutions in a straightforward and concise manner. As a result, I am convinced that this proposal effectively addresses the problem", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer is a computer science student with prior Haskell programming expertise who possesses the requisite skills to carry out the idea. Wada's team has demonstrated their understanding and competence in block chain, notably Cardano, throughout time, and they also possess the essential skills to carry out the strategy. The proposer has clearly indicated the kind and quantity of team members required to carry out the plan, as well as a budget that is broken down into smaller parts and suitable for meeting the set goals. A realistic schedule for finishing the work is also included in the proposal, as well as a clear and actionable implementation plan that indicates what is being done and how it is being done. The proposer has considered the challenges that may arise during implementation and suggested possible solutions. Hence, problem solution listed has a high chance being implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal comprises a timeline and milestones, as well as metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) that determine the proposal's success.

By using their own platform Hippocrades it would be easier to make these apps. They would offer guides and tutorials here which would make an app much easier.

The participation of the core team of Hhippocrades will ensure that everything runs smoothly.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Founder Dale already founded a health technology startup. He also ran a soft dev company for 11 years. He can use this experience to further realize this project. The other members contributing to this proposal are not listed. The team has been building healthcare solutions since 2016. The budget overview is unclear. The costs that have to be incurred should be better prepared. No additional resources are required as most of the build continues on an existing platform. A clear timetable is included in the proposal. The campaign costs required to promote this proposal have also not been taken into account. The risks included will be resolved by the Hippocrades core team. The creators already have experience working on their platforms. The team assumes that the problems in this project can be solved internally so that a successful implementation can take place. It might be better to translate the platform and material into different languages spoken in Africa.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team will be using grithub to closely monitor the development of this project. The submitter will make use of a checklist in which you can check off when a task has been completed. When they are all done, everything can be done. It says that the production of the tutorials and material will be divided into the team and posted on the website. It would be useful to mention all the different milestones in this proposal. A short roadmap is available that states what the team wants to achieve in 4 months. This could have been elaborated a bit more for me. The production of these materials makes it easier for developers in Africa to build a health application.

It is important to engage with local stakeholders in carrying out projects that solve real problems in the market, in order to add up value to the ecosystem and have a positive impact on it as well the whole Project Catalyst idea as the proposer states that they are going to encourage students to participate not only as community advisors but also apply their proposals (with the needed help) through Catalyst, which is completely aligned with the challenge settings.

The proposal's plan defined to implement this proposal is clear and sufficient for me. The budget request covers the three phases described, and it is broken down into five clearly identifiable line items. There is enough information provided to enable a proper assessment. As the amount requested varies considerably depending on the local context, I cannot determine whether or not the requested amounts are appropriate. Yet, I understand how they will be allocated, and from that perspective it seems that the task was successfully accomplished. Something i would point out is that, practically, there is no timetable for the proposal to follow but only the definition, which i don't doubt that is very clear, of the phases. The risks and the mitigation of them, as well as the resources needed, have been also clearly described and that is very helpful for the people voting to know.

I really believe that the phase 1, phase 2... roadmap should be changed into a time-defined roadmap and due to the complexity of the proposal, I am of the opinion that the voters need to know when each phase is going to take place. One thing to notice is the way to track the progress of the proposal. Is that the LinkedIn profiles you referred to? Making that clear enough, would make this proposal undoubtedly auditable.
