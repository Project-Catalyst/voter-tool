In terms of meeting Challenge metrics, providing more resources in an important African languages is a good fit. What is missing from this proposal is more clarity about WHAT resources they will be translating --they give some examples, but not even a definite plan about how many of what kinds of resource, just that the overall all number of Swahili \"things\" will total 50. These might be articles \"such as those at Cardano.org\", Videos, Podcasts (which they say they will publish on youTube, so I'm not sure if the videos and podcasts are the same thing, or what the plan is for them. \nI am able to see some evidence of their work at educhainment.com , which looks interesting, but the other links shared are broken or blocked.\nI would not expect to see a comprehensive list of every resource they plan to translate, but a little more detail would give me hope that they have a solid direction, vision, and plan. Just pointing to a primary Cardano website and saying \"Stuff like that\" doesn't inspire me that they have a plan for maximum impact for their work.\nI wish to see more work being doing with Swahili translation, so I hope this team has the opportunity to do the work they want to do. If applying again in future funds, I would like to see more plan and vision for what materials you will be providing, who will be creating them, and what are your overall goals as a team.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Their budget is either 5k or 6k. Either way, this seems like a reasonable budget for translating 50 \"Things\", given what I know about cost of living in east Africa. But -- which is it? The proposal requests 5K, but the budget is for 6K. I have no wish to penalize anyone for a typo, but since asking for money is at the heart of what we are doing here, it's definitely a problem that the budget and the funding request are off by 20%. Furthermore, and unfortunately, I don't think the budget accounts for everything. They mention creating a website \"with articles covering current Cardano-related news, .....\" but there is no clear budget for creating or hosting such a website. Futhermore, it remains unclear exactly what all these resources are -- if they are just farmed from different websites around the ecosystem, then ok, but even researching and identifying WHAT news and resources to translate is a certain type of work, and I don't see this in the budget. \nTo improve this proposal, I would like to see more details of what you are going to translate, where the original content is being sourced from, a budget that accounts for everything that needs to be done, and accurate alignment of the budget and the funding request.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Generally speaking, this proposal aims to translate 50 \"Things\" -- articles, videos, podcasts, and/or \"resources\". They have left it pretty open-ended what those things will be, but at the end of the day, if they can point to 50 \"things\", this project would be pretty auditable.\nI would prefer to see some inclusion of metrics around marketing and reception of these materials.

Indigenes of Africa speak more languages that English which is poplar in the cardano community. However, many resources are available in English, which automatically excludes the other communities who do not speak English. Expanding awareness to make Cardano the blockchain of choice in Africa by 2023 requires that there is access to education and resources in most of the notable languages in Afriaca including Swahili. This proposal seeks to Collaborate with catalyst school to translate and provide education on Cardano and catalyst resources in Swahili language. The proposal aims to work towards making Cardano Community much more available and approachable by creating diversity of Swahili Language Catalyst and Cardano resources and building a communication channel for all of Non-English speakers who are available in the East African Region and are speaking Swahili Language.

The proposer indicated that there were currently no challenges because the team had started implementing the plan and that the team was ready to continue.

However, not just because this is a small-scale project with only the Swahili-speaking community, it does not directly impact the development of Cardano in Africa. Through your team\u2019s experiences in previous projects, we can see the importance of \"language\" in imparting knowledge. And an East African region will bring more extensive projects once people here can access and understand the Cardano ecosystem in their language. The idea and content of this proposal are good, and I won\u2019t argue with that. But to ask if this proposal can convince investors, I'm afraid it's not enough. I think you need to add the total Swahili-speaking population in East Africa for investors to get a figure of this project\u2019s impact. Moreover, the two links for the finished translation do not need to be repeated twice. Instead, add a few lines to describe the comments of the natives on your translation so that the investors can see the quality of your team's work.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "If this project were solely focused on translating Cardano-related resources, I wouldn't be able to demand a detailed plan with lots of activities and clear timelines.

So why is your detailed plan so simple? Furthermore, I see content marketing spending in your budget, but you don't mention this activity in the plan either. Whether the project is small or large, it is the heart of a team with many talented members, so try to show all your seriousness.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Like the Feasibility part, you almost forgot about the other goals and only focused on translating important Cardano documents and the Cardano forum. Not to mention the lack of success goals for other activities, measuring by 50 Swahili resources is still not enough for investors to be interested in this project and for the community to track its progress and development.

Creating content in another language allowing several people to be part of this community is amazing.

Assuming that they don\u2019t speak english, maybe, until today, there are none or few content suggestions about ADA (because just a few or none of content are in Swahili). Therefore a strong marketing strategy is needed here.\n2)\tThe content: Since the proposal is to translate lots of things, how the selection is made has a huge impact in the final result. Therefore, there is a risk associated with this selection. Probably tracing the needs and preferences prior of translating lots of things would be good for this proposal.\n3)\tMonetization: In order to scale this up and not stopping when the fund grows short, probably creating a strategy to monetize and continue with this project.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project is quite feasible for the proposers. However would be good if there was a more detailed budget such: 1) breaking down a little bit the marketing (which platforms, strategy, etc); 2) Content translators (they who will choose the content to translate).\n\nAnother point that should be added is a more reliable roadmap and milestones. Informations like in which frequency can we expect to see a podcast, a translation, etc. You have a 6 months panorama with some expectations but it need to be broken down and have some deadlines and help with the deliverables such as the podcast and the texts, articles translated. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Sharing translated content and having a podcast are two things that is easily seen and auditable.
