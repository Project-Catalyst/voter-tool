Given the recent rise in the commercial importance of NFTs, using blockchain technology to carry out these auctions is also an innovative idea.\n\nWith the success of this initiative, great benefits would occur, charities would be helped and Cardano's technology would gain visibility in a new community in which its projection is still not so great. In addition, specific problems in Africa that can be mitigated through the initiative were mentioned, showing that the proposal is well aligned with this juncture and understands the goal of the challenge in question.\n\nHowever, the amount of $60,000 being requested is high and we note that little information has been given on how the project is intended to be carried out. It is necessary that not only the problem that you want to work on is well defined (as it really is here), but also that the path traced to it is clear.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Regarding the feasibility of the project in question here, it is very important to mention at the outset that, given the information as it is presented here, we could imagine that the project is still at a very conceptual level and the kick-off has not been given. So here's the tip of trying to organize this information a little better so that we can better understand what has been done so far. For example, in the comments below the proposal we can find the link:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1UnmmWtj_5Ejc3g1MBpegx5pmRH-UGBRD/edit\n\nAnd this one has a lot of rich information about what has been done so far, including usability examples; the biggest difference in the presentation of the proposal, in my opinion, are exactly these materials. However, it should be mentioned that, even with an idea that was initially well structured, the steps that must be followed for the evolution of the project were not very clear here. The detailed plan and schedule to be followed by the project only present the information present in the \u201cchalenges\u201d section of the link indicated above, but we were not able to identify clear actions that will be carried out in certain periods of time so that the objective is achieved.\n\nIn the same way, we have a very strong lack of information about the detailed budget description. We just have the description that the budget will cover the main parts of the job, but what would those parts be? What amount would be allocated to each of them? It is critical that a description of how the $60,000 will be used be more detailed.\n\nIt was also not easy to locate the CVs of the main people involved in the proposal to prove the experience of each one of them and how they contribute to the execution of the project. Additionally, it is always interesting that a well-detailed marketing strategy is defined for proposals that need a great deal of knowledge on the part of the public.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Regarding the metrics to monitor the success of the project, we also noticed the absence of better structured indicators that show us whether or not the project is achieving what is expected. Given the objectives of the platform, we could have some indicative parameters such as the number of NFT's being offered in the auctions, the average number of participants in these events, how much movement is being carried out and also the evolution of these numbers, establishing a before/after comparison of what is possible fund contribution.\n\nThe perception of what would be the success of the proposal is described in a way that is consistent with everything that has been presented so far and the team has the clear objective of carrying out an integration between two large markets. It is worth noting, once again, that the central idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal already has a body, and that a better polishing of the information and strategies available here would considerably increase the chances of success of the project.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 6, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2593, "q0": "I really find this proposal very confusing and difficult to comprehend. First of all, the problem stated in this proposal does not align with the challenge. Again,the solution given in the proposal does not align to the problem stated, this is very confusing. I feel the proposer did not get much understanding of the challenge. The idea in this proposal to me clearly has no impact on the cardano ecosystem.\nAlso, the proposer did not give us any information on how demetergift can help seed and grow cardano in Africa, therefore this proposal does not match the challenge at all.

The budget breakdown does not exist, hence no justification of the requested amount can be made. I think for $60K, we need a lot more than whatever the team is showing here. It\u2019s a pretty high amount, but no further information is given about how it\u2019s going to be spent, such as how many developers will work, the distribution for the budget or simply just hourly rates. There\u2019s also no descriptions of the team members with their technical expertise, so we also have no idea if the project will be assisted by people with relevant skills or experiences.
