Your idea is not only creative but also meaningful, I appreciate it. Your project does not require large-scale works or great investments but aims at knowledge - the core to build a future. Moreover, you create job opportunities for your students and indirectly sow potential seeds into the Cardano ecosystem through their solution proposals.

All actions involving the creation of smart contracts, in particular, are carried out on the Cardano ecosystem, which is a significant advantage to the community. It not only broadens the African market but also allows more individuals in Europe to learn about and participate in this diverse ecosystem. . Even in the face of future obstacles, the proposer presents timely answers that, in my judgment, will adequately address such challenges. It would be preferable, though, if they detailed the answer to the task, guaranteeing that students finish the Plutus/Haskell course. It's still a little hazy and doesn't appear to address the issue at hand.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I want to applaud the efforts of the entire team in the detailed and specific planning of this project. They establish two distinct milestones for each action, with the second milestone requiring an output. This is a unique feature and an advantage of this project. Other initiatives normally just provide a single result, which in this case is multiplied by 4, a highly impressive quantity. Perhaps it would be better if they assigned a time frame to each of the milestones they established. To make it simpler to track the progress of the project, it can be based on the length of the course or by months. Furthermore, the funding is spent judiciously for each individual spending item, including rewards for student groups.

If the initiative is successful in the future, it will, in my opinion, benefit not just students or businesses, but also the Cardano ecosystem, which plays a vital part in this project. It not only increases the number of individuals who participate in the community, but it also has a significant impact on the next generation.

The proposers from the European Business University (EBU) plan to continue teaching their haskell/plutus course that is taught over 13 weeks. At the end of the course, the students are given a real-world problem and are tasked with solving it using their acquired knowledge. By providing this course with the challenge at the end, the proposers are teaching students how to code for cardano smart contracts. Additionally, the proposers partner with businesses to provide graduated students with internship opportunities. Up until the very last sentence of the proposal, I was very confused about how the proposers were going to onboard African developers because they made no mention of the fact that they were targeting African students to take their program. However, in the very last sentence of the proposal, they say that the majority of their students are from Kenya. In the future, I would encourage the proposers to build this information into the proposal earlier because it seemed to me that this proposal was just to teach a course, and not to teach a course to majority African students. I would also encourage the proposers to mention how they would get more students from Africa to participate in this program. This way, the cardano community can know that this proposal will directly impact the people of Africa, and therefore, address the challenge setting.

The proposers all have the necessary skills to effectively teach this course to students. Some of their qualifications include haskell instructor, technical administrator, and dean of the EBU.

I can see that they have two key milestones: organizing the hackathon and setting up the internship program. There are also sub-milestones, such as the creation of EBU hubs. However, it would have been nice to have this information in a roadmap with dates so that I would be able to follow along with how much time each part will take. With regards to the budget, it has been broken down well by the proposers. There are prizes for the hackathon, costs per student taught, and other administrative costs. I have not taught a course in haskell, but I think that, given the scope of the proposal and the number of proposers involved, the funding requested is sufficient.

The proposers listed many good metrics of success that can be used to track the progress of this proposal. For example, the projects developed during the hackathon, the number of students who get internships through the incubator program, and the number of EBU hubs created are all concrete metrics that can be tracked by the cardano community. I am wondering, how exactly will these metrics be shared with the community? I don\u2019t currently see a webpage or a specific format that will be used to share the success metrics. I also have one suggestion for the proposers. It would be very interesting to include a KPI on successful projects created and implemented by graduates of this program. Something like a success story page where people can see people just like themselves who took this course and changed the world for the better using the skills they gained. While this metric may take many years to achieve, I think that it could show long-term success of this proposal.

The most interesting thing is that the great majority of the requested budget will remain in the hands of the students' future.\n\n-The proposal presents enough information to verify the knowledge and experience of the team in charge of the implementation of the proposal.

This proposal not only answers this Challenge key metrics in spades, but it also answers a universal situation that Cardano faces and needs to solve, which is the lack of developers.
