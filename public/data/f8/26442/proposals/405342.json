The benefit of this is that it will bring these young people into the Cardano ecosystem while creating an opportunity for the artists to support themselves and their communities from their artwork. I would like to know how many artists stand to be impacted by this project and what plan is in place to extend beyond the SOS villages. It would be advisable that the proposer provides data regarding the technical possibilities of the artists as it pertains to engaging with the Cardano ecosystem. I am uncertain of the potential impact due to a lack of information regarding the initial impact and the potential to scale and reach more artists. It may also be more beneficial to include an intention of education for the children as you mentioned setting up wallets for the children, yet I see no data or plans to confirm that the children will know what to do with those wallets and the potential earnings they receive. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There was a lack of information regarding the team in place to execute this project. There was mention of one other person named Matt. Most NFT projects have a team of around 5-6 people to position themselves to be successful. I am not certain that a two-person team is adequate enough to launch and manage an NFT project involving multiple artists. I see no supporting evidence that the team has the experience to complete and execute the tasks involved in setting up, maintaining, and scaling a project of this sort. The budget is also quite large and appears to be concentrated on internal matters such as visas, travel, accommodations, and equipment. I would encourage the proposer to put together a suitable team of individuals that can function in specific roles as well as develop a clearer vision of what the potential risks are for this project idea.

My experience leads me to conclude that the scope of an idea of this sort is much more involved than what has been documented in this proposal.

This is the initial idea, the proponent intends to bring the art produced by a community of African children into the Cardano ecosystem. He would do this by transforming these arts into CNFTs, building a community on twitter and discord, and configuring the \u201cwallets on the Cardano network. Create smart contracts that give a percentage to community creators in Botswana.\u201d CNFTs would be launched on the market. I found the idea interesting, but this part of only a percentage of the profit going to the artists worried me, who would get the rest of the profit? I think it's a very interesting way to introduce this community to our blockchain technologies, which aligns with the goals of the challenge from the moment that both Africans would benefit (they would learn a new way of profiting from their art and could also get involved in the community in other ways); and Cardano, from the moment that new active members would be added to the community, which would generate popularization and greater investment in our blockchain. So I think the idea is good, it just needed a little more clarity on the part of the distribution of funds so that we understand the real impact for the African community in question. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unfortunately, the project's viability is somewhat low. The information that has been given is superficial. For example, we have a roadmap, which lists the activities that would need to be developed for the project to become a reality. However, the temporal notion is a little strange, for example, what would be done until December 2022? I don't think so much clarity is given regarding the temporal part of the script. Regarding the budget, the total amount is divided into some parts, but I think it would be more interesting if there were more details regarding each of the expenses. For example the vectorization of the arts would cost 4 thousand dollars, but how many arts would be vectorized? And for how long would the professional involved perform this activity? It's not very clear. Finally, speaking of the team, it's actually just the proponent, which worries me, because in general projects with this level of complexity would be better developed with a multidisciplinary team, that is, with different people involved performing different functions. The details on the proponent are also not very extensive, we do not know, for example, how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem, so there is not so much confidence in their preparation to deal with our blockchain technologies. Therefore, I believe that this part of the proposal leaves a lot to be desired and needs to be revised. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I found that the ways in which the author suggests that the process be audited are quite satisfactory, he makes a brief qualitative analysis of what the partial results would be. I also think that it would be better to follow the development of the activities if the script were better organized in time, and if each of the activities was better detailed. The proponent does not make it clear how the information said here would reach the Cardano community, and this point is really very necessary to think about. Finally looking at the final results, I really found the information provided here to be too abstract. It is necessary that we think of more accurate ways of measuring success. This should be done both quantitatively - such as the number of CNFTs sold, how many artists remained involved with the project, how many people were added to the Cardano ecosystem - and qualitatively - how are these people getting involved in the community's activities? How was the target audience, that is, the children's community benefited? How can we ascertain the consequences of this idea both for Cardano and for Africa? I think, once again, that there is a lot to be improved in this part of the proposal. You should outline exactly how the community will have access to all the audited information and you should also think more objectively about how to see if the intended success has been achieved. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9662, "q0": "From the information  given.

NFT being a unique token on the blockchain and its feature  of  its having a proof of authenticity into the digital realm, making ownership of digital asset provable and secured, it means that if successfully implemented , the children and community will have a lot to benefit.
