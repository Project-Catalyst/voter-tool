They did mention how they are part of the Ariob Incubator / Iceaddis program in Africa (which is a partnership with Cardano) however, illustrating their idea more by saying: for example, X country could benefit from Y app because currently their healthcare system lacks Z. Additionally, this would show that they have considered the context, like - what type of training material would the end user of their proposal be more receptive to? They mentioned that they will be creating onboarding manuals and tutorials that will help developers accelerate their learning, but what if they prefer other ways like in-person? Could it then be more useful to train a few people in the corresponding countries to then deliver the training?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Details on the founder indicate that they will be able to implement this proposed work successfully.

They did, however, mention that they typically use Github for both technical and non-technical tasks lists to monitor progress. Hence, this would be a place to identify updates. Furthermore, it is important to note that Hippocrades is a health infrastructure and platform that enables other developers to build more healthcare apps - this is great for the ecosystem and I encourage solutions that could have such a great impact with health system and approaches.

Dale already has a health technology startup. He will lead this project and has run a soft dev company for 11 years. This team has been working on projects since 2016. This team has already established a clinic management system called Mycure. So the team has relevant experience to make this project a success. The budget has not been worked out in detail. There is nothing about the hourly wages of the employees. The cost to promote the project is not included in the proposal. Most of the risks are taken care of by the Hippocrades platform where the team will help when there are problems. This allows immediate adjustments to be made. The program is certainly feasible because a usable platform already exists on which to build. Several similar projects have been requested. Costs could perhaps be reduced by using the same tutorials and digital materials. A budget may then be invested to translate the project so that a wider audience can be addressed.

Success can be checked by checking checklists, so there is always a clear overview of how far the project is progressing.

Hippocrades is a health infrastructure that makes it easy for devs to create DeHealth apps. We'll provide onboarding manuals and tutorials.While Hippocrades makes it easy for devs to use the platform, it has a huge tech infrastructure that can be used for many use cases. Here are some major ones:\nDeploy your own health infrastructure ideal for health institutions, local or national governments\nDeploy a decentralized Health Information Exchange (HIE)\nDevelop health apps or integrate existing ones\nAs such, onboarding can still be improved by providing organized, well-written materials and tutorials.\nSince Hippocrades is now part of the ongoing Ipaddis Incubator program in Africa, this will attract users to try the platform. Thus, having these materials as part of the onboarding process can encourage more developers to create health apps in Cardano.\nThis has made the proposal relatively large. For Africa, the construction of healthcare dApps will partly create positive effects in increasing people's quality of life, thereby promoting sustainable economic development.

By creating content to help onboard African developers, it opens the doors for new minds to enter the cardano space and bring their novel ideas with them. Nobody knows the healthcare pain points like the African people themselves, so by opening up to include African developers who can address the problems they see, it will have immeasurable positive effects for people in Africa too. When users in Africa start to use Hippocrades, they will be introduced to cardano, so that can also open up the door for new cardano community members. Maybe some Hippocrades users will be inspired by this use case and will go on to start their own projects to improve the lives of people in Africa through cardano technology.

It would have been nice to have a little more detail about what would happen in each of the sections within the roadmap. For example, what kind of activities will need to be planned?

The community can know that the proposal was successful if the tasks were completed on time. Additionally, the proposers mentioned that the creation of the tutorials and materials will be a measure of success. I agree because these are actual documents that the cardano community can read, which will allow for strong auditability. The proposers said that they will be posting on a github page to provide a transparent record of their work, so all of this information will be readily accessible.
