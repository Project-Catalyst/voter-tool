We have here that the main differential, in addition to the creation of quality content, is in this platform. Instead of spending and planning in relation to logistics and infrastructure, it is possible to be primarily concerned with the quality of the content being produced and the engagement of the public around it, as there is a whole network already validated by millions of users. With that, we have that this proposal fits the challenge in question, since this content will be produced with a focus on Africa and will be available in languages \u200b\u200bthat are widely spoken nationally. Furthermore, with a good performance of the project, it is expected that more people from the continent will show interest in participating in the ecosystem, including contributing with business ideas. Certainly the project has a good chance of having a positive impact on Cardano's visibility, in addition to being naturally scalable. About the budget being requested of $37,500 we see that it is higher than in other similar proposals aimed at education, but this is justified due to the structure of the platform and the team involved.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Due to the characteristics described above, we expect considerable organization in the feasibility plan. And you can see that this is confirmed. The steps chosen and described in the plan go far beyond the production of educational materials alone. Several techniques are considered to generate considerable engagement in the process, among which we can mention with special attention the diversity of formats in which the materials will be produced, including the participation of local influencers. It is also interesting to see the separation of the process actions into three main stages, starting with the production of materials and even considering at the end an analysis of the results. Another feature that makes us strongly believe in the feasibility of the process is the maintenance of videos on the platform after production. As in most businesses, we know that there is a seasonality of interest in certain subjects. That way, whenever the subject of blockchain is hot, people from the continent will be able to find educational videos on GoodWall.\n\nRegarding the budget details, we found a good distribution of capital among several fronts such as project design, structuring, dissemination and even awards. In particular, we can mention that a considerable part of the funding ($7,108) will be devoted to dissemination, which makes a lot of sense given the magnitude of the target audience to be reached. Regarding the team of professionals involved in the project, we observed that the team's experience with marketing, dissemination and project management is impressive, showing that they seem to be the ideal team to carry out the project. Additionally, additional information from these professionals can still be found at the address provided in the proposal (https://www.goodwall.io/about).", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In line with the entire structuring of the proposal so far, we also found very consistent information both on ways to measure the project's progress and on the perception of success. It is even interesting to see how these two pieces of information are related in this section. For example, impression and engagement were two concepts chosen to measure the progress of the proposal. And when explaining the success, the team quantified these ideas into well-defined numerical goals; 1 million impressions and 30,000 engagements as milestones to reach.\n\nOther information relevant to the auditability of the project can actually be found even earlier, when we see the team's concern to carry out an analysis of results and a survey in the final weeks of the project.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 5, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The Future of Cardano is African.
