However, I regret not to find any information about your experience and skills. I think you need to share it with the community, maybe through Linkerdin, Telegram, Twitter, ... or any website so that the community can better understand you. In addition, you also need to talk more about the risks that could make this proposal unsuccessful. For example, the use of cryptocurrency to pay for goods in some countries is prohibited because it is not allowed to replace fiat money. So does the law in your place have any influence on this or not? Moreover, the integration of payments by ADA, which solution will you use for this? I believe that if you can solve these problems, the community will appreciate it much more.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The roadmap you have given is quite clear, but you need to clarify some financial expenses. For example, $10,000 for a consulting team is to spend on how many consultants? In how long? How does $10,000 label stocks and specific products?... In addition, you also need to put KPIs in a clearer and more specific way in numbers so that the community can easily measure.

They have clearly defined the problem, and the solution, and this proposal would help to drive awareness of Cardano in Africa. The budget includes 10 000: stock and product labelling + distribution via courier and gas costs, so it is assumed the bottles will contain Cardano branding to help spread awareness of Cardano ADA.

It is not clear who the proposer will hire to implement the payment solution, or if they have the in house technical ability to do so, however the technical challenges should not be insurmountable.

Water is very important to people, but the retail water bottles here have high mineral content leading to hydration that affects their health. The idea of \u200b\u200bbringing Ada to liquidity during the sale is a good idea that both helps businesses grow and helps people understand more about the ecosystem running on ADA. . With a simple explanation, people only need a phone to be able to use clean water through Cardano or a reputable website. This challenge both helps businesses grow and exposes the African community to ADA and cryptocurrency so that the community can assess its link to the challenge. The author also highlights the risks and potential challenges that will be encountered.

The budget to which the project applies is $28,500. The author has detailed each expenditure in a clear and specific way. Especially here, I see that the author has a budget of $ 2,000, enough to see that the author calculates very carefully and lists the contingency budget. The proposal is well structured and clear, the budget is broken down into expenditures that I find perfectly reasonable. The group consists of many members who are assigned specific jobs, suitable for each individual. Here I see the author mentioned the fan page \"https://www.facebook.com/Say-Yes-103383311644322\" clearly stating the product's activities on it to increase the product's reliability.

This idea if well and successfully implemented  will have a great positive impact on the cardano ecosystem but the issue am having with the proposal is that most of the implementation plans stated are in the future.  The proposer team are not focusing on how  this is going to be done like the  step to step plans on how the project is going to achieve and the key metrics and goals the proposal is not aligning with the outlined challenge setting. The challenges like the government regulations , the progresses you made so far on how to tackle them etc. You research and findings etc. I will recommend you include this for better chance of having your proposal funded.

The team stated the names of the members and the role they will play in the proposal but there is no well outline experience of the members showing that the team is capable of handling the project. The budget of 28500 is reasonable and broken down into identifiable items but I believe the team can define a more detailed breakdown of the fund e.g USD10 000: Consulting team - IOHK PSG team, I would like it if you go further to explain how many people involved like ( USD10, 000 for 5 members of the consulting team) for a better understanding. A realistic time line of 2, 3 to 4 months and more for the execution of the proposal. Also like I mentioned  above am not seeing a sensible and conductive plan for implementation  that is show me what is being done but how , so I recommend you look into this points for better review.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team provided a roadmap with milestones and a time horizon of only 1 to 4 months without mentioning how to keep updating the community  after the mentioned period of time.
