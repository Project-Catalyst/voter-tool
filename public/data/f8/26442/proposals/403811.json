The success of the proposal would be expected to benefit Cardano and the African community.\n\nThe majority of funds applied for under this proposal are targeted to providing and furnishing a physical location for 7 months in Ethiopia for up to 30 people (free-of-charge) who are interested or involved with Cardano.  5% of the budget goes to creating a virtual platform to support 200 members.\n\nNote that the proposal does not make clear if there will be people living on the premises.  Presumably this is not the case given the target of 30 members would require a large living space?  This needs to be clarified.  \nThe proposal only mentions the second floor of the building being used by members as a co-working area, with the first floor being an open space for cafe and bar.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer lists their experience in operating co-working/living space and a simple timeline for furnishing and living in the premises.  It is likely this basic aspect would be achieved successfully.\n\nHowever the proposal does not specifically communicate any involvement of technically knowledgeable Cardano members whose participation would be essential in helping run a Cardano innovation hub.   The proposer does not list any personal expertise in Cardano blockchain, programming, app development etc, so would be unlikely to meet this need.\n\nThe proposal provides no research on existing demand from the Cardano community for such a space, rather the proposal aims to populate the space by focusing on recruitment through the \"student Ambassador Program\" and \"Cardano Networking Events\".  \nTherefore, it appears unlikely the facility becomes an actual Cardano Innovation Hub given no trained Cardano community members are identified to be directly involved or planning to use such a facility.  \nAs previously mentioned, the success of the innovation hub depends on at least a few, highly knowledgeable Cardano experts being physically involved at the facility, providing guidance on technical issues and facilitating meaningful progress on projects.  Particularly given the likely need for training of student recruits from the \"student Ambassador Program\".\n\nA detailed budget is provided, but it is incorrect in its total of $40,400 USD vs the $37,400 USD applied for.  The budget needs correcting.\n\nThe proposal mentions spending $2,000 to develop a \u201cvirtual platform\u201d but gives no details on what the virtual platform is or how the desired 200 members will interact with it.  Given the existence of free platforms, discord, telegram etc, more detail should be provided.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proposal lists detailed KPI\u2019s that would enable adequate auditability of the success of the innovation hub.  The physical location could certainly be confirmed along with membership numbers and projects started.\n\nThe proposal mentions a goal of 1000 people reached through promotion, but these numbers would be difficult to confirm.\n\nPublishing a monthly report on progress to the community would be a beneficial inclusion.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1614", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3945, "q0": "I love the proposal's objective of spreading information to Ethiopia and developing interactions among members of the Cardano community in Ethiopia. These events, which will be organized by experienced Cardano teams, will be essential in increasing understanding about Cardano in particular and blockchain in general across a wide range of Ethiopian classes, including students, developers, and entrepreneurs. Proposer also provides a unique element to encourage members to support and communicate with one another, which is a board of polaroid images with users' personal profiles and areas of expertise. \n\nHowever, I think there should be more information about the current situation of blockchain understanding in Addis Ababa, so we can better understand the reason why this location will be a suitable place to organize the event.\n\nOverall, I believe the idea will have a positive influence on the Ethiopian community. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal includes a timeline of actions that will take place for the 6-month duration. The money utilization is clearly defined in terms of how it will be spent.\n\nHowever, I think proposer should deliver more information about the structure of a meetup, at least in the first meetups so I can better assess will these events bring good  knowledge foundation for newcomers. Also, marketing strategy to attract more audience should be stated. Lastly, personal profile of team members should be provided more in detail such like links/reference to LinkedIn profile.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The plan offers a specific mechanism for controlling progress and establishes a clear route to achievement. I would add one additional metric to monitor: the ratio of positive to negative comments after the event; this might be a reliable source for determining whether the audience is interested in and understands the idea of the meetups.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1693", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7691, "q0": "Other than setting up a physical space, I find it hard to see what added value this proposal gives to the community. There is no information regarding what materials will be used to teach on Cardano. Just mentions but no action plans to either translate or develop Cardano related materials. It is too focused on setting up a typical co-working space without the programs to support or attract to it.\n\nFurther assessing the blog link provided, would highly recommend the proposer to build on his rapport of having 2 (two) potential programs; Cardano Students Seminar and their First Student Ambassador Program. Build on that, ask funds for that, slowly gaining traction until it's big enough to collaborate further with the Addis Ababa University. Perhaps even submit a joint proposal to reuse a empty area in their university to become a Cardano Hub.\n\nI reckon the above solution would be more acceptable by the community.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "There is only one individual provided to execute this proposal. At the very least, since this is mainly a construction job, it would have correlated well, to whom will this construction job be outsourced to. In the website provided, they mention that this is a group effort but after going through further I could not find any other individuals, making this proposal evermore unlikely delivering on it's plan, yet alone the Challenge setting. The only shining light will be the proposer's LinkedIn link. The individual shows so much potential and credentials but none of those credentials are used as leveraging points in their proposal. The credentials in questions are the proposer's credential as a part of the NGO AISEC (developing youth leaders) and EiABC (Ethiopian Institute of Architecture, Building Construction and City Development). With the latter being something that ironically would be very helpful if stated, in correlation to this proposal's goal.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is no consideration on how will they report their construction project at all. KPI's are mentioned but the majority do not correlate with the budget asked. Highly recommend to attend the Africa Town Hall that just started this March and build from there. From what to expect of Project Catalyst, to the know-how to submit a proposal to building relationships with the African Cardano community.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_635", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9026, "q0": "The description of the problem in this proposal is clear and aligns with the challenge. Establishing a co-creation space in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia- which will be set as an hub for Cardano developers, entrepreneurs, students etc to foster the development of Cardano products in East Africa is a goal of this project that aligns and tackles the critical issues of challenge. I see this proposal bringing much value to Cardano as it would engage professionals and possibly attract them to the ecosystem. The proposal has the potential of increasing its reach in the future. This is not just a win for East Africa but Cardano as a whole.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The information provided about the team and the relevant experience described provides evidence that the team possesses the required skills and knowledge to implement the proposal. The budget has been broken down into identifiable items. However, a challenge I see is that the grand total for the budget is not stated. In as much as breaking down the budget is important, stating the grand total is like wise important so that there can be a better appreciation of the budget. For future proposals it\u2019s good that budget grand total is stated. But I believe with the breakdown of the budget given, it\u2019s reasonable to achieve the set goals.\nI am very impressed with the plan provided because it\u2019s very detailed and easily understandable, there is clarity in the timeline over time.\nThe proposer has also factored in the possible challenges and risks associated in the implementation of the project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap provided is very detailed with clear milestones/deliverables and time horizon. The metrics/KPIs provided here are very clear and I believe that they are good indicators of evaluating the success of the proposal. They KPIs provide us with definite information about the number of members for the physical and virtual spaces amongst others.\nThere is clarity in the targeted problem and the solution, hence I believe that the proposed solution is effective to address the problem.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_717", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10246, "q0": "According to the author of this proposal, there is no space for Cardano experts and enthusiasts to collaborate and share knowledge in East Africa, and given the circumstances among Africa and Cardano's effort to overpower this, i agree with the problem stated. There is a quite clear overview of the hub itself, but not that much of a clear overview of the virtual space, as for that i would like some more explanation. This proposal does indeed effectively address the challenge and it is pretty obvious to me that it could potentially address also future challenges across Africa, but also outside Africa, where there are no means to communicate with other Cardano enthusiasts. Something i would like to be cleared out is why your target groups do not address older aged people with no specific background in the blockchain technology, for them to be able to initiate in the ecosystem.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer does not give account of the skills and experience needed to be able to complete successfully this process even though they provide a website link and a linkedin profile of the manager. The budget has been outlined and clearly broken down into the different parts of the proposal. However, i would say that this is a tight budget in order to get funded according to the current funding mechanism. It is more than a 10% of the fund that's 250.000$. For example, if someone gets 215.000$, the proposal will not get funded for 2500$, even it the assessment score is the second best in the row. An idea/tactic for this, could be to apply for extra funding in the Fund, if that's considered needed. I also do not fully understand the amount of dollars needed for some sections such as the creation of a virtual platform. What kind of resources are needed for this purpose? Also, the type of team members are mentioned, but how many team members will you need? Is that clear enough at that point? The resources needed are mentioned successfully. Last but not least, i think that the proposer needs to make a reference to the risks that may accompany the idea and elaborate on how they would mitigate in that case.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There has been a clear explanation of the key milestones, indicating 5 milestones with brief descriptions, so that the community is aware of both what will happen and when.  Additionally, the reference to a webpage maintained by the team enhances the auditability of the proposal. Unless that's the way of tracking the progress of the proposal, the proposer might need to provide another way of auditing the success. The success metrics are quite bold, which indicates the level of motivation and confidence the team has in themselves. Consequently, in light of my previously described reasoning, I strongly believe that the community will have the necessary elements for auditing. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_861", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "A Hub designed for collaboration; to allow people to share experiences, learn from one another and outsource or seek talent.", "experience": "Running a co-working/living spaceCardano Community Organizer in Ethiopia\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/nebiyu-sultan-30775446"}
