It differs from most of the proposals found in this challenge, because most of the ideas are about introducing the cryptographic universe to the African population, instructing them, providing free courses, scholarships, etc. I think this is very important, as we know that blockchain is still a relatively unknown technology for most people on the continent, being more popular in the United States and Europe, for example. However, it is necessary that we have proposals of a more technical nature, with more specific objectives, as is the example of this one. The idea is to create a platform that works with the issue of data provision/access, with a lot of quality and security, where users (whether individuals, public or private organizations) have a lot of control over what is accessible and what is blocked. in relation to your data. I found that the way the application was explained was very accessible. In other words, we were able to clearly understand how the activities of this platform would work: they can be done in mobile applications or on the web, users would have two ways to provide their data specifically for a certain category (the so-called spontaneous submission of data) or by creating a form that can be viewed upon request... Anyway, everything that says about what would be done and what the user experience would be like is very clear to the proposal's readers. With this, I can clearly visualize the results of the project, which would be to create an \u201caccessible and reliable way of collecting, curating and sharing data\u201d. The proponent says that this issue of data sharing and research in relation to this is one of the most important and targeted issues in the development of the African continent, according to the African Union, so the project would work with a key issue, very relevant to the locality. With this, we can conclude that the proposal would have a high impact for the African continent, benefiting it, since it would address one of the main current demands there, clearly achieving the objectives of the challenge of promoting African economic and social development. And in relation to how all this could benefit Cardano, from what I understand all the data would be recorded on our blockchain, smart contracts would be made, to access some parts of the application (such as the data of someone/some company that they chose to keep the blocked information) people would have to make payments in Ada and etc. To conclude my opinion, I think that this proposal would have a very positive impact on our ecosystem and meets the objectives of the challenge very well. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Unfortunately, that part of the proposal is not as good as the impact. Starting with the script, we know what tasks will be performed and how many weeks on average they would take to complete. However, I think the detail here should be more in-depth, so that we have a more solid understanding of the development process for this application. I will give an example: in addition to how many weeks each activity will last, the proponent could have placed us on when it would start (in which month) and when it would end. For example, in the case of \u201cTechnical Recruitment Team = 6 weeks\u201d, would this start to be developed in May and end in June? If he had explained this issue of temporality better, at what time of year each thing would develop, I think we would have a better understanding of how long the project would take as a whole. It is also unclear whether each task would be done uniquely and when finished the team would move on to the next one or if some activities could be worked on at the same time, by the same or different people. Regarding the explanation of the budget, a very high amount of 140k USD is requested, I think that due to the complexity of the project this amount of money may even be necessary, but it is not understood very well why. This amount is divided into two parts, the first being the team salary and the contract fee. How much would go to wages, and how much would go to fees? In terms of salaries, how would this be shared across the entire team? Would everyone involved receive the same amount, or some less and some more, depending on their training and previous professional experience? How long will each professional work on the project? What will your work routine be like, would each one work every working day, and for how many hours? If this information had been provided, we would have had a better understanding of how the money would be used for the salary issue. As it is presented to us, this data is still a bit abstract. The value of 35k would be used for various things that involve distribution, again reinforcement: it would be interesting to know how much would go to one of the aforementioned parts: \u201cServer and Database, Token Release, Promotion, Release\u201d. Now speaking of the team, we know what kind of professionals would be working here, but we don't know details about them. In fact, we don't have information that allows us to know this team in a basic way, because we don't know their names, we don't know their professional resume, how they got involved with the Cardano ecosystem, we don't have social media profiles like linkedin, where we could get to know them in practice... We don't know who these experienced iCog Labs developers are. Therefore, I think that the feasibility of the proposal has a lot to improve and deserves to be reviewed. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Project auditability is good, although not perfect. We can work here on two sides: that of the development process and that of the final results. Regarding the development process, it is said that progress would be made available in an online project management tool, such as Trello, for example, in addition to github. If these platforms are constantly updated and freely accessible so that any member of the Cardano community can access them at any time, I think the auditability of the process will be well ensured. Regarding the final results, we know what the specific objectives are for a period of time considered shorter and a longer one. It is positive how this information is passed on, as it generates a very solid view of what is desired as a result of this project. However, I would like to make a few more suggestions. The objectives are the complete development of the application, in addition to some quantitative goals such as more than five thousand users in the first year, more than a thousand spontaneous data submission entries and so on. Indeed, it is necessary for us to have knowledge of these numerical facets, but I also think it is important that we know what the qualitative impact of the whole thing was. It would be nice if the proponent, together with some key members of the team, could establish contact with some recurring users of the application to analyze if everything is working properly, for them to carry out general research in order to understand if the issue of data access , once a major problem for the target audience, is being performed satisfactorily. Whether this facet of African development is indeed being improved and has been significantly boosted through this project. This information would need to be collected by the team and provided to the rest of the Cardano community, either through the apps already used to monitor the process or through different means such as synchronous meetings in Town Hall, for example. With this, I believe that the proponent's suggestions on how to audit the project would be increased and we could be more confident about the final impact of this investment. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Thank you for the feedback. On the Feasibility part, you asked why I didn't include dates. \u201cTechnical Recruitment Team = 6 weeks\u201d, would this start to be developed in May and end in June? Well, when you work on proposals, of projects which have not started, you will always use weeks. Because the actual starting date is not defined. In our case, for example, we didn't started the project. Yes we have been thinking about this for too long but we didn't. We will start when we have the budget. So Week 1, w2, w3 is how you plan the time. If we got the budget in May 1, then 6 week means June 14.\n\nSecond, tasks are done simultaneously if the time line is the same. In our case for example \n\nRecruiting Technical Team= 6 weeks\nDesign and system Arctecture= 4 weeks\nMVP= 40 weeks\n\nThese means the whole time period is 40 week. Out of this the first 6 week is team recruiting, then comes design and system Arctecture etc. Yeah I agree I should added further breakdown like Back end development, front end, Database, etc. But all these and further details are under MVP. \n\nSalary is for permanent team members while contract is for one time. Amount cannot be the same and it varies depending on specific skill, experience etc. \n\nLast, the cost is high because this is a real commercial product which involves lots of features. The scope is very wide. In truth, if you go to software companies and ask for the price (using this proposal), you will get minimum quarter a million and max 1 million.
