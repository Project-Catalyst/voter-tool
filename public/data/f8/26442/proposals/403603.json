Therefore the proposal does not meet the Cardano requirement of the challenge - adding no value to Cardano.\n\nThe use of the name \u201cTesla\u201d should also be clarified to avoid confusion.  The question should be answered plainly - Does this project have any relation with Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla?", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I strongly disagree this project is feasible for the following reasons.\n\nThe proposal gives no information about the team, size,  nor provide any track record of expertise or accomplishments.  Detail needs to be provided about the team in order to evaluate their ability to meet their goals. \n\nThe video provided in relation to the proposal is a CGI portrayal of what an electricity generation structure on a river would look like, but provides no information on the basic principles of how they aim to generate electricity.  The video provides no assurance of the team\u2019s knowledge on electricity generation. \n\nThe project\u2019s website states \u201cTrue Tesla Technologies will install the first pre-production hydropower generation system by mid-2020\u201d in Mauritius, but provides no evidence of accomplishing this despite that being nearly 2 years ago.  There is no evidence provided of any work completed in Mauritious.\n\nThe appropriateness of spending cannot be evaluated given the proposal\u2019s lack of budget information.\nThe proposal mentions that operational costs are 9000 USD per month, but provides no budget on how the funds would be spent.  It is important to provide a specific breakdown on spending e.g. wages, materials, compliance costs, surveying etc.  \n\nNote that the proposal says its technology costs a similar amount to comparable technologies but lasts 2-3x longer, but fails to provide evidence for such a considerable claim.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proposal does provide a basic roadmap including the implementation of a working electricity generation system online in Mauritius by May 2022, and a completed survey of a location for a similar plant in Madagascar by March 2023.  However, no detailed KPI\u2019s are provided.  No information is provided on the stages of construction of the facility.  Insufficient information is provided to enable adequate assessment of the proposal\u2019s progress.\n\nThe roadmap itself appears unreasonable.  It seems very unlikely the facility could be built and operational right at the beginning of the budgeted period (May 2022) given the size of the construction works required as evidenced in the CGI video in the proposal.  \nThe remainder of the budget period is filled with comparatively insignificant events \u201cinauguration\u201d of the facility July 2022, \u201cConference on Tesla's Technology for Africa\u201d Dec 2022 and surveying a site in Madagascar March 2023.

First, the proposer also raised the problem that the people of Africa are facing and then introduced his solution. However, the proposer can clarify 'avert situations that are current on the River Nile' so that voters can better understand the problem. Proposer introduced the solution in quite detail when introducing the features, functions, and strengths of the solution. In addition, the publisher has clearly stated the positive effects of the solution on the lives of African people. Proposer also thought about the risk that the project might face and provided a solution for that. This will help reduce the risk to the project.

Proposer should add more specific steps to the proposal, for example sharing more steps to implement Mauritius system online and delivering energy. Providing a detailed plan helps people better visualize the project steps and thereby have more confidence in the project. The information for the budget section is too sketchy, the proposer should list additional monthly expenses for the expansion to Africa instead of just giving the cost without providing the name of the expense. Moreover, the information of the project members is not clear. Proposer should add additional information such as the members' names along with their education and work experience so that people can easily find out.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Proposal just shows what the team will do but has not been able to specify that.

The idea of developing the Hydro Power Plant (HPP) and expanding the river network in Africa is a big idea and makes a lot of sense, to be honest. And your project has fit in the GROW AFRICA side of the challenge, but what about the GROW CARDANO side? What I received after reading this proposal was just a desire to promote the development of Africa, but I did not see any explanation regarding how this project will have an impact on the Cardano ecosystem. As for the part Impact introduced to the project, I have nothing to comment on. The proposal is made very well because of the wording and providing information. I can feel your big dream for Africa's prosperity. But keep in mind that this project needs to be linked to the challenge, and it's a shame that I haven't seen that yet. I regret to give this part 3 points.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "At this point, I will not consider whether your project aligns with the challenge anymore but only evaluates the content and presentation. But unfortunately, you cannot convince me. There are many vague things in the plan, budget, and the team members' introduction of your proposal. You only mentioned the system in Mauritius once in the Impact part and didn't even say what it was like but put it right in the detailed plan with a specific timeline. Furthermore, what activities does the $9000 you suggest for the project budget be spent on? And most importantly, how can investors believe in the success of a project where the names of the two scientists involved are unknown? Please consider adding more information to this part to clarify the project\u2019s feasibility.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are no KPIs, no specific metrics, no clear goals, and no detailed roadmap to track. This last part does not seem to provide any necessary information. Besides the word \"will\" that you use, is there anything else that can build investor confidence? Do you want success to be encapsulated in the word \"understanding\"? You say you will provide a valuable overview of the way forward, but even if this project can make it to that step, I don't dare believe it anymore.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1666", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Undoubtedly, Africa today, no matter how developed, continues to exist apart from the rest of the globe, with very slow and dismal development. As a result, generating power from the river in Africa is a rather safe choice. It can be observed that, in addition to supplying power to consumers, the project also helps residents in the surrounding area with their agriculture. This is fantastic news for the inhabitants of this area. Unfortunately, I couldn't uncover any connection between the project with the Cardano community. As a result, it is difficult to demonstrate how it would affect the Cardano ecosystem, which might easily lead to the project being rejected. Furthermore, the proposer stated that the relationship with Mauritius would fix the problem but did not specify how. The project has a very nice goal and function, but without such essential ideas, I will give the proposal a 3 out of 5.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Overall, I'm with the approach and schedule outlined in the proposal. They provide explicit deadlines for fulfilling each minor objective, which is likewise fairly feasible. However, in the case of the aforementioned budget, the reverse is true. Instead of just mentioning $9,000, they should produce a list of what needs to be spent and how much it should cost. Failure to identify such will make it difficult for investors and proposers to evaluate the project's success and determine whether such monies are appropriate for operations. Furthermore, they have Pr2 scientists on staff but do not identify them or provide information about their name, experience, certifications, or qualifications in the project. This can easily lead to difficulties recognizing the persons participating in the project, how much work they put in, and they will miss out on the opportunity to be commended if the initiative is successful in the future.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "My suggestions for this part will assist the proposer in noting some things and adding more. To begin with, there is no set time limit for completing each project task. It's simple to miss the deadline, it's possible to get overburdened with work if it's completed ahead of schedule, and it's easy to fall behind since it's not completed on time; these are the major hazards of not having this exact timescale. Further, the proposer should offer detailed information on the persons or households that will be able to utilize it when the first hydroelectric dam is constructed. This will demonstrate the team's resolve while also assisting investors in keeping a close check on it. Specifically, I have yet to discover the possibilities that it will offer to the Cardano ecosystem in the near or far future.

Of course, energy generation for regions without electricity is a good initiative, but there is no utilization of Cardano tech and no correlation to how the Cardano Ecosystem is going to be further developed.

The link provided to shed more light on the ability of the project to actualize did not provide any of such information.
