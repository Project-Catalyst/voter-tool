As their solution explanation, I think they have a clear vision and mission about what they will do to help the community. The plan is divided into two important groups that impact the SPOs and Catalyst project community. The proposer showed us the detailed activities, components that their programs will help and impact these communities. Moreover, the proposer also provides some key KPIs that I believe they're really aligned with the challenge settings. One of them is the number of African projects seeded in 2022, this will impact the Cardano ecosystem in 2022. In addition, some numbers of interactions in the social media channel are also their focus key KPIs.

From my experiences, their activities in each time frame of their roadmap are suitable with what they want to make in the solution session. With these outlines, I think this roadmap is detailed enough to measure and audit. It also helps us assess the budget is reasonable. But for assessing easier to people who have no experience in these types of projects, the proposer should explain more the detail of position they need in each scope of development in the roadmap that relates to. For this, the proposer explains which position is needed for implementing the plan of this project with some of their key person that I believe they can help this project to be successful. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I hope that the proposer can provide some tools to help us track their key metrics in the future. The key metric and the successful image that they provide are fully for the community to audit their progress and they're all very easy to understand how they're connected to the main plan. Moreover, this proposal is the next phase of their old proposal in the fund7. So I think we can believe in their ability to develop it.
