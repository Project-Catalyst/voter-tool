The training of 100 Mathematics teachers to teach functional programming for the Cardano blockchain will undoubtedly promote the interest and participation of Africans in the Cardano ecosystem. I appreciate you sticking to the challenge's KPIs to highlight this project\u2019s link with it. However, \"hope\" is not the word to use in the proposal of a serious project. You must describe the content to show what results from your project produce and whether it is consistent and in sync with the KPI/Key metrics of the challenge. So, if you are unsure which KPIs, don\u2019t add them to the body of the proposal and focus on presenting KPIs to which the project is directly related.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "First, I will evaluate the topics you do well. Your plan with a clear timeline will build investor confidence. The detailed budget and members' list listed in detail and full of information are also a plus point for your proposal. Moreover, the expenses are also very consistent with the activity items in the plan. But, I still have a piece of advice for you. An excellent detailed plan needs to show a reasonable plan not only in terms of what they will accomplish but also how to do it. And it's not the same content you copy as the project's KPI. Please consider and revise to avoid investors misunderstanding the seriousness of your team.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Since this project only focuses on training 100 math teachers, it is understandable that the quantitative numbers mostly revolve around \u201c100\u201d and the time of training.

However, I can't give this section 5 points because you still make the mistake of copying the content of the two parts above and don't have many groundbreaking sentences to attract investors' attention.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1666", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3951, "q0": "The aim of proposal is to provide an online course to teach math teachers about programming language, thus onboard new developers in Africa as a result for this training of math teachers. \n\nI think there is a risk that teachers might not be capable of learning and understanding all the fundamental of programming. The proposer does not say which level of mathematics teachers' competency is, and traditional math is really different from programming language, which includes technology and new trend that teachers might need a lot of time to get familiar with. \n\nOverall, I think the teachers will gain a very basic idea about programming language in the 3-month course, that's a good foundation, but they need longer time and training to finally participate in Cardano project and make an impact.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan outlines a schedule of activities that will take place over the course of four months. The use of the money is clearly stated in terms of how it will be used. \n\nHowever, I believe the proposer should provide additional information about the course structure and the major topic so that I can better judge if this course will provide a suitable foundation for instructors. Each member's personal profile is linked to LinkedIn, and while they appear to be competent in education and technology, they need to show more experience in blockchain in general, and Cardano in particular.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap outlines a clear path to success and provides a defined approach to measuring progress. I would add one more measure to track: the ratio of positive to negative comments following the event; this might be a good source for judging whether the audience is engaged in and understands the course.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1693", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4257, "q0": "It seems that besides focusing on training programming programs for math teachers in East Africa, the project also targets students here. This is an excellent concept since it will build a deep passion and interest in functional programming for the Cardano blockchain in the kids. It may seem far-fetched, but it will almost surely have a beneficial influence on the Cardano ecosystem by boosting the community's fan base and opening up new markets in east Africa. However, the risk section is still short, making it difficult for the proposer and team members to cope with any issues in the future. As far as I can tell, there may be obstacles such as ensuring that schools make it a mandatory subject or, if it's a sub-subject, ensuring that the number of pupils enrolled completely meets the conditions outlined previously. Furthermore, they announced the selection of 100 math professors but did not disclose selection criteria. They should think about hiring based on experience or reputation to identify the ideal individual to learn about Cardano and be able to communicate it effectively to future generations and colleagues.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "With the intention of completing all activities of the project within 4 months, it is divided into extremely logical and clear sections. There is a lot of work to be done in the first two months overall, therefore it would be preferable if they divided it into particular months or quarters to accomplish each project activity. This reduces the likelihood of the entire team becoming overburdened or not functioning on time. Furthermore, fees for certain goals ranging from curriculum creation to teacher training are clearly mentioned here. Even the team members are skilled individuals who have worked on every aspect of the project. Additionally, having communities like Python or Nairobi Ruby would tremendously assist this effort, assuring that they will accomplish numerous achievements. A strategy is made in great depth therefore I am completely satisfied with what is written in this area.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Finally, for the project to be completed smoothly, it is essential to provide a detailed operating schedule. Proposer has done a pretty good job in this section by listing the activities in a certain order and in accordance with the development progress of the project. However, in my opinion it would be more perfect if they added a certain period of time so that investors could assess the level of development more appropriately and easily. Also, I appreciate their mention of the positive impacts of the project on the Cardano ecosystem, a plus for this. Not only does it help them get scores from investors, but it also ensures that the project will accomplish what the Cardano community has come to expect from this project.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1713", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9659, "q0": "From research it is widely  know that most of the Africa's education and training programs suffer from low-quality teaching and learning. Training 100 teacher to focus on teaching Mathematics computationally will go a long way to improve quality of teaching and learning. But am yet to understand how this program is going to be implemented successfully . In the information provided the program it's a 4 months program starting from May which I believe is school section meaning that the teachers will be busy with their students and you stated that you will encourage them by giving them incentive term learn and earn program which is a good move . I will advice you include part of the holiday period in the program  to encourage the teachers to participate more , also during the school section you should include weekends and some days  of the  week so that the program will not affect more of their school work thereby the stress and also improve their participation to the program. I recommend you state the teachers like is it  grades class or college or tertiary institutions mathematics teachers etc. The team provided their experience which I thing given the opportunity they are capable to carry out the project and also the proposal clearly articulate how it will add value to the cardano ecosystem.

The budget of 20,000 USD is reasonable  given that they will give incentives to the teachers to encourage but the budget is not well outlined  and broken down  for instance \nTeachers establish Cardano clubs where coding using Haskell is taught and practice teachers incentives 5000 , there is no statement  of how much each teacher is getting  as an incentive  etc. There no statement for additional funding. The timeline provided which is 4 months is realistic enough to complete the  project.  The team also provided the technical aspects I.e the technology needed for the implementation. They also considered the challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation.
