The number of purely African participants would be considerable, as they would be a large part of the public and the organizers, and the idea fits well with the questions of novelty and adequacy, since in the city there is not a good circulation of information about the community. The continuation of this project, which has already taken place in other African locations (such as Ethiopia) would be very positive, reaching the specific objectives of the challenge as it would disseminate knowledge about the Cardano Ecosystem. I believe that for Africa this would be very beneficial, as those involved would be exposed to a sea of \u200b\u200bpossibilities and opportunities; if they are from the technology area, they can seek to learn about the various technologies of our blockchain, such as the Plutus programming language, and with that, both education and future jobs will be the result of meetings, that is, an alternative would be presented source of income for them. If the participants of the events were not from the technology area, they would also benefit, as our ecosystem has a place for everyone, either through work as a CA, or through jobs that are not necessarily for those who work in the area. computing/technology, such as vacancies for game narrators, designers, writers, etc. While the Cardano ecosystem also benefited greatly, as this would generate a dissemination of our blockchain, more people would come to know about it, perhaps this could be reflected through some indications of the popularization of the blockchain such as Ada number purchased, NFTs minted , digital wallets created, Dapps in development and etc. This is all the more interesting given the following quote: the proponent says that \u201cIOHK implemented a course last year in Accra to teach Haskel to 80 students. As this course takes off and your students with it, there is the perfect opportunity to synergize with networking events that have already proven successful in Ethiopia.\u201d In other words, the chosen location is strong ground for future professionals working for Cardano. With this, I believe that the proposal is of high value and fits very well with what we are looking for in this challenge. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is average, but the impression I got is that the proponent saved a lot of details in relation to the explanation of this part. There is no roadmap here, in fact what we have is a short text that summarizes what would happen if the proposal were funded. However, in order for us to accurately visualize the development process of this project, it would be necessary to prepare a detailed schedule. We know that the project is expected to last 1 year, I think it would not be necessary to include the complete roadmap with details of all these projects (although it is ideal), but it would be interesting if the organization process of at least 1 of these were detailed events. In this schedule, all the activities necessary for the development of this project should be described in detail, and separated by weeks (in this case, it would be 1 event per month, from what I deduce). Then we could know what would happen in week 1, 2, 3 and 4 of that month. Who would do what, how and for what purpose. In this way, the understanding of the process would be much more specific than the current one. Regarding the budget division, it is also done in a basic way, we know the approximate cost of each event (how much would the speaker cost, the rent of the place and etc). But two things crossed my mind here: wouldn't these values \u200b\u200bvary according to who was speaking, and where the event would be held, etc? And the translation part, which is optional, if that money wasn't used, where would it go? Regarding the explanation of the team, this part is satisfactory, we know who those involved are and their professional occupations. However, this part could also be better detailed. We could have a better developed curriculum on each, so that we could get to know their previous experiences more richly; We know your linkedin profiles, so we can verify what is being said. The role of each one in the project could be clarified, this is a bit abstract too. I would like to know more about the involvement of those who already have proposals funded by Catalyst, such as what role they played in them, etc. So I think the feasibility is good, but it could be even better by adding a few more details. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability here is good, but it could be even better, from my point of view. A few more ways could be traced to perceive the success of the project beyond numbers. The proponent states that he will monitor whether the proposal was successful or not based on indicators such as the number of participants in the events, as well as the number of views on the content posted on youtube recorded on the day of the meeting, number of interested parties in the course launched by IOHK and etc. And the overall success would be if the local Ghanaian community explicitly increased their interest in the crypto world and especially in Cardano. I agree with these statements, but would like to suggest that a further survey be done with each participant of the events, so that we can understand if they are taking the Haskell course, or if they are participating in Catalyst, who knows if they became proponents, launching their ideas so that maybe they will be financed... It would be interesting to know if they shared the knowledge acquired in the events to more people, that is, if they helped to increase this current that we are trying to create, specifically in the African continent (as well as in India and Asia East, which are the target geographic locations for other challenges). In this way, we could observe, in addition to the number of people affected by the project, how they were affected. It is also important that we follow the proposal development process, not just the final results. The team of professionals involved needs to give some feedback to the Cardano community in a sporadic way, this contact can be done by preparing reports after the end of each event, saying how was the pre-production and the event itself. Was the speaker able to communicate well with the audience? Was there a translation? How many people showed up? These and other questions could be clarified. I think that in this case, a written report is the simplest and most objective way to update the community about the progress of the project, it could be sent to our telegram or discord channels, for example. In short, it is a very simple proposal to audit, just that this connection between the Cardano team and community is built and maintained throughout the process. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 7, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The 'Grow Africa, Grow Cardano' initiative is such that seeks to increase Cardano knowledge and awareness across Africa This proposal indicates that there is a lack of interest in and engagement with the Cardano community and project catalyst in West Africa, particularly Ghana, so the goal is to host monthly networking events managed by the Defi Discussions team with the goal of expanding the scope of projects to include west African countries, beginning with Ghana.

Though I think it would be better if the author mentioned more information about these events such as the total time of each event, what the keynote speaker's part would cover and what impact would it have How, and who will participate, and how large, what will attendees get from the event. and what they will do to be able to establish a network that engages more people in their community and fulfills the commitment to DeFi. the challenges they mentioned were finding the right speakers, ensuring the right venue, and the security of the event. In addition to the challenges they raise, I think people should provide more about their response to these challenges, such as listing some criteria for choosing a representative or preparing a security team to monitor the event... and I think listing the options to deal with the risk will help the reader see the investment of the proposal.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I find the project implementation plan rather vague, as this is a one-year project so I think they should provide more stages more clearly to help everyone understand the implementation process and feasibility of the project. I think they can plan the first events, and in the meantime, they will focus on adding, discussing, and agreeing on the development plan, because there will be no certainty when If the funding is provided, or the funding is delayed, the later planning will also prolong the project implementation time, in addition, there should be a plan to find speakers and how many speakers are needed. And planning also helps the project implementation go more smoothly and can anticipate risks if any. In addition, they should also clearly state what each event will cover and on what scale Due to the roadmap is not specific so I find it difficult to compare the budget with the plan. Especially in the marketing section, I think to be able to present more transparently, the author should write in detail what activities need marketing and how to be marketed. What does technical service include? how much does each event include, what does food service include\u2026About the project team, including professional directors, Founder of Defi Discussions LLC Project Manager & F7 Fund Recipient, IT and security specialist, marketing manager...

This easily leads to the plan taking unexpected twists that even the proposer did not predict. The solution proposed to link Cardano enthusiasts with each other may be viewed as part of bringing the Cardano ecosystem closer to Africans in order to promote and expand the number of users. However, failing to highlight its impact on consumers in Ghana is a significant omission that must be addressed. Proposers should emphasize the project's positive benefits on users in order to persuade them to participate willingly and truly motivate them for sustainable long-term success. In addition, the mentioned risks can be considered as major challenges, demonstrating that the proposer has done an extensive research to make conclusions about such challenges in the future. However, no solutions to that problem were offered. The proposer should conduct more studies in order to come up with the best answers.

The proposal provided to solve the problem is brief yet understandable and acceptable. However, it is advisable to set up a certain period each month to arrange, either at the beginning of the month or at the end of the week.
