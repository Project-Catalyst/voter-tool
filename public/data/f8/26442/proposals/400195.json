I like the idea about  RFID Chips in the oracle part, however there are still many unknowns and questions, in traditional factories and stores, these chips are widely used to make production line efficient, moving these data on chain available facing many challenges too, how are you going to clear up and  what information you should/shouldn't push to chain? How do you scale it up, and how are the dapps interface work together? etc.. I understand the proposal is in a very early phase of the project, and I also believe that given these questions ahead, it worth trying and definitely doable. I'm looking forward to see detail solutions on this part in the future from the proposer.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding to what's proposed here only, the audit is clear to me, it's more about building the factory and production in the local with a  traditional fashion, a foundation for the on-chain boarding, each step is auditable and verifiable.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1165", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 1, "ng": 8, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 475, "q0": "The problem explained is in line with the general challenge since Industrialization in Africa needs to be taken to the next level and more so quickly and one of the most important pillars for such a blockchain is decentralization.\nAfrica can boast of a large populace and enough human resource who, if given the chance, could transform Africa as China has done over the years with their human resource advantage. This proposal has clearly identified the problem within the challenge and also clearly articulates how it is going to affect the cardano ecosystem since in the long run, next to building new Factories and businesses running on Cardano, they plan to also enable collaboration with other local entities such as fabric producers, training entities, local construction companies, local logistics companies and so on. The integration of both industry and blockchain would revolutionize blockchain and build truly blockchain based industry models only available on Cardano. The metrics show a great potential for the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Firstly, Leapfrogging Industrialization is a project on the back of another project and some of the deliverables have been completed even before asking for the funds. \nWith regards to the team as well, the expertise listed and the well detailed profiles of the members shows that they are capable of delivering. The budget touches on 10% of the total amount they would need for the whole project and that is what scares me a bit since there is no surety but hope that they would be able to raise money for the rest. That is what I think compromises the feasibility assessment. \nAmount seems reasonable but just too rounded for such a project. I would be interested in them sharing the actual amount before showing the approximated amount.\nThe selection of strategic contributors also gives them an advantage since their profiles show them to be experienced in their fields and their addition to the team would go a long way to help the project come to a success.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The problem is well described and so is the solution.

I hope next time you will take this great idea to a more suitable challenge.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Antonia Lorenz, Matthias Guilbert, Carolin Baltzer and their associates are all people with a lot of experience in this field. I have full confidence that you will do well with this proposal. I appreciate the fact that you give very detailed and complete information about each member of the team. This will help the community get to know you better. In addition to political risks such as political instability in Uganda, I think you also need to include more other risks that could affect the probability of success of the proposal. For example: To build a factory requires a lot of materials such as iron, steel, etc. Currently, the escalating price is also a big problem related to cost. If this problem occurs, how will you handle it?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I think you need to be more transparent about how the $50,000 will be used? $5,000 for construction planning like? How much is $40,000 spent on land? $5000 spent on specific training like? You need to be more transparent and detailed about these expenses so that the community can better understand. In addition, you also need to be more specific in terms of numbers so that the community can easily measure your KPIs. For example, how many products will be sold? How many employees will be trained? What is the revenue of the factory?... If you specify in terms of numbers, it will be easier for the community to imagine the success of this project. I hope you will do better next time.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1213", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 1, "ng": 8, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2405, "q0": "As we know it. To develop a country, the first thing to do is to develop the industry of that country, the fact that the industry in Africa is much lower than in other countries makes the economy in Africa impossible to develop. fast. With the idea of \u200b\u200bsetting a new standard for highly efficient, sustainable, and decentralized manufacturing in Africa. I think this is a very good idea. Here I see the group that raised the issue that Africa's population is high but most of the people are working in the informal sector. The work is informal and mainly they move to the cities to get a satisfactory job. I found the issues presented by the group well suited to the challenge, it answered most of the questions posed. As a result, I find it very well-suited to scale to address challenges. with the solutions that the group has raised, which is to build a new, decentralized economy, set up the greenfield project to create a sustainable economy. it solved the problems in the challenge by bringing the Waya ecosystem consisting of three different types of Autonomous Aggregation to operate the Factory using Blockchain and Cardano as stated in the concept, with a series of solutions legislation has been put in place, which I think is very suitable for economic development in Africa. The solutions that the group offers have specific evidence, arguments, and research, besides, the group also points out certain risks that may be encountered. Countries in Africa are not completely stable and also offer methods to address such risks.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "With the provision of plans and timelines, I found the team outlined specific timelines to be completed in four quarters, with plans laid out for building and operating production and business facilities. First developed retail business in Uganda. I think the above timeline is reasonable to complete the set tasks. However, I find the progress of the project is not easily tracked by the community. With a budget of less than 20% of the challenge's budget and having been divided into 8 different categories, I find such a division to be reasonable even though the team is very confident in its ability to raise capital. But I think there should be backup plans in case more budget is needed, in the group member information section I see here the group has listed 7 members. and has assigned specific tasks to each member. Team members are architects and CFOs with many years of experience, their identity can be easily verified by Community Watchers I think with such a team the team will be easy achieve certain success", "q1r": 4, "q2": "when asked about the measurability and development of the project. I see that the group has stated quite specific measurement indicators, with 6 indicators to be achieved as in the above project. I feel that is enough, the success of the project has also been clearly described. It is a Cooperation with Ugandan and international training organizations and land acquisition. I see the success of the project as very related to the challenge in the campaign, in particular, is that the project has been tested before and has achieved considerable success. This project is a continuation of a previously funded project that has had some success but it is a project that needs to be tackled for a long time I hope it will be more successful in the future.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1486", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3522, "q0": "This proposal is aligned with the challenge and offers and effective and smart solution. It has the potential of having a very strong impact in local communities, by creating jobs and, therefore, stimulating the adoption of Cardano. By using different local suppliers, it also increases Cardano's local reach. It is smart to start with a model factory to stablish its brand and creating trust, to later expand. The risks are well-thought, and the ideas to mitigate them are very valid.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It is a bold project and requires a big budget. Since it depends heavenly on other investments, it could be a risk as it not a sure think.

You did a great job, to be honest. And I have to thank you for showing me such a great idea introduction and sticking to the challenge. You know how to lead the reader from the African background to describing the Waya factory and defining how it works. Your outstanding leadership makes the connection between Waya Collective and Cardano clear. You stick to the challenge\u2019s KPIs and specifically analyze each item. And since you've put absolute seriousness into your project, you're well aware of the challenges ahead and offer compelling solutions. However, I still want to give you a little advice. In my opinion, many proposals make the mistake of a good opening with too much information but then let the following two parts slowly narrow down. Therefore, I think you should put information related to quantitive numbers, future goals and human resource allocation in the following two parts. Depending on how data is distributed, your proposal will be more balanced and not lose interest at the end.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Waya Collective is a large-scale project with great potential, so of course, it has to start with a small base to refer to the market and demand. First, the proposal outlines an action plan for the main factory\u2019s appearance as soon as the small business is booming, and I see the enthusiasm of your team with 4 development milestones. But if only you could add a few lines to describe how your team will perform these tasks and the technology allocation. Second, the project's proposed budget is well intended with item-specific costs. Although this budget only accounts for 10% of the factory\u2019s total cost, your team is still confident that it can raise the remaining capital from private investors. I understand why you have that confidence because with a group consisting of talented and experienced members alike in the proposed proposal, I also have faith that your project is definitely will be successful.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Just as I had feared, your proposal became a flash in the pan, with a grand opening and a few lines at the end. Milestones to be achieved and only one KPI, of course, cannot help the community have a direction to track the development of your project. Because if your project is funded, you must regularly notify the community and show them whether the project's development is in line with the goals and metrics you have set from the beginning.

From the start, the proposer provided a panoramic perspective of Africa's underemployment market in order to persuade the audience that the app was the appropriate match for development at this moment. Building a prototype garment factory in Uganda, a developing country with agriculture as its major economic emphasis, is a novel initiative that will attract employees. Proposer also has a separate section to talk about the impact on the Cardano ecosystem. Waya Collective is a DAO on Cardano that will open up thousands of job opportunities for people in Uganda in particular and Africa in general. This ensures that people in Africa and other countries will know more about Cardano thanks to the importance of the community in building the operating system for the new economy. Last but not least, risk management solutions will, in my view, guarantee that the project avoids needless risks. I especially like when seeing the solution expanding to other nations as quickly as possible to prevent dependence on Uganda, which is politically unstable owing to poor governance.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Once again, I am overwhelmed by the brainstorming investment as well as the proposer's time to be able to make a specific plan for this proposal. The project is planned on a quarterly basis, with various goals that are perfectly appropriate for the implementation time. With the objective of finishing the project in 2022 and part of the work for the first quarter finished, it shows that the proposer is ready to carry the project forward at any moment and assures that the proposal will achieve what is intended. In addition, the cost needed for the project is also outlined in detail with a specific amount. This will definitely help investors, as well as team members, manage their spending more rationally and honestly. In terms of the workforce, they are all well-known individuals in the industry associated with the project, holding various positions. The brightest light for this initiative is architect DAO, a venture pioneer at the impact-driven firm builder Ampion Ventures, who is working on supply chain solutions in Nigeria. With previous experience, the architect will bring make the most suitable suggestions for the development of the project", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In comparison to the preceding parts, it appears that the auditability section is a little short and has fallen short of expectations. In general, the proposer demonstrates the project's development and success in a reasonable manner. However, this part would be more comprehensive if the proposer included information such as the number of workers employed or the number of persons that attended the factory modeling consultation. It may not be required to provide particular data, but it is essential to approximate the numbers to assist investors incorrectly assessing development progress. Moreover, it is recommended to add time after each growth phase.

They have talked about what the success would look like to them in which they clarified some milestones that need to be achieved.
