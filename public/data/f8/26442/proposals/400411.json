This proposal identifies a need for a standardized framework and material for Workshops, particularly those that can be translated into many languages, and its purpose is to provide professional slides and practical guides that can be translated and utilized to deliver workshops across Africa. According to the proposer, educational material addressing the fundamentals of blockchain technology and how Cardano fits within it will be developed. This will contribute to the objective of making Cardano the block chain of choice in Africa by 2023 by increasing blockchain knowledge and promoting additional development and use of the Cardano blockchain in Africa. This proposal presents a Cardano technology use-case solution in detail. The challenge is adequately addressed in this proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provides evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal.

The project will provide a standard and professional content template for the short workshop. Personally, I strongly support the team's point of view and believe it is a good idea to contribute to the development of the Cardano African community.\nThe features that the project brings are presented in the form of a schedule for the seminars. Each activity is logically divided by day and by time corresponding to 2 parts including basic knowledge and practice. The structure of the project and the functions it provides can both be clearly visualized. But I can't seem to see how this project impacts the potential audience and what changes the project brings to the Cardano ecosystem. If possible, elaborate on technical aspects or use case studies as examples.\nThe project has identified desirable outcomes. These results generally meet the key metrics of the challenge. The contents of the proposal are also quite detailed and easy to grasp. Viewers can imagine the potential that the project will bring to the community in the future when it is completed.\nMost of the risk that the team predicts is due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. But the team also planned solutions in advance to minimize the negative impact of those challenges on the implementation of the workshop.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Proposers have come up with a very detailed and meticulous project implementation plan. Roadmap divides each milestone logically. Each timeline outlines the tasks and work items to be completed in great detail and explains the requirements for each item as they are completed. It will be more convincing if the project specifies the job positions and the number of personnel required to operate the workshop.\nThe budget plan is divided into sections corresponding to the items to be invested. The spending plan is presented very clearly with bullet points. All costs are transparent. However, I think in order to increase the persuasiveness of the proposal, we need to clearly state the part of the funding used to pay salaries for the number of staff implementing the project. The purpose is to give viewers a better overview of the actual project expenditure and show that the proposed cost is appropriate for the solution development of the project.\nThe project is led and developed by DMITRY SHIBAEV who has many years of experience in the field of tech delivering large scale projects and investment. Pre-existing DMITRY SHIBAEV activities also bring high efficiency in work. This increases the trust of the project and confirms the potential the project brings to the Cardano community.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Project KPIs should be presented with specific numbers.

On boarding needs tools to help new members to learn about the project. The idea of essentially producing \"canned\" content arranged as in person seinars or meet-ups is an excellent kind of approach. I would guess all Local Community hubs will be able to take these 4 day seminars as a core. Adding whatever material they want. Finally the material can be seen as a starting point, the heavy lifting for others to use. Localising the language, as appropriate.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The detailed work you have produced suggests careful thought and understanding of in person events.

We need to help expand the Cardano ecosystem but also benefit Africa and its natives, the projects funded here need to have these two facets. In this case, this project can be perfectly summarized by the passage \u201cprepare professional slides and practical guides that can be translated and used to carry out the Workshop in Africa lasting 4 to 8 days\u201d. The proponent states that there is no material that is suitable for being translated into several languages \u200b\u200band presented both to a more lay audience (the first days of the workshop) and to the more technological ones (who, according to the author of the proposal, will study how to build in Cardano, use cases, about smart contracts, and more in depth). Therefore, I think that the idea aligns well with the objectives of the challenge, since if this workshop is translated, it could help to introduce what is blockchain and what is Cardano to a wide audience, in the same way that it can help those professionals from the technology area who think about working with the opportunities that our ecosystem offers but don't know exactly where to start. That is, without a doubt, this proposal would benefit our blockchain, helping it to become more popular and widespread. The question here would be, in this case, how much this workshop is aimed at the African public, how much the classes would be adapted to the specificities of this community. We know that the workshop would be created in English and later translated into other languages. However, when doing a quick search on which languages \u200b\u200bare most spoken on the continent, I came to the following results: French, English and Arabic are apparently the most widespread dialects there. Therefore, I think that perhaps it would be necessary for the workshop to be translated at first into these other two languages, as there is already a lot of content about Cardano in English (in fact, the language barrier is what most hinders the broad democratization of our blockchain) . Therefore, I don't know if it would be interesting to launch this project purely in English, in my view the objective of benefiting Africa would be better contemplated if the proponent asked for a little more funding and already made the materials available in Arabic and French as well. A very positive point that I would like to highlight is how detailed the workshops are already presented, this demonstrates a lot of planning and mastery of what is to come. So my only suggestion is really to cover the language range better. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal script is perfect. We know exactly what would be done and when, as the bidder details what will be done each month and specifically the planned activities by week. In this way, we have a full understanding of the project development process. Therefore, in relation to the schedule of activities, I have no criticisms to make, in my opinion it is excellent. Moving on to the next point of analysis, regarding the budget, the price of the project is based on the amount charged per slide (25 euros each). I found a very high value, however, we do not know how many hours the professionals involved would dedicate to this project, so we have no way of knowing if it is a fair or exorbitant value. I think it's up to the voters to decide their opinion on this, because explanations we have, we understand how the approximately $6500 requested would be used, the proponent also clarifies in great detail how the funding will be spent in practice. Finally, regarding the team's presentation, in this case, from what I understand, only one person (Dmitry Shibaev) would develop this project. On the one hand, there is a lot of trust in him, as he explains extensively what his previous experiences are, we can see that he is a person who has already developed many tools and he attaches the link so that we can verify in practice each of the technologies previously developed by he. We also know how he relates to the Cardano ecosystem, so we have a lot of confidence in his ability to run this project successfully and smoothly. However, I am concerned that the team is formed by one person alone, because I think it is always necessary that, for example, a designer be present, especially in these projects aimed at producing material to be disseminated. As important as knowing about the quality of the content created is knowing how it would be presented. It would also be interesting for someone who understands marketing to be on the team, to help multiply the reach of the slides that will be created. Therefore, I think that, despite being a fully qualified person, it would be more appropriate if he worked together with other professionals as well. Therefore, the feasibility is very good, but there are still things to improve. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding the auditability of the process, I believe it is perfect. Generally, my suggestion is that monthly reports be made with some KPIs indicating how the project construction process is going, and that is exactly what the proponent suggests. So, once again, I have no points to criticize, as I absolutely agree with what is proposed. However, talking about the final results, the proponent outlines a very basic success scenario, which corresponds to the main objectives (that the slides are made and that the community gives positive feedback). However, I believe this is the basics. We need to go further in the way we monitor the results of this project. It would be essential to know: a) where these slides are circulating b) which languages \u200b\u200bthey were translated into c) approximately how many people would be having access to them d) how these people would be putting into practice the knowledge acquired in the workshops. Have these people become active members of the Cardano community? Are they getting Ada, buying NFTs, using our Dapps? What is happening in relation to the ecosystem, and how has it impacted their lives and the lives of those around them? It would be essential for the proponent to evaluate all this, build a final report and make it available to the Cardano community (this can be done through the same means of communication that he will use to send the partial results reports). Therefore, I believe that auditability was considered excellently when it comes to the process, however, regarding the success scenario, the proponent was very superficial in its analysis, requiring a real deepening.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 4, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "African really needs resource materials for it education outreaches.

It actually has so much embedded in it. The proposers have identified the lack of a standardized template and content for Workshops that can be translated into other key languages as a major challenge. This I wish to state is actually a big gap with regards to drumming home the gospel of Cardano. They proposal that they will use educational materials to write fontent covering the basics of blockchain technology and how Cardano fits into it is a great one. They stated that they will be prepared for a workshop spanning between 4 to 8 days where the basics are covered for those who don\u2019t know what a blockchain is and up to the point where the more tech minded participants set up a Cardano node and learn how to interact with it and run smart contracts. I however suggest they could make it two weeks instead of the 4 to 8 days to allow for better comprehension.
