The organization selects and supports (up to) 5 companies to integrate Cardano into their business and develop use cases: $10,000 Need to be more specific on how this money will be used. You also need to be more specific about KPIs so that they can be easily measured in terms of numbers. Example: How many companies are trained in blockchain and Cardano? How many entrepreneurs will use Cardano in their business?
