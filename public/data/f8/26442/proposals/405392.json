The organization selects and supports (up to) 5 companies to integrate Cardano into their business and develop use cases: $10,000 Need to be more specific on how this money will be used.

Overall this proposal has met and aligns with the given challenges. Starting with the help of Impact Hub to make this program a success by having more than 16,000 members, the accelerate2030 program becomes more relevant and very likely to happen. Then, look at the big plans to expand Cardano's reach and its sophisticated, especially on the blockchain system, starting with conducting a survey on African which I think is very important to do to find out the interest and satisfaction level of each participant, both entrepreneurs and companies that will adopt blockchain. this system. In addition to the virtual workshops that have been conducted very often, the method proposed by Accelerate2030 regarding the formation of a group of 3 people to conduct in-depth case studies is very relevant to broaden their knowledge and implement it immediatly on that cases. Perhaps the idea is to empower a variety of teams to come up with those specifics, but if so, that should be clarified, with additional detail provided regarding how the teams will be directed or motivated to accomplish the objective. What's more, this proposal is also aware of the challenges and risks that will be faced starting from the untapped potential of the blockchain system and the difficulty of conducting surveys if the survey takers do not benefit from it (so only the surveyors get insight from this survey).

In addition, the project roadmap provided is quite good, although the timeline has not been explained in more detail in weekly or daily units about what they do, but in the monthly concept it is sufficient to explain what they do. The interesting thing that I got is that there are outputs and main deliverables to remind them and conclude about what they will get from each activity they do. What is quite unfortunate is the budget breakdown which is very shallow and not detailed at all considering the background of each member who is already well-known for each field. They should have broken down more from \"Design, Launch & Analysis of Survey: $5000 \" to Design --> $1000, Launching --> $2000, etc or even more broken down about who did it, how many hours a day, how much is the salary, how many people are working on it, how many survey designs are there? and so forth. It's a huge project, so it needs a lot of publicity to reach the public. Regarding the steps that would make up the entire project, the authors specify very well what would happen in a given period of time. It is always beneficial to draw a timeline of activities to be completed, in parallel with the success achieved over the months, as they do in great detail.
