Is there a study to understand exatcly how many Portuguese speaking people there are in Africa? Is it taking into account that each country has its own dialects, and that not everyone is fluent in the country's official language?\nI am genuinely interested in understanding if those question were answered while writing this proposal.\nMoreover, I think that, for a bigger impact, marketing should have a bigger focus on the project.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I like how the course content is ready and it seems very complete. \nI don't think 1 month before the classes start is enough, mostly because there needs to be time to promote the course, engage students.

In order to effectively market or spread the knowledge on Cardano to all the people of the country, translation of the content of Cardona to local language is required and is the most effective way to reach a larger group of people. In this case, the local language would be Portuguese, which is very huge community and they are very proud of the language. Hence translating the contents of Cardano in Portuguese would reach a lot more people than expected and also be appreciated for translating into Portuguese. Most of the people are educated in their local language and might face difficulties in English, by translating the content to Portuguese it would benefit a lot of people in getting familiar with Cardano and also the advancements of it.

Bringing the blockchain world to Portuguese speakers in Africa is the same as to bring it to, roughly, 14M people. \nHowever, there are some points that I should add in the risk management:\n1)\tMarketing: Since this is a new world and probably there are lots of people who are unaware of it (and therefore the search engine never shows this kind of content), it must be allocated here. That said, it\u2019s mandatory a strong marketing strategy. And since you\u2019re looking for people who are strong in maths, maybe consider to contact some universities or some student group (like in Brazil we have the \u2018diretorios academicos).\n2)\tInternet: I\u2019ve read a lot in the Catalyst proposals that there are several areas in Africa which the internet is very poor. Therefore, taking it into account when sharing the content might be interesting, providing more than one media (video, PDF, etc). Creating more than one access method to allow as many people as possible.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Everything seems to be prepared and appear to have been thought a lot about.\n\nOne thing that I noticed is that you are planing to have 10hour content having 19 contents (not easy ones).

Maybe creating a Q&A in which everyone can answer and, therefore, you can stimulate every attendee.\n\nAnother aspect that might be more explored is the filming and editing. Maybe hiring a professional would be the right choice (they can create editions which will engage your public and film the best way possible)\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Everything well written and easy to follow.

It also good to know that Q&A is taken into account. If well done, this will help the engagement of the community.\n\nIt would be imporant, however, to have stated in the proposal an aproximate number of how many people in Africa speak portuguese. It is mentioned the countries who does but some numbers could be provided to fully assess proposal potential impact. Another imporant data would be the percentage of these population with internet access in Africa, as it is the continent with most limited access to it and the course will be online. For instance, according to statisctics from the World Bank (IBRD), only 36% of people in Angola use internet (source: shorturl.at/crEG2), which could limit the goal of this proposal.\nIn addition, I wonder if uploading content in an existing course platform was considered. I know it could raise costs a bit, but using an existing platform could save proposers time and help people finding the course, as these platform already have subscribers.\n\nMoreover, countries in Africa have different cultures and, as I understood, proposers are brazillian. Even though the language is the same, it would be imporant to know how overcome distance and culture barries to better communicate with people there and make them engage. This would be a risk that is essential to mitigate. In the same sense, the communication/advertise plan could be better ellaborated here, also including who is really their target audience (STEM students? people who work in tech companies? recenty graduated people?).\n\nLast, I'd also include here in the proposal how this course would differentiate from other courses already available in portuguese in this subject. Maybe having one specially developed for Africa helps, but it would be imporant to know what is included in this special developement that others dont have. This would help to make the value proposition more appealing.
