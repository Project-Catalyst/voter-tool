The proposal is about creating a platform with several pools, where people can invest in weekly bets, and part of the profits and fees from each pool will go to non-profit organizations that seek to work for the conservation of the environment. I thought this idea was very smart, because: people wouldn't be betting on these pools just for the environmental cause, of course, once they know about this facet of the process, they can feel even more captivated to participate; however the ultimate goal is to profit. And that is sure to attract a large audience. Therefore, this proposal aims to fund a platform that can be beneficial to the Cardano ecosystem in a number of ways; first of all, once people become users of this platform, they will know about our blockchain, its possibilities and advantages, so the objective of expanding Cardano will be directly contemplated. In the background, this project will certainly have a very positive environmental impact (if everything is correct), because, as I have already explained, the purpose of the thing would still be to make a profit (on the part of the users) and indirectly the environmental organizations will benefit; with such improvement, it is as if they were receiving investments and will be able to develop their activities with more tranquility, fight for the protection of wild life and species at risk of extinction and so on. In other words, the proposal is a great idea and perfectly meets the two main objectives of this challenge, which are to benefit at the same time the Cardano ecosystem, attracting new people to our community, increasing the purchase of Ada, delegation in pools, as more people know Cardano the purchase of CNFTs would certainly grow as well; new digital wallets would be created and likely new people would participate in Catalyst, such as CA, vCA or bidders. And the second objective of the proposal would also be contemplated, which is the benefit of the African continent, whether in the social, economic or environmental sphere (as in this case). Therefore, I think that the proposal deserves maximum marks in terms of impact. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal roadmap is ok, we know which activities would be developed and approximately how long it would take. The problem I encounter here is the lack of specificity. In other words, information is passed on in a very abstract way. The time periods are very long, a bimester is a lot, I would like the activities to be separated at least in monthly intervals. Now talking about the activities themselves, I think they are just mentioned, when the ideal would be that each one explained in detail. For example: \u201cbuild release team (8-12 people)\u201d. How would this team be chosen? Would it be the people mentioned in the team part right here in the proposal? I counted less than 12 people mentioned, so if you are going to choose other professionals to embark on this project, what would be the selection process? The proponent mentions that they will seek to work in partnership with Wada, a well-established group in the Cardano ecosystem for having launched numerous proposals in the African challenge with the passage of funds. Could the other members be from there? Anyway, I would like each activity to be detailed more precisely. Now let's talk about the financial division, a total amount of 25 thousand dollars is requested, which is a high amount, but compatible with the complexity of the project. The explanation of the need for such an investment is quite rich in detail, as the total amount is divided into some parts (for example, 2500 dollars for legal and administrative part, another 2500 for development resources and so on). Each part of these has a small explanation of what would be done, in this way, it is possible to understand more accurately why such an amount of money is needed for the development of such activities. Therefore, I believe that the script part is very well covered, and the way it is presented to us, we have no doubts about the need for such an amount of investment. Regarding the team, I think this part of the proposal is very good too, we know who the people involved are, their names, areas of expertise and some information about previous experiences. It is very positive that it is such a multidisciplinary team, that is, we have people from different areas of knowledge involved here, and in this way both the technical parts and the design, marketing and etc will be well assured. My only two suggestions regarding this part of the proposal are: the detailing of previous experiences could be more in-depth; ideally, everyone would attach their linkedin profiles, not just a few people. Therefore, I think the feasibility of the project is great, with only a few small points to improve. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Regarding the development of the process, we have some indicators that can say well about the progress of the proposal itself (TVL, total number of users, size of the award and total number of contributions provided) and also about how the project would be reflected in NGOs and on the environment directly (tracking statistics related to climate conservation and endangered species conservation, which will include statistics from the Black Rhino funds directly). This is generally what I advise you to do: a monthly survey of all variables, so that we can understand not only how the activities and work routines of the professionals involved are taking place, but also how partial results are being obtained. However, it is not very clear how this information will reach the members of the Cardano community. How will these reports be shared with everyone? Are they posted on google drive, or on telegram and community discord channels? Regarding the audit of the process, this was the only question that remained pending. Now talking about the final results, the success scenario is outlined with quite specificity, as we can see from the following excerpt: \u201chaving a large engaged online community, a fully functional protocol on our platform, several successful project launches in collaboration with our non-profit partners and be able to generate and provide significant funds each month to non-profit organizations. endangered species and climate conservation organizations around the world\u201d. The proponent states that such information must be measured, but again, it is unclear how it will be shared with members of the Cardano community. He says that they would work in partnership with Wada, as I said, and also with the Cardano4Climate group. It would be interesting to establish a dialogue with these two teams in order to understand how they bring the results of their efforts to the community in a practical and direct way. There are several ways to do this, such as video calls in Town Hall, as I said, online sharing through google drive, telegram or discord, in short. I think that the proposal is very auditable, it just needs to be clarified with the community Cardano can actively participate in this auditability. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2553, "q0": "This proposer is trying to solve a never ending cycle of human impact vs climate & animal conservation between the two by utilizing Cardano Non-fungible tokens to fund efforts with non-profit organizations starting in Africa. The solution to the problem can add significant value per volume of the NFT sales portion which would be Cardano based and educating the public on a more serious problem in the world we live in today. Cardano based NFTs are still just a year into their infancy, but the growth potential seen in 2021 really opened the possibilities to entrepreneurs and content creators/artists/businesses that could benefit in more real world applications through sales of NFTs found on the Cardano blockchain and other crypto platforms, and in this case non-profit organizations. The key metrics and goals proposed are that a team of individuals will take on the challenge of growing a community within the Cardano ecosystem that gears it's NFTs sales towards like-minded individuals in congruence with conservation efforts of wildlife, particularly African nations where their is a strong presence building off of the Cardano Africa initiative. The proposer does address the future challenges but not necessarily does the best job of outlining a plan to scale, i.e.: is there a targeted cost to the NFTs creation? What does a Wildlife Conservation NFT look like? and how much will the minting price (ADA holder cost) be for said NFTs? This information would be more helpful to include while also understanding the supply and demand from the community based audience that may or may not be interested in such an endeavor. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer shares and provides some evidence to references via website for the project as well as team members with relevant skills and experience via LinkedIn profiles adding the amount of years within their applicable career fields of interest. Besides the members shared, it is not clearly defined what tasks these team members will be in charge of throughout the project's outline or what they're capable of in regards to the solution of the problem. The budget is rather vague in setting aside only $2,500 USD for Development Resources, which will ultimately manage the NFT collection. This number is perhaps too low but without further details to what the non-fungible tokens will consist of (animated or static images, tokens or coins) it's difficult to gauge this amount as (un)realistic. The legal and administrative costs do seem reasonable for ensuring Black Rhino will be a lawful project moving forward. Which brings the largest portion of funding being allocated to Marketing and Promotion (80% of funds requested). This portion dedicated to marketing and promotion is the most ambitious amount, focused on building a social and community presence within the Cardano ecosystem. The proposer states there are three experienced advisors working with the existing team; Having those advisor's experiences referenced within this proposal would allow more indication towards the overall success of the project. With conservation and climate partnerships outlined as part of the first months of progressing through the timeline, will these partnerships be using any of the available funds from this proposal or adding to it? What type of marketing and social media tactics will the funding be used for? The proposer may or may not be aware that building a community can take a massive amount of time and effort, not just funding promotions & marketing. Establishing an online community of this caliber (10k+) with members willing and able to afford or even interested in an NFT is extremely difficult for the most seasoned creators in the space. This may very well be the most challenging given the timeline that's outlined (accelerated?) as the ambitious number could take much longer to acquire. How the proposer plans on doing so is not clearly defined beyond a reasonable doubt.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Measuring the success and auditability of the proposal, these factors will solely depend on the promotional aspects and the efforts of building a strong community, making partnerships and finding investors within the Cardano ecosystem and NFT communities. Launching of the NFT tokens is a great way to indicate the community interest. With that set to happen between May-June 2022, it may just be too optimistic given the current state of said community interest without a solid following via Twitter or discord, NFT sales are practically no where near a launch-able date. The roadmap could be altered and pushed back if funding was approved which could allow for the proper amount of time for the Marketing and Promotional portion to be used wisely in accordance to solving the problem proposed here, ultimately creating a strong online community for a non-profit NFT sale which will fund conservation of wildlife sanctuaries. A successful launch of Black Rhino project is detailed as continuous real-world impact and contributions towards non-profit endangered species and climate conservation organizations. The proposer has stated these impacts will be measured on the ground through monthly and annual reports tracking data. If the team can deliver a better social presence within the Cardano ecosystem, it could possibly deliver it's solution to the problem while simultaneously helping preserve nature and endangered species throughout utilizing blockchain technology and the ever growing non-fungible token community.

The proposers are partnering with African non-profit wildlife conservation groups in order to make an impact on the wildlife conservation crisis. This proposal represents a key cardano use case because the blockchain meets the sustainability goals of the proposers as well as provides a blockchain to host their NFT-related fundraising system. There will be numerous partnerships with different organizations, sanctuaries, parks, zoos, and local communities to help raise funds to benefit the African people. Cardano has the capability to provide a mechanism that can raise funds to not only protect African wildlife, but also help fund communities as well. Creating partnerships with African organizations can also open the doors to onboarding African members into the cardano ecosystem. If they happen to hear about this project, they may become inspired to create their own cardano NFT collection and mechanism to raise funds for their own good causes. One thing to note is that I don\u2019t believe there are currently any African developers on this proposal team, but one of the big components of the challenge setting is onboarding African developers. Would the proposers consider bringing on African developers who have better knowledge of their communities? Onboarding some African developers would make the proposal even more in line with the challenge setting. (score given: 4)", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Given the information provided, I believe that this proposal will be successfully implemented. The proposers all seem to have the necessary skills to successfully complete this proposal. For example, there are members who have multiple years of experience in business development, engineering, product management, and many other relevant fields. The proposers have laid out a well done roadmap. They have broken it up into 2-month chunks with specific goals and plans outlined for each of those periods. The second period seems especially ambitious, given that they hope to raise over $25,000 for wildlife conservation organizations as well as launch 2-3 NFT projects and start a community of over 25,000 people. However, if the proposers are able to work efficiently, they could pull this off in only two months. I would recommend for the proposers to make sure they can get all this work completed in time. With regards to the budget, the proposers have listed the main categories that they will be spending funds on. It is pretty clear where the money will be going. In the future, I would encourage the proposers to include a little more of a breakdown for the $20,000 to marketing and promotions section of the budget since it is such a huge sum of money. For example, providing some examples of campaigns or methods to be used for marketing would have been helpful. (score given: 4)", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Given the information provided, I believe that this proposal can be successfully audited. The proposers have listed easily trackable/reportable metrics that they will share with the cardano community to give updates on the progress of the proposal. For example, their monthly contributions to wildlife organizations, the number of African organization partnerships, and the local impact on wildlife habitat and wildlife populations are all metrics that can be recorded and reported. The proposers also mentioned that their end goal is to majorly impact endangered species, which is something that can definitely be tracked by organizations on the ground. Statistics will be reported in monthly and yearly amounts. Additionally, the metrics related to their NFT projects are a good indicator of success because the higher volume the NFT project has, the more revenue that can be sent to wildlife organizations. I would highly encourage the proposers to maintain good accounting records that can be reported to the cardano community.

As we will see later, the project's action front is well defined and ample tools are used to achieve the conservation objective. In this way, it is easy to see the positive impact on Cardano's ecosystem that the success of this project would bring. According to what was mentioned in the proposal, we also see that the actions to be carried out would help to fulfill several SDGs. In relation to the amount requested, $25,000, we see that it is a viable amount given the steps that will be carried out and the professionals that make up the project team.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A point that contributes considerably to our belief in the feasibility of the project is the constant proximity of the team to the value of the proposal. The explanation of all the steps makes it clear that the objective is to promote environmental conservation and protection of endangered species; but we can also notice that the strategies on how to accomplish this objective are well defined. For example, partnerships with other existing projects operating in Africa, such as WADA, were established, demonstrating that the team understands the magnitude of the problem, and that it is not possible to solve it alone, even with a very complete team. And on that, we can mention that the professionals have great attributes that increase the chances of success of the project, in this context we pay special attention to the fact that the team has a good experience with marketing, and also software development. Additionally, it is possible to find the resumes of the professionals involved through the LinkedIn addresses provided.\n\nRegarding the description of the actions to be carried out, we noticed a good temporal organization of these, with the stages being segmented into quarters throughout the year. It is even nice to note the concern, already in the first quarter, in forming communities on social networks to promote engagement. We also found well-defined targets on the expected value to be captured by the pools over time, which demonstrates a lot of organization. By the way, in relation to pools and protocols, we have that this is a central theme of the project to promote the raising of resources that will be destined to the assisted organizations, and in line with this, in the detailing of the budget, we can see that the greater capital expenditures will be focused on the project's treasury and DeFi product development.\n\nThe project's well-structured website also helps to convey trust and facilitates attracting investments.

In the feasibility explanation, it is possible to note the establishment of quantitative targets on how much the fund is expected to allocate at different times, for example, in the fourth quarter of 2022, it is expected to raise $50,000 to support conservation organizations. Furthermore, an expected number of members in the online communities was also set, 50K. In addition, a clear understanding of the positive impact of these actions is demonstrated, through what was transmitted in the perception of success. In this regard, we can pay special attention to the fact that the team expects, within 2-3 years, to have contributed to an increase in the number of individuals in the endangered species.

When compared to existing conservation financing schemes, what contributors receive in return are virtually entirely souvenirs or spiritual gifts; this is not a bad thing, but it is obviously frequently used, so there is nothing new or interesting. On the opposite, the proposer's offer in this project is to assist bettors in obtaining some of their money back through the aid. It may be not a great deal of money, but it signifies two things: first, bettors are still formally sponsoring non-profit organizations, and second, they gain a different perspective on giving and receiving. Even the suggested solution to the problem has demonstrated to benefit many individuals, including organizations that have always turned their financing around and sponsors who have always had greater access to information via the Cardano ecosystem. Of sure, this will increase Cardano's popularity in the African market. Dealing with predicted risks also makes the project simpler to manage.

Furthermore, stating a figure such as Online Community of 10k+ would assist the entire team to have a clear direction and purpose. The members of the partnership demonstrate that this is a squad with many years of expertise in many professions but a particular connection. In particular, (Professor) \u2014 Advisor: Co-Chair & Director of the Sustainable Energy Initiative International Renewable Energy Academy, a prestigious and well-known position, is clearly helping the project's smooth running.
