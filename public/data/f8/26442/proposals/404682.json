Indeed, for a good  product to reach out to large audience, there is a positive need to market it well to be patronized. Even though Cardano may be known, as clearly identified by this proposal, there is a clear need to better push Cardano and its related parties to the door step of South African students, developers and politicians. The proposal seeks to register additional value to the Cardano community with the hope that there will an increase in the quality of project catalyst coming through from South Africa, increase in the number of Cardano development participation and an increase in the number of individual interest in Blockchain with Cardano as the choice. I am satisfied with the impact session as the proposal has noticed that there might be challenges with legal regulations and as such will devise a platform for consulting Lawyers and building relationship with Law students as this will be an advantage to introduce them to Cardano ecosystem as they guide the team  to better position the project properly within the South African Law\".", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Feasibility Assessment: Rating of 4\n\"With reference to the attached pictures and the introduction of Wada, Catalyst School and Kaelo Lentsoe, I believe, given the necessary guidance and resources, it is likely that the proposal will be implemented in a grand style.

Also videos as a prof of topics earlier discussed as a a team should have provided in addition to the pictures neatly attached. The proposal outlines a realistic timetable to execute the project when funded just that, waiting for a whole three months after receiving funding to put up the program will be too long and will create a space for relaxation on the side of the organizers and will also affect budget.
