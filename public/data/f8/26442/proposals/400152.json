In short, it involves mobilizing 500 people in 8 African countries, all French speakers; these people would be from different branches, such as the press, developers, entrepreneurs, etc. thus mobilizing the French-speaking African population to integrate our community. If this works, surely the challenge objectives would be achieved. We know that the goal here is to promote projects that help both Africa and our blockchain. This proposal would certainly benefit the continent, since, with influential people from different fields knowing basic concepts of the cryptographic world, this knowledge could be spread to a good number of people. This would generate better education about Cardano, breaking down preconceptions such as \u201ccryptocurrency is something to get rich quick\u201d, since people would know about so many opportunities and projects that are born in our ecosystem, which has the greater truth to make the world a better place through of projects that dialogue with the humanitarian goals of the United Nations. And obviously this would have a clear reflection of the Cardano community if the number of Ada holders increases, as well as digital wallets, NFTs being minted on our blockchain, Dapps being developed and etc. The challenge here, as the authors themselves know, would be to captivate people to the point of being interested in what we have to say, teach and show about blockchain. As I mentioned, the prejudice on the subject is very high, one thing is to call Catalyst CAs to a workshop about our technologies, and another is to draw the attention of an influential journalist from country X, who already has his whole work and life routine solidly established, to stop his daily life to learn about something he may not trust. Proponents explain that they would circumvent this problem through the act of \u201cidentifying high-profile individuals in governments and cooperating with them to reach key people\u201d. It seems like a good solution, but I would like to know more details on how this would be done. How do they intend to captivate these individuals in governments, by the way, who would these people be? Which countries are we talking about? The proponents cite the name of some cities in feasibility, but not all. Anyway, the idea is a lot and it can certainly be promising if it works, only this problem of \u201cgetting attention\u201d is what occurs to me here. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "From the script provided, it seems to me that the whole process would take about a month and a half. I found this time too short for the goal they want to achieve, but let's go in parts. I think the division of tasks is good in the sense that they are divided into very exact time periods (this is rare, usually the proposals divide the time blocks by month, not giving an exact date for the start of the project and also for its I thought this was a positive point. But regarding the details of the activities, I believe that this part still leaves a little to be desired. In my view, each of them could be better explained. For example, during the \"registration and integration\u201d, how would these two tasks be done? What would the application process be like, through which platform? How would they make the \u201ccall\u201d to apply? Soon after, there would be the first training session for developers. in practice? Who would deliver these sessions, passing on knowledge? About the budget, I feel that there was also a lack of detail. The amount requested is compatible with the proposal, in my opinion, but it could have been better detailed in some s parts, especially the more expensive ones. For example, 5k is asked for \u201clocation\u201d, but what justifies the need for this value? Would it be the rental of the physical spaces where the training sessions would take place? 3k is reserved for \u201cothers\u201d, which for an amount of 15% is quite a lot. I would like at least an idea of \u200b\u200bwhat these \u201cothers\u201d could be. Anyway, as I exemplified, some parts of the monetary division could be better explained. About the team, this part was very complete, as you can see, needing little improvement to make it perfect. We know the names and a very detailed resume of the duo of professionals involved in the project, we know from their previous experiences, and I notice that both are well understood in blockchain, which reassures me a lot, as usually the proposals have only 1 more related member with Cardano. What I think could be added are still two simple things: 1) what role they would play directly in this project 2) their linkedin profiles, in order to see their work in practice. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "All auditability indicators suggested by bidders relate to results. I will suggest improvements. In my view, the proposal is satisfactorily auditable on the basis of the data provided, which are mostly numerical. It boils down to the number of training sessions, of people trained, of people indirectly affected (from what I could understand), number of posts on social media by people who were trained (about Cardano) and so on. They are indeed good ways to see objectively whether the intended goals have been achieved. However, it would also be interesting to do a more humanized individual follow-up of some selected ones, I don't know, maybe 5 people from each area, in order to understand just how many people were affected by the project, but also how. The team involved could establish a later contact asking for a few minutes of their attention to answer a report, it could even be in the form of google docs, with questions like \u201cafter the training, did you start investing in Ada?\u201d or \u201chow did you enter the world of blockchain?\u201d, even \u201cdid you pass on the acquired knowledge to third parties?\u201d and so on. In this way, we would have a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the process. However, what I always suggest in my evaluations is that we also have an understanding of the project development process, in addition to the final results. In other words, we understand: if the established phases were fulfilled within the deadline; whether the people they sought to train gave their opinion, were actually involved in the project; if there was any delay in the schedule, and if so, why; and that kind of thing. This would help to understand the partial results beyond the final ones. I believe this could be established by direct contact between the team and some members of the Cardano community, even better if they are natives of the countries in question. In other words, auditability is not bad, but it can improve both in terms of being more detailed and in analyzing not only the final product but also the process as a whole. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 5, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3437, "q0": "The impact section is written quite poorly.
