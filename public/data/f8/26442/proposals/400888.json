The proposal looks likely to be underestimated not to mention the fact that the implementation across 10 houses will definitely cost more. The project doesn't look very feasible considering the timeline and the budget presented.

I think the proposal overall meets the challenge requirement and I also support the idea.\nProposers outlined the project's functions and benefits, as well as the impact the project would have on potential audiences. The team specifically explains what the project functions for and also clearly show the project's impact on the Cardano ecosystem. Technically, the solution is well explained and easy to understand.\nThe project promises to provide opportunities to improve the quality of life in remote villages.

The proposal has identified one of the biggest challenges in Africa, i.e rural electrification. The development of small-scale solar energy conversion systems such as photovoltaic systems for the provision of electricity in a rural area will certainly aid in improved electricity access, also leading to job creation and skill development.

Or is it that, smart phones will be provided for the use of the smart meter and access to their cardano funds? Or are you targeting a central household with a smart phone to be a central P2P node?\n\n-In a typical African village, access to the internet is a big problem? This has to be addressed as it will be central to the gaining of access to the smart meter and even their cardano funds.\n\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I think a bit more clarity on the following issues would be helpful:\n-Team should include funding allocation for community sensitization. This is especially important since the village systems and traditions are very different from the towns and cities.

You should rather focus more on the field campaigns or propose an additional means of marketing.\n\nI think if these are addressed, the degree of success of this proposal will be high. its a very impactful proposal and should be funded.\n\n-Kindly check your budget outline.
