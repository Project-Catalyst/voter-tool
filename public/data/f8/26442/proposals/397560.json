A lot of people who are not English-speaking really find it difficult to defy the information coming out of Cardano. Honestly, there's been a lot of attempts by the community to sort of break this barrier to ensure all-inclusive and a typical example is the diversification of Catalyst Town Hall which used to be just the Main Town Hall (Eastern) edition but now with the introduction of African Town Hall and others, people are able to join a town hall that has their cultural sentiment and receive the usual same information from the usual Main Town Hall in their native language and cultural feel. Introducing this idea into relaying of information about Stake Pools is indeed worth a solution that addresses the problem of language barrier. You know, you may not want to invest your time, money, and even knowledge in something you don't understand. The opposite of this is what I see to be the impact this proposal is going to have on the Cardano Ecosystem. i.e., safe onboarding of people with different language background and French at that, to invest in staking.\nI strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From this proposal, it is stated that \"This is easily achievable as we have already translated the application into multiple foreign languages.\". However, I got a copy of the application from the App Store and unfortunately, it's got only 1 language pack which is English. I tried accessing the website link provided in this proposal to verify if the translated versions were indeed done or not as claimed but it looks like it still has the same language pack which is English. From this, I'm thinking it would have been great and helpful if the proposing team had provided evidence on the translations made so far. But, once they've been able to build the interface in English, I don't think it's much of a work since all they need is a translator to translate the contents from English to French and then upload this into the application. It may be quite technical which's not my field of expertise  but I think any good technical team should be able to integrate easily. \nFrom this proposal there's little information given about the team and it's making me feel quite skeptical with the feasibility as far as implementation is concerned. It's stated clearly that the help of a professional translation service would be needed in order to implement this proposal and they've budgeted $1K for that service but according to research from Fiverr, a well known job market, the premium charge for 900 words translation which usually takes 3 days (72 hours) is $15 which's  1.5% of $1K. Huge difference. I suggest the team should provide information on how many hours this translation service is going to work and what the price is tag is. That would enable the community to know whether or not the requested budget is overstated or understated and thus feasible or not for successful implementation.\nAlso, $400 is allocated for development but there's no information on who this developer is. No name, contact, etc. but only a brief description which says; \"The primary developer for this mobile application has over 10 years of mobile development experience and his applications have been downloaded from the Google Play and Apple App Stores several million times.\" and yet no links to some of his past success. \nEven though the link https://pool-peek.web.app leads to a nice website which clearly gives a great picture of the impact of this proposal, there's no specific information on the team behind it and it makes me feel quite skeptical about the feasibility of a successful implementation of this proposal if funded unless the proposing team can really clarify the raised concerns. \nGood luck to this proposal!", "q1r": 3, "q2": "It is stated in this proposal that \"Success will be seen as the application published to both Google Play and Apple App Store in French.\" which's great but I think a detailed roadmap could've been very useful for the community to at least know when to expect progress report and final delivery. A typical example of a good roadmap is one that details what would be done within 1 month post-funding, 2 month post-funding, 3 month post-funding and through till the project is successfully implemented fully. Details must include timelines and milestones. The team can also reach out to the several proposal workshops hosted by the Catalyst School in order to learn how to write great Catalyst proposal.

To this end, it is essential that sources of information and knowledge are available to many citizens of this continent in a language that is widely used locally.\n\nIn this context, since many African countries have French as one of their languages, we can observe that this proposal will have an impact consistent with the challenge proposal. Furthermore, as technology penetrates further into the African continent, the greater will be the interest in how to allocate and invest ADA. At this point, having an app like Pool Peek fully translated into a widely used language, it will be possible to bring more strength and outreach to the ADA.\n\nThus, the impact generated by this investment, already in the short term, is a greater popularization of the Cardano platform, and even the budget for the realization of this translation, $1400, seems quite feasible with the service to be performed.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Uma vez que o projeto se trata de uma ideia muito importante, por\u00e9m n\u00e3o necessariamente complexa ou inovadora, n\u00e3o \u00e9 necess\u00e1ria uma estrutura\u00e7\u00e3o de etapas muito complexa ou de um grande n\u00famero de profissionais na equipe para que o objetivo seja realizado. \n\n\u00c9 citado tamb\u00e9m que o aplicativo j\u00e1 foi traduzido para diversas outras l\u00ednguas, demonstrando assim que a atividade aqui proposta \u00e9 perfeitamente realiz\u00e1vel.

Most of the courses, studying website and information about blockchain are in English. It definitely bring some certain difficulties and hesitations to users who don\u2019t speak English well and want to learn about Cardano.

How long will it take for recruitment, translation, QC and apply it onto the app? What is the amount of work like? How many working hours are needed?
