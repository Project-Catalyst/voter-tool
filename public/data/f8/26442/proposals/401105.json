This new people objective project should insert me in a well-oriented way in the Catalyst process, help as CAs, vCAs, ponents, the initiative has already been voters and etc. a series of activities such as workshops, follow-ups, in short, the group is made up of experienced non-complex people, who help to structure new Catalyst concepts, instructing them on the concepts that should be blockchain, what is the difference between Cardano and other blockchains , what are CNFTs and etc. In short, it is literally a source of catalyst for new members. And if this is adapted to the specifics of Africa, it will certainly be a great gain for its natives. As stated here by the proponents, it answers some difficulties regarding membership in Catalyst. Starting with the fact that most are totally unaware of what Cardano and Catalyst are. Then we have a language barrier, which makes it difficult for everyone who does not have English to attend community meetings (Town Hall, for example), even the mother tongue to follow community meetings (Town Hall, for example), up to the participants' accent account. Africa deserves a special one, it is necessary that the knowledge passed on to these students is so important to our blockchain. Now that he explains that I also think the project will have a positive impact on the continent, he will say that the expansion of our blockchain is perfect for our community. As new participants join Catalyst, the numbers of Ada holders will be added; new digital wallets will be created; more people transacting on our blockchain; with this, we can increase investments in our Dapps; young people in the technology area will be motivated to learn about our technologies, who will become Plutus pioneers, will know if developed with the workforce produced; In short, the gains are many. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal script is perfect. We know what will be developed in the first 3-month cycle, and in addition, it is detailed which activities will take place per week. In this way, we have a full understanding of what will develop next, what we will build over time so that this project goes from theory to practice. The degree of specificity found here is so high that it will also be useful in the part of auditing the proposal, as I will comment below. Therefore, no criticism to make for this part of the proposal, in my opinion everything is in order. Talking about the budget, the amount asked in my opinion is totally fair and very worth investing in compared to how this project will be beneficial for Africa and Cardano. The total amount is divided into parts, so we understand exactly how it will be used. The level of detail is so good that we even know the hourly value of some things, like the \u201cDelivery of 11 live sessions in English and French\u201d. I don't have any criticisms to make about it either. Finally, analyzing the team, I think there is a lot of security in this team, because we know their names, previous professional experiences and how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem. However, I think it would be interesting if the level of detail provided by them was more egalitarian, we have people who spoke little about themselves, such as Afia Owusu, for example, while others, such as Daniel D. Lezu, provide extensive information. about your resume. It would also be interesting for all team members to attach their linkedin profiles, because with that we would have a practical way to prove the information that was said. However, I'm going to give the maximum score for feasibility, because we have enough information to know in depth who we are dealing with, what they will do in each passing week and how much all this would cost. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability of this proposal is very good, with only a few things to improve. We know very well how to audit the process, the bidders would provide very detailed information on how this monitoring can be done as the months go by. I found the way they explained this auditability really differentiated, it's as if they had left everything as unraveled as possible so that the Cardano community has enough grounding when it comes to monitoring activities and processes. My only suggestion is that they make it clearer how we could have access to this information, otherwise it's perfect. Now talking about the success scenario, we have many numerical indicators to understand if the project achieved what was expected. I believe it would also be interesting if we had direct feedback from the students involved, from the people who were trained through the School's activities. It would be really cool to see the result in practice, new members joining, people getting an extra income working for Catalyst, tech students specializing in our most used programming languages, developers learning about smart contracts and so on. And it would also be perfect if it was made very clear how this could be directly perceived by the Cardano community. Therefore, I believe the auditability is good, but it could still be a little more detailed and diversified (qualitatively, in this case). \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 6, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Theres is a detail presentation of the plan and timeline for the project to be carried out.

I strongly agree the proposal is impactful because the proposal would:\n- onboard new members from Africa for Project Catalyst and Cardano community\n- help new members improve their skills while engaging in Project Catalyst as proposers, CAs, vCAs (or without any specific roles)\nAs we see The Catalyst School is enhancing the impact of Catalyst completely by improving the contribution of all its players and roles.

I reckon those individuals submitted disjointed proposals most likely because they have not been mentored and this is proven. There is one proposal that through mentoring by Emelia Sarfo, it's quality grew leaps and bounds. I do not understand why this wasn't setup earlier. Too match the wave of African proposals, that perhaps due to not being funded, become discouraged, and again this is a fact.

In regards with their action plan, it is almost identical to that of the Catalyst School, a tried and proven system. Though I did find some adjustments from the original that seems to be an effort to iterate into a more refined and improve syllabus.

Introduction to Cardano Blockchain and Catalyst, How to be a Community Advisor, How to be a Veteran Community Advisor, How to be a Voter etc.\nThe Africa Catalyst School will provide additional courses as follows:\n(a) How to navigate the Cardano.ideascale.com website\n(b) Brainstorming and Q&A sessions \u2013 These sessions will aim at gathering and sharing ideas on challenges peculiar to Africa so participants can use them as a launchpad for writing future proposals.\n(c) How to turn an idea into an effective proposal on ideascale\nGiven the huge potential for the growth and expansion of Cardano and Catalyst in Africa, an Africa oriented Catalyst school will yield tremendous results.\nThe proposal has positive impacts on the development of Africa in particular and the Cardano community in general.

The proposed solution as outlined in the proposal is to facilitate and help educate so many Africans on the opportunities that project catalyst provides.\n\nIn the proposal, you will realize that the proposers laid the foundation that \"newcomers to Project Catalyst have experienced the challenge of understanding the entire Cardano and Catalyst framework and how it operates.\"\nTo solve this problem, they proposed that in order to participate effectively in any role whether CA, vCA, Proposer etc. newbies must adopt an intentional approach to navigate the various online platforms and channels of communication and integrate into the community. This I believe is commendable. It will help bring out the best to always assess and participate in the project's activities.\n\nOne aspect that also caught my attention was the fact that Africa\u2019s participation in the Catalyst School\u2019s activities is quite low for a couple of reasons including:\n\n-    Many people in Africa have absolutely no knowledge of Cardano and Catalyst\n\n-    A large francophone community (141 million people and growing) and Arabic speaking community (140 million people) which is largely not engaged\n\n-    People struggle to understand some live and recorded sessions because they are unfamiliar with the spoken accent of presenters (These were from the proposal)\n\nA comprehensive solution is therefore needed to be able to enhance education and empower so many people to do their best in the catalyst environment.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This project is highly likely to be implemented successfully because there is clear and concrete information about the team in the proposal and it is well detailed.
