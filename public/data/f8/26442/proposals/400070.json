This proposal is intended to promote, recruit, and onboard African Mentors and Proposers in order to achieve rapid adoption and value where it is most needed, as well as to position Africa as a strategic region in the world where Cardano can have a greater impact and help us achieve our goal of making Cardano the blockchain of choice in Africa by 2023.

What areas of Africa will the project focus on? Will the mentors be linguistically diverse enough to handle the possible language issues that can arise?

I mention this in another assessment, the passion of people from Africa to submit a proposal is there. What they only need is people to help them with creating a structured proposal that coincides with the Project Catalyst standards, which is ever changing. Hence, the need of continually available mentors. I can not stress further the need of mentors in Project Catalyst, paid mentors too. Mentors are gatekeepers of 2 (two) things; upholding quality and negating scamming tendencies. Workshops can only do so much, the key to quality is mentorship.
