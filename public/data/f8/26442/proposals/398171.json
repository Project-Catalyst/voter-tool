The proposal fits perfectly with the goals of the challenge as we have a clear use of Cardano's blockchain to solve a historic problem on the African continent, the central idea is precisely to use this technology to connect African women with health services in different locations, which often would not be available to them. This makes a local problem begin to be solved, and also increases Cardano's influence in the African community.\n\nInnovation occurs precisely because this will be an innovative way of breaking down a historical barrier; the medium/long term impact of the project is to promote a change in the quality of the health service in certain parts of Africa, which can be of immeasurable value.\n\nThe amount of funds being requested by the project is considerable, $70,000. But as we will see, all the steps that indicate how the financing will take place are well explained and cohesively outline a path for the project to be successfully completed.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The steps that detail the way to complete the project are organized by periods, usually monthly, and we can understand the importance of each of these periods for the execution of the task. For example, we noticed that the initial stages have a greater structuring characteristic, that is, the aim is to find local ambassadors and consultants for the project, in addition to starting the development of the dapp that will be used to connect information.\n\nIn the final stages, we have already observed a concern to validate the results that were generated during the 'pilot' phase, also considering applying scalability to the initiative, and this is a good indication as it demonstrates a future concern in carrying out an expansion of the project.\n\nRegarding the budget details, we see that the division of capital was quite coherent. Given the characteristics of the project, it would be impossible to implement the central idea without a well-developed platform to connect patients and health professionals. And one of the largest amounts in the budget, $15,000, is being earmarked exactly for the development of this dapp, which will already include a payment system.\n\nThe professionals destined and necessary to carry out each of the stages are also clearly designated and, together, they seem to have the necessary skills for the execution of the project. A negative point that should be mentioned here is the fact that the curriculum of the author of the proposal is not easily available, so that we can confirm his previous experience. It would also be interesting to know which product was developed by the author of the proposal and which resulted in a patent.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As for auditability, clear ways were established so that the steps presented in the previous topic were well monitored. Not only were the parameters established to verify that the dapps were built, but the number of patients treated was also taken into account, as well as a survey will be carried out at the end of the project to validate the initiative's premises.\n\nThese ways of monitoring the result, together with the other characteristics of the proposal, give a lot of confidence that the project can be successful in this first phase. As an additional point, it would be interesting to add one more way of verifying the result between these metrics: the follow-up of a Cardano member, with experience in similar projects on the issue of data use, to verify if the technology is being well used and taken advantage of at the same time. maximum.

As for the presentation and completeness of information, I think the Impact part of this proposal has not done well. Firstly, I hope you can make the project's introduction easier to understand. Take one example by this sentence: \u201cWe will recruit women into the project using program ambassadors and train them to register and provide the data sets needed by linked providers to provide health assessments\u201d.
