Eventually what usually happens after a Town Hall, are social forks, where numerous community based entities pops-up. Without funding, the Town Hall can indeed function, but not effectively and not humanely. Efforts of the participants of a Town Hall should be compensated. Those who operate a Town Hall are faced by tedious day-to-day education and engagement of the community till it reaches an infliction point, where the community runs and grow the Town Hall autonomously, the seed of a DAO.

It bothers me. I repeat, it bothers me, when quality people need to low ball themselves to receive funding. It's as if no one understands how to valuate people accordingly to the value they will deliver, to contributing to the mission of Cardano in uplifting people, to the long term goal of mass adoption of Cardano. I repeat, we are not capitalist that seeks to find the cheapest most impactful proposal that is. Which I believe is still a continuing trend.

Thus they are a very powerful catalyst for new projects and can only be beneficial if organized by the right people (which in this case they clearly are). Some of the recent discussions within some catalyst groups that have contained enviousness, prejudice against african countries and tried to delegitimize the entire challenge have shown that exactly this kind of proposal fostering self-organization is what is just needed within this challenge.

Perhaps PCATH may be better? I know it's just a slight change but it's more specific which could be useful too for future SEO.\n\nI love how they made reference to challenges such as frequent power (electricity) outages within the continent with regards to participating members, and mentioning that the host will be supported by a standby power. Most proposals in the 'Grow Africa, Grow Cardano' challenge do not seem to acknowledge this main risk.

More Cardano-based projects will open up a broader market for the continent, contributing in the development of the Cardano ecosystem in Africa, which is the challenge's aim.

Because as a first fund Catalyst participant, I can assure you that I suffer from this ailment, I can't keep up with all the other Town Halls very well, mainly because they are not often in English. I can only imagine that the African situation is similar if language is the primary barrier to entry, which makes this idea very useful, keeping up with major ecosystem updates is something every member of the community should do, and certainly this proposal will make this more possible for the Africans. Another positive point I found here was that the authors have already done a successful CATH townhall and have partnerships with SWARM and other townhalls, which demonstrates that they have competence and experience with our ecosystem and with Catalyst, and it is also very useful that they already have a site created where this new content could be introduced.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project team proves to be very well prepared to carry it out, because they provide a small individual description of who they are, which is summed up by their contacts on social networks, making real the possibility of making direct contact and getting to know them better, and also the fact that they are connected to other teams already funded in previous funds. In relation to the budget, I believe that the level of detail here was high, and with that, satisfactory. We know what each part of the project will cost, and regarding variable costs, they are very well calculated, broken down, and explained so that we can understand exactly what would happen here. So I think the only thing I would suggest would be a little more detail in the phases and what they are already doing. I love that they already had the town hall and the vibe in it.

That way, all we would need to do is have access to such information as well, which they would generate weekly, but could present to us monthly, or every 2 months, for example.
