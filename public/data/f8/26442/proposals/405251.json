But it\u2019s one of the initial steps towards hugely potential multilanguage NFT gaming. As an NFT Game Engine built on Cardano, Revelar is set to success in the play-to-earn sphere. As an avid tabletop gamer this reminds me of games like Cards Against Humanity that have built almost cult-like following globally. The only minus comes from the blunder that instead of stating the summary of a solution, they\u2019ve repeated the problem they have identified: Focus on natively English-speaking cultures is limiting the formation of a truly global NFT-based gaming community. Nevertheless, potential in building an engaged, global, Cardano-powered gaming community is huge. Besides these kinds of simple games have the potential to attract a lot of new users to the Cardano community.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Out of their 14 proposals in Fund8, half deal with Duo - their flagship game - and five are specifically targeted for translation (https://www.getduo.gg/).

Considering how well the proposal is laid out, it\u2019s a reasonable ask. The team is both passionate and skilled.

Five of their proposals were funded in Fund7.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "When it comes to reporting and tracking results, Revelar is setting an example for others to follow.

For this amount, the return will easily be higher than the investment in my opinion, if the proposal is successful and the game takes off.\nRegarding the team, we are provided with descriptions and social links for the company\u2019s CEO, CTO and CCO.

As the challenge goal is to expand cardano/blockchain related information in Africa, I believe that it can be done via games as well. The only disadvantage is the price and the limit of the collection. Right now, you can find some cards on jpg.store but I do not consider them lucrative enough to make any traction (1 black card for 250 ada, and few colored cards)...so I do not really see, how Africans would actually be able to play the game, if they would not be able to buy it.

Also, on their website and discord, we can find some videos, which are meeting the quality requirements of \"today\". \n\nThe roadmap is set to 10-12 weeks, and the longest parts are focused on translation, or marketing.

The problem contextualized by the proponents is that this type of game is very widespread in English, so populations that do not speak the native language are a little excluded and without so many means to expand the practice. Therefore, translate the game into the Afrikaans language, in order to better reach the Afrikaans-speaking audience. I agree that it's a good way to expand this type of project to new audiences, what I'm missing here is more detail about the game itself. We know that the reveal group already has projects in progress at Cardano and they are reliable, but the short video posted was not enough for me to have a complete understanding of the game, the matches, the rewards, etc. Therefore, I cannot say that the impact will be maximum. Details are lacking, but it's certainly a good idea.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Overall, the proposal is quite feasible, but I would like to suggest some improvements. Regarding the script, I have no criticisms to make, because I think it is well suited. We know what will be done, when and how. The level of detail is satisfactory and the time division is very specific, in weeks. The budget explanation part is just ok because some things should be explained better, such as what the marketing campaign would look like. How will Afrikaan speakers find out about the existence of this game and get involved with it? How would the routine of translations cost around 1800 dollars? What would local content creation be? Finally, analyzing the team, I thought that this great part, like the script, we have a great degree of detail about who the professionals involved are and it is important that they are people well involved with our blockchain. Therefore, I think that only the budget part deserved a little improvement.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditability is not as good as other topics. Talking about the process, the group has a website that can serve as a way for us to notice updates from the project's development, but we don't know what would be posted or how often. I also didn't find the site's interface so ergonomic, I would like it to be more intuitive for the user. The same observations I make about Duo Translation - I don't know how often or in what way the feedbacks would be made available, nor how the Cardano community would keep abreast of the news. Regarding the final result, it is known what is expected for this project itself, but it is not studied how the reflection for Cardano would be measured. I would like the proponents to be concerned with qualitative and quantitative data that explain what this translation generated for Cardano in the chosen location.

Having it only in English really creates some boundaries to several people across the world. There are several games/movies which does not consider this bit and all the humor around it is lost. Therefore, I agree that this idea has the potential to grow towards the aimed community. \nSince the proposal states that it\u2019s mandatory making partnerships with people from that country/culture, it fits perfectly the challenge accounting the local impact and partnership formed. Arranging partnership with people from different countries of Africa will grow the awareness and curiosity towards the ADA community.\nA point that should be added, however, is the explanation about the game itself. To verify its impact would be great to know how it works. It would help us to know if it would stick.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It seems that the team is capable, being very active through the ADA funds. Besides that, having the CTO from South Africa and being an Afrikaans native speaker is amazing. \nI\u2019ve seen that you\u2019ve submitted the same proposals in other languages, therefore I suppose that this one is just to translate in Afrikaans. Since the CTO is a native speaker and he is from S.A., I think the \u2018finding the partner/translator\u2019 part won\u2019t be a problem and would not exist. However, it must make a partnership with a totally stranger to not have any bias.\nAbout the translation, it should be taken into account that it\u2019s not enough having someone translating to some language. It has to account to the differences between countries as well (Portugal and Brazil, e.g.).\nOne point that should have been better explored is the game itself. The budget for the translation is $1850, however I\u2019ve no idea if this is too much or too little since I\u2019ve no idea how the game works (how many cards, words, content, knowledge required, etc.). More than that, if we don\u2019t know the content, we don\u2019t know if we would like to play it or not or if it would be another game that people start to play only to earn something and then disappear\nAnother point is that you state that is a play-to-earn game, however it not explains how it will work, therefore I have no condition to know if it\u2019s sustainable or not. These are very serious points that should\u2019ve been more explored.\nAdding these information would enhance the overall quality of the proposal.\nAnother point is the scalability.

One can wrongly question its belonging to the Grow Africa, Grow Cardano challenge because Duo is an NFT game & should be in the On-Chain Gaming challenge but I would argue that what's being presented is not the game itself but the content of the game which is currently in English and not aligned with the local language. Whilst English is one of the commonly spoken-languages in South Africa, the proposal indicates there are nuances in the current content which aren't easily translatable and their goal is to make it more meaningfully relevant to the local population by introducing culturally-relevant content. This makes it more than just an NFT game to the population because if it's 'speaks their language' in a manner of speaking, i.e. if the content is very South African in its delivery then it would be warmly adopted as 'their own'. To anyone who has travelled, met anyone from another country, or if you tell a local a joke that's very endemic to a local's own culture, then you would get the nuance and the importance of being relevant to the people.

The team has also proposed KPIs post translation which seems to err on the conservative side, though I am not so familiar with South African participation in NFT P2E gaming as I am of their other proposal (Filipino translation).
