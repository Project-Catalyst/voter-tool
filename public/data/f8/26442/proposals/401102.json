This proposal reveals that no Catalyst money have been allocated to Cardano-related operations in Malawi, and that crypto acceptance is low in Malawi as a result of previous frauds. To solve the aforementioned issue, the proposer proposes creating a free public place where individuals may schedule time to learn about Cardano and technology, or simply come and study on their ownBy creating a public platform where anybody can learn about Cardano for free, the proposer will be able to reach a larger audience and increase their understanding of crypto. People's skepticism will be replaced with a practical grasp of how to utilize Cardano wallets safely and what dangers are involved in storing Ada and other cryptocurrencies, as well as the benefits of leveraging smart contracts on a decentralized blockchain versus centralized services. Scammers will be less able to create a negative image if people's comprehension improves, and it will pave the road for future adoption in Malawi. This project aims to introduce individuals to the Cardano ecosystem and provide training to those who want to learn more about how it works on a technical level. More individuals will be onboarded to Cardano as a result of this, and Cardano will be the blockchain of preference in Africa. Hence this proposal addresses  the challenge effectively.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer is one who has shown over the period his knowledge and skills in block chain specifically Cardano and can carry out the plan. The proposer indicates the kind and number of team members needed to carry out the plan gives a budget that is broken down into pieces, and acceptable in order to meet the established objectives. The proposal also includes a realistic timeframe for completing the work, as well as a clear and actionable implementation strategy that demonstrates what is being done and how it is being done. The proposer has taken into account the challenges that may arise during implementation and provides possible solutions to these challenges. Hence, problem solution listed has a high chance being implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal offers enough information to audit and evaluate the project's progress toward its stated goals, since it elaborates the implementation techniques and success measurement criteria, thanks to the well-developed material from the effect and feasibility categories", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1501", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal presents the factual background and motivation that makes you want to develop Cardano Tech Training in Malawi. The future benefits from this training are also convincing. However, I have read many proposals related to Cardano training or awareness plans in African countries. I see that your project still does not have any outstanding points or any difference from other training projects. So I hope you can add the unique features of your project so that investors can pay attention to it. Furthermore, you should not say that \"The main risk would be if people aren't interested in learning about Cardano\" because your project's primary goal is people's interest. Instead, \"The main risk would be if a new training project can hardly attract many learners\" will further highlight your giving away ADA solution. Those are some of my sincere suggestions, and I hope they can help your proposal better.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Overall, your Feasibility part provides just enough information needed for a skills training project, but not enough to capture the reader's attention. Here are some tips I would like to give you:\nFirst, let's focus on analyzing the activities in the timeline. For example, how would you arrange classes by time frame, with how many people per class? What is the focus of your lecture, and how will you test your learners' comprehension? What are \u201cother technologies that might be beneficial for Malawi\u201d?\nSecond, please tell more about how much ADA you give per person.\nThird, \u201chobbyist\u201d, \u201clove\u201d and \u201cinterested in\u201d are not words that investors like when reading a person's self-introduction.

What metrics do you base on to know that this project has improved people's understanding of Cardano? Where can the community track the project's progress?

If there is a lack of awareness of blockchain technology, developing basic blockchain training\u00a0should be a\u00a0priority before talking about Cardano and its ecosystem. Furthermore, the initiative does not provide specific details on the strategy for attracting participants, and the content given for each session is abstract. \n\nAs a result, assessing the quality of workshops and their potential impact is pretty difficult.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There is a\u00a0timetable\u00a0for a four-month period.

Recognizing the limitations and inadequacies of virtual currency use in Malawi in the past, the proposer provided a viable remedy. With the primary goal of promoting the Cardano ecosystem as well as ADA to the people here, it is apparent that the number of individuals ready to join the community will increase. Furthermore, the proposer underlined that it will create prospects for future initiatives in Malawi. This is undoubtedly a very amazing achievement; not only help a country become more developed in the eventual, but Cardano will also become an essential community for Malawi's future development. Moreover, giving away Ada or requiring individuals to sign up for time in the space addresses the difficulties that the proposer anticipates will occur during project execution. On the other side, while the strategy is good, I have some comments to help the project succeed. The proposal suggested training and growing public knowledge of ADA and Cardano but provided no specifics on how to proceed. They may offer classes on a regular weekly basis or on specified days of the month to instruct participants at a specific place. Alternatively, they can collaborate with local governments to quickly advertise the initiative and ensure a large number of people participate.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "To begin discussing the highlights of this part, I appreciate their usage of the budget. A method of spending with clear objectives and a very affordable price. Furthermore, they have a particular strategy in place for the next four months with the purpose of imparting knowledge and different viewpoints of people in Malawi about ADA and Cardano. On the other hand, the project's flaws are still relative. As previously said, the proposer should clarify how they want to prepare the lecture, what it will feature, and how they intend to instruct those present. Also, if there is no contact with the local government, the proposer should go above and beyond to promote the idea. It may be necessary to travel to people's homes to spread the word, or to rent a car and run advertisements within 3-4 days to guarantee that the plan is known to as many people as possible. As for the team, two persons are much too few for a teaching activity that aims to promote awareness among the locals. They should hire a budget manager or someone who can communicate with the public and the government in order to save expenses or quickly rent a suitable space. They should hire a budget manager or someone who can communicate with the public and the government in order to save expenses or quickly rent a suitable space. Further, rather than selecting someone who has experience in the logistics industry and wants to learn about Cardano, it is better to find someone who really has a broad understanding of the community to convey all the strengths and characteristics of this ecosystem.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I was impressed by the proposer's steadfast drive to highlight the project's eventual success. The mention of funds earlier demonstrates that he has been more prepared for this mission. What he learned in prior funding will undoubtedly be very beneficial to this project as well as the future development of Cardano in Malawi. However, I am hoping that the proposer can provide concrete data on how many individuals will be taught about the Cardano or ADA ecosystem in the coming months. Certain dates for achieving the anticipated quantity are also attached.

One of two more people with knowledge about Cardano and training technics would facilitate things. Or develop a collaboration with other experts (individuals or organizations) that can offer those trainings.\nThe proposal present presents a 4 months period, during which the space is rented, but it doesn't specify whether that 's the entire period during which the training will be offered.\nThe budget covers the rent and rewards/incentives to participants, but nothing to trainers (You or other collaborators).

How many hubs would be opened in other regions of the country or area of the city?...But the indicator mentioned is only qualitative.\nThe roadmap is unclear excluding the 4 months period during which the rent will be paid. For sustainability, it would may be important to have a plan beyond the 4 months, since it's training offered that can be continuous on a certain cycle.\nThe challenges haven't been clearly mentioned by the proposers while they may include: the promotion difficulties, the sustainability plan, the human resources...\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_478", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "In my opinion, the spirit of the proposal revolves around the establishment of a small knowledge laboratory of the Cardano ecosystem.  A knowledge center that people of all backgrounds could enter and openly acquire knowledge that would make their lives better.  The lab would be run by proponents with a long standing relationship with Catalyst and Cardano that remains active to date, with knowledge and experience in development and logistics (logistics: an ingredient from the  physical world in the mix). This small knowledge center could become the incubator seed for Cardano ecosystem projects in the Malawi community.  Thanks to the management of this knowledge lab, we could see among us new Catalyst members and new Cardano developers.\n\nIt is this kind of apparent low-scope projects that initiate a major reaction due their tendency to connect with other seemingly low-scope projects.  You don't know where they came from but they end up taking the region they are in by storm.

General aspects: hours of operation, days of operation, personnel to be hired, etc.  What will be the methodology of distribution of Cardano tokens for academic purposes.  \n\nUnfortunately, without a more detailed relation of the activities to be developed in the space, it is difficult to establish with certainty the diligence with which the budget will be invested.
