Undoubtedly it is a very noble proposal, aiming to create opportunities for more people and also contributing to the development of the region and others around it. Regarding the budget of $15,000, we realized that it is feasible in relation to what we want to accomplish. However, the way the proposal is currently structured, it is not possible to say that the project will succeed in forming this basis so that in the future Cardano's knowledge and technologies can help Africa. Thus, the proposal may not have the expected impact.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "As it is a proposal that will possibly face many barriers, even structural ones, for its implementation, it would be expected that a little more detail would be evidenced in relation to its execution. From what has been said, it is quite evident that the actions to be taken are known, as well as the benefits that they will possibly bring. We realize that the beginning of the problem and where we want to go are well known. The problem seems to be in the middle of the road, exactly in the feasibility. Given the characteristic of being an innovative project and that will change the reality of a certain region, it was expected that there would be some prototypes of materials or of the teaching model that will be adopted. For example, what topics will be covered in digital literacy?\n\nAnother point that was quite confusing was when it was said that one of the goals is to make the project participants obtain functional programming skills. The focus of the project is to create a technology-oriented educational base, so why already target such advanced goals?\n\nBut we should mention that the stages of the feasibility plan are generally organized, as well as the allocation of capital to each of them makes sense. It was also indicated that a large number of professionals mobilized around the project, as well as finding CVs. As a suggestion, then, a possible partnership of this project with other educational projects present in this or in previous funds, which have Africa as their main focus. In this way, some of these problems can be solved, increasing the viability of the project. It would also be interesting to make it clearer that this is a project that aims to promote educational bases, so that in the future, with its implementation, a second stage can be imagined with a clearer introduction of Cardano concepts and technologies and how they can help to change reality in Africa.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Regarding the ways to measure the success of the project, we were not able to find many details, we observed that the main action carried out each month was explained, but we did not find clear indications of how the proposal would be audited. Some questions to be answered based on the project results could have been raised, such as:\n\nWas it possible to measure student learning through an end-of-term assessment?\n\nWhat was the average grade in this assessment?\n\nHow many students started and how many completed the project?\n\nWe realized that the ideas defined in the project's perception of success are very clear and consistent with everything that was proposed, reaffirming that this is a very noble project with very important goals to impact the continent. The idea is then to try to contact other similar projects so that the points mentioned can perhaps be readjusted.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 2, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2598, "q0": "I really do not think this idea solves the problem in the challenge.It clearly does not align with the challenge,I found impact of this idea on cardano rather confusing,if I understood what the proposal aims at achieving,then it is to impact the lives of 400 marginalized girls that is by empowering them, training them, equipping them with skills to function in society.My question then is, how will all the above impact the cardano ecosystem? That answer is clearly not in the proposal. This proposal is more or less like looking for funding to train girls to become digital literates.Well,I have seen cases where training people to become digital literates helps them to discover cardano but in this proposal,I only saw that, gaining functional skills will help the girls increase coding capabilities for the cardano blockchain. What happens next after they increase coding capabilities for the cardano blockchain?, how will it impact the cardano blockchain?, how does it solve the problem in the challenge thus how does it grow cardano? All these answers were not clearly stated in the proposal,I therefore doubt if this proposal has an impact on cardano.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team provided us with an individualized description of each member so that we get to know them,but then I did not see previous works of these people, how do these people relate to the cardano ecosystem? Usually in projects,we get one or two people who have some knowledge about our blockchain technologies but I did not see that in the proposal.\nAlso,the funds requested was to me,too much for such a project and how monies were allocated for purposes were not appropriate.. For example, monthly internet connection for schools 1000 and wifi installation for schools 500,to me means the same thing. As such,I see this proposal not feasible enough.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The delivery dates were not clearly stated and somehow confusing to me.

Those skills are said to increase the student\u2019s coding capabilities on Cardano.  \nThe second mention is in regards to making Cardano the blockchain of choice through grassroots Cardano projects like the one in the proposal.  This is confusing as the the proposal doesn\u2019t appear to be a Cardano project.\n\nThere is no detail on how the Cardano block chain would be used to achieve objectives.

Essentially asking for a charitable donation.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Linkedin urls are provided for all the team members, however none of the members list any Cardano expertise.  \nThere is no explanation of who would be training the students in Cardano-relevant programming.  Therefore, I do not have confidence the Cardano training portion of the proposal would be completed.\n\nThe teams does appear qualified in general information and communications technology, so it is plausible the necessary online platforms can be built, and the necessary technical training of the 20 teacher completed.\n\nThe proposal does not elaborate on what the digital outreach hub actually is.  A website?  A network of people communicating by email?  It is unclear what form this hub takes and therefore how much development it requires.  There is no clear timeline provided on the development of the outreach hub, therefore, it is difficult to guage its feasibility.  \n\nThe budget allocates only $1,000 in total to the 20 teachers as compensation.  This appears well out of balance with the remaining personnel costs of project manager, admin, MoE monitor and programmer totalling $5,000.  Clarification is needed on this point.\n\nNotably the proposal budget breakdown of the 15,000 USD applied for as 15,000 KES (Kenyan Shilling).

This would be a critical metric on the success of the program.  It is mentioned a presentation will be given by the students at graduation, but not whether the presentation quality determines if they graduate.  \n\nThe proposal does not specifically mention the provision of student presentations as evidence, however if the presentations were recorded this would provide some audit evidence.\n\nLikewise the online outreach hub is not mentioned under auditability, but the ability to view this would provide some audit evidence.\n\nMany aspects of the project can only be confirmed by an auditor on the ground e.g. the new wifi installations, teachers involved etc. ", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1614", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3490, "q0": "The proposal described the intention of proposer to sow the seedlings of human resources to spread Cardano blockchain in the future.

This has brought positive collaborations in the community such as increasing future career opportunities, increasing the cryptographic capabilities of the Cardano blockchain...This also helps Cardano reach more disadvantaged people in the community and turn Cardano into the blockchain of choice in Africa.

This helps the reader easily visualize the model of the project and how to deploy it. However, I think this proposal should provide more time to make the project and how long each task in the project is implemented for example, the  400 girls and young women writing an animated series Ada and Naisula, how long will it take them to start writing the story and how long will it take them to finish it?. The budget for this project stated is also consistent with the activities carried out. I think the members of the proposal are all doing well in the necessary tasks.
