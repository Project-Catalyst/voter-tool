The idea is to translate to Sual\u00ed an application that helps people buy Ada and delegate it to some community pool, the application already exists and is well evaluated in the apple store and google play, that is, we will not be betting on the unknown. This directly achieves the objectives of the challenge because at the same time it will benefit Swali speakers (note: I have already seen some proposals aimed at this language in other funds, I did some research and found that one of the most important dialects in Africa, so certainly is very useful to invest in it), it will also help our Cardano blockchain to expand to new horizons. It's important that we make Cardano more accessible to everyone, and language is without a doubt the biggest barrier we face. As stated in the challenge, most pools are located either in the United States or in Europe, if we invest in taking this knowledge to other languages, we will be investing so that in the long term people from different parts of the world can enter the Cardano ecosystem and who knows, become involved enough to create their own pools. A suggestion that I can make for this specific project and include a small guide, which can be in text, video or images format, explaining the main concepts of our ecosystem. For example, if a person who has never heard of Cardano downloads the app out of curiosity, they will be able to understand at least the basics - what is blockchain, cryptocurrency, a pool, etc. That said, I believe that we should finance this proposal, it meets well what we are looking for in the challenge and is not complicated to execute. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Despite being a simple execution proposal, it would be interesting to include more details in this part. For example, the author of the proposal does not specify how long the application translation process would take more or less. It would be nice to set aside some time, so that we can situate ourselves, for example: the project will take place in two months, week 1 being this, week 2 that and so on. It would also be beneficial if we knew who will do the translation, the Swali language is of indisputable importance but I believe it is not as quick to find a professional translator for it, as it would be for Spanish or French for example, because there are many people working with the translation of those languages. Therefore, the author could have included how the selection process for this translator would go, or better yet, if he has someone in mind, introduce that person and their resume. I also missed thinking a little about marketing. We can't expect Swali speakers to take the initiative to play the app's name on the play store/apple store, right? It would be more prudent to draw up a dissemination plan, through which the target audience could get to know and get involved with the app. In this way, we would be even more certain that the desired impact was being achieved. Regarding the developer, it would also be important to know who he is, what his relationship with the Cardano ecosystem is and also a little history of his previous work, in order to convey more confidence in his ability to carry out the proposal successfully. And about the funding, it is possible to have a good understanding of how it will be used, it is a low value compared to the other proposals, but it would also be nice to understand, for example, how long the translation would take to be done to find out the amount of 2k is adequate as a translator's salary. I think that perhaps this professional's hour of work may be more expensive due to the lower number of translators for this language, compared to languages \u200b\u200bsuch as Spanish and French (as I said above). Is it the same? Anyway, I think it is possible to understand the process and how the budget is being used in an ok way, but because it is a more different language it would be important to know the translator who would work here. So I won't give it full marks just because I would like these details included.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Because it is a relatively simple proposal, auditability is also simple. The author does not detail this part of the proposal very well, he says that the success can be measured based on the popularity of the app in Swali and people of that language buying and delegating Ada. In fact, it is the most direct way for us to understand if the project was successful and achieved what it was looking for. However, other ways can be thought of. For example, it would be very positive if a schedule (however short) was attached to the proposal, so that we could monitor whether the translation process was being carried out properly and within the expected time, for example. It would also be positive if any member of the Swali-speaking Cardano community used the app and brought feedback to the rest of the community, is it working well, is it adequate? Another thing I thought about would be that we understand the impact of this on the Swali-speaking cryptographic community. As I said in this evaluation, I have already seen other proposals focused on this language, whether in a challenge aimed at Africa or for translation, so this portion (Swal\u00ed speakers) is very relevant to us in the Cardano community. It would be positive if there was a small satisfaction survey, it could be done directly in the app, which would help us understand what has changed in these people's lives, when it comes to investments and blockchain. And a small 5-question questionnaire in my opinion would be enough, asking things like \u201chave you started to acquire more Ada?\u201d or \u201chave you researched more about Cardano, the activities that can be developed on the blockchain and the difference between our ecosystem and other blockchains/cryptocurrencies?\u201d. That way, a deeper analysis of the impact of the app's translation would be carried out, don't you think?

And one of the consequences of this is also greater strength and disclosure for the ADA and its investment pools.\n\nSo, in the short term, we have benefits being brought both to the African continent and to Cardano.

As a result, the expenses that will be destined for the translation ($2000) are justifiable and understandably higher than the expenses with the previous translation ($1400).\n\nIt's also very encouraging that the amount being earmarked for development remains the same, $400. Once again, as the application was developed by a very experienced professional, it is certainly quite scalable, with no problems in its translation. Also, an email was found to contact the developer via the Play Store: support@colorworkapps.com.\n\nWe also have that as the application already exists and the main differential of this project is its translation, an initial concern with marketing and dissemination is not necessary. In fact, with the growth in the number of Cardano projects in Africa, there will be greater interest in how to invest the return of these projects and, consequently, the expectation is that services such as Pool Peek will become more talked about.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Once again, the way to verify the success of this project is done in a simple way, once the new version available online is validated by the users, through the application's rating.

This web app educates and assists new Cardano users about staking, includes a pool map and a pool search engine. \nThis app has good reviews in Google and Apple app stores, and after having tested it myself, I found it useful, and I confirm I will keep it on my phone.\nEven if Swahili is a widely spoken language in Africa, so is English. The proposer does not show how this proposal will widely contribute to make Cardano the blockchain of choice in Africa. Indication about the evaluation of potential new users would enable a higher impact score.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": " The team intends to hire a professional translation service to support the work and evaluates the budget is 2kUSD.
