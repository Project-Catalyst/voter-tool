We cannot currently meet with most African students and professors.", "f6_no_assessments": 10, "f6_rating": 3.8666666666666663, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 7377, "q0": "The proposal is very good and perfectly aligns with the objectives of the challenges, although I would like more details regarding how the project would be put into practice. In this challenge, we seek to fund proposals that help expand the Cardano ecosystem to Africa. With this, we would benefit, as our blockchain would become popular, acquire more investors, more participants for Catalyst, perhaps qualified labor to integrate the teams of our catalyst projects, in short, we would grow in every way. And in relation to the African continent, it would also clearly benefit, as its inhabitants would be presented with a sea of \u200b\u200bpossibilities, both in terms of investment, employment and source of income (even if not fixed, what is it like to work being CA and VCA, or something more stable like being a designer or developer of some Dapp, for example). In the proposal in question, there is already a group that teaches about 3400 students, according to the proposer, about Cardano and its technologies. The idea here is summed up by the excerpt: \u201cWe want to hire 2 local people to help facilitate the delivery of our educational program to students and teachers in South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya and Morocco\u201d. This certainly fits with our goals in this challenge. The issue is that some detail is lacking. What would be the subjects signed? How many classes would be taught? Would they be online, in person? What would be the language spoken? \u201cOur biggest difficulty is finding an educator who doesn't just speak the necessary languages\u201d; which? How would the target audience be captivated to participate in the project and keep attending the various classes? In short, a series of details remained pending, in my view, so that we could clearly understand what needed to be done. In summary, I believe in the potential of this idea and I think it will have a very positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem, mainly because the group is already active, it would not be a bet in the dark, let's say. These people have already been funded and are already producing knowledge about our blockchain for a wide audience, but seeing this does not exclude the need for us to have a very detailed explanation of how this project would develop in a practical way. Therefore, I will give it 4 stars, the note would be maximum if the explanations were more in-depth. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is no exact roadmap for the project. We know that 2 teachers will be hired who will extend the teachings on Cardnao to a specific target audience, but we don't know, for example: who these new team members would be, how many classes they would teach, as I said in impact, what the exact topics are addressed... I think it would be important to establish a detailed schedule with dates, specifying what would happen in these 2 months. We know that it takes two months because of the explanation of the salaries of professionals, so the most appropriate thing would be to explain what would happen weekly, for example: month 1, first week: hiring professionals + planning of classes + publicity of the course to be offered. Month 1, second week: first class taught, meeting with students, etc etc. In other words, we deeply understand what would happen and when, in addition to what tasks would be delegated to the new professionals involved and what would be under the responsibility of those who are already part of this team. Now in relation to the budget, they are asking for 3600 dollars, a very small amount compared to most proposals. I think this proposal is a fair investment, as it is not so complex (so many different actions will not be developed in parallel), so it is understandable that the cost is lower. The total amount is shared by the salary of the educators, each one receiving 900 dollars a month, a value well compatible with the market. I think it would be important to ask for an extra amount to be invested in marketing, because since the idea is to expand a course on Cardano, we need some advertising to do that, right? There's not even a budget for advertising, so I'm a little concerned about what this facet of the project would look like. Now in relation to the team, we are very well presented to those involved. We know the name of the professionals, what their main functions are, some examples of what they have done so far, as well as their profiles on social networks, where we can learn more about their background. In relation to this, I think the only thing that remained pending would be to present the professionals hired for the project, I know they will still be selected, but more confidence would be conveyed if this had already been included as well. So I think the feasibility is good as we don't have a detailed roadmap, but we do have a direct and satisfactory explanation of the budget and also the team members. To be perfect feasibility, I suggest that the proposer consider my suggestions and further detail this part of the proposal. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of the project seems to be in compliance. Regarding the lawsuit, the proponent claims that a separate digital wallet will be created so that the budget usage is traceable. I thought this idea was very good and should be repeated in all proposals, because that is precisely why we work with blockchain: so that everything is done in the most transparent and decentralized way possible. The proponent claims that regular reports are made to Catalyst: this is really what I tend to suggest in my reviews, because it is through written documents that we can access information in a more direct, but synthesized and practical way. The question is, where would these reports be made available? How could the Cardano community see this? This question could be made clearer. With such a question answered, I think that the monitoring of partial results would already be very well done. Now talking about the main goals, I think the proponent suggests several things like: \u201ceach presentation has 50 students. Students are already qualified for the fit because they are in the field of informatics (developer) and or business and law, areas where the Cardano Ecosystem lacks talent\" and \"measure the number of engaged students, the number of references to Catalyst and we want to create new feedback loops to continue engaging our community by introducing innovative communication channels like Tiktok.\u201d How would these students be monitored? An idea that came to me now is that it could be interesting to promote a general meeting, at the end of the project, where some more engaged students could participate and report directly to the Cardano community how their participation in the classes was, what they are doing now, in what way are getting involved in the ecosystem and so on. This part of measuring engagement in new media, such as tiktok, seems to me a little loose in the proposal. Who would? I think a social media role would suit this team well, as they intend to use social media to their advantage. In summary, I believe that the proponent has dedicated a good part of his explanations as alternatives to auditing his project, it is enough to establish a more direct bridge between the team, the data collected and the Cardano community. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 7, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2428, "q0": "The 'Grow Africa, Grow Cardano' challenge simply seeks to expand Cardano awareness and knowledge throughout Africa. Due to linguistic barriers, this idea implies that contacting African developers is challenging. As a result, the plan proposes to engage local African-speaking developers to promote educational programs in nations including South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Morocco, which have the biggest numbers of developers and computer science students in Africa. Getting team members to offer educational programs and onboard talent into the ecosystem would aid in raising Cardano awareness and helping the project achieve its objective of being the blockchain of preference by 2023. The use-case solutions for Cardano technology are also demonstrated in this proposal. Hence, this proposal effectively addresses the challenge", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provides evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal. The proposer has indicated the team required to implement the proposal and has outlined a budget that is quite clear, broken down and reasonable to achieve the set goals.

This approach empowers local communities in the countries they are targeting - namely: South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Morocco and Egypt. The rationale for this is because these aforementioned countries are said to have the highest populations of developers and students studying computer science in Africa. Hence, there is a great opportunity to make impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There are several languages spoken in Nigeria for example, however, for the majority, English is a commonly spoken language in Nigeria. So my suggestion is that they find team members that at least speak 'Pidgin' (which is 'broken English' which almost all of the Nigerian population can speak and understand) and perhaps the major languages such as Igbo, Yoruba and Hausa. As for countries like South Africa and Kenya, team members that speak Swahili should be able to cover a decent amount of people as this language is shared. For this reason, I believe they could benefit from 3 additional team members rather than 2 as one can speak Pidgin, one can speak Swahili and then the 3rd can speak Arabic (for Egypt and Morocco).\n\nThe salary proposition for the 2 months is good but I would consider 3 new members as mentioned above, so perhaps funds may have to be reallocated. To that end, it would be good to consider additional costs for the team members like electricity/internet which is relatively more expensive. \n\nNonetheless, the existing proposing team is strong and they have been awarded funding from previous Project Catalyst funding rounds.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The plan is clear, however, the team did not mention where the remaining funds will be allocated. They simply stated the salary of their two incoming team members for which this proposal is for. \n\nThey also mentioned that their feedback loop with regards to impact of their previous campaigns need to be strengthened, e.g. surveying previous students. Perhaps they can implemented a feedback loop plan for this project from the onset to help with capturing the value. \n\nAdditionally, I think it's great that they're looking to start a TikTok channel for Cardano content, I couldn't find it when I searched their proposed username so just in case they haven't made it yet, I suggest they do so they can claim the username before it goes.

I see the requirements you have for these two candidates and how they will help you increase the growth of Cardano in Africa.

Development of localized content and tapping educators/ influencers who can speak the language will make it easier to reach students and developers who might be interested in joining the Cardano ecosystem. \n\nThe plan of the proposal is clear.

They also admit the risk that finding an educator who is (a) fluent in both English and South African languages and (b) interested in blockchain is going to be difficult. \n\nTo mitigate this risk, they can check two communities in the region. First, the team can take their chances in the engineering academic community. The salary would probably entice a local professor to try it out and it will automatically reach the target students.
