Since the cost required for the proposal is huge, I recommend asking for a smaller initial amount to make it easier to fund. For example, instead of the proposed 9 fund asking for a 250k/12 month fund, you should split it into $62,500 per fund (3 months). If fund9 is funded and the proposal is properly executed, it will also be easier to apply for funds in subsequent funds. It's also easier for the community to check your recommendations\n3.
