Plutus Internship Cont.", "url": "https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/405052-48088", "category": 26441, "amount": 9000, "description": "There are almost no internship programs for university students to get involved with Cardano, learn Haskell and Plutus.", "f6_no_assessments": 5, "f6_rating": 4.6, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 7464, "q0": "This proposal is very positive for our ecosystem because it will provide instruction, as well as practical work, for young students who want to learn Plutus and work on projects involving this programming language. I think this idea is right in many ways. First, let's make it clear that, in my view, the proposal fits well with what the challenge proposes, as it is not something that would fully fit into any other challenge. It's not about adding new members on board, as the activities here are very specific and only students in the computing and programming area are adept to apply for the internship. It is also not about creating new hubs, as it is a stage and not the formation of a group with unique characteristics. The scope of the proposal is not aimed at any specific geographic region, as the challenges of Africa, East Asia and India are. It's not about developing a Dapp either. That is, in reality it is something that is outside the course and at the same time extremely beneficial for Cardano, since once new students are instructed to work with Plutus, a highly needed qualified workforce will be formed for several projects right here in the Catalyst I myself have already noticed several teams that needed a Plutus programmer. It is difficult to learn this programming language, both because the teachings are mostly in English (I evaluated a proposal that sought to translate Plutus' teaching into Vietnamese, another very good idea); and because it is not so easily accessible, there are not so many courses available, both because it is a very recent technology. Therefore, if two interns are hired to work at Loxe Inc, they will have the best way to learn: in practice. This will be as beneficial for the two interns contemplated as for this company, and especially for Cardano, as these future professionals will have a lot to contribute to the growth of our blockchain. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is great. We know who the stakeholders are, what the development process would look like and exactly how the requested money would be spent. Let's start with the description of the script. This in my view is the only part of the feasibility that could be improved, as we are told which activities would take place each month in a somewhat basic way. For example, in \u201cAugust and September 2022 - Publicize the internship program + Selection process with potential candidates\u201d. Would the disclosure last 1 month and the selection process the other month? How would this program be publicized? Through the Town Halls, social networks, official announcements by email? How will the selection process be? Will the candidates undergo video interviews, as well as practical tests, so that the level of programming knowledge they have at the moment is evaluated? I think it is possible for us to understand which phases the project would consist of, but not with as much specificity as I would like. However, the other parts are excellent. Starting with the budget explanation, we know how the requested money would be used. I believe it is a fair value, it will be 3 months of project and the professionals will dedicate part of their time to instruct the interns, they would gain equipment (computers) and would also be remunerated for their efforts. It is very simple to understand where the requested money would be going. The division of the parts is done in a clear, concise and brief way, but as they are very defined purposes, I do not feel that more details would be necessary for the complete understanding of this part of the proposal. Now speaking in relation to the team, according to the descriptions given, they are highly qualified professionals. We know their names and we have a very detailed description of their resumes, as they are people who are very involved in the Cardano ecosystem and who are implementing their own businesses. We know that you already have some experience with Plutus, as they studied this language and from what I understand, they work with it on a daily basis at Loxe Inc. Therefore, I really believe that they are capable of developing this project very successfully and safely. The way the team is presented is entirely satisfactory. Therefore, the only part of the feasibility that in my opinion deserves more attention is the script, otherwise everything is in order. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditability of the proposal is very possible because the proposers clearly explain how the monitoring of both success and partial results would be done. Regarding the progress (partial results), this auditability can be done as the proponents claim that they will deliver monthly reports to the Cardano community, through meetings with the challenge team and IOG coordinators. In this way, a lot of confidence is transmitted in relation to how the project would gradually develop, I believe that in these reports the team would situate the coordinators both about how the work routine has been (in this case, the training of interns) and the advances obtained that month (if the two interns are learning well what is being taught to them, what results have they already managed to obtain so far, that is, how are they delivering the products created, etc.). Therefore, everything is right when it comes to the auditability of the process. Regarding the success scenarios (final results), I would say that it is quite clear what we are trying to achieve: that the two interns really learn plutus through the teachings and practices at the company Loxe Inc, that the number of candidates per vacancy has the ratio greater than 10 to 1 and that two people are actually selected for the project. It would be very interesting if, after the internship, these young people could give feedback to the Cardano community, in order to explain how they intend to pursue their careers, how this experience was a differential for them, how much they learned, how the company's internal activities improved with your help, etc. This is my suggestion to further improve the final audotability. Finally, my opinion is that yes, it is quite possible for us to audit this proposal, it is very clear which activities should be monitored and how. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 414, "q0": "When looking at the various proposals present in F8, it is noticeable the growing need for Plutus developers to bring various types of projects to life. Another factor that shows this is the average salary paid, which is higher in relation to other languages. With this, we see that the objective of the proposal is quite relevant, as it aims to train professionals specialized in an important area for the evolution of Cardano's ecosystem. In addition, one of the differentials of the proposal is the focus of teaching based on real examples, being a more comprehensive project than just the transmission of technical concepts. As it also has a somewhat unique objective, we noticed that the proposal fits correctly with the goals of the challenge in question. Given all these factors, we see that the requested budget of $9,000 is quite consistent, as the positive impact to the ecosystem with this project is visible.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "We see that the steps for a good execution of the project are explained in a very clear and direct way. It is also interesting to note that the first planned action already indicates a concern with the project's marketing, and that the necessary equipment will also be provided for the intern. As one of the great differentials of the proposal is to provide the participant of the program with real work experiences, we understand that it would be important to provide information about the company involved, as well as about the professionals. And both information is found, both in the description of individual experiences and through the references present on the company's website.\n\nAnother positive point is the team's extensive experience with software development, which is the focus of the proposal, in addition to the high degree of knowledge and specialization of the members. Regarding the details of the budget, we see that the distribution of capital makes a lot of sense, with the amount offered by the scholarship ($500 monthly) being quite fair, as well as the $500 monthly dedicated to training and mentoring, given all the experience of the team and the time that will be reserved.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Regarding the indicated ways to monitor the project, we see that the Agile method for management was mentioned, one of the most used methods today for this purpose, which is a good aspect of auditability. Additionally, the team also organized monthly meetings for follow-up, demonstrating a periodic concern with results.\n\nThe most important differentiator in this section seems to be one of the perceptions of success, the expectation of the candidate per vacancy ratio. This indicator will demonstrate with good accuracy whether the process has managed to generate considerable engagement.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 4, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2060, "q0": "This is a great proposal that needs to be seen by more people. There are not a lot of Plutus developers out there. Having an internship for that position will be extremely helpful in finding those willing to learn the language and to get a start in the industry. I'm sure there are lots of people that would love an opportunity like this. Most people just don't know where to go for it. I would say that this is the hardest part that the proposal will have to address. However, giving a paid internship may be one of the best ways to get the attention of the community and will be an incentive for those that want to learn and participate in the Cardano ecosystem. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The way that this proposal was written is incredible. Especially the portion that highlights the skills and experience of the team. This is very important for readers of the proposers because it allows us to see the team that is going to be working on this project. It also allows the community to keep the team accountable with carrying out the project. Being in the industry for 10+ years and having a member that worked on Liqwid finance is a very good indicator that this team knows what to do. I also think it was really important to create a link with the rest of the team that was not listed. For this reason, I give this section 5 out of 5. I strongly agree with this idea and I find that it will be executed properly. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal has given a lot of valuable information throughout their proposal. It was a nice read and I was able to identify everything. Looking into the roadmap, I noticed how the team will first market the idea and select candidates based on their information. This will ensure that those selected will be a good fit for the platform and will help the Cardano Community in the future. The detailed budget breakdown was written with a good amount of detail showing exactly where the requested funds would go if funded. I like that the information was provided while staying concise and specific. For these reasons, I give 5 out of 5 stars.

However, I understand proposals for that challenge should be directed towards improving the developer ecosystem (so maybe they are attracted), not just hiring developers. Therefore, I agree alignment is good for the miscellaneous challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I agree with the proposers that the biggest risk is that the internship is cut short by the intern resigning, which is quite common in tech jobs (as candidates often find better opportunities as soon as they are in contact with the job market). This is particularly true in this case, as plutus developers are in high demand.  The team expertise, however, must make this internship quite attractive for aspiring interns. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability section for the proposal describes how the teams plans to offer information on projects developed by the interns, not on the internships. I'd say the goal in this case should not be so much project deliverables, but interns perceptions and engagement with the Cardano ecosystem. I'd suggest the team considers an exit survey, or even report on the interns next proffessional moves a few months after the internship ends.

This proposal is aiming to recruit young and fresh talents into our ecosystem while being mentored by more experienced and veteran Haskell developer. The method of nurturing these talents through internship and real-world professional experience is one of the most effective, efficient, and mutually beneficial for all parties involved.  By securing talents early and organically growing them in Cardano-native environment, this will pave way for Cardano communities to gain more hometown-heroes to contribute with developing more and diverse dApps, driving further adoption. I consider this a small, but necessary investment towards the long future of Cardano. We never know where the next Charles, Vitalik, or Gavin can rise from.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Loxe, Inc. team has already proven themselves in previous fund and past Cardano hackathons. The founders are also no strangers in the Catalyst community. Their record of accomplishment is very sound and satisfying delivery of this proposal is very likely. The cost breakdown is adequately detailed and reasonable for such professional internship program. Timeline is also attainable and common in most internship programs. Though we already see similar educational programs from IOG such as Plutus Pioneers, we as a community don\u2019t have to restrict ourselves and consider this as a redundancy. Cardano needs to be accessing and be accessed by talent pools as large and as diverse as possible to realize its vision as the most world-changing blockchain, able to contribute to a better reality.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Since they already did the first iteration in Funds 7, I believe the community would like to know how well the funded internship is faring. I believe Loxe Inc. is doing a decent job in terms of reporting and coordinating the progress and result with the supervising challenge or IOG teams, given how accountable the team with previous fundings. However, I think we need to measure not only numbers of candidates and interns, but also we need to know how the progression of the interns in term of technical (Plutus) skill and other complementary and supporting professional skills, including their personal development. The measurement of the quality of the output is just as important-if not more important to the quantity. We also need to make sure that the recruited interns are treated well and they gain positive experience while trying their best to deliver the community\u2019s expectations. Maybe some testimonies from current interns can convince us to rate this proposal more favorably or even opening doors to grow this proposal into a more complex and larger scale initiative with grander objectives and beneficial impact.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_943", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Provide new Plutus developers with mentorship and real world working experience.", "experience": "Loxe Inc. team, experienced and hackathon winning group of Plutus and AtalaPRISM developers, Gimbalabs PPBL veterans, UX specialist, art direction and designer."}
