A suggestion is to clarify in the proposal if there is a stronger connection to the Cardano community other than it being one of many blockchains.\n\nThis proposal does not aim to go further than a playable POC but the finished product is a physical set, which limits the availability by a lot. In order to make the board game available there is a big workload related to production and marketing that is necessary to bring the POC to a finished product on the market.

Gamification is never easy, and personally I think requires a knack and wit for making interesting games and intriguing mechanisms. I have not seen this demonstrated from the proposer's profile, existing/tested mechanism, plan to acquire new members, or plan to learn it from the players. I would suggest the proposer to demonstrate this more clearly in his proposal next time, and showcase more of the current designs, tested mechanisms, surprises and insights from rounds of testing. \n\n2. Despite iteration is mentioned, the implementation stages have not yet reflected this nature. Currently, it looks like a design and production timeline, rather than a mechanism testing and building process. I would suggest the proposer to focus more on testing and break down the testing process into more step-by-step modules e.g. building an initial testing community (e.g. a group of passionate friends/first adopters), interviewing learners of block chain from different stages to understand what do they appreciate learning about block chain at each stages, making infildelity prototypes (with pen and paper) to test gaming mechanisms with the groups, making initial designs and prints to test mood and feelings, etc.\n\n3. Bringing physical products to life does not stop at initiating or testing it, but also in bringing it to the community or into the market. I would love to see an initial sketch on this matter. Is it a creative common for everyone else to develop further, or a physical card product that need to work with a publisher to publish and distribute, or else? \n\n\t\nHaving said that, I think the budget is quire reasonable if the USD 2000 budget for x4 trials is distributed down to many more cheaper rounds of testing, and to a commited groups of block chain advocates. With that perspective, I think the timeline is quite rush, and final designs and production should be delayed until the end of the testing proces.
