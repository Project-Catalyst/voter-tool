While everyone is looking for new ideas, it's equally true that there were some wonderful ideas and teams who could not prove their potential due to failure to reduce funds. The proposer plans to dig into this gold mine as he/she says and identify the gems that could do wonders to the Cardano community. It's a new approach and certainly unique compared to most of the others in \"Miscellaneous challenge\" and I feel should be given a chance as the ramifications this initiative could bring are beyond measure.  \"Trying not losing any passionate people along the journey is crucial\" is an absolute fortune. The challenge would not face much risk or challenges as this is more of a research phase as the proposer mentions and a part of a huge project that the team is putting together, a one-stop hub for everything for everyone.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provides the readers with an elaborate detailing of their game plan. The phase-wise development and the corresponding deadlines provide the community with the foreseeable result. The mentioning of the proposal being a small part of a big picture the team has added more credibility to the authenticity of the proposal. The extensive amount of groundwork already laid down is another positive to look at. The team put together along with the DLT360 core team looks promising and dependable. The fact that the entire team is flexible and domain experts provide more confidence. Also, the funds requested for is a lot smaller compared to a lot of other proposals in this challenge and is sensible and just being more of a research work rather than any development.  The only concern, I have is regarding the deliverables, a lot of them are common milestones for the bigger project, the milestones for this proposal alone look a little weak and fuzzy to me. Apart from that, it's a great proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There isn't much to track in this proposal, as it's more of digging up previous funding round proposals, but the proposer still makes a commendable effort in providing the community with the kind of outcomes we could expect and decide how the funds were put to good use. The number of identified contributors and cooperative partners, the number of potential ideas long lost are all clear indicators of how well the proposal and team's work has progressed. The success criteria are enhanced versions of these measurable metrics with a benchmark figure that the team assures to reach by the end of their timeline. The proposal being a part of a huge project, on funding, I assume the auditors will have plenty of tracking techniques available to ease their work and make sure the proposal is on track.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 5, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal identifies the problem to be solved as good proposals often go unfunded and this may cause proposers to become jaded.  This project aims to pay attention to these contributors and funnel the ideas to further innovation rather than becoming discouraged.\nThe metrics and goals have a hint of another challenge (Open Standards and Interoperability), but this CA is not sure if it is enough to state this proposal is in the wrong challenge.  The project sounds malleable and scalable, and is a part of a timeline of other Catalyst funded proposals and future Catalyst proposals.\nThe proposer includes a break down of relevance to Cardano's mission, this has legitimacy.

The budget is presented clearly and appears to be realistic to achieve what the team sets out to accomplish in their problem statement.  There is also a clearly laid out plan to achieve end objectives, most with specific bullet points for each objective.

The team realizes that throughout funds 3-7 there have been so many amazing proposals that haven't been fortunate enough to get funded. They propose this funnel to help funnel out those projects that don't have as much value. I think that a CA should be able to help with that filtering system, but there can still be more work done to narrow things down. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I love to see diversity in the Cardano space. It is so great to see people from all over the world trying to share their ideas with the community to further improve this wonderful ecosystem that we have.

I believe that this is a pretty straightforward proposal that has the ability to be extremely useful to Cardano users and members involved in the funding process.

This proposal is judged partly through its individual merits, and partly through the way it fits into the wider DLT360 project. My assessment takes into account aspects common across all proposals (team specific like adequacy, competency, workload, or similar reporting mechanisms / budget logic). You shall therefore find common parts across these proposals (labeled as such) and parts specific to each proposal, which should offer a good balance of looking at each tree but not missing out the overall health of the forest. \n\nSpecific: This proposal wishes to take a closer look at the funnel of proposals from previous Catalyst funding rounds. I think it is a tremendous opportunity to discover and share insights into the behavior of proposers and community advisors and perhaps turn it into amazing insights for the future. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "COMMON part: Great team. DLT360 is operated by an outstanding and growing team of regulatory experts, very active in the Cardano community. They also benefit from a scalable network of contributors from the Cardano community, academia, industry and EU institutions. In terms of team competence, skills and experience, they are well positioned.The multitude of projects funded under their umbrella showcases the great capacity to identify opportunities within the Cardano community and clearly articulate them into actionable projects. \n\nCOMMON part: Significant existing and future workload. DLT360 is a wider project initially funded in Fund6, and greatly supported by at least 5 proposals in Fund7, for a total funding so far of 85.000 USD (own calculations), many of them being still ongoing. During Fund8 the team is casting a very wide net with 13 additional proposals across several challenges, for a total funding of 295.000 USD. Onboarding so many projects so quickly can potentially lead to: too much workload, overlapping deadlines, increased risks of under-delivering, inability to distinguish added value of one project versus another, unnecessary stress and a lack of focus on and core scope and competencies. Future iterations that can bring comfort to these worries will of course be highly appreciated. \n\nCOMMON part: ALL of the 13 projects have overhead items included in the budget (project management, social media, back office, etc.) consuming an overall 30-40% of each budget (an educated guess let\u2019s call it). I think there was a missed opportunity there in terms of gathering all overheads under one roof and simplifying the budgets for all proposals by keeping them strict for core-activities.\n\nSpecific: Half of the budget goes towards the actual analysis, and although there is not much detail regarding the way in which the assessment would be performed it can be a great exercise for the community. The project would be scheduled in Q3 2022 but no further details are being offered.  I somehow feel that the proposal is missing a few details regarding who actually performs the analysis and what tools will be used. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "COMMON part: Existing track record. DLT360 projects are interlinked and since there are a number of running projects the team is definitely familiarized with the standard procedures and reporting process of the Catalyst team, so there are very low risks in terms of failing to communicate properly or inability to implement the necessary KPIs. \n\nCOMMON part: The website is a great opportunity for improvement. A concern is the fact that glancing at the DLT360 website, there is no reflection of recent live presentations that were perhaps delivered to the community in Q1 2022. I am aware that it is a work in progress tool, and a very nice-to-have feature would be for such live presentations / slides / supporting materials to be uploaded there as soon as possible and be accessible for the community as an intermediate deliverable until the projects are finalized. Also for the sake of transparency, a user-friendly list of funded (any why not unfunded) proposals would definitely be appreciated, at least by future CAs.   \n\nSpecific: basic KPIs are offered: number of identified partners to carry on the analysis, number of domain experts on-boarded.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1454", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "\"The background context, intention and purpose of the project are clearly stated in this proposal. The proposers also mention their previous success as their proposal were funded in Fund 6 and Fund 7, which partly proves their ability and the likeliness of success for this project. The contributions to Cardano ecosystem are explicitly demonstrated by the proposers, which are highly likely promising and largely benefits the ecosystem. The proposers seem to have high awareness of their current backward of depending on Catalyst funds, thus, they also have a long-term vision for solving that, which is a good point of this proposal. However, in the first part of introducing this solution, the proposers indicate the potentials and opportunities that rejected proposals and ideas would gain from this project but those information are not comprehensive enough to me. If they could provide further details on how their project could make impact on and benefit the community, this part would be better and more persuasive in my opinion.\nSince they are choosing the Miscellaneous Challenge, their current illustration for challenge alignment is quite enough.\nTheir foreseen risks and challenges are understandable. They do mention that in the solution description part, and in this part, it is provided with some more details. Yet, generally in this part, I think it is important to understand their whole picture, whole project, so it  would be better if they can provide the link to their funded project in Fund 6 or they could make a brief demonstration to the whole project for better understanding. \"", "q0r": 4, "q1": "\"If in the previous part, I have some inquiries for how this project works, in this part, the proposers have shown a significantly thorough demonstration about their project and how it works.
