Students are the next generation of builders, it is a brilliant idea to introduce them to the Cardano ecosystem as early as possible. The proposal is doing this in the form of paid internships which is a good idea since it will incentivize the students to take on this challenge without feeling used. Some companies have brough negative associations to internships where they have used students as free labor for short term gains. \nIt is indicated in the proposal that the internship is remote and candidates all over the world will be considered which is a plus since it is more inclusive by definition. It is hard to find an argument against the impact of this proposal, therefore it is given a rating of 5-stars in this section.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I have a few questions that might be interesting to reflect around.\nHow and where will you market the idea to reach out to as many suitable candidates as possible and make it more inclusive? If you would fail to find great candidates, will you extend your search or will you take the most suited students that are available?\nAll in all, the team behind the proposal is well known within the community and they are credible. I have no doubt at all that they have the expertise and knowledge succeed with their internships if the proposal were to be funded. \nScore given: 5-stars.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team have a plan for external auditing and provides relevant and easy to measure KPI's.
