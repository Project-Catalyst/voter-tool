A major concern about the former is the focus on Youtube and other very specific language in the challenge setting; the specificity of that challenge precludes any relation to this proposal. The author intends to create mixed-media educational resources for students across the globe (mainly LatAm, U.S., Germany and Africa) and ranging from 14 to 18 years of age. The education material is referred to as packs and will initially be focused on the following subjects: Metaverse, Web 3, AI, Machine Learning, Blockchain, NFTs. This will certainly broaden the awareness of not only Cardano but also the entire industry. The author does mention scalability, there are no discrepancies here since the program has the ability to scale at will. Risks are mentioned in depth along with mitigations but the author does not include the ever-changing nature of these technologies as a risk; deprecation and protocol changes happen frequently. It would have been nice for the proposer to address mitigations for these very real risks.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has not listed additional team members but given the author\u2019s experience as an actual author and educator, along with the vast number of contacts with teachers and media professionals leaves little doubt concerning capabilities. Given the various educational platforms outlined, the amount of research required and the scope of the proposal, the budget is within reason. One area of minor concern, as stated in feasibility, is the impact of an ever-changing industry and how best to mitigate those issues while likewise keeping the educational material relevant. Appending materials is not mentioned but is a common practice, the same for change notices. Overall, the proposer has a firm grasp on the requirements necessary to accomplish the tasks outlined in the 6-7 month. Coordination amongst the various industrial contributors will be a huge task in itself. The entire proposal is very detailed and well written.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The author intends to create a project dashboard highlighting the progress and events as they become complete, however a platform or link are not identified. Conveying the dashboard\u2019s location later does not provide the same reach as its inclusion within the proposal and is something the proposer may wish to consider for future proposals. The timeline has been mentioned previously in feasibility. The proposer intends to publish the material with a non-commercial attribution under Open Education Resources which falls under the Open Solutions system of open source materials. Other KPIs include scaling the project beyond these 6 core areas. There are many important areas not covered in these summary metrics and the voter is encouraged to read the entirety of this well-written proposal. Aside from the few concerns previously noted, this proposal is an excellent step in the right direction to educate the younger generations on important technologies in understandable and comprehensible terms.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_591", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 822, "q0": "I found this proposal to be well organized, clear, and thoughtful.  And there is truth to the author's argument that educational resources proposed here offer to benefit Cardano by helping to generate a wider audience of people who are capable of actively being part of it.  However, it was also my analysis that this project aims to deliver general knowledge on a wide range of tech topics having no direct link to impacting Cardano.  And while I do think the project has some utility, I'm concerned that, a) I'm not sure it's Cardano's or Catalyst's responsibility to provide general tech/blockchain education to the mass market, b) I'm concerned that the speed of innovation in this space may cause content produced by this project to be outdated shortly after it is produced, and c) I didn't see any demonstrated evidence that the author was a stakeholder in the cardano community, other than having received funds for an education related initiative in F7.  If the funding requested represents the entire funding for this idea (as opposed to partial funding or co-funding by the proposer) I wonder if there is some non-bias was to proceed with a project like this, but give credit to Cardano/Catalyst as a way to ensure that it is included as part of the educational materials.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The budget and roadmap breakdown are well structured relating to timeline, real deliverables, and reporting KPIs, indicating a high level of confidence that the proposer has the interest and capability to implement his plan.

The argument that things evolve so fast that we shouldn't create content to explain them makes no sense at all. So, how can people become up-to-date?
