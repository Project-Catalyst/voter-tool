He also mentions the \"cost of ADA at the time of minting\" as a potential challenge in delivering this solution, which is might not be relevant when considering that minting is generally a fixed cost in ADA, and this proposal is requesting funding to execute that process.  He has also budgeted $7000 for minting 1000 CNFTs (an average cost of $7/CNFT) even though the minting and transfer cost combined would likely only total just over $0.3 for each, indicating ADA price would need to be more than 20x higher than it is today in order for the price to have any affect on the budgets presented in this proposal.  The timeline is present but basic.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The author's metrics for auditability mainly consist of \"monitoring,\" \"testing,\" and \"measuring\" with the overall success measured by transactions - apparently up to 1000 as this is the number of CNFTs they want to distribute.  The artwork sample presented offers not enough detail to evaluate the style, theme, or plan for this art series, and based on an average cost of $38/CNFT, the project would need to deliver a high level of perceived value to a small community, which would be very difficult to evaluate from an auditing perspective.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1224", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 905, "q0": "The proposal addresses a marketing pull-through problem which needs to be solved that the Misc. Challenge is best suited for. Creating a desirable NFT gift / giveaway removes the cost barrier to entry for someone who's never interacted with Cardano before.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Over 10 yrs experience with luxury brand event production and content creation shows the project will be handled by a professional. However, it would help to validate the experience claims if there were professional links or documentation provided to showcase the person and their experience. Ex: linkedin or similar, relevant social media handles, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or CV to show there are real people behind the team member names listed in proposal.  The plan set forth is very simple and easy to understand. A little more detail behind any initial ideas or possible NFT design strategy would be useful. It would be interesting to know where the name Candy-Pop came from and if the free NFT's will be connected to a future game. Any initial ideas for how the finished NFT's will be launched and given away would be helpful as well. Does the potential CNFT receiver have to do the work and enter a contest to win? Will it be a cross-promotion with another project where the CNFT's will be airdropped to current holders of an already established community? Or will the project build up a discord of it's own community members who are excited to receive these free CNFT's to gift to their non-crypto or Cardano curious friends (and become mini CNFT ambassadors in an organic way)?\n\nAlso important to note: The amount requested is $38,000 for a total of 1000 CNFT's being given away. The cost to acquire a new CNFT wallet holder is $38 each. In addition, the free ADA minting fee of $7000 for only 1000 free CNFT's is rather high. A reference to which minting service the proposer is using would be helpful in addition to a sliding scale showing what the minting price would be at different ADA prices.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal has an easy to read roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement. However, a little more detail on some of the roadmap and milestone elements would be helpful since there is not very much information to reference elsewhere in the proposal. Ex: What would auditing traffic and transactions look like since this is free giveaway. Also, clarification on what defines a unique wallet is needed in order to understand how it will be communicated to the public and tracked. A few questions to consider: How will the CNFT giveaways ensure they are truly going to brand new wallet holders instead of those who already hold CNFT's since different wallet addresses (no matter if they already hold CNFT's or not) can be considered unique from each other? Will the giveaways all be given away in the 3rd month or across a longer time period? \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1231", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5937, "q0": "It is unclear what is the added value to Cardano ecosystem based on the identified problem and the provided solution to the problem.
