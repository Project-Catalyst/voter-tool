It will be nicer if the proposer can include some successful case-studies to make the proposal be more reliable. \nThe proposer put lots of effort in explaining on detailed about how the proposed solutions will address the challenging. The proposal aim to not only support for new people who want to join in the ecosystem but also activate both the Cardano community and outside of that. It also target to involve youth, the active and dynamic people to make the ecosystem be stronger and reputable. \nKPIs and Metrics were mentioned clearly with both qualitative and quantitative indicators that all stakeholders have to consider when applying it.

NFTs act as tradeable certificates of authenticity for digital art, memorabilia or fan merchandise. Most of the people around the world have only heard about these terms but have no idea how the block chain works and the benefits of it.

Providing education on such topics is on of the major challenges in todays world and the proposer has identified the problem and is working towards a solution for it which should be appreciated and by doing so it clearly educates more people on blockchain and cardano which will add more value to cardano platform.

I was given this impression as the budget provided shows that the owner had already invested 50,000 USD into the project.
