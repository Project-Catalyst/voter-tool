And user can explore WordPressMultisite, Bubble, Adalo, Stacker, Glide, Fliplet, Dropsource, Outsystems, Appsheet and many others. where people can use the tools without requirement of any instructor which will also boost spanish people to invest in cardano related projects hence this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "ProofSpace is a no-code platform for building & deploying SSI, since ProofSpace Dash and ProofSpace App are ready for localisation, the team is also an multilingual  which has people of all languages.\nAs it has right partner of ProofSpace ,it just needs one Spanish expert to translate all the data in the form of documentation, later which can be implemented and tested and check the outcomes of the translation, which is not difficult task to complete.

The budget was broken down in deliverables with the respective costs and seems to be reasonable due to the tasks. In addition, the proposal gives information about the experiences of the team members and they are reasonable to make the project happen. They need a translator and want to find him/her inside the Cardano ecosystem and that makes real sense. Finally, the proposal explains the risks and ways to mitigate each one of them. Part of the plan to mitigate the risks counts with an additional budget. Would that budget depend on a new Fund? ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The problem is clear as well as the proposed solution. The roadmap and the milestones also are clear and coherent with the project.
