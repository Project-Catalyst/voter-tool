I am just starting to get into the NFT space and this would be absolutely amazing for bringing NFTs to the masses, and best of all set cardano apart from the rest of the Blockchain ecosystem. The only worry I have is the \"allow friends and family access\" to the NFTs that someone purchased. I feel as if that takes away from exclusivity of the NFT, unless it is up to the owner of said NFT to control access (as opposed to the artist). Would also like to know how centralized this platform would be as the embodiment of cardano is decentralization.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The only thing that worries me is the centralized nature of the platform. If there is a way to give more power to the users then I think you guys would have a home run.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I would like to see more social engagement of your milestones.

From what I\u2019m given to understand in the proposal, apparently this proposal is a description of a VR 360 showroom dedicated to displaying and trading NFTs while ensuring the artists and followers are lawfully protected. I\u2019m personally thrilled with the idea since to my knowledge, there are yet many successful virtual showrooms that fully captivate the attention and interest of both artists and the interested audience. Hence, enabling them to have just that is a remarkable success by any means, and especially when the project is migrated to Cardano, it should theoretically draw in more people to join our ecosystem. The proposer has managed to deliver a well-made demonstration of the functions and security features that this project possesses, and also lists of potential obstacles in the foreseeable future, followed by viable resolutions for each. The only tweak I\u2019d add to this proposal is some mention of key metrics, preferably in figures (though I assume that won\u2019t be too likely)", "q0r": 4, "q1": "From the timeline and plan laid out by the proposer, I do believe that the proposal will be able to roll out a desirable outcome. Given that this is not a large-scaled project, the requested budget sounds legitimate.

Nevertheless, that member does come with the information of relevant background and expertise (though I would prefer if the proposer also included some affiliated links or online profiles for further verification), and the proposer does claim to bring in more personnel, which shows promising signs of this project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Here in this section, the team notes down 2 versions of success in 2 different periods of time, and the KPIs for measuring those successes, which I find relevant.

The market is so huge already and imagine introducing 3D NFT's into the marketplace. People would be so attracted towards it and is definitely going to make a major change in the NFT marketplace as it is the first time someone is implementing such thing. The proposer has uniquely identified a need for the 3D effect in NFT and has also worked towards the implementation which is impressive and by introducing 3D NFT and live marketplace it will attract a lot of people to get involved in this and hence increase the popularity and face value of the cardano ecosystem.

If this proposal will be ever funded, it would change the whole game of the NFT collector when the content inside the NFT is only available for the owner. The most exciting about NFT3D is viewers can view NFT with animation or interact with them, so this will add huge value to the NFT marketplace. NFT3D Live auctions are designed like a showcase room where buyers feel like walking in the museum but on the virtual platform.

The author mentioned that he would hire NFT design/creation and other animation, or 3D work as they had collaborated in the past, I suggest providing their name or link to their work would significantly improve your feasibility. Moreover, migration should be a priority since it takes a longer time to test and launch in a new ecosystem. For example, all the NFT creation and 3D works are ready and functional perfectly with NEO 3D Live, but it cannot be compatible with the Cardano ecosystem, then lead to a delay in the delivery date. The other limitation is that each conference can only handle 25 people while the growth of Cardano community is exponential.
