The Cardano ecosystem will benefit from a top down approach to visibility and onboarding people at the City level, utilizing NFT's for artists, city improvements, entrepreneurs, and Cardano specific community events. The goals align with the Misc. Challenge settings as there are no other challenges focused on Fundraising incubators / co-ops as an entity initiative. (However, this may have fit into the Scaling Up Community Hubs possibly for Las Vegas)", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind this proposal did an excellent job and put the extra effort into creating the attached video in order to introduce themselves and their experience. In addition, their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s are all attached for even more transparency. Their experience ranges from security, law enforcement, regulatory compliance, legal practice, gaming, crypto start-up advising, and event management. Richard is a also a retired U.S. Marine Corp  veteran. The proposal says they are establishing relationships to establish a charter and roadmap. It would be helpful to know how many individuals are already on board, how many are currently being talked to, and how many or which companies/independent contractors were targeted for these critical elements of success? The plan is very simple and easy to understand. More details on execution (even if tentative and subject to change) or ideas for what the local government fundraising, tokenomics strategies, and Cardano integrated events could look like would help greatly.   Ex: Are there plans to partner with CNFT Con coming to Vegas in October? Could there be events for local artists to win a paid booth at the show or could this new chartered organization sponsor a whole area at CNFT Con for local artists exposure? What would be the amount needed to provide this? What would the strategy for First Friday implementation or working with Fremont Street on a free sponsored concert series that features Cardano musical talent potentially look like? Could CNFT's be implemented as easter eggs or featured on the Viva Vision Light Show consistently?  Is there a way to integrate a Cardano area into the Life is Beautiful music festival featuring local artists and Cardano onboarding education for festival goers? Can there be cross promotion marketing done on Twitter/social media for the Cardano community at large (maybe ppl from the community come help out at the Cardano area in exchange for free tickets to the festival) \n\nEven though there are no artists or people from the creative community on the team at this time, they will be included in developing the tokenomics strategy. \n\nThe team has a realistic approach to their timeline and managing risk. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It wasn't until the \"what does success look like\" section that a glimpse of what the NFT strategy was fully understood. This fundraising group will partner with artists to create NFT's for fundraisers to improve the city. It would be interesting to understand what the payment structure will look like for the artists. Are they receiving an up front commission for what they create as well as a portion of the initial sale profits? Knowing what percentage of profit sharing they will be receiving would be helpful. \n\nThe Proposal provided a simple, but effective measuring progress plan with monthly progress reports. For the timeline or roadmap, the details around the 3 Development phases could have been expanded upon in greater detail for transparency. Overall, proposer has the experience and a realistic, achievable plan ", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1231", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The fundraising LV Arts District seek to use DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) for fund raising to address the Miscellaneous Challenge. It is unclear as to the relationship between Pinnacle Consulting Advisor and the City of Las Vegas as the proposal has not mentioned why they are selected to be the party to deploy the fund raising solution using blockchain technology. As the scope of implementation will be city wide, there would be a good amount of awareness about Cardano. However, they do not elaborate in detail how the city's NFTs and tokenomic strategies would be different than individual ones. It leaves a few questions on why the city of Las Vegas wouldn't mint NFT themselves as the minting cost is not high and can be done relatively simple. This is in contrast if the city of Las Vegas would engage the consulting firm, it would raise the transparency issue on how they select which consultancy firm to use for these services.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There is only a YouTube clip where each team member explain their past experiences and how excited they are to join the project but there is no link to check their profile. Neither does the proposal share the link of City of Las Vegas, their working partner. Majority of cost will go into development (3 items) but no technology is specified so this makes project questionable in term of feasibility. The timeline is also stretched 6-12 months (while the delay of a few months is understandable) the gap between early delivery and late delivery should not be this big. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The project milestones are also not listed clearly. The monthly update for the project is sufficient but the proposal should be able to specify in numerical figures like how many artists, how many arts etc. Again there is no information and it would be hard for community to track progress and see the project completion. The team could have given the metrics that define the success of the project. The proposal should have a better understanding and share with the community how they will be able to be the curator of NFT for the City of Las Vegas.
