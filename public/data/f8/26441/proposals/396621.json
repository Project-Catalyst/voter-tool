The impact of this project being funded depends on the cooperation and willingness to participate in the events. The benefits are directly to the new proposers, because they could have an early feedback on their proposals and have a tribune where they can present and or ask questions that need answers. Indirectly the benefits are spread to the whole community. \nI strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Feasibility section of this proposal is very short, a month for the scheduling and execution of each event.\nThe budget for this proposal is outlined broadly, no specific hours or positions or remuneration per hour. The voter just knows that one event costs $5000, $2000 for organization, $2000 for execution and $1000 for post tasks. The voter should decide if the events bring sufficient value to cover the cost.\nThe feasibility of this project is very high, it is backed with history of completed projects and the community trusts the team of Swarm. Unfortunately the proposer does not outline the individuals that will comprise the exact team that will work on this project.\nThe proposer has the financial incentive to complete the project in order to receive funding next time, because this is a recurring event. \nI strongly agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This project is easy to audit, because everything is out in the open and the community will see it happening. The success is simply defined and the only thing needed for this proposal to be defined as a successful is for the events to happen.

Things to improve - a budget could have been described in more detail - 2k for organization - organization of meetings online? How many people will be involved? is it calculated on some hourly wage/ or how it is made? Also, even that it is stated that there is CatalystSwarm - it would be nice to see some representatives, 2-3-4 people,  and the most ideal would be - a list of people who will be involved from CatalystSwarm on these meetings.

So auditing the final success by proposer KPIs as number of attendees (basically] is enough to check whether there was a traction. \n\nSlightly off-topic suggestion -  maybe a questionnaire sent to all participant at the end, with some questions regarding their satisfaction e.g. whether it was helpful, if they formed new collaborations, if they would join the next time, and such, to reflect better whether the community is finding appreciation in such \"fests\" and at the same time, give community the possibility to provide ways how to improve. (assuming you will want to host it again in the future, via catalyst funds, having such records can increase the overall impression of the proposal).

What worries me here is the cost. Each event would cost 5 thousand dollars, 10 thousand dollars are requested, that is, 2 events would be covered with this funding. I think the events are very beneficial because better proposals can generate better projects, which will have a better impact and thus help Cardano to expand as a blockchain, help consolidate Ada, etc. But I don't know if the price is justifiable, I will comment further on this in the topic of feasibility. So, although I like the core of this proposal, I think it could be a little more affordable and that part could be better detailed as well.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Unfortunately I found this part very insufficient. All parts are said superficially. The roadmap only mentions what will be done in certain months, but these activities are not explained, despite being quite complex, constituting the entirety of the project: \"Scheduling and execution of Challenge Fest Fund 9\". What happens in pre-production? Who will do what? Regarding the budget, I think it is also explained in a very basic way. Why is $2,000 needed for organization? Who will do what, in what order, and why? Now talking about the team, it is said that the members of Catalyst Swarm are very experienced and engaged. But who are they? What are your names, what jobs have you done before? How can we prove that they are prepared for this? I think it would be necessary for more detailed explanations to be attached to each of these parts.\n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Like the previous topic, this one leaves a lot to be desired. All metrics chosen to measure progress are numerical. It would also be important to have qualitative information, that is, to understand in a more human way how things are happening. Were all the professionals involved carrying out their tasks properly? And how can we prove this? What advances can be measured in pre-production, how will the Swarm team make this information available to the Cardano community? And talking about the final success, no scenario is drawn, it is only said that the success would be considered when the event took place. But I think that's the basics. In addition to knowing if it happened, we also need to know how it happened, what impacts were generated for Cardano and how this can be measured directly. I believe that this part needs to be revised and improved, it is not possible to monitor well neither the process nor the results of the way the information is dictated here.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10783, "q0": "This proposal is actually a request for funding in continuation of an existing project in the community.

And communication is the glue that holds us together as a community, that makes the Catalyst community a living organism.  \n\nThere is no doubt that with the passage of iterations (of funds, of cycles, of experiments) many elements are depurated: excesses of greed, excesses of humility, excesses of realism, excesses of idealism. However, this beautiful process does not occur without scenarios that dynamically facilitate it: that make possible clashes and consensuses, that eliminate what is left over and highlight what is missing, all in real time.  \n\nHaving participated in Swarms and Town Halls in the 5 continents, I can say without a doubt that the work done by the Swarm has positive and productive effects on the entire ecosystem, to the point of making its model completely feasible and reproducible, which means the eventual disappearance of its creators as owners of their own creation. This is the fate of good ideas: to dissolve into the system, in absolute silence. \n\nI know the work of the proponents and how it has proven its own value in practice.  Therefore, my qualification is not directed at the proponents, it is directed at their work.    ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It is evident that the Roadmap and budget descriptions are short on detail.  The details about the team members suffer from the same weakness.  As a user, I don't mind, I'm already getting a good product.  However, as a reader and analyst, I would prefer to know more about the secret sauce: I would prefer to know more about each of the Roadmap activities (what is the planning and execution process for each of the two related activities, what are the sub-activities that are carried out).  In the same vein, I would prefer to know more about the related activities in the budget and details about the team executing the proposal.  \n\nI hazard a guess that this is simply an overconfidence in a product that the proposers already know works and not a desire to withhold information in a decentralized environment of which they have demonstrated full awareness.    \n\nSpecific recommendation for the next IdeaFests and ChallengeFests: eliminate the division by Rooms.  The attendance per Room is very low, therefore the exposure of the proposals to the public is reduced (most of the attendees in each room end up being the same proponents).  However, with all proposals in the main room, the exposure of each proposal to the number of community members is increased.  Reducing the speaking time for proposals to 2 minutes and establishing 5-minute question sessions for several proposals at a time (in a methodology of, for example, three presentations in a row and then a 5-minute question block for those three presentations) is a strategy that would increase the benefits for each proposal, in terms of being likely to be known by a larger number of community members.   The above strategy was implemented at TH East Asia's recent IdeaFest Reels2.  Each proposal was exposed to an average of 60 people, 6 times the average number of people in the format per room.  In turn, such a rapid fire format reduced audience fatigue significantly.  \n\nAdditionally, a way for non-proponent audiences to attend the events should be created: examples of success cases are the weekend Swarms and weekly Town Hall.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Given the nature of the IdeaFest and ChallengeFest events, the KPIs in the proposal are quite clear and promote a practical measurement of results.
