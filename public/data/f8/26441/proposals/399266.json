Cardano is in the ever-growing Basho era, when the projects and the amount of information are increasing, this proposal is very useful for the community, as well as finding new users to come to Cardano.

From my perspective, Cardanocube.io can completely add Event functionality simply using the Eventbrite extension, or using another similar plugin from the Webflow marketplace at the following link: HTTPS://university.webflow.com/integrations-type/event-management. Now Cardanocube.io is also built using Webflow toolkit, so the integration can be completed smoothly.

With a website built with Webflow, when the proponent adds an upcoming Event section, it is very simple and can be completed quickly using the built-in Webflow toolkit component, the cost of the component this is very cheap, maybe the webflow price package the proponent is using already includes this extension, so the proposer needs a budget of 6,000 USD I find it unreasonable.
