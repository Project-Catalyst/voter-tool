The biggest difference in question may not be the teaching itself, as other proposals have similar objectives, but the target audience as well as the previous experience on the part of the proponents. We therefore believe that a future success of this proposal would bring obvious benefits to Cardano's ecosystem, by increasing its visibility and also the number of proposals being submitted. Given the project model, we also noticed its scalability and the positive impact in the medium/long term that can be brought to Cardano. However, it should be noted that the budget does not seem so well adjusted given the actions that are planned to be taken, and perhaps the requested amount of $22,480 is too high.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "One of the positive factors that makes us believe in the feasibility of the project, as mentioned above, is the team's previous experience in the work of transmitting content. We realize that the scope is not limited to simply teaching about Cardano and its benefits, we also see a clear concern from the team to monitor the project results and support the students who are being contemplated, which seems to contribute positively to the feasibility. In addition, the team responsible for the proposal also made available ways to contact and their experiences seem to contribute to the progress of the project, but it is noted that the LinkedIn address: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-g- 30a144188/ is showing as invalid. Another point is that it would be interesting to observe more clearly the temporal division of the actions to be carried out, that is, to understand what would be carried out in the initial months, in the middle of the project and also in the final stage. We know what the team intends to do, but we don't have a clear idea of \u200b\u200bhow it will be accomplished. When it comes to budget detail, most capital allocations make sense, but some seem to be very expensive. We understand how important everyone is to the execution of the project, but it seems, for example, that $5,000 for a 10-hour work week for 3 months is too high, not least because the project leader will receive $6,000 for a work schedule. of 37.5 hours per week, also considering the period of 3 months. But we can cite as a positive feature of this budget division the concern of the team in promoting the project, as demonstrated by the capital allocations for marketing campaigns and the incentive program.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "We noticed an indication of parameters that will be used to track the progress of the project, such as measuring the number of students engaged and ideas that were funded. But for this explanation to be more complete, it would be nice if other additional metrics had also been used, for example, it could be verified if the students' proposals in general bring ideas for solving problems using specific knowledge of their courses. It would also be interesting if, in the perception of the project's success, some more numerical goals had been used, such as an expected number of new ideas that were financed or a certain amount to be reached of teachers who were interested in the idea and will disseminate it in their classes.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 2, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3491, "q0": "The proposal is a part of a continuing project so that the intentions of proposer to address challenges could be shared concretely and in such an evident-based manner. In the proposed solution, it was clearly shared about the context of the funding project before, where the proposer already challenged in other challenges. By the way, idea about the project was share in such a very detailed way, including what function of the project and how the beneficiaries can be beneficial from the project. Main activities were shared briefly as well. To increase the reliable of the proposal, it can be added several case-studies to increase the reliable of this project. \nKey metrics were put in detailed including both quantitative and qualitative data, so, the proposer can ensure that the propose contents could be achieved through these clear challenges. By the way, the proposer can add a bit more explanation on how they are going to implement these metrics in practice, to ensure its relevant. \nRisk and solutions were described sufficiently in the proposal. Audiences can understand easily if risk happened in reality, how the proposer can tackle on it. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Up to the timing of the proposal, this on-going project already approach to a certain amount of student to date. There was the explanation from proposer that, time might not be fixed yet as process require more time and methodology from team members. However, in case of funding to any project without specific information about roadmap and intention to do each step under a certain of time, there will be no supporting factor for approval or decision to help. It is better to write down the tentative road map as much clearer as possible so that all people can catch and convince on its feasibility. \nBudget breakdown was done by the proposer. it is quite detail in itemizing budget. It will help all people follow the mentioned financial flow easily. \nFor human resource, team composition was put already by the proposer with detailed profile of each person. With the experiences of this team members, which include both experiences in kinds of virtual activities organizing as well as intensive technical knowledge, proposed activities could be done smoothly. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal already includes opinions of proposer about how they can measure the progress and the development of the project. Mostly, the proposer want to check and share about the output of the training, as well as intentions do some analysis for better metrics. By the way, they can consider about how to add more outcome indicators, that showed more qualitative results of the project to audiences. \nThe success of project was mentioned in details by the proposer. With this information, it might support all stakeholders to have common vision on how to reach to it by the end of the project. \nThe proposer already mentioned that, this project is a continuation of a previously funded project.

They have outlined how the key demographics and institutions they will be targeting will bring value to cardano. This type of content and outreach has a high potential to scale significantly in the future and reach a global audience, as well as key organizations within various educational institutions.

As this proposal has potential to reach a wide network of people in various ways, it may be challenging to track and trace every specific KPI, however the overall success of the proposal will be easily viewable by the community.

The proposal wants to increase awareness of Cardano among students and college and university graduates. . The solution is to spark interest in blockchain by educating them by zooming in on a daily basis and assisting in the development of a proposal with goals. Of course, the problem and solution are obvious and it is within the scope of the challenge, as evidenced by the fact that it has received funding from previous funds. However, I have a small suggestion that you should change the title of the proposal to match the proposals from previous funds, that will help the community have a more familiar view.\nThe proposal outlines some of the potential challenges and risks that may be encountered in this proposal and also offers options for addressing them.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The budget required for this proposal is $22,480, which is presented in great detail, allowing the community to easily audit by knowing how the funding is being used.

However, compared with the results achieved, it can be seen that fund 7 is active. ineffective action. The reason I say it doesn't work here is that after funding at fund 4 & 6, the project attracted 3320 students, but at the end of fund 7, the number of students reached by the project was only 3,400 people.

Number of participants (40 / day Zoom / Twitch) (down from the last 100 funds) \"both funds match so the number of 200 or 100 people reduction compared to the previous fund will be based on what data to compare Besides, the suggested KPI 1 also explains \"This KPI is being DROPPED in FUND 8 because it is no longer being tracked\" this is also my question point if this indicator is not being tracked.
