This is a necessity. I appreciate this idea.\nFor the account, I think it's better to use 1 account, which has 2 functions: provider account and customer account, instead of 2 types of accounts. This minimizes account junk and brings convenience to users.\nFor Service pricing, the prices of services are relatively cheap, which can be good to support the community, but will not bring revenue to the project, which will affect the project's lack of profit. Profit don\u2019t enough to run long term. And doesn't attract many CAs. To solve this, it is possible to create ready-made templates for project construction (these templates have a low service cost), and direct CA consultation (more expensive), especially CA will have many levels of service. and consulting prices for each level.

This project will help connect these pieces of the puzzle together to make a good idea a reality.\n- Help Catalyst have more quality proposals, more CAs with better assessment skills\n- The project has a multi-language translation to help more people know and deliver Catalyst\n- The project states the specific services to be provided to the market\n***Projects that need improvement:\n- The proposal does not have criteria for evaluating and selecting service providers on the marketplace.\n- The proposal provides too many services in different fields: Catalyst, Marketing, financial consulting, community building, interpretation...with unspecified target market\n- The proposal does not have a penalty mechanism for poor quality services\n- The proposal does not have a process to protect service users if there is a conflict between the two parties\n***Suggestions/ advices:\n- There should be specific evaluation criteria for service providers on marketpalce to ensure the quality that the project provides. Avoid fraudulent, poor quality services that affect the user experience for Catalyst\nFor example, how many years of experience does the person giving the CA training skill need, the minimum number of CAs that have been trained. Among those CAs, there should be a minimum of how many CAs receive how many bonuses in 1 Catalyst fund.\n- The project should clearly state the target market of the project.

Running expense is calculated for 1 year but hosting is for 3 years.\n- The admin fee is low, which will affect the quality of human resources\n- The project to locate the target market is quite large, so the cost of $1,000 for marketing is too little to be effective.\n***Suggestions/ advices:\n- The project is currently available in the community in Vietnam, so the first steps if the project focuses on the Vietnamese market for testing, modification and upgrade will be much more advantageous. After operating well in Vietnam, the project can expand to Japanese and Korean markets...\n- The cost allocated to each item should be calculated in a uniform time frame. The project reduces hosting costs and increases the budget for admin and marketing items, the efficiency of the project will be much higher. Because the Admin is the representative of the project to contact and advise directly to the community, if the admin has an inappropriate attitude or qualifications, it will adversely affect the reputation of the project.

We are very pleased that CA is interested in our proposal and gives us valuable comments.\r\nWe have some responses to the CA's comments as follows.\r\n\r\nAbout the comments regarding the Impact section\r\n\r\nRegarding the criteria for evaluating service providers on Marketplace, we are developing a detailed regulatory document. We will verify the identity, KYC of the service provider when the provider registers. Service providers will need to have proof of their experience and skills when registering.\r\nAnd to ensure the quality of supplier service is always good, Marketplace will have a supplier review feature. Users (customers who register to use the service) will evaluate the service quality of the provider by scoring the reputation, the service quality satisfaction score. Vendors with high customer satisfaction scores will be prioritized to be displayed on the Marketplace homepage. Suppliers with low customer satisfaction and reputation scores will be restricted from displaying or fined corresponding to the level of customer complaints.\r\nRegarding the target market of the project, in the initial stage, the target market in Vietnam. Once Marketplace is up and running, we plan to expand the service to other countries like Japan, India, and more. The reason for choosing the first target market is Vietnam because the number of Proposals from Vietnam as well as CA is increasing, the demand for support is quite high. And since we are a Vietnamese team, the first phase of deployment in Vietnam will be convenient to support and receive input from the Vietnamese community, thereby quickly completing the Marketplace better.\r\n\r\nAbout the comments regarding the Feasibility section\r\n\r\nBecause in the first 3 months we will build a foundation and develop in the Vietnamese market, so the Marketing materials and introductory videos will be made in the Vietnamese language. Later, when we expand to other countries, we will translate documents into multi-language\r\nRegarding the time for each item in the budget, the reason we recommend Hosting costs for 3 years is that when we buy a 3-year Hosting package, we will get a 70% discount. Hosting costs for 1 year and 3 years are almost the same. So we proposed a hosting cost of 3 years.\r\nRegarding Admin costs, we save costs by using our team's resources. We will need to hire 1-2 people to assist with vendor consulting when they initially sign up. Admin costs funded by Catalyst will be used to pay the admin staff's salary for 3 months. After that, we will use a part of the service fee collected from the supplier as an administrative cost.\r\nRegarding marketing costs, the reason we only want to get funding is 1,000USD because We have the Cardano Vietnam community, so we can introduce Service Marketplace there, thereby saving advertising costs. Marketing expenses here will be used to create more interactive programs on Marketplace such as Minigame with small gifts. We calculate and choose cost-effective, highly effective marketing methods.\r\nThe project's budget may not seem like much, but we want to use the funding from Catalyst most efficiently and optimally. We will try to operate Marketplace to make a profit, thereby turning the capital well.\r\n\r\nAbout the opinion regarding the Transparency section\r\n\r\nWe are building a website and will soon announce it to the community. We plan to publish the website once the project is funded. The website's domain name is chokynang.com.\r\nMany thanks to the CA for the advice on adding a domain name to the proposal to indirectly market the project.\r\nOn how to test project progress metrics, we will periodically report in Catalyst meetings and update the information on our website. The community and Catalyst will check the project development progress through the website chokynang.com.\r\nHere are our responses. Looking forward to the understanding of CA and vCA, Community and Catalyst.\r\nSincere thanks very much."}, {"id": 1026, "q0": "This proposal can help to solve the difficult problems of the project when there is a shortage of skilled and qualified personnel.
