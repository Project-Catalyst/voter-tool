Well, let me argue - most of apps on phone are having notifications which you can set, e.g. if the price increases/decreases about set %, a sound and visual notification is raised on your device (lets say a phone). So, from this perspective, I am not really convinced that you have managed to identify a problem that needs to be solved, and at the same time, whether it will be just another device that will not find its demand. Also, in the proposal is stated, that when this ticker will be at hand, that people will be less distracted, but I would claim otherwise - having crypto displayed 24/7 will take more of your attention, therefore unless you are a scalper or daytrader, you will not find use for it, and if you are daytrader/scalper, you are already having your \"workstation and devices\" ready to use.

Yes, we can definitely assess the success (partially) on a working device, but what about the problem solution? - people are missing some movements on the market? If this was the problem you wanted to solve, I am not really sure if a working device is a success metric (to the full extent) and there should be some metric evaluating e.g. people are less distracted, or, people did not miss price movements - but we all agree that it is most likely impossible to measure, therefore I think that auditabiity of the success, which should be related to \"problem vs solution\" is not really possible.

I believe that the proposal is in line with the challenge, because the creation of this specific device to capture information about Ada (such as market share value and price variation, for example) is not something that fits with any other challenge. This device would allow the ada holder to have much more control over how he will use his cryptocurrencies, as he will be informed in practically real time about the changes and will also be able to moderate the device in his own way (for example, pasting a price alert that will indicate when Ada reaches a certain pre-chosen value). In my opinion, this project may also be an attraction for new Ada holders. As far as I know, no cryptocurrency has such a device, and as we know the nature of cryptocurrencies is highly soluble, so it is super valid that one of them (Ada) has a faster and safer way of control.

Regarding the use of funding, similarly, we know in general how the borrowed money would be used, but so much specificity is passed down. For example, we don't know how long the engineers involved would work (a full day's work? half a day?). The amount is broken down into parts, but they could be more detailed.

And speaking of success, he reaffirms what is said in the impact part, the bigger goal here is to make it simpler and more straightforward for the Cardano community to keep up with the price of Ada without compromising mental health. I'm sure the goal is noble and will do a lot of good for community members, however, it would be interesting for the author to plot metrics on how the project affected the growth of our currency, transactions on the Cardano blockchain (grew?) and so on.

Without the details of its manufacture (details corresponding to the display of the images attached) I could risk to affirm that it is a product well thought for the purpose suggested by the proposers.  However, although it is not made clear why it is shown, through the attached images, an apparently functional product while in the Feasability section design, prototyping and testing activities are described (although what the images may be showing is simply a sample of how the final product would look like, which would explain why the display shows a quote that ADAEUR has never been in since its introduction to the public market), the following are the reasons why the suggested product proposition is not feasible (please note that I am not stating \"it is my opinion\", or \"I believe\", since it is not my opinion that I am stating here, they are just facts):\n\nthe service that the proponents wish to provide through their product is already available through online platforms, in real time, tick-by-tick, easily accessible through mobile phones and any other screen the user wants to employ, with the same functionalities that the proponents describe: price alerts with sounds, a wide range of pairs, a wide range of timeframes, and many other features, like alerts sent by mail, etc.  However, the important thing to keep in mind here is that the companies developing these platforms have taken the game of displaying market information to stratospheric levels, utilizing infrastructure and talent that can only be paid for with massive amounts of private capital, because their core business of those companies, their lifeblood, their very existence, is defined by the display of real-time, tick-by-tick information.  Love it or hate it, you can't help but recognize two things: 1) they have done an impeccable job at the informational level (from anywhere on the planet the user can access information in an efficient way, in real time, tick-by-tick) and at the graphical level (the interfaces are increasingly attractive and adaptable to the user's tastes and needs);  2) as in the HFT (High Frequency Trading) business, the beneficiary is the user, since the companies competing in the market information display sector are willing to stab each other in order to squeeze pennies, therefore, the user can not only choose his provider, he can do it at increasingly competitive prices, even for free.\n    \nAnd free is the concept that corresponds to us as non-professional consumers of market information.  We are in a position to enjoy the gigantic technical and financial investment made by the private sector, for free.  It's like being able to enjoy for less than $10 bucks a Hollywood blockbuster that cost billions of dollars to make, but better, because as users who don't require complex features at our disposal, it's free.    \n\nIn summary, and I don't want to sound cruel, but the reality is that today, anyone can have access to the information and features described in the proposal, with fantastic interfaces, in real time, tick-by-tick, and at no cost.  The best of the best, put at the user's fingertips, at no cost. But I can tell you with complete certainty: the proponents' intention of wanting to provide access to information is good, they just want to get into a game that has been in rotation for decades (see, for ex, www.tradingview.com).   \n\n\nYou, Mr. and Mrs. user, do not want that madness on your desk. Unless you are a professional trader, who lives behind every tick of price movement, who needs to have your finger on the pulse of something that is ultimately not in your control, let me tell you: you do not want this torture in your life.  Not even the producers of grains, food, commodities in general, want that in their lives: they hire financial entities (banks, hedge funds, etc.) to be the ones to carry out the hedging operations, so that they are the ones to deal with that madness (and as the premiums paid are considerable, the financial entities do the job without any problem).  \n\nThe same proposal makes mention of the madness I am talking about when it states: \"There can be a big jump any second, and you just can't afford to miss it. Checking your phone has become second nature. Almost every free moment you have is used to check your ADA crypto. At work, at home, even on your commute. It can get overwhelming, and become an unhealthy obsession.\"  With access only through the phone, you ensure your peace of mind.  \n\nMy recommendation to proponents, voters and members of the community at large: there is nothing you can do to control volatility.  It is almost a natural phenomenon (you don't tell the rain what to do).  However, maybe this is the right time to start learning about hedging and personal treasury management: take your ADAs, lock it and borrow Djed (stable coin) againts it.
