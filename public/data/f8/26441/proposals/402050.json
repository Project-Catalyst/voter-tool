The idea is to create a community (Proud Dirt Farmers - PDF), which would be a kind of group whose main objective is to \u201cencourage family farms to reduce carbon\u201d. This would be done through a reward system, each farmer would have a decentralized Atala Prism identity through which their data would be associated. They would receive what was called by the proponents a \u201ccardano credit bond\u201d, which could be sold, as I understand it. Proponents also say they plan to go further. For example, they want to form a conscious community that thinks about \u201cfood security, the importance of farm-based carbon sequestration\u201d and other sustainability issues. In theory, it's all very interesting; we know that several aspects of our ecosystem, as I mentioned at the beginning of the analysis, would be used. This makes us think that, then, Cardano would be boosted, fostered and benefited in many ways. However, I identify some problems here. For starters: would these DAOs be face-to-face or online? How would farmers and smallholders be invited to the project? How would it be publicized, and how would these workers be educated in a simple way about what Cardano, blockchain and etc is? In addition to the teachings on sustainability, how would the more technical parts be explained in an understandable way, accessible to all? What would these carbon bonds be? How would they help reduce the amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere? What would farmers have to provide for these credits to be issued? How would they receive them, and how would they handle them? Would it be through digital wallets? How would the Atala Prism DIDs be associated, could the worker receive the credits only if they have these decentralized identities? I think that several questions are said but not properly explained, that is, many questions remain open. I understood what needed to be done, but not how, it is not so clear how a project of such complexity would develop in practice. Therefore, my opinion is that the idea is undoubtedly very good, but there are many instances relevant to Cardano involved and it is not so clear how all this would develop, what the process of receiving the credits would be like, how the workers would be entitled to this. , how they would be instructed to use them and how their real impact would be measured. Therefore, I will give it a score of 3, my opinion is neutral, the core of the proposal is great but it should be better explained (in terms of practical realization). \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I did not find the provided script suitable. Starting with the fact that the temporal division is a little confusing, what would 1.T1 / 2.T2 / 3.Q2 be? In my view, it would be more appropriate for the proponents to have broken down the entire script into months. It is the simplest and most practical way, and with the appropriate degree of specificity, to understand the temporality of processes. Speaking now about the activities, they are only mentioned, they are not explained. We don't understand in detail what would be done, how it would be done and who would do it. For example, in \u201cFormation of the foundation and social acquisition\u201d, how would the foundation be formed? In this case, would the participants who would compose the DAO be called here? How would they be selected and how would the proponent present the project to them, their motivations and ultimate goals? What would social acquisition be? In \u201cSubject to the Roadmap - Takeoff DAO\u201d, it is not very clear what would happen, but I infer that it would be the growth and popularization of this DAO. How would this expansion be successful? Would some sort of publicity campaign be launched, how would the target audience be reached? In general, I think that the script does not have the necessary degree of specificity so that we can solidly understand what would need to be done, so I would like it to be elaborated again, clarifying the issue of temporality better and increasing the degree of description of each of the activities. Turning now to the financing analysis, approximately 50 thousand dollars are requested; it is not a small amount, in fact it corresponds to about 10% of the money destined for the challenge. I disagree that the amount has been adequately explained, it is also generally lacking in detail. In \u201c20,000 Legal Review, Compliance, and Foundation Setup. Third-party retention and fee-based estimates\u201d, how much would you go for each thing? What would third-party retention be, what rates was this value based on? In \u201c2,000 Acquisition of Socials and Initial Web Design\u201d, are proponents referring to creating artwork to be posted on social media? Which social networks would be adopted in this publicity campaign, and this value corresponds only to the initial design, how would this part of the proposal continue to be maintained? I think it would need the topics to be explained more deeply, some parts are better than others (eg the \u201c4,000 artist fees for initial NFT design work, logo design and social graphics part. Two weeks / 80 hours at 50 hours\u201d, it is positive as the proponents state the price of the working hour in this case). But all, in my view, deserved the same level of detail. Regarding the team, this is undoubtedly the most elaborate part of the feasibility, since we have a lot of information about each of those involved in the project and links that can prove what was said. However, none of the team members is specialized in Cardano, which worries me a little, because I think it is always necessary that at least one person is well understood about the technologies of our blockchain. So I think the feasibility is ok, not bad, but we still have a lot of points to improve. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Unfortunately, the proponents seem to be uncertain as to how the auditability of the process will be done. We know that it would be started more intensively in phase 2 of the project, \u201cwhen the organization is funded, it is selling NFTs, it has a Treasury, the DAO is started and we turn to the real mission \u2013 to help family farms, globally, to kidnap carbon, help Mother Earth\u201d. However, it is clear that the bidders do not have specific KPIs and metrics, from the excerpt \u201cHow do we audit this? At this point, anything we write will just be a questionable pope. We are aware of the issue, we recognize that it will need to be resolved, but at this point we are not close enough to have a solution. As Dor said, the solution will unfold over time!\u201d It would be necessary for proponents to devise more direct ways to monitor the process and partial results. By that, I mean both the task accomplishment part and the small goals achieved. The process should be monitored at least every month, as I suggested in the topic above, it would be more appropriate if the temporality were divided in a more traditional and simple way - monthly, at least - and at the end of each of these cycles the team would need to the Cardano community about the project as a whole. Due to the fact that it is a project with several aspects, my suggestion is that it be divided into some parts. The parts I thought of were 1) direct guidance from farmers - how we're going to educate them about everything that's going to happen next 2) the mitigation of active tokens 3) the organization of the DAO itself 4) the creation and association of the DIDs of the Atala Prism for the rest of the project 4) the carbon credits emitted 5) the environmental consequences that could be measured, quantitatively and qualitatively. I think all these aspects should be monitored frequently. As the proponents themselves claim that they will use social networks to publicize the project, it would be interesting if small illustrative posts were made available monthly, with new information each month on each of these aforementioned fronts. Regarding the final results, it is quite complex to measure the success of a project with so many aspects, but I think that in general two things should be analyzed: the environmental impacts and the improvement of Cardano. The benefit to farmers could indeed be measured through \u201ca self-sufficient treasury with inflation provisions that is able to reward farmers around the world for sustainability and carbon reduction\u201d. The direct consequences for Cardano can be perceived based on the NFTs market and also by the \u201cAtala-based SSI for a) farmer integration, b) agricultural carbon credit certification, c) ecobasket/ecobond to sell on the market to finance credits of carbon for farmers\u201d. I thought that this part of auditability is better covered than the previous one. We have material on which we can build if success has been achieved; I missed an environmental measurement, that is, knowing how CO2 emissions actually reduced from this project. That part could be added. As long as the Cardano community is fully informed of all possible achievements (this could be done through a video participation in Town Hall, for example), I think the end results are already well measured. In other words, the auditability of the process leaves a lot to be desired, but the final success is adequate. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 8, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1030, "q0": "The proposal effectively addresses the difficulty of family farms receiving carbon credits.
