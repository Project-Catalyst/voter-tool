By gathering a lot of learning resources related to the ecosystem in one place, it will promote more people educating themselves coming in to the space, and create a healthier environment for people with limited knowledge about Crypto or blockchain technology. And if there are many credible learning resources gather in one place, it will in turn attract more users to the ecosystem. It all comes down to if the project has the means to scale properly, advertise and grow a good reputation. More on that under \u2019Feasibility\u2019. \nIt would have been less impactful if the platform only would feature paid courses, so the inclusion of free courses on the marketplace is a welcomed one. \n\nThere is a discussion to be made wether or not this would fit in the dApps and Integrations-challenge (as mentioned in the comments section), but it seems that the intent of the proposer is leaning more to the side of a web-based E-learning platform. The line between the two is thin, but overall my opinion is that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team covers a wide area of expertise needed for the completion and success of this project. Relevant links (LinkedIn, etc) are provided for each of the core team members, and the credibility of the team is further strengthened by the fact that they are already running a very successful media coverage platform focused on the Cardano Ecosystem. From my opinion and experience as a teacher/researcher, I would have liked to see more emphasis on teacher experience represented in the core team (even though this is represented in the team) but after reading the proposal it is my understanding that the specifics of the courses will be left to the hired teachers themselves. \n\nBudget of the proposal is broken down in a clear and understandable way, and we are provided with a clear timeframe spanning over 3 months, with included milestones. I am by no means a developer, but in comparison with other successful projects in the past (This is my 3rd fund as a CA) the calculated resources and timeline for completing the project seems likely to be implemented. \u2028\u2028I agree with the teams mention of the potential risks/challenge of the need of the onboarded teachers to market the platform, along with the \u201dthreat\u201d of competition from other E-learning platforms. The decision on making the focus of this platform crypto is a good one, in my opinion. In my opinion as a teacher, a potential risk/challenge in regards to the actual content being provided on the platform could be that the courses differ a lot in quality and content between each other. It would be nice to see if there is a list of standards, example of curriculum etc to see if the proposers want each teacher to construct everything completely independent from each other, or if they aim to have a \u201dred thread\u201d between the content provided. I agree it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "We are provided with a clear roadmap with milestones set on a 3 month time frame (as mentioned before). Considering that the core team already has a strong and active user base from their other platform (CardanoFeed), it seems highly likely that the process of development will be easy to follow for the community. \nThe proposal includes a list of KPIs and measurements of success, but it would further strengthen the proposal if it had included some target numbers in relation to stated KPIs. \nFor example: \u201dBy this point in time, our aim is to have X amount of registered users, and X number of free courses and Y number of courses for sale available on the platform.\u201d\nEven though it would just be a target number, it would grant further insight in the development and process of the project. \u2028Overall, I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_349", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 3, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "We are very excited about your comments and ratings, almost full marks in all topics, especially coming from a teacher. \nThank you very much for your feedback, we would like to count on your support in approving this proposal and that we can bring quality knowledge and training to users."}, {"id": 1866, "q0": "The proposer has the idea to create a marketplace for marketing and conducting online courses (e-learning) in the area of blockchain technology.

Number of hits on the site, number of registered users, number of courses available. However the proposer does not want to engage with any numbers. That means, the auditor should make a discretionary call if the project is going well or not. Even more than that, all these parameters could be followed only after the site and the project is up and running, that means that the auditor could not measure the progress of the project until reaching that stage of development. The question then is how the auditor will assess the progress of development in order to fund the proposal?\nWhat I want to suggest for the next proposal of this team is to make clear milestones, monthly let\u2019s say and bind them with numbers and dates, this way the work of the auditor is already clear and will not be discretionary.\nSuccess is of course missing the same concrete numbers that we already talked about.\nI disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1417", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 3, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you very much for the comments and feedbacks received, they were very deep and we believe that we were able to work to improve the project even more. \nIn terms of auditability, we will already implement an open and public framework of JIRA, thus bringing transparency in all tasks to be developed, roadmaps and deliveries, we will also have periodic releases with the progress of the programming and also. dissemination of deliveries and conclusions in our networks social. \nIf possible, we would like to count on your support in approving this proposal and also a possible reassessment in the project notes."}, {"id": 4637, "q0": "Plan to develop a platform to buy or sell courses on blockchain products and use cryptocurrency as mode of payments.
