The good thing for the community is that for that time the community could be certain that this team delivers.\nThe team is well presented and consists of young specialists with experience in the field.

Combination and integration is an important factor in creating a stronger ecosystem. Plus, the author shows their passion and experience for the project by mentioning that they are also working on a tokenomics system. The proposer is also a PhD candidate, thus, when he mention something, a reference link would be attached, which creates a stronger affirmation for the ideas. The last paragraph of this 'objectives and goals' part is an indicator for the proposer's vision, ambition with specific examples as their demonstration for ideas. The impact of this project reaches another level as the proposer even considers benefits of a larger group, industry and community. They list out a lot of examples to prove their ideas in this part. Still, if the proposer can descrbe more detailed on how this project can strongly affect or build up Cardano ecosystem, it would be more completed. \nThey have an quite comprehensive explanation for the reasons that they choose to put this proposal in miscellaneous challenge. \nThe foreseen risks are illustrated clear enough and they also offer their ways to handle those risks cleverly. \"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\"The timeline of this proposal can be considered as crystal clear when the author divides the tasks into small periods of 2-3 months and particularizes the detailed tasks for each period.

As a result, the feasibility of this proposal is incredibly strengthened. \nThe budget breakdown for this proposal is little surprising and quite impressive as they declare to pay out-of-pocket spendings in order to prove their ability of gaining funds. This can be referred to the proposer's great confidence in the feasiblity and chance of success of their ideas. \nThe proposer's profile is introduced with great details and evidences for his work.
