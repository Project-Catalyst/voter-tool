They are all trying to achieve a common goal of making sure the market needs are fulfilled efficiently and also the talents are put to good use and for the right cause. The one thing that makes this proposal stand out amongst the others is the concept of social media which in turn provides means to access Twitter, discord channels, and hence there is a learning and engaging aspect to this product. The team is, however, mentions this to be just a mere concept and nothing is set in stone and is cautious about the risks involved which are positive. Hence, all in all, I score a 4 for the impact of the proposal.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The action plan supporting the idea is very brief. The proposer provides a vague idea about what the community can expect during the project implementation. But there are no clear milestones and deliverables at each phase defined yet. Also, the requested fund is a pretty hefty amount and the breakdown being guesstimated is not doing any favor to the proposal's integrity. The proposer also mentions not having made any effort or research yet on the team that might be working on the proposal and hence I feel it very difficult to make any assumption on the feasibility of the proposal from the limited information available. Hence I would like to agree and disagree on that at the moment. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "My sentiments to the measurable key metrics are pretty much the same as the feasibility parameters. The proposer has somewhat failed to identify the quantifiable metrics the community can use to measure the progress of the project. The proposer again makes claims about what they intend to do during their implementation and after that. The success criteria are also yet to be defined clearly, but since the submission is under \"Miscellaneous challenge\" the lack of crystal clear metrics and expectations to evaluate the validity of the proposal, I find it hard to agree with the proposal from the auditability perspective. I'm sure an elaborated proposal could have gained them some leverage over other proposals considering the unique approach they propose. Hence I suggest the proposer solidify their game plan that complements their brilliant idea and come back stronger if they fail to raise funds this time.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 364, "q0": "We observed that the Link Start platform has an objective that actually helps to expand the visibility of technologies that are in the scope of Cardano. However, we noticed that both the main function of the platform and the secondary function apparently do not need these technologies in themselves to be implemented. In this way, the proposal does not seem to fit the goals of the challenge. Likewise, the idea is not very innovative; despite the main focus being a tool to recruit professionals involved with web technologies3 and also to find tools from this universe, we were not able to perceive a great impact or innovation with the creation of this platform in the way we proposed. Overall, this doesn't seem like a project that fits the goals aligned by the DApps and Integrations challenge, just as the requested budget of $63,000 seems too high.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Regarding the feasibility plan, we also noticed that the strategy aims to build a platform in the web2 version so that the product is validated before the transition to a Dapp. However, given the ideas described in the proposal, there seem to be no clear reasons why the idea, once validated in the web2 version, needs to be migrated. Thus, some points developed here could be used to build a product whose scope was really the web2 version. Such points would be the validation with 600 users that was mentioned or the use of the heat map to better understand the operation of the project.\n\nAlthough in some parts of the proposal some strategies were mentioned, such as the use of smart contracts to bring greater security to the data, it seems that all the project's objectives can be achieved without using such concepts and technologies inherent to the Cardano ecosystem.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "We noticed that, in general terms, good metrics were established to track the results of a project, such as the establishment of a test group for a beta version of the platform and a number to be reached that represents the project's user base.
