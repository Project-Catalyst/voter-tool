However, I would critcize the way how the problem statement and solution summary are presented: \u201cThere is no ABC in Catalyst. We will provide ABC.\u201d The gist of the issue comes only later and can be literally read between the lines: \u201cas a community, we are missing out on the potential for new approaches and fresh ways to address complex questions\u201d. That is what the team is about to solve. The solution is to recruit additional facilitators/trainers, device a foundation level course for new facilitators, run the program twice and get 20 people trained to become facilitators, support and mentor them to try their skills in practice, provide a channel for peer support, and document everything, including a \u201cGood Spaces Charter\u201d that crystalizes the tenets of good facilitation. It will also be translated to two additional languages (although it\u2019s not mentioned which ones). This is all geared to increase the quality of Catalyst events and make participation a more engaging and fruitful experience.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Vanessa and Gustavo are both active community members. They form a great foundation for the five-person team. It\u2019s interesting how they\u2019ve left the three spots open. Proposers state: \u201crather than starting this proposal with an already-fixed team of 5 trainers, we preferred to give an opportunity to engage some new people as well\u201d. Makes you wonder if it was due to time running out or an actual strategic choice. Either way, it\u2019s a nice approach. When calculating the ROI (no, not \u201cintention\u201d but \u201cinvestment\u201d) it could be argued that 1,500 per person (30K divided by 20 people) is a bit on the high side. However, if you consider this as an investment to the future of Catalyst, you see how it can have a multiplying positive impact and therefore the cost becomes justified. Possible risks have been considered and mitigation strategies are discussed.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The way the information is laid out is just brilliant. Vanessa\u2019s pedantic and detail-oriented style shines through. Everything from KPIs to timeline to budget has been very well thought out.

Their functions are described in the proposal so that those who do not know what they do will understand well in which branch this proposal would act. The Catalyst School is already a well-established group at Cardano, which teaches several things, from how to be a CA, how to submit a proposal, etc., but this moderator role was never really the focus of the workshops. And because it is something fundamental for the smooth running of meetings, I think that investing in how to be a good moderator can significantly increase the quality of meetings, and this would certainly benefit the entire Cardano ecosystem, since practically every meeting in the our ecosystem are online. In other words, the proposal is of very high value for the Cardano community. In fact, it doesn't fit into any other challenge either, so it makes sense that it was posted here. I found it interesting, specifically, when proponents say that Cardano meetings all basically follow the same format, and that this limits how we approach certain subjects - certainly the training of facilitators would make a difference here too. A great idea.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Although time is not broken down into months but rather into longer intervals, a lot of detail is given about what would happen in each of these time periods. We know what would happen and how, the activities are explained fully and in a very accessible way, we understand when such a thing would happen and what is the need for it. So the script part is great! If the division were monthly, it would be easier to audit the proposal, but this did not interfere with the understanding of the process as a whole. Talking now about the budget, approximately 30 thousand dollars are requested, and this amount is divided into very detailed parts, we know the hourly value of the professionals involved, which part of the expenses would go to accounts and licenses, we understand very precisely the because the requested value is this. I was just confused because some expenses are measured in dollars and others in euros. Other than that, this part of the proposal is also excellent. Finally, speaking of the team, it is a little confusing if Vanessa and Gustavo are members of the School or if it would be them + the members of the School (in which case, which ones?). However, in relation to this pair of professionals, a lot of confidence is passed because we know in great detail what their resumes are and how they relate to Cardano. Therefore, the proposal is extremely viable, requiring only minor improvements.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is fully auditable, the topic being almost perfect. Proponents give many metrics for measuring both progress and end results. As for progress, they are given a lot of quantitative data (such as the number of trainers involved and the variety of where they come from in the ecosystem and number of training sessions planned and delivered), but they also say that they will do a qualitative analysis. The only thing that could have been clearer would be how all this would come to the attention of the Cardano community. And on the subject of success, they also outline numerous verifiable ways in which it could be measured, and again it is not so explicit how ecosystem members would know whether these things have been achieved or not. My suggestion is that proponents make regular meetings or reports to inform the partial results to the community (or if they are going to meet with the coordinators at IOG, that they disseminate what was discussed). And it would be interesting for a more detailed final report to be presented, raising all the points mentioned in the success section (whether they were achieved or not, and how).", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10858, "q0": "This is a proposal that definitely fits or aligns with the objectives of this campaign category.

And for me, the key factor is good moderator skills. So from that point of view I totally agree with your proposal. We are looking to train a total of 20 people, who could become part of the Catalyst School facilitator collective. The metrics are aligned with the problem and the challenge.

I must congratulate the team for the great approach they gave to the risk section, because basically they did what is expected in this section. Identify a risk, estimate the criticality of the risk in terms of probability and severity and present a countermeasure to mitigate the risk. Regarding the skills and experiences two people are presented as part of the core team, both presented a sufficient description with the necessary links to check them, additionally it counts as Catalyst School as part of the team which adds another layer of confidence.

It is clear to me that there is a clear understanding of the problem and its ramifications, all the necessary considerations were taken to present to the community a proposal with all the necessary considerations to be selected by the voters. 5 out of 5.
