From the description of the proposal on the website that is attached in the part of \u201cWebsite/GitHu repository (if relevant)\u201d there is a little of the performance of the DLT360 group. It is a kind of technology, in which a group of professionals gives advice and directions to companies thinking about blockchain consulting. As far as this group is able to understand, the objective of all projects is to be well developed by third parties, to be planned at Cardano in a safe and planned way; in short, that companies understand and choose to use Cardano technologies in others and blockchain technologies (and also start to decentralize their actions). That is, the group that is, that is, what is important for the ecosystem, for what they are not important yet for the ecosystem, for what they are not important to expand. What I think could have been better explained in the impact part of the proposal is 1) what experts do that all users understand, especially those who are not in the domain area. These principles will improve the general understanding, proposed so that they would also act on knowledge. We are here that they would be responsible for administrative activities. What for exemple? And since they are working for this company, which domain experts would they improve on which projects? I think the situation faced today lacked a clearer explanation. It's just that domain experts aren't being as productive. For example, the situation could be better explained like this: specialist X stopped performing a task because he needed to do a task Z, which would be easily solved by an intern. I think that way, we would better understand the optimization that is discussed here. Therefore, I will give it 4 stars for the impact, the company DLT36 is fundamental for the expansion of the card and this proposal will contribute to the improvement of its works, but it would need more explanation on how, more details for the practice. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Proponents argue that \u201csince most of our activities are highly interconnected, we see overlapping and specific elements when we look at the business model canvas on a project-by-project basis\u201d. In doing so, they provide us with two aspects of the script, the generic and the specific elements. In the generics, activities that encompass several of your projects are explained, while what we should focus on for this project are the specific elements. They are described from topic 6, participation in biweekly meetings (...), auxiliary or core team and domain specialist (...) and etc. All activities are planned to last a semester together, and are presented clearly but succinctly. In my view, this roadmap is ok, it allows us to have an overview of what would happen in the case of funding the proposal. But the roadmap could be better detailed, if, instead of informing that all activities would last 6 months, the proponents indicated how long each one would take to carry out; whether some of them could happen in parallel; if they had provided more details about each, such as who would work and how it would be done. For example in the following activity \u201cassist or core team and domain experts with general back-office tasks\u201d: what would these general tasks be? Talking now about the budget, 10 thousand dollars are requested which from what I understand would be divided into two parts: the payment of the interns and the general management of projects/HR/etc. I thought this part is very clear, we were able to understand well how the money would be used, because in the case of this proposal this division is not at all complex. I found the pay of 20 dollars per hour quite fair for an internship, regarding the management part I think I could have been told how many hours it would last as well. We don't know how to calculate the hourly rate in this case, although the amount is quite low, so in reality it may not be asking for a payment directly to the company's professionals, but for something else (in this case, a little confusion was generated, I would like to know how the $400 would be used more accurately). Speaking now of the team, we are introduced to the pair of professionals who would be responsible for this project. Little information is given about them, just what professional area they work in and also their linkedin profiles. As much as a trust is passed automatically at the moment that composes the DLT360 team (because of the projects they have already delivered and those that are in progress), it would be great if a small resume about each was made available in the proposal. So I think the feasibility is good, but it can still improve. We know basic information about the funding, the process and the professional duo involved. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Proponents claim that they are already familiar with the Catalyst auditability process, as they have previously been funded. They make progress forms and also hold meetings with the IOG coordinators, as I understand it. I would like to know if, somehow, these forms would also be available for the Cardano community. In addition to the aforementioned KPIs, such as research progress, assignment completion, etc., do they talk a little about their work routines in these reports? In the case, if the planned activities were carried out at the right time, in the right way? How the interns were doing, if they faced any difficulties during the learning and work processes, how they were overcome and etc... That is, in addition to knowing the partial results, I would like to understand if these reports would also allow us to understand what would be behind them. Nor is it said how often these reports would be prepared and released; This is important information in my opinion. So I think the auditability of progress is not bad, but it could be more closely monitored. Talking now about the final results, the same KPIs are used, now conclusively. It is positive how they are qualitative and quantitative, not limited only in number as most audits do. I believe that the last two KPIs are the most important and, in my opinion, both deserve special attention: the feedback from the interns and the DLT360 team; How will we know about this feedback? What will he make up? It would be necessary for a more complete final report to be presented, or for this team to participate in a town hall (1 professional and 1 intern would be enough), so that they could present this information in more detail. Which projects were optimized and how, through the work of interns; how this was clearly reflected in the Cardano ecosystem and so on. In general, the auditability is good, but like the two previous topics, some points could be better explored to make it ideal. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 387, "q0": "One of the most important points to understand if the proposal in question will have a good impact is to understand the performance of the company that is offering the internship. And when we analyze it, we notice that it has an area of \u200b\u200bactivity and values \u200b\u200bthat fully converge with Cardano's principles, including the financing received previously indicates this. We can cite as a great feature of the company its purpose of offering solutions and consulting seeking real objectivity, without appropriating the exaggeration often attributed to blockchain. In this way, by increasing the team (with a future intern) and optimizing its processes, the company's success will contribute to an increase in the visibility of Cardano's ecosystem, since its technologies are used to find opportunities and solve problems in the real world. As was also stated by the dlt360 team, the company aims to become fully independent in the future, and as its beginnings were intrinsically related to Catalyst, we believe that the company's future success will allude to Cardano, helping in the visibility of our ecosystem in the long term. Additively, given the singular objective of the proposal to hire an intern, we have that it fits well in the challenge in which it finds itself. Given the possible impact of the proposal, the professionals involved and the plan built, we have that the budget being requested of $10,000 is consistent.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "During the detailing of the action plan, the team was very insightful in giving an overview of the progress of the company's processes. In this way, it is possible to understand well the mode of operation and the momentary needs of the business. In this context, we have a great organization of the information that was transmitted in a clear way, and with that it was possible to understand what the intern's functions would be and mainly why it is necessary. We note that the detailing of the budget is quite understandable, and basically the amount being asked for by the proposal is defined by the number of working hours multiplied by the value of the hour worked. In addition, the team behind this project, as well as behind the company in general, made their resumes available and has experiences that, together, are very complementary to the success of the project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The ways to follow the project are also described in detail. Not only were ideas presented on how to track the progress of activities, but clear quantitative parameters were given to measure performance. These parameters cover well what is expected of the intern, both in terms of completion of the internship time, as well as in relation to their performance and the satisfaction of the team. We even noticed that the perception of success verifies if certain values were reached by these parameters, which is quite consistent.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 5, "ng": 7, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2967, "q0": "There's something about this proposal that I feel intriguing and surprising, for a reason that while many proposals are looking to put in ideas of new applications in the miscellaneous challenge, this team has given us a totally unique one. The team is searching for a helping hand from enthusiastic members who could lighten their load from trivial tasks and rather concentrate more on critical aspects of the other proposals such as DLT360 RADAR which they have already submitted in the other challenges. This could do wonders considering this could be a first step of the many for the newcomers on the chain to get first-hand knowledge about a lot of stuff coming straight from the experts they work along. This could help a lot of people to start off and later come up with their own contributions, this will help a lot of young minds build connections and get to know a lot of experts from whom they can get advice and suggestions when trying to build something of their own. Impact-wise, the community has a lot to gain from this proposal, and should it should be given a chance to prove itself.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provides the community with clear indications on how and what the interns would be doing for 6 months and what kind of project they will be working on assisting the experts. The project's deliverables and outcomes are very promising and verifiable and hence the amount of knowledge they could gain is immense. Most of the work the interns would be doing would be preparing the reports of the work done by the team and other administrative works along with attending many meetings with the senior members. The learning curve is great for someone who is just entering the chain and everyone would like to get their hands on such an opportunity. The fund of 10000 is considerable taking into account that the team has to invest some time and effort on these interns and also have to give them incentives for working along with them for a period of 6 long months. The team put together for DLT 360 RADAR is a long list of experienced professionals and the project is a huge one targeting 4 different aspects, so the kind of mentorship and expertise the interns could get sure looks exciting.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "To be honest, for me as a reader the measurable KPIs are really not of much importance at this point considering the gravity of the proposal and having gone through the rest of the proposal. The takeaways are far too great from the interpersonal point of view for the interns than any other surface-level metrics. However, the proposer still presents some valid metrics that could help the formal auditing process. Metrics to measure the progress of the intern, the satisfaction index from both the intern themselves and the DLT team they work with, and the percentage of assignments completed successfully are all verifiable metrics and the community will be very content if these metrics reach success criteria the team defines with a target numbers each of the above metrics might have to be achieved by the end. With a satisfaction score of above 80%, it should be good enough to start off as this is a new proposal, and a lot of other teams on the Chain might be able to take this positively and come up with similar plans next time around to make sure great minds are put to the right use.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1593", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "A smart internship-program will allow us to free-up our domain-experts up from many administrative tasks", "experience": "The DLT360 Domain Expert Team and the contributing network with many years of experience in this field.\nDetailed information & links provided in 'Feasibility' section below."}
