In this challenge, we seek to finance projects that do not fit into any other challenge of the fund, but that are still of high value to Cardano, helping, in some way, our blockchain to grow, become popular and be adopted by different initiatives/people/ companies and etc. The idea here is to provide a paid internship in the area of \u200b\u200bhuman resources, in which the intern would work at the company Loxe Inc., which is a remote company that uses Cardano\u2019s blockchain to develop its projects. I see many positive points for which we should finance this proposal. 1) Indeed, as the proponents say, Cardano and blockchain in general still offer few opportunities for professionals who are not in the fields of technology (programming, design, etc.), law or business. Human resources students are certainly a key part of our ecosystem, as they can become professionals who help the company in non-technical issues when it comes to technology, but in relation to the behavior, satisfaction and performance of the professionals employed. I think that as important as having professionals trained in a technical way, is that we also have people with the appropriate psychological profile for the position in which they work; people who are satisfied with their work, so that they do their tasks willingly and carefully; people who get along well with their bosses and co-workers. It is also essential that these people can be selected in the most humane and fair way possible, that is, I truly believe that professionals in this area are fundamental to the success of any company, this also includes those who work with Cardano. 2) The second positive point I identified here is the company itself (Loxe Inc.). I believe that this company is of high value to our ecosystem, since it is made up of competent professionals who have already shown service through tools for their own community or projects that were financed through Catalyst and are currently in operation, such as the Win platform. win. I think this team will probably make a great introduction to their interns about what blockchain is and what are the differences and advantages of Cardano over other blockchains. This will certainly generate future professionals who will remain in the community, contributing to the realization of projects that will make Cardano widely adopted in the near future, if all goes well. Anyway, I think that the proposal will have a very positive and considerable impact for Cardano, really deserving the maximum score in this regard. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap for this project is very simple, but as it is not such a complex proposal, it is possible to fully understand what will happen based on the information given. The months of August and September would be destined for the dissemination of the internship. One suggestion I can make to the proponents is that they specify where this disclosure would take place. Would it be through sites like linkedin, communication channels in our community, like Discord and Telegram? Afterwards, the months from October to December would correspond to the stages themselves. I think it would also be nice if the proponents explained which projects they intend to involve their interns in. In other words, the script is good, but in my opinion it could have given a little more detail, so that we had a deeper understanding of what is to come. Still, as I said, it is very clear what activities will be developed and when, due to the simple nature of the proposal. In terms of funding, USD 9,000 is requested, which, in my opinion, is quite consistent with the magnitude and benefits that this proposal will generate for Cardano. We know very well how this money would be used: for interns' grants, payment for training provided by Loxe Inc.'s professionals, equipment (computers) given to university students, etc. About this part, I think the presentation of the information was adequate, I don't think it would be necessary to go into more detail. Finally, speaking of the team, it is the team of Loxe Inc: Matthias Sieber, Ganesh N, Victor Corcino and Eli Selkin. Total trust is passed on in this team, since we have a good level of detail about their careers, we know in which area they work as well as what jobs they have developed previously. As I said about the impact, because it is a company that already executes projects that involve Cardano's technologies, a lot of confidence is automatically passed on in its ability to carry out the project successfully. They are experienced and highly qualified. Therefore, I think the feasibility of the project is great, my only suggestion would be to delve a little deeper into the script, but there is no lack of information so that we can solidly understand what will be done, nor by whom or for how much money, so I will give it a note. maximum once again. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Regarding the process, the proponents explain very well how the small advances of this project will be audited. They state that \u201cwe will use the Agile methodology to manage and track our progress in the development of this project\u201d. That is, they have already defined a way of organizing, planning and auditing the small steps that they will need to follow so that the desired partial results are obtained. My suggestion here would be that they explain a little about the Agile methodology, which I believe, like me, most readers of the proposal are unaware of. It is very clear how they will make the Cardano community and the IOG coordinators aware of the small progress: through reports and monthly meetings, which I believe will contain updates both on the tasks that would be being done in that period of time and the partial results obtained. . Now, talking about the final results, I think the proponents also give enough information about how this could be measured by the Cardano community. We know what the main goal is: that two interns from the human resources area are working and learning about Cardano in practice, and with that they become active members of the community and contribute to the development of future projects. We also know specific KPIs that make this objective measurable, such as \u201cNumber of applicants per vacancy: > 10 + Number of interns selected: 2\u201d. My suggestion here is this: it would be very positive if the team at Loxe Inc. (it wouldn't have to be all of them, just a few professionals or even just one) make an overview after the internship period, reporting how the experience was and how the interns showed interest in Cardano and how they will act for the community from now on . I think that autability here is very safe, even because it is a simpler proposal, so it is also simpler to monitor it, and I also think that the proponents make it very clear how the bridge between them and our community will be; that is, everything is in order. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1101, "q0": "It is reasonable to use the miscellaneous challenge to propose funding for an internship.
