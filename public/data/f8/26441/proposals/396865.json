The proposal stated, \u201cOur search engine will address the challenges by facilitating a responsive, easy-to-use website for deep metadata search\u201d. However, the proposal could explain better such as their feature for searching NFT (search/sort out by name, artist, characteristics), how fast the result will return, why people will use this search engine instead of the traditional method? In my opinion, the proposal should come up with more unique and effective features that can attract more people using it. For example, input an image and search for similar NFTs. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "We don't have any information on the team. We know the team will include two members: an engineer and an operations/management specialist., but the specific information about them is missing. Thus, I believe it is vital to provide their name, their roles in the proposal and a brief of past projects/works and their experience in the Cardano ecosystem. In addition, the profiles available on LinkedIn are also useful and enable initial trust with the team. The proposal project had implemented 90% of their goal in the first milestone. A few items are remaining which is fixing UX/UI, but who will be responsible for doing it? Other roles such as developer, system administrator, management should be declared on what they will contribute to the project. I am not sure why they need more than 2 months to refine UX and test bugs, then the estimated time required to deliver the project is in the next 3-to 6 months. There is no specific date that the complete system will be launched. Thus, I give this feasibility 2 out of 5.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The roadmap seems to repeat the same steps after milestone 1 which is the core idea of this proposal, the remaining milestones just to improve the performance of the project. According to the budget breakdown. However, the proposal did not mention the total number of people who will be involved in the project. The requested budget is just a short brief and unclear but asked for fund $35,000. Since the role developer and sysadmin is calculated $8,866 for each position, at the same time the proposal also asked for another $8,866 for looking for another developer, so this has confused me why they need to look for another developer and how many developers will join their team? Therefore, I recommend instead of writing in a general way, the proposal should break down the amount of $8,866 into smaller parts by answering these questions: what is the hour price for each developer/sysadmin? How many developers/sysadmins is needed? Finally, the measurement of progress and development could be done better if the proposal explain what can be done in the first months? and which methodologies are adapted to this project to manage the progress?
