The solution was to install and maintain wifi in rural schools in Paraguay. This will allow students to connect with the Cardano community sooner.

Internet access begets any movement toward the crypto space; there is no Cardano scaling without the internet. As such, we believe this comment to be incorrect in questioning the use of wifi integration in a country that Cardano could help in the future. \nOur team believes, just as World Mobile Token, which is supported by Charles Hoskinson, that internet access is one of the most significant ways crypto adoption can increase, so we think this proposal is a way to identify possible challenges to be proposed in future funds.\n \n Feasibility: \n \nThe proposal explicitly states that we would be working closely with Claro, Personal, and Tigo (all South American ISPs). \nWe have also deliberately included the monthly wifi price for each school in our budget, which seems to have been ignored in this assessment. Our plans for implementing wifi should be sufficient as the process is delineated clearly and does not need to go into explicit detail on the level of this proposal. We will mention the schools we will be partnering with which are the following: The names of the 6 schools our team will be working with are Escuela Primaria Alfonso Loma, Colegio Monsenor Demetrio Aquino, Escuela Primaria de San Jos\u00e9, Escuela Primaria Primero de Marzo, Colegio Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Mercedes, Escuela Primaria de San Pedro. Not only will the school's class of 120-200 students have wifi access, but the wifi will be available to the local community as well. This will allow a large amount of access to the Cardano ecosystem, and in tandem with local networking events the team is already implementing in this region, it would enable wider adoption of Cardano in the cordillera region of Paraguay, which is severely lagging.\n\nAuditability:\n\nWe believe the statement made by the CA is inaccurate. When it comes to auditability, our team mentioned:\n- the successful installation of internet and computers in chosen schools\n-The number of schools that successfully integrate the use of computers into their educational programs.\n-An increase in technological literacy among students\n\nHowever, we are not limited to just this. The number of students who interact with the Cardano ecosystem can be measured by the number of new yoroi wallets created and the number of new catalyst proposals submitted in the region. A thorough reading of the proposal would imply that interaction with the Cardano ecosystem through providing wifi access would be more than just purchase and service but rather an introduction to a new world these students did not have access to before, thus creating a more diverse pool of thinkers that can interact with the Cardano ecosystem\n"}, {"q0": "The Wifi has become fundamental right to all human, still  50% of world doesn't know about it, The proposer idea of providing wifi to rural parts of Paraguay is great idea , only with internet everyone can get access to ADA, for ADA to be implemented and introduced much needed task,\nBy providing funds ADA value will be increased, Introducing ADA to school children is best way to create future, The proposer idea of providing WIFI access to Rural Schools and kids and implementing ADA for kids is effectively addresses the challenge.
