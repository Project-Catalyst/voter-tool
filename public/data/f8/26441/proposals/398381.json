Is it one week? Or 2-4 weeks? \n\nThe budget of 50k, even tough it might appear detailed, and most likely calculated on some hourly wage - could have been paired to activities on the timeline.  e.g. first point -> Program design -> Program and challenges design, creation of challenge content -> $8770 - to what activities it is related? Is it related to the first two, in the first section User journey design and Promotional assets design? This part is unclear. At the same time, if you managed to calculated budget for one section, most likely based on the expected time spent, it could have been paired to the timeline, as mentioned above. \n\nAt the end of feasibility - since the plan is to use user generated content to create educational material, you need traction. But based on their twitter profile, there are only 3k followers, youtube channel posted video a year ago, which is actually making me less confident whether it can be implemented. My confidence was restored based on Instagram, 40k followers and the latest post 4 days ago, facebook 80k followers.

An example of a report was provided, which contains a lot of useful metrics to verify the success as well. Nevertheless, these KPIs are checking only the traction/or a traffic on their platform, but what about the problem vs solution? There are no provided metrics to check whether we have increased education among young people. To mention one metric specifically - there is a plan that success will be also defined as a 2k video entries focused on Cardano. What can be added, is a metric to at least check the number of new people who joined Cardano/Cardano catalyst via the app. Or a similar cardano related metric, that would allow the verification whether the proposal success was actually beneficial to the cardano.\n\nWhat I am actually missing is auditability of the progress. Given the timetable and the plan, there is a lot of things to be done, but there is no mention how to check how is e.g. \"program design\" progressing, or how do we check how is \"comms and media\" progressing. I suggest that some weekly, bi weekly reports via some channels would be posted, or a blog about simple \"A week at Goodwall\" with some sections \"what was done\" would provide sufficient information. \n\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_54", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10744, "q0": "This is an outreach type of proposal that is looking to use a mobile video platform to help spread the word of Cardano through video and community engagements.

The proposal consists of creating a diversified portfolio with video content on blockchain, aimed at young audiences. Young people could also upload videos reporting their experiences with the cryptographic world. From what I understand, the objective is really to promote an exchange of knowledge and promote Cardano to entrepreneurial powers, technology students, etc. I think it's a good idea, but I would like to understand more about the differences between the Goodwall platform and youtube itself, for example. It is also positive that some prizes are distributed, which increases engagement. Another point that I think could have been cited better is some examples of videos/content that would be generated and promoted here.

Talking now about final results, some numerical indications are given (1 million impressions, 30,000 appointments and 2,000 challenge entries) that say about the Goodwall platform itself.

And I say this from the position of someone who is not sympathetic to projects that stand on the shoulders of other projects to generate their own growth.  Unless they already have meat on the grill, smoking up the whole neighborhood. \n\nThese guys have the platform, they have the audience, they have the experience (they have worked with Unicef and Yoma, and if anyone knows who Yoma are they know that these people don't play games: they are in the hard business of finding a better future for young people).  \n\nThe user experience on the platform is pleasant: texture, speed, content, engagement, enrollment the first time ... pim pam pum, in a matter of seconds (and I don't like to wait in line unnecessarily).\n\nTheir target audience, the Gen z'ers, is an audience that the Cardano ecosystem is not paying enough attention to and is not being very ambitious about.  And that's a major strategic mistake. My eyes lit up a few days ago when I heard in one of the TH's (the East Asian community's IdeaFest Reels2) a young proponent funded in F6, proposing an F9 Challenge setting aimed at students, I thought I was listening to the most innovative idea in the ecosystem at the market level, only to realize that he, a 16-20 year old student, was also thinking like an old man, because he was referring to college students.  The question is: in this ecosystem we tend to get old? too many adult and brilliant ideas (discarding in this reflection those ideas that are just hot air that the system itself will end up depurating), too much search for the stevejobsian creativity, without space for the young stupidity from which eventually arise the outliers that shake the whole game? \"An exclusive challenge for young people between 16 - 20 years old, what a fantastic idea\".  Then, the clarification that it was for the young seniors of the universities.  Finally, the old questions of: \"how can you know that the person who is presenting himself in that category is really a student'\".  The short circuit in my mind was complete. \n\nI believe that the proponents have the tools and capabilities to deliver what they promise, with the infrastructure to execute a project like a challenge setting for true young people.  And if they deliver what they promise, they can potentially bring new blood to the Cardano ecosystem.  And if they bring new blood to Cardano, perhaps we can begin to realize that we are not in an old man's business: this is a business as young as the generations we are not paying attention to.  The complexity and current state of the world tends to overwhelm the consciousness and cloud the possibilities of a future that absolutely no one knows anything about.  \n\nAn important consideration for the voter to keep in mind: the proponents already have their own business, therefore, they already have their own concerns. Think of the proponents as potential good strategic partners in marketing, promotion and merchandising, not as Catalyst members involved in Town Halls or Cardano governance. Cardano would be their client, whose marketing budget would be $50,000 (total budget suggested in the proposal).  The evidence leads to the conclusion that the Cardano-proponent relationship will not go beyond those limits, which, from the position of task specialization, is quite efficient. So, no problem there.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The activities in the Roadmap and the items described in the budget make sense.  The team member information also presents no difficulties.  Additionally, if you go to the \"About us\" section of their website, you will find information not only about their commercial partners, you will find information about institutional support provided by the European Union.    The thing is, these guys have a lot of skin in the game, so if they fail us, we have their address. But, I think we're dealing with professionals.

I conclude that the metrics are good, and being based on numerical results, the project execution can be followed efficiently.

Summarizing, I believe it is a proposal that, while it can be adjusted for a different challenge, meets the miscellaneous requirements, therefore I am in agreement. The metrics provided are aligned and one of the proposals' objectives that I find particularly interesting is that the funding allocated to this program will result in the submission of 200 new proposals in Catalyst by the end of 2022.

Mainly because there is too much misinformation in crypto, and even more so when considering the position taken by the major crypto news portals with regard to Cardano. Regarding the implementation plan, I am able to discern that the team knows what it is doing and makes an appropriate distinction between the stages. It would have been preferable to read more about the educational content that they intend to develop, but I understand that perhaps the plan is to make preliminary analysis for defining the necessary requirements (in this respect, my previous recommendation becomes even more critical). I would like to add that Goodwall presents four additional proposals in addition to this one with exactly the same core team, although I can understand that they are an established organization capable of handling this work load, I would still like to know at least who will be the leader or project manager for each proposal since the skills and experience of this individual are critical.
