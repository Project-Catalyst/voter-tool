Students are our future rock stars, by introducing them to Cardano early on we can gain broader and more natural adoption. The online course presented is ambitious and includes relevant subjects. \nThis proposal is submitted in the Miscellaneous Challenge and it does align with the campaign brief. It could be questioned if the proposal should be placed in the \"New member onboarding\" category but it focuses more on the Project Catalyst, which is not the aim of this proposal. As a result, the proposal is considered impactful.\nThis proposal aims to equip students with the right tools early on to be introduced to blockchain theory and Cardano. That is indeed impactful and the proposal will receive a score of 5 stars in this section.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer is well educated and familiar with the academic environment, their claims of experience can be further verified through their personal website. The proposer is considered credible and their provided plan is detailed and sufficient given the scope of the project. The budget is reasonable for the work and time required to take the project from start to finish. As previously mentioned, given the scope and risks of the project, there is not much to address that should be altered in the proposal. The score given in terms of feasibility will be 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The description of progress is laid out quiet sparsely in the proposal with no real definition of how a phase is considered done or achieved. The milestones are split up into three months and it would be interesting to have a more clear definition of done in each stage in order for the community to audit the project. \nThe definition of success is also quiet general and hard to measure, it could be argued that it is straight up subjective. A suggestion is to include a clear goal that is measurable and easy to follow up. A few examples could be 50 potential candidates, 30 enrolled students, 20 students completed the course, 15 students achieved a great score (if applicable). \nWith the above mentioned points in mind, the score will be neutral in terms of auditability.

The scientific course entitled \"Cardano Science on Networks\" for which the proposal seeks funding is with a length of 30 hours, so this is a serious in depth course. \nThe target group that this course will address is a very important group for the growth of Cardano. \nI strongly agree that there are no other suitable challenges where this project could fit. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal has a not very detailed plan with a monthly time benchmarks. The syllabus for the project is outlined and the material will be taught in Brazilian Portuguese by the proposer who holds a Physics Ph. D. A website will be created to host the course, so the course supposedly will be available for other interested parties after the initial class, although this is not explicitly stated.\nThe budget is nicely divided in 4 segments in order to facilitate gradual funding. However the budget is not broken down in detail and with remuneration per hour.\nThe proposer states that the project is with sponsorship and staff support from the University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil. \nThe proposer has provided a link to his personal webpage, where we can find further links to his CV, but the linkedin link does not work, fortunately there are other links to other platforms where a CV could be found.\nI strongly agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer suggests that the progress of the project could be done on a monthly basis in line with the incremental milestones provided in the roadmap. Presumably the results will be seen on the website created to host the course, but that is not explicitly stated. The proposer does not attach any specific numbers against which the progress could be compared, number of website visits, number of  students following the course, etc. \nThe success measures for the project are also ambiguous, without concrete numbers and will be difficult for the auditor to define.\nI disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1417", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2588, "q0": "It sounds great to promote Cardano and engage students to yield future proposals to the Cardano Ideascale, but it doesn\u2019t seem to contribute that much more to the community if the students wont engage after the course is done.
