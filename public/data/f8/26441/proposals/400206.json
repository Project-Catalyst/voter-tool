Links are always appreciated. About timing, I would suggest not using summer as a measurement of time, since voters come from all over the world, I would suggest using a month approximation, just a small detail.

I would suggest creating a demo website first, if possible, or at least a social media.

Bringing a community of artists together to learn about selling NFTs on Cardano could be an educational experience for that group.  However, flights, accommodations, and curated event productions offer a small impact to the development of the actual Cardano ecosystem when considering that the group requires such a level of training, entertainment, and gifts to recognize the opportunity that exists for them in blockchain.  Also considering that most of the art NFTs sold online right now are digital art format - meaning the artist already have some level of tech savviness - I'm not sure the target market is even appopriate, and no examples of the artists were presented in the proposal that could help to evaluate in more detail.

I do appreciate that the proposal author has gone to such lengths to conceptualize and present this opportunity.

In terms of auditability, I believe this initial idea could be difficult to measure in terms of success.

Being an NFT artist himself and a clinical embalming professor for 7 years shows his experience in the ecosystem and ability to teach a very hands-on job. When onboarding a new person into crypto, this level of care and patience is needed. Knowing how long the proposer has been an NFT artist for and be able to check out any current projects available would provide a bit more transparency.
