The meaning is to celebrate Catalyst and engage external businesses and institutions.\nThe proposer has already paid for domain name for the convention landing page.\nThis is planned to be a two day convention with presentations, awards for projects, workshops and discussions. There is a detailed plan for the events in the convention, marketing strategy and a look towards the future, for the 2023 convention.\nThis is a proposal with multifaceted effects and could trigger objectives in several challenges in this fund, however it is just a peripheral to all those challenges and its place is in none of them. \nI strongly agree that there is no better challenge to host that proposal than the miscellaneous challenge. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is very well developed and explained plainly and in a structured way. It shows a thought and planning behind everything that is written.\nThe proposal presents a road map, with one, three and six months milestones. Unfortunately this roadmap does not go into enough detail. More detail will show to the voter unequivocally that everything is ready and taught out and we are just waiting for the funding to start executing.\nThere is a budget broken down by categories, however the budget is not very detailed. The ultimate breakdown for a budget is when we reach the $/h point. I strongly suggest that this is included in the next proposal. \nThe good thing is that $13000 of the budget will be funneled back to the community via remuneration of judges, speakers, panelists and awards.\nThe bad thing of the budget is that the proposer calculates a budget of $39 000 but asks for just $28 000 in this fund with the suggestion that the budget gap will be closed in fund 9 or through other means. I can\u2019t help but wonder why someone will split the budget for two funds if this will bring uncertainty for the acquisition of the missing part of the budget. \nThe team is well presented and with links to linkedin profiles and related web pages. This is the wada team, it has a high visibility in the community and instills trust. Also the team as if not enough partners with Catalyst Swarm, Catalyst School and Gimbalabs.\nI strongly agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project will be easy to audit because it will be all in the open. If the community does not hear about the project then, the project is not successful, if it does, it is successful. Everything will be easy to follow. As regards to measurable KPIs, there are a lot of them listed, but there are no rigid numbers against which to compare the results to understand if the project is progressing accordingly by upfront definition. The success parameters however are very good and ligned with concrete numbers. We are expecting 200 attendees, 30 projects participating and attracting 50 new members to the Catalyst community. That is a solid, easily identifiable measureable benchmark for success.\nI strongly agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1417", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 4, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2544, "q0": "The proposer's solution to the problem is presenting/conducting an annual 2-day virtual convention which will celebrate and highlight the accomplishments of Project Catalyst to a wider audience and fund such an event that will engage institutions and businesses alike. This proposer is an active member of the community within PC and Cardano who has previously hosted a similar 2-day event with great success. The problem being solved is the overall knowledge and awareness of what Project Catalyst is and does and what benefits it offers projects within the Cardano ecosystem. This event would be much deserved recognition of what they've achieved this past year (TBD). This type of idea can be beneficial to many businesses and project creators, potentially introducing new & current users to the work and dedication PC has done so far and what is being done for the future of the space. Project Catalyst is without a doubt an underrated platform within the Cardano community still today. Showcasing the accomplishments and perhaps even failures being learned from and improved upon, would be a great tool for the ecosystem and it's members that may or may not be aware what Project Catalyst is designed to do for the crypto community as a whole and the impact the platform is having on the world already. Such an event would add certain value to the ecosystem if the key metrics proposed are addressed and completed accordingly before Q4. Future challenges in regards to the proposed attendance and marketing are among the most impactful for successful scaling and completion of the idea.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Like IOHK and the Cardano Summit, this solution of creating and planning of an event relies heavily on the team involved. It may be obvious to me, but I believe this proposal could be brought to an even bigger scale given the success of Project Catalyst, and turn a 2-day virtual event, into a real life in person event, similar to the Cardano Summit but with just one, smaller venue. This would allow the entire Catalyst team and funded projects the opportunity to meet and greet one another beyond a live stream, promoting real world experiences within the community and it's members whom have only been in connection through monitors and mics. This may be ambitious in and of itself as a virtual event, but with an even larger budget proposed, this team may be more than capable of pulling together it's resources to accomplish this celebration of technology and community, presenting to thousands if not millions via virtually, a more engaging experience, with live interviews from projects around the world, solidifying the continued success of Project Catalyst. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposed event could be clearly auditable by the project manager with monthly updates given through the CatalystCon website, the Wada website, Partner websites and in Catalyst Townhall as stated. As a member who attends most if not all Catalyst Townhalls, I don't see setting aside 2 minutes every meeting for short updates on the KPI metrics of success that may unfold over the next weeks and months leading up to Q4, i.e. sign-ups, partnerships created, Catalyst project participants etc. Whether it stays as a virtual 2-day event or if Project Catalyst can take the leap towards a live in person venue, remains to be seen.

According to this Boardable guide to virtual meetings, meeting remotely can save up to 40 minutes of commute time. Those extra minutes mean more time for new ideas, problem-solving, and task completion. Hence doing virtual catalyst Con is a very good idea where most of the people can get to know about the in and out of the cardano system. It will be a platform to exchange ideas and knowledge.\nThe proposer has identified the problem as this has never been done before and is a very good initiative to be done for the betterment of Cardano and its community.\nBy doing this it will definitely add value to the Cardano ecosystem as it is getting standardized and a lot more opportunities are open by doing the Catalyst Con for the new generation people to get to know more avout Cardano. The proposer has pointed out the key metrics and also has planned well to reach the goal. This proposal is an starts as an initiative to cardano and has a lot of abilities to scale for the future and its challenges to come along.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has laid out the roadmap on how to implement the proposal. The proposer and his team's experience are very impressive and also have provided relevant links to assure the success of the proposal.\nThe proposer has quite an idea about the members and the team required for this job to be done and is sure of it. The proposer has asked for a budget of 28000 USD which would be required to first setup the proposal and then the rest of the money to be planned on raising on fund raising 9 or by other means which shows that the proposer has understood the budget clearly and has broken down into specific items.\nThe proposer also has the resources on necessary to implement the project.\nThe proposer has considered the challenges he will be facing during the course of implementation and also has alternate solutions to overcome the problem and by considering the expertise and the knowledge of the proposer this plan is highly likely to be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer has a clear idea about the implementation of the proposal and the resources required to implement it. The proposer has requested funds for 28000 USD and has provided the breakup cost of each expenditure, considering that we could tell the funds would be sufficient to implement the proposal and has provided all the information required to process the audit. The proposer has clearly understood the need of the virtual convention in Cardano as it has never been done before and is going to revolutionize the concept of Conventions in the future and has also addressed the solutions and the plan required to implement it and the resources required along with the team of expertise.
