The idea is to create a \u201cZiwwe platform\u201d where people can transfer money quickly and conveniently to each other. However, in my view, this is already what we do with our digital wallets (whether yoroic, ccvaultio, etc, wallets that work with Cardano); Blockchain transactions already have this characteristic of being simple and fast, this already happens, it is already an existing technology. Another problem that I identified here was that the proponent claims that the idea is to transfer a stable currency, but Cardano does not have this, as he claims. So in my view it doesn't make sense that a project is created to work with something that doesn't yet exist in our ecosystem. I think the proponent is not suggesting something innovative, something that will help Cardano become popular and widely adopted. Therefore, I think that this proposal would be more interesting in case it suggests solutions to improve a situation that already exists (for example, transfers in digital wallets) or could propose new solutions that meet the needs of the members of the Cardano ecosystem and attract new people to our community. Regarding the impact, I really felt that this proposal does not meet the objectives of the challenge and leaves a lot to be desired. \n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "I found the script of this proposal rather vague. We are told that activities would develop according to the quarters of the years 2022 and 2023. However, the explanations are very superficial. For example, the first quarter of this year would be an \u201cIdeation Phase, Market Research, Proposal Submission\u201d. The proponent could have detailed this much better, what will this idealization look like? Who will work on it and doing what? What exactly will he be looking for during his market research? To whom would he present the proposals? The same thing I think for the second quarter of this year: \u201cFinish the Software Requirements Document\u201d. How would this finalization be done, in what form is the document expected to be so that it can be presented? Now, analyzing the requested budget, 80 thousand dollars are requested, a very high amount. I believe that the value would be justifiable with the complexity of this project, however the budget explanations should also be better detailed. Let's take the third quarter of this year as an example. The following activities would be carried out: \u201cFinish POC (Mobile Application - iOS/Android) + Growth - Publications/Reach/Marketing to grow Remitter Network + MRP v1 Development\u201d, with a cost of $10,000. How much would each of these parts cost? I'm concerned that the proponent reserves 10 to 20 thousand dollars for miscellaneous expenses, but if that is not necessary, for example if the expense is 10 thousand dollars, what would happen to the other 10 thousand? Finally, analyzing the team, it is actually just one person, the proposer. We know the role of Tochi Eke-Okoro and its linkedin, however, it is not presenting a curriculum, we do not know how it relates to the Cardano ecosystem. It would be important to have this information, in addition to what I think is inappropriate for this type of project to be developed by a single person; in my opinion, the team should also contain a designer to interface the Dapp and a publicist to generate a strong and appropriate marketing campaign. For these reasons, I think the feasibility of the proposal is low, in need of improvement. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The bidder provides us with 4 points that would serve to audit the process - increase in local senders signing up or registering on the Ziwwe platform to support remittances + successful transaction percentage + TVL increase rate for loans and loans + liquidity increase. However, two important things are missing here. The first would be that: how would the Cardano community become aware of such statistics? Would the standard meetings with IOG coordinators take place, and after that, would this content also be made available to all members of the ecosystem, whether through telegram, discord, any online platform like Notion, Miro? And the other thing that I am concerned about is in relation to monitoring the work of the proponent, we know that the project would last about 2 years, it is a very long time, it would be necessary that some measurable ways to monitor the tasks that are behind the partial results were possible. The proponent, in my view, should prepare quarterly reports (preferably monthly, but as he divides his time into quarters, it could also be done) in a way that would update the entire community on the small advances of this project, as was his work routine, if problems had to be solved and so on. Regarding the final results, the proponent summarizes the objectives of the application being able to promote the fast and safe transfer of a stablecoin (he does not mention the stablecoin at this point in the proposal, but I infer that this is it); this would depend on the adoption of this platform by different audiences, and also on the growth of the community that the proponent already has on discord. I found this scenario very abstract, not saying about the Cardano ecosystem. It would be essential for us to know directly what the consequences of this project were for our blockchain, how it contributed to its wide adoption, if more people started making transactions on Cardano, etc. Therefore, I also found this topic inappropriate, in need of improvement. The part that I thought was better is the auditability of the process, but the final results are still very vague. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "I disagreed with this proposal's methodology to address the challenge at hand for 2 main reasons, 1) I believe it is more suited to the Dapps and Integrations challenge, especially since it is targets problems in remittance AND lending, which are primarily DeFi functions, 2) The project is entirely dependent on DJED, which is issued by Coti - a company also working to solve on/off-ramp and stablecoin conversion problems with their Coti Pay products, which seems to solve nearly identical problems as presented in this proposal.  While I believe in competition, and certainly see no harm in multiple iterations of tools aimed at solving the same problem, I could have had more of a neutral 3 star position on this particular approach had it not been listed in the Miscellaneous challenges.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "While timeline and budgets for this project are present, it's difficult to evaluate the accuracy of those estimates as presented.  The budgets, for example, are almost equally distributed on a time basis over upcoming quarters, without any specific comments on how the proposer intends to spend those budgets or how the cost model was achieved.  At this stage, the project also seems like an enormous undertaking in effort, although only a single team-member (the proposer) is listed, along with a plan to hire a development team if the project is funded.  From my experience researching other similar projects, I would recommend explaining how this project is different/localized, or drill down into more detail on delivery and propose a way to break it up into smaller pieces that might offer a higher confidence level for delivery.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Does this project have a github repository or any kind of open source code?  With only relatively new social media channels to go off of, the proposer's own metrics for auditability are almost entirely transaction volume based.  Given that it's nearly the end of Q1 and the proposer claims to have boostrapped a pitch deck and feasibility study, it could be nice to at least see some of that work presented in the proposal.  The timeline presented for the MVP then beta version of lending functionality will also not be available until late 2023, so perhaps waiting until there is a stablecoin live on the cardano chain for your idea which is so dependent on that rollout could give you a chance to gain more community support on a later fund.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1224", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Banking the unbanked is a main theme in many African and underdevelopped regions.

Many expatriates are transferring money at huge costs due to the lack of Fiat-Digital currencies links in their local (back home) countries where they are supporting the ir families. \nIf we support such projects the challenge would bring a positive impact to the cardano community.

The demand for such an app is very high, especially for travelers that visit around the world.

Whoever can setup this platform and navigage the different financial regulation of the countries it operates would not only strike into a huge market but also greatly merits the block chain platform it uses.

And what is unique power that Tochi and Ziwee have to make it happen now? I fail to see this criticla factor from the proposal, and would like to suggest Tochi to demonstrate more of this in his next proposal. \n\nSecondly, the project depends wholy on a not yet published stable coin (Djed), and there is no guarantee for the success of this project or that the proposer can do it himself as stated, \"We can completely avoid this risk by implementing an algorithmic stable coin, though this would definitely extend our intended launch date\".\n\nThirdly, I appreciate for the long-term plan throughout 2022 and 2023, and I think it is feasible if everything and the stable coin goes well.

I propose the first funding stage (Fund 8) is to cover until the beta Launch of MRP v1 on Cardano in Q1 2023. The remaining stage would need the next round of funding, after the next round of assessment of the first stage. \n\nFurthermore, the introduction of a new product does not stop at initating and creating it, but also bringing it out to the market.
