With an estimated 10.9 networked devices per capita, according to a study by Cisco, and being the highest spending in mobile apps per capita country in the world, according to Sensor Tower, Japan is home to a tech/innovation hungry society.\nAlthough the problem statement doesn't clearly introduces the real problem, it is explained at the end of the Impact section. Waiting for people to get to know Cardano and the progresses it has been making is not a very efficient strategy on growing the chain. Also, it opens doors to other chains like Ethereum to attract business and users that could instead be joining Cardano ecosystem.\nJapan being so tech centered, is a key territory to focus on expansion efforts. It has the potential to develop solutions that will become wolrdwide, and that should be done inside Cardano. For so, actively publicizing about Cardano there could make a huge impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team seems to have a great experience with press and media in general, with several contacts in the industry. On the other hand, the only member with blockchain experience is Andrew Tamura and not too much is said about it. It would be good to have more explanation on his work and to have some reference or link about all four members.\nThe 36k budget would make more sense if you included some reach expectation so we could better measure potential impact. Judging by the team's reported experience, this initiative could reach thousands of people, but how any thousand?\nThe plan is well divided into tasks and the timetable seems feasible. A little more detail on each task would also help analyse this initiative proportion, such as which documents will be reviewed, and which media interviews are going to take place.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The tasks are well divided so the community may be able to keep track of them. However, there will be lots of things happening between April and June, are all tasks going to be executed throughout this entire period? Even if so, you could try to set smaller milestones, each with shorter goals for a better auditability.\n'Media Outreach' and 'Media Meetings and Interviews' are good KPIs to measure the success of this proposal. As mentioned before, you could add a KPI regarding the reach of those publications, for it is the key point of all this.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_951", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "I believe at this particular time, it is just as important as ever to communicate good/correct information relating to Cardano's core features, roadmap, and overall potential in an increasingly busy blockchain environment.  Japan is a progressive environment for cryptocurrency regulation, but mass market consumers also require localized content.  Leveraging a team who is experienced with production and distribution of Japanese content could be a good way to build a more engaged community within Japan.  Based on my knowledge of PR, the proposed solution to the challenges described in this proposal are logical and experienced.  The structure of the proposal is well organized, and the proposer also presents thoughtful case studies to compliment it.   I do agree with the basis for this proposal, but did not strongly agree because in theory I'm slightly hesitant to acknowledge that an initiative like this should be needed.  But in practice, I can appreciate it's merits.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Based on the teams experience, case studies presented, timeline, and budget prepared for this project, I think it is highly likely that the team understands and aligns on the scope of what is needed to deliver a successful project.

The case studies presented also indicate that the subject matter has been well researched and provides a foundation to build on in the delivery of this project.   I agreed, but did not strongly agree, since PR and media tend to be a bit \"hit or miss.\"  Success in this field depends partly on knowledge and experience, and partly on luck and timing - meaning I believe the while the intentions are good, the results have a limitation on their guarantee to provide highly measurable results.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Subjectivity aside, I think the team has done a decent job of defining the relevant KPIs for this project, defining the terms for project governance, and describing both the tangible and intangible visions for success.

In particular, the creation of success story profiles strikes me as a strategy that can help bolster Cardano's image at this phase of the project. The team appears to the international bonafides, background in PR, and necessary command of both Japanese and English. \n\nWhile I believe this project has a lot of potential, I unfortunately cannot say that it meets the parameters of the Miscellaneous Challenge category.
