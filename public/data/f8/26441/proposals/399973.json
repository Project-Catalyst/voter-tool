This proposal is judged partly through its individual merits, and partly through the way it fits into the wider DLT360 project. My assessment takes into account aspects common across all proposals (team specific like adequacy, competency, workload, or similar reporting mechanisms / budget logic). You shall therefore find common parts across these proposals (labeled as such) and parts specific to each proposal, which should offer a good balance of looking at each tree but not missing out the overall health of the forest. \n\nSpecific part: Behind the wider DLT360 umbrella lies another sub-project focused on the Risk and Opportunity Radar, with 4 branches and 5 proposals. This proposal focuses on the 2nd branch - Environment / Health / Ethics / Reputation. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "COMMON part: Great team. DLT360 is operated by an outstanding and growing team of regulatory experts, very active in the Cardano community. They also benefit from a scalable network of contributors from the Cardano community, academia, industry and EU institutions. In terms of team competence, skills and experience, they are well positioned.The multitude of projects funded under their umbrella showcases the great capacity to identify opportunities within the Cardano community and clearly articulate them into actionable projects. \n\nCOMMON part: Significant existing and future workload. DLT360 is a wider project initially funded in Fund6, and greatly supported by at least 5 proposals in Fund7, for a total funding so far of 85.000 USD (own calculations), many of them being still ongoing. During Fund8 the team is casting a very wide net with 13 additional proposals across several challenges, for a total funding of 295.000 USD. Onboarding so many projects so quickly can potentially lead to: too much workload, overlapping deadlines, increased risks of under-delivering, inability to distinguish added value of one project versus another, unnecessary stress and a lack of focus on and core scope and competencies. Future iterations that can bring comfort to these worries will of course be highly appreciated. \n\nCOMMON part: ALL of the 13 projects have overhead items included in the budget (project management, social media, back office, etc.) consuming an overall 30-40% of each budget (an educated guess let\u2019s call it). I think there was a missed opportunity there in terms of gathering all overheads under one roof and simplifying the budgets for all proposals by keeping them strict for core-activities.\n\nSpecific part: 20% of the budget goes to active content sharing by domain experts, 20% to quarterly video shooting, 20% to team meetings with Radar-content review. For budget core-work rates are 25 to 100 USD/hour. \n\nAgain, striking similarity in scope to the other 3 branches and again, suggest merging them for future iterations. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "COMMON part: Existing track record. DLT360 projects are interlinked and since there are a number of running projects the team is definitely familiarized with the standard procedures and reporting process of the Catalyst team, so there are very low risks in terms of failing to communicate properly or inability to implement the necessary KPIs. \n\nCOMMON part: The website is a great opportunity for improvement. A concern is the fact that glancing at the DLT360 website, there is no reflection of recent live presentations that were perhaps delivered to the community in Q1 2022. I am aware that it is a work in progress tool, and a very nice-to-have feature would be for such live presentations / slides / supporting materials to be uploaded there as soon as possible and be accessible for the community as an intermediate deliverable until the projects are finalized. Also for the sake of transparency, a user-friendly list of funded (any why not unfunded) proposals would definitely be appreciated, at least by future CAs.\n\nSpecific part: basic KPIs are presented: size of active network, new content elements, net promoter score from Cardano community. I am not sure how they will manage to obtain data on the NPS score from the Cardano community, or how that community is being defined.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1454", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9707, "q0": "The proposal at hand is suggesting a different kind of outlook the entire Cardano chain can achieve. A go-to destination for all kinds of research and risk management. While many would think about making the chain stronger on the technology or the usability front, the proposer here tries to improve it on the informational front. One-stop hub for all initiatives to assess their businesses and the competitions and evaluate their operations would make Cardano a somewhat business encouraging, start-up chain. This could drive a lot of businesses and users from different walks of life onto the chain. Impact-wise and reach-wise this proposal could do wonders. The idea is not fuzzy, it's quite clear on what the team is trying to achieve, and a part of the big picture they share with us they are quite aware of the kind of opportunities and also the vulnerabilities they will have to address.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provides the community with a crystal clear description of the intended business model and the proposer speaks confidently about the deliverables we could expect along with the features they come with. Again this proposal being a significant portion of the bigger product DLT360, most of the milestones are generic but the proposer still makes specific points regarding this project alone which all adhere to the expectations one would have this being a \"Miscellaneous challenge\". The points are compact and self-explanatory. The funds requested also looks sensible and rational considering the amount of groundwork and research already done. The roles of the team are also very definite and all of them are filled with competent individuals.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer makes no mistakes when providing the metrics the auditors could use to monitor the progress. The clear-cut success definition and roadmap instills trust amongst the community regarding the proposal's success. The team is successfully funded in the previous rounds is quite acquainted with the audit process and they shall assist the community with all reports and tracking metrics. The KPIs set are impactful and quantifiable and thus sets a clear picture about the kind of success we could expect at the end. The success criteria the team has set for themselves are enhanced versions of the KPIs and provide a verifiable figure against them to evaluate it. On successful implementation, this initiative could help a lot of applications and businesses approach Cardano for their market analysis, opportunities, and risk reduction.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10543, "q0": "This proposal is part of a bigger project, whose intent is to conduct continuous research (quarterly reports) on risks and opportunities for the blockchain space. This proposal would fund the \"Environment/Health/Ethics/Reputation\" dimension. I don't see this proposal fitting any other challenge, so it's a good candidate for the miscellaneous challenge. The impact on the community is yet to be known, as the plan is to share first deliverables from the team's proposal in Fund6 in the next few months, but given the team's involvement in the community, I think it's fair to give the benefit of the doubt.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As part of a much bigger project, the overall project plan is clearly defined, and the specific activities funded by this proposal are reasonably identified.  The core team should be experienced in this kind of work, but potentially thinly spread with the amount of proposals they're involved in. For this particular proposal, the team is reinforced with two senior experts, altough only their name is stated, and a google search does not provide any info on any of them. I trust the selection of the experts would be adequate, given the expertise of the team, and their choices on other proposals.\nBudget breakdown is quite detailed, and the overall budget is reasonable.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Proposed KPIs seem appropriate, measuring both the output (new content) and impact (partners and contributors). I find very interesting the inclusion of Net Promoter Score as a KPI. This is a metric used by brands to measure client perception, and it's refreshing to see it used in this context.\nNote to vCAs.
