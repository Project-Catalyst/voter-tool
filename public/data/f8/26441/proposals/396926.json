As multiple municipalities have already decriminalized consumption of psilocybin mushrooms, I believe this dialogue is already occurring in legislative bodies, and that community voices are being taken into consideration. From my perspective, blockchain and CNFT's do not further discussion or address the issue at hand. Lastly, I believe the correlation of the relevance of this proposal to the mission of Cardano is tenuous at best. The problems identified in this proposal do not meet the challenge criteria and address issues outside of the Cardano community.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "It is honorable to raise awareness and funding for mental health resources, but doing so is not likely to have an impact on furthering dialogue in regards to changing legislation or introducing new legislation. My suggestion would be that inviting qualified mental health professionals with successful experiences in using psychedelics to gain positive mental health outcomes would be far more impactful to solving the issues of dialogue and legislative relief. Furthermore, the proposer has not identified which specific institutions would be funded if the city council neglected to choose any. As the challenge criteria are not met, implementation seems highly improbable at best.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "As prior mentioned, no mental health institutions or related charities are included in the current proposal. Thus it is difficult to grade the auditability of this proposal. The  monies requested for NFT generation are not specified in any substantive manner. The proceeds from sales of the NFT's are also unspecified. It would be helpful if the proposer could identify exactly which tools would be used, how many NFT's would be produced, which exchange they would be listed on, how would they be advertised, what the pricing of the NFT's would be. what wallet would be used and how the ADA received would be exchanged for fiat and how that would be distributed. I have reviewed the two prior submissions by this author and while some organizational progress has been made, the format is still lacking coherency and does not conform to Cardano standards of 3,6 and 12 month budgetary and disbursement standards. The project only loosely describes metrics which could be used as KPI's, but the term is absent from the proposal.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1131", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 3, "ng": 5, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "This is a respectful review, and while I disagree, thank you.\n\nImpact: This proposal is the Most Miscellaneous I have seen. No previous psychedelic dialogue has been recorded that I have seen, and if so, it has never been just one common person, always well connected political businesses, not openly funded by blockchain. Part of the mission of Cardano is to integrate with regulatory agencies. How does creation of dialogue with local governance through ADA and recording CNFT highlights of the dialogue not have potential impact on this mission for Cardano?\n\nFeasibility: Is this @newmindflow? I have provided video evidence talking to City Council already. All my proposal suggests is dialogue as the next step. Incentivizing with ADA makes this more feasibile. The suggestion is beyond the scope of the proposal as I am talking about Decriminalization not Legalization. I said that a psychedelic mental health instituition would be funded if city council neglected to choose any. What challenge criteria is not met? Implementation can be highly improbable while still meeting all proposal feasibility standards.\n\nAuditability: I specifically say that it will be up to the city council what charities are given ADA. All of these details about CNFTs are unnecessary red herrings. $703 is clearly enough to make CNFTs of the discussion highlights and use a no code CNFT solution. The review does not argue that $703 in ADA is not enough. Proceeds from sales of NFTs are specified. I used 3 month budgetary standards. Did the reviewer not read my proposal? I see the word KPI so much it has lost all meaning to me. It is a buzzword. My proposal is directly auditable through video. Did I talk to city council? Did I have a charity discussion about Psychedelic Decriminalization funded through ADA? Did I make CNFT meme highlights of said discussion? \n\nSuggestions from this review show that the reviewer wants details that simply cannot be provided until I have a discussion with City Council. Furthermore, they did not read the proposal's auditability section as I have a 3 month budget clearly. Get audited!"}, {"q0": "Our societies clearly need to be more open minded about psychedelics and their potential use for therapy. The proposal couldn\u2019t fit in any other challenges.

The link with Cardano is beyond obvious as I am proposing in Project Catalyst, want to fund charity meetings with ADA, and want to make CNFTs highlight memes of charity meetings. In addition, one of Cardano's missions is integration with regulatory agencies. This perfectly aligns.\n\nFeasibility: Professional background isn't needed and would take away from the impact of the \"anyone can do it\" mentality. The videos provided show feasibility in the sense of willingness to discuss with City Council. I have not reached the actual discussion point yet. I am trying to get my local legislation to match the de jure to the de facto. I have provided evidence in attachments of nearby Decriminalization and scientific research studies that will be discussed further.\n\nAuditability: The reviewer says \"auditing would be easy to accomplish.\" The reviewer goes beyond the scope of the review with \"not impossible, but there's a long way to go.\" That is personal opinion.\n\nI think this reviewer goes beyond the scope of what they are being asked to do and falls into personal opinion (which does have validity, but is in the wrong context in a review.)"}, {"q0": "The problem identified fits well within the misc challenge as there's no challenge category for(alternative)  psychological well being or cognitive security (made, built or supported) by Cardano.\n\nUsing the power of memes (smallest unit of an idea) to create powerful vehicles for conveying complex themes or arguments or even emotions in this context is brilliant and might even work - the budget is small and reasonable enough to give it a try. \nThe added value to the Cardano ecosystem would be the public exposure in a precedent trial for decriminalisation of entheogens. The creation of the NFT authenticating the meme, could garner more positive publicity. \nEven before getting funded the proposer (this proposal) has managed to create a space of acceptance and dignity of being - which leads to believe that Cardano is the best fit for communities around self empowerment and initiatives like this will thrive and nourish the community in return.\n\nHow it will scale is not clearly enough articulated, only hinted at by using the power of memes to hitch on to emotions and effect change from within individuals and thus institutions that are spearheaded by such individuals. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer already started engaging with City Council and left video evidence of it in the proposal. He's not yet flexing his skills enough, giving room for the council members to express their thoughts.\nThe only \"team member\" is the proposer himself, however other people vital to an official decriminalisation (council members) have been identified and lightly engaged already.\n\nEven tho it was not yet fully understood by the city council and responsibility was shoved over to the state; the proposer continues to show heart and conviction. \nThe main risk/impediment of the need to have an item \"agendized\" before it can be discussed by the city council has been identified and is being treated as a high priority by the proposer.\n\nIn case the council will not pick up the item for 3 months, the funds will be donated to a psychedelic mental health charity.\nThe city council attorney referred to only the state legislating criminal laws, apparently the city by default enforces what laws are being passed down by the state. \nSeems like the proposer will have to go in front the state regulators to push for wider change. \n\nThe power dynamic between the US, the individual state and city makes it a bit unclear if the proposer can effectively partake in or continue the decriminalisation of entheogens. But it should be tried anyhow!\nAdditionally it's not yet clear how the CNFT of the discussions will look like and why 703 USD is spent on it.\n\nThe proposer's conviction and engagement with the Cardano community signals a strong impression that the proposal actually might effect decriminalisation of entheogens  (plant based psychedelics) on local or even global levels.\n\nSome additional information on how the decentralisation of the playbook will take place,would be helpful to achieve a full assessment score.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Tracking and success measurement is done in a very transparent and apparent fashion via city council recordings published on youtube.

Worth a try!\n\nFeasibility: Really nice points on the city/state/country dynamic. The Decentralization aspect is dependent on CNFT memes of the discussions that have not taken place yet, so that is why I did not add more information. I did say that decentralization depends on the mimetic value or how much the CNFTs sold for but before I have the discussion, I do not know how many memes I am working with, their quality, etc. I would say that this proposal had 248 \ud83d\udc41  so that is proof of some \"meme\" feasibility.\n\nAuditability: See above for the Decentralization aspect.\n\nThis is an excellent review, but I do not think I should be marked down for the Decentralization process as the memes have not been created yet.

I don't understand. The budget is clear: 3 discussions $1000 in ADA each. The rest goes to making CNFT memes of discussions. I do not yet know how many memes, their quality, etc. so I do not know what else I could have added. The $4901.96 was the amount of money $500,000 for the challenge divided by the number of proposals at the time.
