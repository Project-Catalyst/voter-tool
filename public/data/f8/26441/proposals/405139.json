Therefore in principle any proposal could be in this challenge that is does not fit into other challenges. This Catalyst School proposal is aimed to improve the clarity in the Catalyst process for Proposers, Community Advisors and Voters and therefore does not align precisely with the other best matches (does not fit in \"New Members Onboarding\" as this covers existing members as well, does not fit in \"Community Advisor Improvements\" as also addresses Proposers and does not fit in \"Scale-UP Community HUBs\" as is not targeted to end user of Cardano in general, but rather those who build and work to expand the capabilities of Cardano in particular). The proposer discloses this in their proposal as well", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The presented team of 10 people is composed of capable Community Advisors who have ran similar workshops in the past which gives credibility that they can continue doing what they have been doing. This proposal is a continuation of a similar proposal from Fund7 which has funded these workshops to date. I have some reservations on the number of people (10) put forwards when there is total of 6 workshops to be given, seems a little too many people for the job. I would expect that at full capacity the workshop can be delivered by 2 people, 1 leading and the other taking minutes and other secretariat support. Also the budgeted time for each of the workshops is a little excessive at 13.5 hours man hours spent for a 1.5 hours workshop particularly. This, however, doesn't take away from the ability to deliver on the proposal to host 6 workshops although the long roaster of people and the lack of definition of who will do what suggests a little over reliance of being able to find hosts along the way - as the propose states in the risk \"...The main challenge of this proposal is finding hosts in time\". For this reason I give 4 in this assessment\n\nThe stated target audience size is 20 per workshop and 100 youtube views. Looking through the last 3 videos on youtube from Catalyst School, they attracted 141, 174 and 342 views and were recorded this 15th and 11th Mar and last 6th Dec, so the youtube view target is reasonable. The same videos had 6,7 and 4 participants so a little shorter than the 20 expected. This is obviously based on a small sample size", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is a promise to deliver 1) 6 workshops with; 2) 1.5h in length each and ;3) Slides and; 4) youtube recordings.

This is because there are currently so many members of the community that have never heard about the opportunities that they have to become a potential Proposer or CA. I think that this proposal gives a good outlook on where the problem lies, and gives a specific detailed explanation on how these requested funds in this proposal will help them to educate the community more. I would love to learn more about different skills we can learn as proposers and CA's to be more effective and efficient.

The skills of the team seem to be sufficient for going through the different workshops and teaching the community.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There was a lot of good information within the proposal. I think that releasing the videos of these workshops on Youtube will be very valuable because they will always be there for other people interested in the programs to see.

The problem is clearly defined and the solution of challenge-specific workshops to address the problem is proposed.\nThe challenge-specific workshops will assist three groups. The proposers, CAs and vCAs, and the voters. The proposer clearly outlines how these groups will benefit from this initiative. \nIf proposers better understand the challenge score and key elements better, then the CAs will get better quality proposals in future rounds. If the CAs can learn from those with domain-specific knowledge then they can provide assessments of a higher quality. This will result in less assessments being filtered out. When voters learn from domain experts then they are in a better position to make in informed vote. \nThe above points show that the overall community will benefit from the launch of this proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The budget and the timeline is straightforward and clear.
