The proponent claims that web3 is the future and that it will launch a series of projects, brands, businesses and etc that will make a lot of money. He also claims that he will clarify for the masses what blockchain, web3 and etc is, so that people understand and adopt the technologies of our ecosystem. I think this proposal has many serious flaws. Starting with the fact that we do not have an objective that can be reached based on a series of activities, which would linearly constitute the development of the project. Many different things are promised, like making the digital revolution \u201cWeb3 Blockchain Apps\u201d a reality; \u201cwe will provide the latest Blockchain media/travel/publishing/encryption/music stores without censorship and we will build the best UBER/BOOKING/AIRBNB\u201d and etc. Which stores would be provided? How would it be provided? The proponent wants to make various economic branches relevant to Cardano's technologies, as he says at the end of the impact \u201dWe decentralized Travel/Media/Music from the global entities and offer a new reward for the use of our platforms blockchain.\u201d But at no time is it clarified how. There are many different things, I think it is better to outline an initial project, well planned, containing steps to be followed; challenges to be mitigated (the proponent defines as a challenge that he is not of the field of technology, which is very worrying, because how does he intend to carry out a technological revolution without being in the area?); this project should also contain an objective s more specific. Instead of wanting to transform the general scenario, the proponent could focus, for example, on one of the areas mentioned, such as transport (he mentions uber). It would be interesting for him to suggest a Dapp that works in the area of \u200b\u200blocomotion, through payments in Ada, using smart contracts, making people create digital wallets, in short, in general, that they know and adopt the technologies relevant to our ecosystem. Rather than saying that it will introduce the cryptographic world of web3 to the masses, the proponent could have provided some palpable plan on first raising awareness of a target audience, so that the concepts would then be more widespread. He would need to explain what would happen, how, who would do it, when and by what specific objectives the project was being guided. Unfortunately, the proposal as a whole does not present an action plan, it does not align with the challenge because it is not clear what would be done to improve Cardano; therefore, I will unfortunately give the lowest score for the impact. \n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "No script is presented, as I already mentioned in impact, it is not clear what would be done as a whole; consequently, we do not know what steps would be necessary for the complete development of the project. What would need to be done here would be 1) define a plan, an objective, something bigger to be achieved 2) divide the total process into phases 3) explain what would happen in each month of these phases 4) detail very well the activities of each month , preferably how long each one would take to be done, who would be responsible for it and how it would be done. Regarding the budget, the proponent states that ideally 5 million dollars would be needed to achieve its objectives (but it is not explained why). He asks for 500 thousand dollars, which represents all the money that is destined for this challenge. In my view, just because of that, the proposal is economically unfeasible, I don't think it's a good idea to spend the entire treasure on just 1 proposal, especially not being a very well structured project that results in very clear and positive impacts for Cardano. Regarding the requested money, it is not explained in which parts it would be divided, we also do not have details about the parts (they are not made explicit). It would be necessary for the proponent to make it clear which professionals would be involved in the project and how much they would receive in salary, and how much the different aspects of the project would cost, such as marketing, design, programming, etc. Ideally, the salaries of professionals should be specified to the point where we know the value of their working hours. Anyway, this part of the proposal is also confusing, the proposer talks about several things, several investments, as we can see in the excerpt \u201cI am seeking US$ 11.1 million against 49% equity/revenue participation as a co-founder of your group\u201d, but none of this is very clear or related to the $500,000 request. Finally, when it comes to the analysis of the team, unfortunately in the proposal only information about S\u00e9bastien Staub. We know in which professional area he works, but not if he has any kind of relationship with Cardano, if he is an active member of our community, examples of his previous work, etc. It would be important for him to have attached his linkedin profile so that we have a working knowledge of the cited information. He attaches a website where we can see his work partner called \u201cThe Nazman\u201d. We also have some information about it, but we don't have any examples of previous work and apparently it doesn't have any direct relationship with our blockchain either. In other words, there is no confidence in the team. In my view, all parts of the feasibility are inadequate and deserve to be revised. \n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The auditability of the progress is quite confusing, the proponent claims that Dapp downloads (which Dapps?) will be monitored. He also says that \u201cWe will do this as a community and with CA\u201d what will they do? And why would it be like a community/CA?. \u201cBut it will be for UA and UX/UI\u201d what does that phrase mean? Unfortunately, I couldn't understand the message he wanted to get across. For the project development process to be plausible, the first thing that should be defined is a main objective, a well-planned and structured project, as I mentioned earlier. Then, a roadmap well backed up with dates and with a lot of detail should be provided, so that we would have something to base ourselves on when we were going to monitor the phases. It would be necessary for the proponent and his working partner to keep the Cardano community always up to date on the progress made in the phases, on the small goals achieved (ie partial results), as well as on how their work routines were being carried out. This monitoring would need to be constant, in my opinion, at most monthly updates should be kept. The information can be passed through written reports, or short videos, a brief slideshow, in short, the format and platform on which it would be made available is at the discretion of the proponent, it could be a website, the community's discord channels or any other online platform easily accessible to all members of our ecosystem. Speaking now about the success scenario, the proponent claims it would be when \u201cthe Cardano blockchain powers the top 10 DApps and the 5 billion users use our Web3 solutions and domains.\u201d What 10 Dapps are these? 5 billion users is a very ambitious number, in my opinion, I would like the proponent to have outlined more tangible ways to see if the expected final results were obtained. I disagree that it is clear how all this will reflect for Cardano, it would be necessary to measure measurable metrics, both qualitative and quantitative, that could demonstrate in a proven way what were the benefits of this proposal for Cardano, if it managed to meet the specific goals of the challenge, if new people have joined the community as active members who buy Ada, CNFTs, delegate in pools, use Dapps, participate in Catalyst... Anyway. I think that, like the other topics, auditability is not well defined, and I cannot understand how this proposal could be monitored and how its fruits could be measured. \n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 174, "q0": "The proposal fits into the Miscellaneous category as the size of the requested budget 500k and the business proposition of building a 8.5 Trillion USD business does not fit anyweher else, and even then I have reservations if it belongs in Cardano at all. It is so grand that no other category could accommodate it. The proposal is to build several brands on top of the \"Top 10 Web3 Domains, DApps and Web3 Blockchain Business Solutions\". The argument is that .com . net and .org domains will soon become obsolete and the top 10 domains that are in the proposers ownership is the good starting point for the revolution and is willing to put up to start the proposal. However given the obscure nature of what is being proposed I will not be able to give full marks", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposed budget is 500k, but early on in the proposal is states that 5 million will really be required to get all the trading, platforms and talent working together. The whole proposal centers around monetizing the domain collection of the proposer that end in .magazine, .valley, .brokers .hire and alike. There is no project plan and no tangible deliverable. The proposal is one speculation the future value of these domain names. The proposal has a number of statements that can not be verified, for example \"Actually looks like we will own monopolies and be the next Bill Gates Warren Buffet and Ruppert Murdock of the best decade they will be long gone and forgotten and our grand grand children's the leaders of the 22nd century.\". Elsewhere in the proposal it is mentioned that the proposed is looking for 11.1 million for 49% equity.The proposer \"Sebastien Staub\" has a webpage but lacks any detail who the person is and the linkedin profile points to a company in Mauritius.

The one proposal contains references to trading, decentralized dns, domains, ride sharing, travel, publishing, software development, branding and marketing.\n\nThere is no way to measure impact.

This is a community platform, not an investment allocation platform. \n\nAlso, the proposal is requesting funding on the grounds that it will result in the creation of a number of companies that are cumulatively worth more than the entire blockchain ecosystem currently. As a tech founder, a proposal this big would at the very least need feasibility assessments, a business plan, financial breakdown of targets etc.\n\nIn the later stages the proposer also hints that it is wanting to part with 49% equity in exchange for the funding. This places the post-money valuation of this proposal at roughly 1 mil dollars.

I have read through it 3 times to see if there's actually an offer or partnership stated which the Cardano community can make use of. \nThe real point of this request appears to be a spam proposal to highlight the fact that domains are available to people working in web3.0.\n\nWhilst it could be debated the domain names mentioned may be of value to someone, it doesn't seem like something that Catalyst was designed for. It should be up to individual projects to source the domain names for what they need. Maybe I'm wrong, and the catalyst community will see something in the idea of holding top level domains as an income for Cardano, but... the problem is the proposal doesn't make any attempt to address how that would happen? Do we get all the domains for $500,000 that's been requested or just one of them at the listed price? To be frank the authors tone make it seem like they are obsessed with get rich schemes and not offering actual value.

", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposers obviously have good knowledge in marketing and domaining. However this proposal falls short on setting realistic goals on creating a platform based on Cardano to market the domains. A figure of $5M is mentioned which is well in excess of anything that project teams have been building on Cardano. Most proposals for dApps are in the sub $100,000 range. With one or two exceeding that for functionally rich dApps. Given there's no breakdown this idea needs much more work to define what is actually proposed, and to have a realistic budget, by pairing with a development partner who could advise realistic costs and timescales. Given that tokenisation has been mentioned a whitepaper would also be a suitable method to advise voters what they are funding. Given that there are no timescales or budget or any development work proposed, it would have been preferable to have seen this proposal withdrawn before assessment started given there's no means to achieve any of the ideas.

The proposal is also very poor in a lot of areas. I think the proposal does a great job of presenting relevant market research about the potential of this industry, the outlook of where it's headed, and the difference between this project and the competition. I find this to be missing from an unfortunate majority of proposals that get submitted. So, there are positives. However, if I understand the proposal correctly, this proposal doesn't actually do anything substantial for the Cardano ecosystem. This is not a Dapp on the blockchain, this is a business that intends to take payments in ADA (which does not cost $500k). There could be an argument made that offering ADA as a payment option could drive people to purchase ADA to get access to this service but that argument is effectively squashed by accepting payments via PayPal and other fiat systems. There is a misunderstanding of the word \"tokenize\" in this proposal, which is supposed to involve interaction with the blockchain directly. It is not capitalizing on the already existing assets of ADA. While it is impressive that the owner has obtained a variety of potentially high-value domain names, I think there is an overestimation of what they would be worth.
