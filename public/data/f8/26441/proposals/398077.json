However, mass adoption of a project like this  is actually a massive undertaking.

The author also makes no mention of any kind of business plan, business model, or marketing plan to that could be used to evaluate if their understanding of the project scope is reasonable.

There is no mention that it is open source, and there is also no comment about tools, language, platform, collaboration, etc.  My recommendation to the author would be to develop this idea a little more, and make some indication (in the appropriate challenge) that this is a real project you have put thought into, and help to explain how this builds on the strength of Cardano by offering interesting new DeFi tools that can reach some level of awareness and utility within the community.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1224", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal tries to create smartex, an application that can help share expenses with friends and families.

The budget information is not broken down into details and only state they need an approximation of 25k$. The proposer can give more details on the cost of the development, such as server cost, remuneration for the developer, or load balancer (if any).

It will be very helpful to the community to know to whom they are giving their funding, at the very least LinkedIn profile for the proposer are enough.
