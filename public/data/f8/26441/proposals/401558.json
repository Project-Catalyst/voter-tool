(a problem that unfortunately is a reality); this could help the local population to have more confidence in the work of these institutions and provide more donations. An excerpt that sums up this proposal very well is this one, which explains that the DAO \u201cwill not only function to provide services for charitable projects, but it will also function as a place where community members vote on which charities they want to support with the funds.\u201d collected\u201d. That is, we know that in addition to helping with the issue of payments, the proponent promotes activities. But come on, why did I say the idea fits the theory well? In the field of practice, the proponent does not explain how these activities would be developed. How will cryptocurrency payments be implemented in charities? Which organizations does he intend to contact? How will you explain to them what blockchain is, what is the difference between Cardano and other blockchains, that is, what are the advantages and benefits of working with us? What are these activities that would be developed in DAOs? How would active members of the Cardano community be recruited to participate in this initiative? I think that, unfortunately, the practical implementation of these activities is still quite vague, so I think the idea may be very relevant, in fact, but it would need to be better explained. I would like to know how this activity would intertwine with the Cardano ecosystem, both in the sense of institutions getting to know our blockchain and its characteristics, as well as in the fact that it would be better explained what actions would be promoted by community members within the project, etc. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proponent states that all milestones reached will be published to the Cardano community, through \u201cGithub commits, site updates and social media will be used to show progress.\u201d I think we already have a good principle of auditability, however, this could still evolve. The milestones to be reached could have been traced (the project is of enormous complexity, which increases the need to know small goals that must be achieved little by little); it would also be important for us to know how often these updates would be made. I think that's the way it is, it's important that the proponent makes the partial results visible to the Cardano community, but the explanation could be more complete as I suggested. I would also like to know what is behind the achievements, that is, how the work of the professionals involved developed to make them possible. So these are my observations regarding the auditability of the process. Now talking about the final results, I think the notion of success established by the proponent is very vague. He says success would be the realization of a \u201cfully decentralized community-led organization that accommodates charitable donations from anyone to any charity.\u201d Okay, but how can this become measurable? It would be necessary for him to explain many more things, let's go: 1) which charities were benefited. It would be important for the institutions themselves to report this process, how Cardano contributed to the better establishment of donations, how transactions became easier and also what activities started to be developed from this project 2) how can we safely and securely perceive directly (through numerical data for example) how has the Cardano ecosystem benefited from this project? Have new members been added to the community? Were these transactions, corresponding to donations, all made from digital wallets such as yoroi and ccvaultio? Has the number of Cardano blockchain transactions grown considerably, and if so, by how much? All this information could have been reported, so that we would know more precisely what the impacts of the project were on our ecosystem.

I think the blockchain environment is getting difficult to support projects where the team does not proudly identify themselves, and they identified themselves neither in the attached documents, proposal, and only on the website with names and short descriptions.

To my experience as a CA, a charity DAO is a new and interesting use case that could affects people's lives in for real. It is an ambitious project as acknowledged by the proposers but the idea is great and impactful.

The estimated time of readiness is in a span of 4 years (1-5 years to complete. This is a very rough estimate and could be investigated further to provide a better prediction. It is however good to be transparent with estimates since it is probably one of the hardest things to do in the development process. The project is asking for 50k in this proposal, which is a part of their total planned budget of about 230k+.\nOne post lists  \"Non-Profit outreach team 20k-40k per member\", how many members can we expect to be needed? This will greatly affect the total amount of funding needed to succeed with the project.
