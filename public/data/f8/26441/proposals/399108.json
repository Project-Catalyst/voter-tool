As I understand it, there is a group called Catalyst Circle that carries out various activities, such as recording meetings relevant to our community members, documenting them, ensuring that these videos receive a high number of views and in the future (if this proposal is funded ) they will translate all this content into Spanish, so that the Latin American (outside Brazil) and Spanish community can more easily follow the content in question. A phrase that can very well summarize the activities of this group is to promote the \u201cgovernance, oversight, support for distributed decision-making\u201d of the Cardano community. According to the proponents, the Catalyst coordination process will be passed on to the community in the future (currently this is done by the IOG coordinators); this makes it even more necessary that we have an internal organization, that we don't get lost in the various projects, processes, meetings, exchanges and all the activities that make up this complex ecosystem. I found it very positive how the authors of the proposal provided a brief explanation of what path they have taken so far as a group, explaining it through valid arguments (real life situations, such as increased views of their videos - around 300 views -, increase in the number of people voting and etc) as the group has gained visibility within the Cardano community. I also found it very important how they explained what activities would be developed from here, should funding be provided; and also how they were mature enough to identify possible challenges in this process, already outlining solutions. In other words, I think the proposal is extremely relevant and fits the challenge well, as it talks about distributed governance and that doesn't fit well with any other challenge of the present fund. Therefore, the impact grade will be maximum. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponents explain in a detailed and extensive way what would be done with this project, however, I think the roadmap is not so clear in the sense of being able to visualize the activities well. The activities carried out from May to July, during the Catalyst Circle 4 cycle, are listed in topics. Ideally, we would know what would happen in each month of this time interval; same thing for the period of Catalys Circle 5, from August to October. I think we managed to understand very well what would be done and in what way, just this visualization of temporality is not so safe, so I would say that the script is good, but it is not perfect. If we specified more precisely how long each activity would take, our understanding of the entire process would be more solid. The budget division, in my opinion, is ideal, because the total amount is divided into some parts and we have a good detail about each one of them, in a way that justifies the need for such investments. Let\u2019s use as an example the excerpt \u201cTranscript, summary and timestamps of Circle meetings: $663 per meeting x 16 Circle meetings (6 meetings per Circle, plus a retrospective and an onboarding meeting for each iteration) = $10,608\u201d. It is not only stated that approximately US$10,000 would be needed to transcribe the meetings, but it is explained how much the transcript of each of them would cost, as well as the total number of meetings that would be held. As well as this, the other topics are explained with much specificity. Finally, speaking of the team, it is the duo Vanessa Cardui and Stephen Whitenstall. We know a lot of information about who they are, what their areas of professional practice are, examples of previous projects (in this case, total confidence is passed because this proposal is the continuation of a project that already exists, so we wouldn't be starting from scratch). We also know how they relate to Cardano (they are very active members of the community) and their linkedin profiles. That is, total belief in their ability to successfully develop the project (in this case, continue it) is passed on. So my only observation on feasibility would be to really specify the temporal notion a little more, other than that everything is perfect. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This part of the proposal is impeccable, I think this project is highly auditable, even because of its nature of being a collective governance process, providing services directly to the Cardano community; that is, to verify if the desired partial results were being obtained, it is enough that we follow the deliveries made by the pair of proponents. However, they even go further, telling us KPIs that could be used to measure the success of progress, such as \u201cnumbers of meetings and events documented + unique views and impressions of meeting documentation + interactions, shares, likes, mentions and comments in media social media like Twitter, Discord, Telegram and etc\u201d; and KPIs focused on bottom-line results: \u201cincreased number of people accessing documentation from Circle meetings + greater discussion in the wider Catalyst community of issues raised in Circle + greater awareness and understanding of Voltaire and distributed governance and etc\u201d. I think my only suggestion here would be the following: in addition to understanding the results to be delivered in each phase of the project, it would be interesting to also know a little about what is behind it, that is, the pre-production of such deliveries, the tenderers' work routine. I think it would be great for them, at the end of each cycle of the Circle, to come up with a little explanation about it. However, I agree that what really matters are the deliveries, in this case, even more than what is behind it, since the main objective of this proposal is to keep the Cardano community together and well governed. Finally, regarding auditability, I think everything is in order and we have several measurable ways of observing the success of this initiative. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 8, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Proposal identifies problem and articulates how it will add value to the Cardano Ecosystem as evidenced by discussing existing documentation from past oversight at length.

But throughout the proposal, the described service that will be offered is more one of documentation - transcriptions, summaries and timestamps of the YouTube videos of the Circle meetings and of translation of those documents. As such, the notion of \u201coversight\u201d or in other words \u201csupervision\u201d, \u201cinspection\u201d is not accomplished, as in the context of this governance issue, it does not provide \u201cChecks and controls over a particular body or institution\u201d (according to Wikipedia). Even the name of the DAO, would suggest that the purpose of the Quality Assurance is to provide an objective view of the meetings, not just a summary of it. By analysing the Gitbook, there are only 2 commentaries provided, the first related to the meetings 3 and 4, where the problem raised by QA-DAO is one of not being able to document the meetings due to some organisational actions, and the second commentary, for the 5th meeting, where a member of the Circle asks for feedback from the community in a discord server. That is one of the closest actions resembling the idea of oversight, but, perhaps it should be started by QA-DAO and it should be a public question, asked to the entire Cardano Community that the Circle represents, in more open spaces than discord servers (via Twitter, website, Cardano Forums etc). \nThe purpose of the problem statement is indeed very important for the Cardano ecosystem, but as it is described at the moment, the only clear mention regarding it is in the feasibility section, as the last KPI for Circle Version 4 \u201dwrite and share a short insight report on Circle v4 from the perspective of an impartial documenter\u201d as such, it is treated like the least important step in the project, when it actually is the most valuable.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The timeline and plan are very detailed, both Circle Version 4 and Circle Version 5 are being covered, each with its planned steps.\nThe budget is well broken down, it presents clearly the number of hours needed per task with a clear specification of the price per hour, and how it has been calculated from the British Pound, since the proposers are located in the UK. The numbers provided are reasonable and realistic.\nThe proposers have provided ample details regarding their previous roles in the Catalyst community, skills and previous achievements, and offered links to their GitHub or LinkedIn pages for verification.\nAs such, I see no missing details and I trust the team will be able to successfully implement the proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The progress development is very accurate, and has ample tracking options described, all being transparently documented in the Gitbook, plus the other metrics available on social media channels: Youtube, Twitter, Discord.\nThe success is also thoroughly described, yet for a complete analysis of both the current situation and of the feature assessment of the project\u2019s success, adding clear milestones to these would have enabled the community in assessing independently the positive outcome of the proposal. For example, instead of mentioning \u201can increase in numbers of people accessing the documentation of Circle meetings\u201d, the proposers could have written \u201c[XX number of] people accessing the documentation of Circle meetings representing an [XX percentage] increase\u201d.

But the proposal does explain in detail that the act of combined documenting and publicising IS a check or control in itself, because it means someone is not only monitoring the meetings, but enabling the community to monitor them too, i.e.(quote from the proposal) \u201cmake it easier for the community to track Circle\u2019s activities\u201d. As the proposal explains, what we produce is **supposed** to be a neutral and authoritative record, not editorialising; because in a decentralised organisation such as Catalyst, it is the community who should be the ultimate authority, and it would be entirely inappropriate for an unelected organisation to seek  \u201ccontrol\u201d or \u201csupervision\u201d (the CA\u2019s somewhat cherry-picked definitions of \u201coversight\u201d) of Circle. We do not judge what Circle does \u2013 we record it, and make the record accessible, so the community can judge - in this, we adhere to the more common definition of \u201coversight\u201d, which is \u201cwatchful care\u201d. If the CA wants to argue against this standpoint, which is expressed extensively in the proposal, they need to show some evidence that they have read it, and give some rationale for why they disagree; but they have not, they have simply asserted their own view of how oversight should operate. Flagged for personal opinion and bias:The CA asserts that the purpose of the proposal ought to be to write some kind of commentary or editorial on Circle meetings \u2013 but that would be a very different proposal. The CA should not assess the proposal by comparing it unfavourably with a very different proposal idea of their own \u2013 instead, they should engage with this proposal and its aims and approach, and say whether those will have impact. The CA ignores the clear evidence of impact and value given in the proposal (large growth in numbers accessing, and significant growth in awareness of Circle, number standing for election to Circle, and Circle voters), and instead focuses on a semantic debate about what \u201coversight\u201d is, coupled with their own idea for an editorialising/ commentary project."}], "solution": "Provide independent oversight of Catalyst Circle.\nResource the Circle GitBooks to document & track the activities of Circle v4 and v5.", "experience": "QA-DAO quality-assurance-dao.github.io have a combined 50+ years experience in documentation and audit, and have successfully undertaken documentation and oversight of Catalyst Circle v1, v2 and v3."}
