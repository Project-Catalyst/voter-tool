Whether the lighting accurately reflects Cardano epoch timing and up-to-date price information triggered by updates from a Twitter bot is another story, but it's possible. \n\nA real question that is harder to pin down is whether this creative endeavor will be popular. I couldn't say. If there is a demand for these sorts of items, it will emerge, and part of what he's requesting is an opportunity to find that demand. About a third of his requested budget is dedicated to developing his website and videos--effectively the ground floor for eventual marketing. And the amount he's requesting is $10,000, which isn't enormous. And I'd recommend voters keep both these things in mind as they decide whether to support his project.
