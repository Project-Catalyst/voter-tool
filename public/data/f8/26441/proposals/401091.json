There are several examples of excellent businesses failing to make their stand due to a lack of mentorship and support from the ecosystem. This proposal addresses the fill the gap in an efficient and effective way. A proven methodology S-E-A-M along with digital sessions and certification will prove to be a boon for the Cardano community, as this could end up adding more value to the existing applications and also draw a lot of attention from other chain users and contributors. The impact this proposal could have is multi-dimensional, to name a few cross-chain migrations, Cardano as a preferred business hub, Improving Cardano auditability, and also invoking several new quality business solutions. The team \"Entreprenerdy\" have been extending the Cardano community with brilliant ideas and they seem to be capable of averting any risk that might lie in their path.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team's plan to establish an entrepreneur mentoring system and certifications looks promising and the funding will be the essential key to drive these in a steady and fruitful manner. The budget of 60k USD and its breakdown for each of the elements in their plan seems transparent in nature and achievable, most of it being used for the cohort purpose. The manifesto comes with crystal clear goals and a step-by-step action plan and a lot of groundwork already laid out which shows the team's sheer commitment and passion. The 4 team members introduce are all clear heavy-weights in their respective fields and come into this project with a lot of prior experience and expertise. However, the only place I feel the team should have made a dainty bit more effort in explaining how different this proposal is compared to what they have already achieved with a similar proposal in fund7 which requested almost the same amount of 60k. A little bit of evidence of their last venture would have gotten them the full marks.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposition in addition to being impactful and feasible also provides the readers and evaluators with usable metrics for each of the deliverables. With a clear distinction between key metrics to monitor and key metrics to quantify, the proposer makes the auditor's job a lot easier. The proposal's key metrics make a lot of sense even though the Miscellaneous challenge does not make a clear requirement of any kind. The Accelerators and Mentors challenge last time was interesting and the team continuing their work from there adds a lot of confidence and makes it easy for the community to assume that all kinds of support would be provided by the team for monitoring their progress and outcomes eventually. The success criteria the team sets for themselves are sleek and bright and on successful implementation, I as a reader feel would do wonders to the new ventures trying to establish themselves on the chain and also to the existing ones who are looking for a helping hand in order to get to the top.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1593", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 4, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 5829, "q0": "The outlined problem statement reads: \u201cIdea-owners and Entrepreneurs often lack the necessary venture building skills and access to the networks required to reach their goals\u201d.\n\nThe Norwegian team\u2019s solution to this issue is \u201ca community-focused entrepreneurship program aimed at developing startup skills & building networks between entrepreneurs and mentors\u201d.\n\nThese are worthy goals and the program sounds really well thought out, at a first glance. \n\nHaving failed as an over-idealistic social entrepreneur myself, I know that the most important focus for an entrepreneur should be a paying customer. Having read through the proposal twice and having watched the enclosed 25-minute video, I haven\u2019t heard the words \u201ccustomer\u201d, \u201cclient\u201d or \u201cuser\u201d mentioned even once. Therefore, I\u2019m not entirely convinced by the S-E-A-M model that the entire program is based on.\n\nStill, I think it will be beneficial for many Catalyst proposers to go through the program. It is a good way to engage in self-reflection and bounce ideas with the facilitators and other participants. And, to be fair, there is one 90-minute session for Business Idea and another one for Business Model. These should focus on the target group\u2019s needs and pain points as well as on the money-making logic. I\u2019m just afraid they will fail to cover all the intricacies of these complex topics, especially because only 30 minutes per session is spent on increasing the participants\u2019 understanding of the subject matter in a facilitator-led part of the training.\n\nPotential multiplying impact of the proposal is limitless. With a $60K budget, a direct promise is to train 60 participants (proposers?) and 10 new facilitators (community advisors). It is this community advisors as facilitators element that has been crystalized more. Apart from that, this is almost identical to their previous proposal posted on November 25th, 2021.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The Entreprenerdy team has made themselves known with the initial Catalyst Boost Camp. Looking at the team\u2019s credentials it\u2019s easy to like this proposal. It is quite well structured and convincing.\n\nIt is probably something that is not specific to Catalyst but has been offered to other clients as well. \u201cThe Entrepreneurship sprint, S-E-A-M and EMS are proven concepts, tested and tried over several years.\u201d As someone who has delivered about 400 training sessions in my life, I know the importance of knowing your audience. I am slightly worried that Catalyst is \u201cjust another customer\u201d for this group of entrepreneurs, that the proposers are not involved enough in Cardano to truly make a difference. They have taken this into account and the proposal underlines the importance of \u201cinvolving community members and advisors in co-creating the program\u201d.\n\nTheir \u201cProgram management services\u201d will help in recruitment and selection of participants. What is not mentioned, however, is who the participants are and how they are selected. After watching the enclosed video\u2014and knowing how Entreprenerdy boost camps were communicated in the Townhalls\u2014I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s going to be an open call and the team somehow decides who gets to participate. Is it first come, first served basis? Adding this kind of detail would make the proposal even stronger.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It is unclear whether the plan includes four or five cohorts. On one hand, the plan refers to \u201cFive cohorts of the Catalyst Community Accelerator over four weeks\u201d and \u201cFive entrepreneurship Boost camps for four weeks\u201d. Yet, in the timeline, it says \u201cJune 2022: Cohort 1 is delivered\u201d, \u201cJuly 2022: Cohort 2 is delivered\u201d, \u201cAug 2022: Cohort 3 delivered\u201d, \u201cSeptember 2022: Cohort 4 delivered\u201d. \u201cThe budget breakdown consists of 12 000 USD for the certification program and 4 times 12 000 USD for the cohort deliveries\u201d. So, if I was to guess the team has changed the plan mid-way and, instead of running five cohorts on their own, they\u2019ve decided to cut one of the cohorts and use that time/money to train Community Advisors to do the job for them in the last cohorts. That\u2019s smart and disseminates knowledge into the community but it\u2019s unfortunate it has made the proposal less clear.\n\nSpeaking of money, the budget breakdown isn\u2019t really a breakdown at all. It doesn\u2019t say what those 12K lump sums consist of. Furthermore, spending approximately $1,000 USD of treasury money on each participant might sound a bit steep at first. However, if the program truly makes the participants better entrepreneurs and people, perhaps the investment is justified. \n\nThe attachment referred to in the proposal is actually missing, this time, but you can see it in the previous proposal: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/idea/385150/48282/download", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_289", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3722, "q0": "There are a lot of developing nations around the world and has a tremendous numbers of startups across every country.
