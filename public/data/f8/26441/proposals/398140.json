While it can be an effective shorthand between people who are immersed in a subculture of specialty field, it also tends to present an uninviting facade to those who could be persuaded into crypto generally and Cardano specifically. Not only that, but certain words have effectively become marketing buzzwords. A user-friendly lexicon, alone, would be a welcome addition.\n\nAs Cardano distinguishes itself in part through its embrace of academic rigor, accessible discussions and analysis are important for both maximizing its value and limiting the shenanigans and fraud that can be buried behind walls of specialized language.\n\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "With Ekphrasis, the proposer has effectively demonstrated all of the necessary skills to tackle the subject of governance. The main risk with regard to feasibility could potentially be the proposer spreading his efforts too thin between maintaining support for the F7 aspect of his project while taking on this new subject. The proposer may want to mention what happens to F7 era maintenance and support once Fund 8 begins. \n\nThe proposer identifies lack of engagement as a potential but unlikely risk factor, and I'm inclined to agree.

I was going over the challenge list again, for the 1000th time now, trying to determine this. At first I was thinking onboarding new members but feel that anyone who would be using QA-DAO's Ekphrasis GitBook, or the Catalyst School is likely already a member or involved in the space. Sure maybe a new YouTube subscriber may relate to a new community member, but this proposal along with the proposers existing work is more of continued  education of members already in the community. If a proposal falls into the misc category, then that begs the question of maybe a new challenge for the next funding round? \n\n   It is hard to effectively address miscellaneous, and this project surely falls into a pretty specific area and that would be education. I am not familiar with all of the fund rounds, so that may have been a challenge in the past, but if not it sounds like a pretty good one to me. \n  Education is key to the success of anything and is important for completely new people to the space and also your crypto veterans.

", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is very practical in what it wants to achieve and the budget it expects to need for it to succeed. The team appears to have been adding value to the cardano community for quite some time, before there was a resource to obtain community funds for a project. They successfully implemented a funded proposal in fund 7 Ekphrasis Gitbook. It is a collection of information about Cardano and the blockchain as a whole. It is definitely more geared to information about the cardano ecosystem, and not just a generalized crypto website. The Catalyst School is another website that this team is involved with, and besides its hard on the eyes UI, it seems to be a good place for people to form a community and learn, and teach on the topics of decentralization. They did mention an issue of lack of engagement within their projects, but this is a problem I believe will be fixed over time. New users are entering the space faster than ever before. The team has gotten off to a good start and  will only continue to improve these recourses if the the proposal receives funding.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This team is very active in the crypto space, and the amount of value vs the proposals budget is a very fair one. They gave a very detailed budget breakdown, along with a concise roadmap. The team is very much in line with the values and academic approach that cardano is built upon. They have a presence on many social media platforms and seem to be very open about discussion and i have no doubt that they would be willing to communicate with the community if anyone had any questions about how their projects are going. This team is obviously passionate about crypto and decentralization, and I have a feeling that they would be happily doing most of these things regardless of this proposal. There is no reason they should not be paid for the huge value they add to the cardano community.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1959", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Provinding structured training and material about governance in Cardano and its concepts, alongside with research, is a very valid and necessary idea, specially as the ecossytem is growing really fast. \nNowadays, the information are mostly spread around many sources, in pieces, and some of them are even tacit.  Proposer addresses this problem in a solid manner. Moreover, I also agree with this proposal being allocated in miscellaneous as there is no specific challenge for governance yet (maybe this can be a challenge in the future).\n\nAs to the proposal itself, it is really clear the scope of it, divided into 3 major parts (A - summaries and shortbites, B - presentations and workshops and C - Ekphrasis GitBook maintenance). It is also provided enough details in each of this 3 topic on what is going to be done or developed - and how. it would be nice if the presentations in B were recorded so anyone can reference to at anytime.

It is also provided how many hours will be spent in each, which makes it more transparent. Project consumes only 2% of challenge budget so it is not an expensive one.\n\nAs for the team, there's one committed person with experience in Cardano, quality and project management, which seems enogh for this proposal.

However, some in quantitative section seems to be written more in a qualitative manner, which makes it hader to measure. For instance, \"Promotion, engagement and communication on social media\" this is more an activity than a kpi itself. It could be turned into number of posts (promotion) and number of comments and likes (engagement) in social media.\n\nI also liked the qualitative succes criteria but it would be nice to have a way to measure them (else it will be too subjectve). Maybe measure the engagement of academic and governance discussion by using number of people accessing the github, attending townhalls or something in this way. The number of dicussions is hard to measure but the number of iniatives can be done. \n\nLast, I think it is also imporant to collect and measure the feedback from the community in the regard of the 3 project fronts (A,B and C), in order to evaluate quality and improve if necessary.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_298", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal will move Cardano further ahead on the road as the state-of-the art blockchain for decentralized governance, thus it is invaluable to the Cardano ecosystem.
