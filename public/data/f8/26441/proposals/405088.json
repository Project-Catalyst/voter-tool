If we can ensure that everyone can present their projects and ideas well, this will ensure that we have more good ideas from the community.\n\nA better educated community makes for better projects and therefore more value for everyone.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has already dealt with various risks that the project entails and always seems to have found solutions so far.

Cardano has already proven itself with it's amazing leadership and community. This proposal makes me think about the future of Cardano and how passed down education will help the protocol to stay alive.

Good leadership will help build a strong community just as they talked about how social economics is a strong part of the ecosystem.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I agree with this form of a team. I like that they are focused on using members of the Cardano community to take part in the leadership academy. This will help with the idea of decentralization and offer lots of different thoughts and opinions to help the community stretch and expand with idea and innovation. I find this proposal to be very productive and will distribute experience in the ecosystem to those that are willing to take part in such a great opportunity.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I like that this proposal is starting off from the beginning. They give a monthly timeframe which includes the process of identifying the instructors and then shifting the focus to the material that they are going to cover.

There is a precise explanation on where the funds provided will go and how that will achieve them to carry out this proposal. Essentially the fund will go to the instructors that will help build the leadership in Cardano so that there will be an even stronger future and more people that are educated in blockchain and leadership activity.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1448", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The issue reported here is \"Catalyst requires world-class leadership skills to level up our impact, and growing these leaders from inside the community is critical\".
