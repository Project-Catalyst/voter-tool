The objective is to evaluate 50% of the projects on Cardano.

The proposal is a form of a public quality control and certification scheme performed initially by team member and later by the community, the project can scale though attracting community members. The project adds value by passing projects on Cardano through a classification filter and attributing a rating, this simplifies the view for community members who do not have the time to understand what each project is, but want to know what is in the ecosystem", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team member disclose their linkedin profiles although one of them has 26 and the other one 97 followers, which suggests they are not very active on linkedin. One of the members reports to be an Admin in a facebook group with over 40k followers, the group is closed so I could not verify the claim, but the said group does have 46k members and is based in Vietnam. The proposer have an active site operating which has an evaluation of crypto projects, not just on Cardano, and their objective is to create a website like that just for Cardano. A delivery schedule is provided which details the deliverables by month . In the first month they will review 30 projects (1 per day) and in the second month they will identify reviewers too evaluate 30 more projects and in the third month and onward they will encourage community to join to support  more reviews. Total budget it 13k which is a low price to pay for a review of 50% of projects on Cardano. The main question then becomes the quality of these reviews. At 1 per day it looks very aggressive to maintain a high quality after allowing for quality controls and revisions.

I quite like this idea.\nCurrently, information technology is developing more and more, people can easily find news through websites easily. This is an advantage as well as a disadvantage. Because it is too easy to access information without being selective, groups of people or organizations with bad intentions will take advantage to spread false news or news to promote FOMO psychology of the crowd to serve their own personal interests. This will gradually reduce the community's trust in the crypto market, making it worse in the eyes of everyone. Therefore, having a place where standards can be set for a project, which can direct people to interact with each other to exchange experiences in filtering information based on standards will help the community to improve awareness. Help community avoid marketing tricks.\nIn addition, the website can be regularly updated news for investors, 2-way interaction to minimize subjectivity.

There was a section in the budget where funds were allocated to a \u2018community incentive reward\u2019 scheme.
