The objective is to evaluate 50% of the projects on Cardano. This aligns with the Challenge setting \"Successfully fund proposals, approved by the community, that don't fit well any other challenges.\". The proposal is a form of a public quality control and certification scheme performed initially by team member and later by the community, the project can scale though attracting community members. The project adds value by passing projects on Cardano through a classification filter and attributing a rating, this simplifies the view for community members who do not have the time to understand what each project is, but want to know what is in the ecosystem", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team member disclose their linkedin profiles although one of them has 26 and the other one 97 followers, which suggests they are not very active on linkedin.

The proposer have an active site operating which has an evaluation of crypto projects, not just on Cardano, and their objective is to create a website like that just for Cardano. A delivery schedule is provided which details the deliverables by month . In the first month they will review 30 projects (1 per day) and in the second month they will identify reviewers too evaluate 30 more projects and in the third month and onward they will encourage community to join to support  more reviews. Total budget it 13k which is a low price to pay for a review of 50% of projects on Cardano. The main question then becomes the quality of these reviews. At 1 per day it looks very aggressive to maintain a high quality after allowing for quality controls and revisions.

This leads to many people losing money due to being scammed or investing in shoddy projects. The project offers a simple solution that allows the community to quickly assess whether a new project is good enough.\n- This solution is based on a simple set of available criteria, investors only need to answer questions to be able to assess the quality of the project.\n- The solution also provides a way to in-depth assessment of new projects.\n- This solution helps the community have more methodology to evaluate a new project. Help investors have a basis to make their decisions.\n- On the other hand, the project also helps to train the community to have more project evaluators. The more experts who are able to evaluate the project, there will be fewer low-quality projects or teams that build projects solely for financial gain.\n- The project also has a reward mechanism to encourage the community to participate in the project.\n***Suggestions/ advices:\n- The set of evaluation questions raised by the project is still highly subjective.

Exactly, we also mentioned it in the proposal. But we don't choose well-know expert for review, who are well-know expert in the industry? We also have a very clear explanation, our platform is towards decentralization, so at this stage we want to work towards the community gradually participating to build the evaluation criteria. We do not need well-know experts to create trust because this criterion will be created by the community itself and that is the absolute trust of the community. Adding well-known experts only increases centralization and costs.\nFeasibility:\nThe assessor stated that proposal gave a sketchy capital allocation plan but gives no explanation why is it sketchy. In my capital allocation plan, I have outlined in great detail about the time to use, how to allocate for each job. Even a fraud prevention plan\nThe assessor also stated \"There is no clear evaluation criteria as to how Coreteam completes the work to be able to receive inquiry fee\". We do not proposed \"inquiry fee\", we proposed \"researching fee\". This fee also clearly states that it is allocated to a group of experts from 5-10 people to carry out in 2 months to complete the evaluation criteria for Defi projects. Perhaps the reviewer did not read the proposal carefully and did not see its attachments. These \"experts\" are carefully selected and with their qualifications, the actual income is many times higher than the suggested figure. This is just a community incentive number. So that we can apply this model to the community at a later stage. This budget is reasonable compared to the benefit of knowledge and information that it brings to the community.\nThe assessor said that coreteam (5-10) member's information is still general and not public. Exactly, we haven't process the proposal, we haven't selected the experts, how can we get their information? Really I can't distinguish who is the coreteam that the assessor wants to mention here?\nIn case the assessor is referring to coreteam, vcoincheck coreteam is generic and not yet public. Exactly, we intend vcoincheck team stand behind to be the support in this proposal, so there won't be a specific number and I don't understand why the assessor knows that vcoincheck team has 5-10 members. Proving that the assessor knows us very well but assessed that information is generic and not public. As a CA role, the CA must always carefully check the information and make objectively assessment for the proposer and give the most honest information to the voter.\n\nAuditability\nAfter raising numerous problems about the feasibility of our detailed plan and capital allocation, the assessor didnt give no advice for better project tracking activities. Only a few recommendations were offered like template assessment."}, {"q0": "The proposal tries to create a group of expert reviewers in order to help the community to gain more knowledge and confidence in the projects and the content will be posted on the vcoincheck website.

Because it is too easy to access information without being selective, groups of people or organizations with bad intentions will take advantage to spread false news or news to promote FOMO psychology of the crowd to serve their own personal interests. This will gradually reduce the community's trust in the crypto market, making it worse in the eyes of everyone. Therefore, having a place where standards can be set for a project, which can direct people to interact with each other to exchange experiences in filtering information based on standards will help the community to improve awareness.
