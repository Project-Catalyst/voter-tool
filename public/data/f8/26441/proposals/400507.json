First, it doesn't fit the challenge, it should have been launched in the challenge of new members on board or even in the community hubs (after all, I believe the target audience here is very specific). Then we know the general idea of \u200b\u200bthe thing (which is great): popularizing our blockchain in Los Angeles, where Ethereum strongly dominates. However, it is not explained exactly how this would happen. What would be done? Who would? How would the target audience be attracted? How advances would be measured (proponents say there would be a measurement of ups and downs in terms of adoption of our blockchain and currency, but they do not explain where they would notice and monitor these variations). It is not clear what the weekly meetings would be like, where they would be, what topics would be covered in each; nor in the feasibility part, where the roadmap was expected to clarify this, are we aware of such information. Therefore, unfortunately the proposal is very abstract, despite being something that could be important for Cardano, it should have been explained much better, so that we understand how the main idea would be put into practice.\n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The viability of the project is very low. as I mentioned in the impact, we don't know essential details about each meeting; where would they be; how the guests would be captivated to participate and keep in touch, who would expose the content (probably the proponents mentioned in the team, but it would be interesting to understand if they would invite outsiders as well); and the main thing in my opinion would be to define which subjects would be specifically addressed at each meeting, so that we could understand how the target audience would learn about Cardano and adopt the use of our blockchain. Talking about the budget, the asking amount is quite low, weekly meetings for 6 months would cost 3600 dollars, however we don't know how the money would be used. The proponents say that maybe there would be money left over, but what would they pay at first? How much would each meeting cost, would the rent of the meeting place be paid, would the professionals involved in the presentation of content be paid...? Finally, regarding the team, we know some information about them, but not enough to convey confidence, since it is not clear how they are involved with Cardano and why they would be prepared to carry out these events, disclosing our blockchain. It would be necessary for the curriculum of each to be better presented and for this relationship to become clearer.\n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Unfortunately, this topic is also not good. The data traced to measure the process is very scarce, with the growth of participants in the meetings and the minimum of 3 projects launched on the Cardano blockchain during the 6 months, from what I understand. In my view, this says about the measurement of partial goals, but not what is behind it, we need to understand how the pre-production of the meetings would be being done, if the money was being used properly, if each professional involved would be doing the activities that were assigned to him... Anyway, really the construction process, little by little. Proponents would need to constantly inform the Cardano community about these updates, preferably weekly. And about the end result, the proponents don't make it clear how success would be measured, we know that popularizing Cardano is the goal, but through what palpable indications could this be proven? I would like them to analyze the growth scenario both qualitatively and quantitatively. In general, everything is pretty abstract, in my opinion.\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "If one takes into account the profile of the exhibitors who are invited to web3 events, one can realize that artists and art in general are given a privileged space.

However, I do not find a consistent implementation structure, a plan with specific steps to execute and measure, independent of the final result.  There is no spirit of execution, only of conversation.  \n\nI have to confess that my initial knee-jerk reaction was: total budget $3600? give them the money!  However, the more I read the content of the proposal and its lack of structure, the more the proposal reminded me that this is not about the money.  Every funded lovelace should have a mission.

What will be the structure of the conversations after buying drinks to the fellow patrons? (it is ancient wisdom that a drink or two will never be enough). Many unknowns in the execution process.
