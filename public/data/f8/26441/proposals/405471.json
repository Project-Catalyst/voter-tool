As this is in the Misc challenge, it does meet the simple criteria of creating something that is related to Cardano and improves Cardano by encouraging adoption of the technology and bridging the digital divide by bringing new users and involvement into the community through actionable resources. This proposal could have been a good fit for the \"Cardano Scaling Solutions\" challenge and the \"Open Standards & Interoperability\" challenges rather than Miscellaneous, because it intends to drive growth, give equal opportunities and increase synergies across Cardano projects.\n\nThat said, the proposers give real-world examples of actual projects that could be served by the solution they intend to create. This gives a sense of both need and application. Goals of their work are: a DAO support hub of learning, connectivity between stakeholders with complementary skillsets,  specific vetting for initiatives and a project launchpad. I agree that the proposal is relevant to this challenge category and will suit it, but probably more relevant to other categories, hence the 3. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "As the proposers are self-proclaimed non-technical users who are actively developing projects where the need for this solution arises, there is a strong sense that they will be highly motivated to create a meaningful and usable solution. \n\nWhile the vision is very well thought out and considers important components like vetting, engagement and collaboration, I can't help but consider that the team lacks the expertise of the technically-minded person to judge scope of the hub development and provide creative suggestions as part of this model development process. Because this potential challenge could inhibit the fulfillment and implementation, it would have been strong to offer their specific plan for overcoming this challenge, especially because they themselves are non-technical proposers. The vision for the outcome (the what) is here and the drive (the will), but explanation for the build (the how) is lacking. \n\nThe team expresses that this stage in funding is preparatory: making partnerships, growing communities and producing a proof of concept model, so this does seem achievable, hence the rating of 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The timeline is provided and seems to progress naturally: engage a community, build a hub of shared resources from and for that community, design vetting and test for projects, get feedback. I appreciate that this team has a reviewable piecemeal goal with this proposal, and the intention to scale it in the stages beyond. Criteria for community review of the model would be helpful in this section so that the team can keep itself on track for accomplishing its purpose, and eliminate excess prior to scaling. \n\nAudit questions for community consideration could include: \n- Does this hub create something novel and useful in relation to the project goal? \n- What did the team learn in recruiting the 30 new people? How effective is the outreach portion of the plan at engaging new members? \n- Are all the intended parts of the ecosystem in the impact section accurately represented? \n- Does the content accomplish easy onboarding of non-technical users? What are the gaps?\n- How do those users progress using the ecosystem? \n\nThe audit portion seems sparse compared to the depth of explanation in the impact section, and somewhat disconnected, which makes it feel like an afterthought where it could be a driving force. The is especially important to bridge because this is the model creation phase. The model should be thoroughly audited so that the team can move forward confidently. The success goal is clear, so inputting some more robust review criteria would make this a 5 rather than a 4.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_856", "no_vca": 2, "ne": 2, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1706, "q0": "The problem statement is clear, the goals of making it easier for people to get into Cardano blockchain via a curated ecosystem of support, signposting and practical activities align with the strategic goals of preparing a group of people able to make contributions to the ecosystem. \n\nThe extensive write up on the problem, recognition that it's non technical guidance that's required and the structure of the solution is deserving of a 5 Star rating. The eligibility for the Misc challenge fund has also been confirmed from the challenge team.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "While the ideas proposed as part of the ecosystem are sound way to address the impact identified, it's not clear exactly what will be built, who will build it and whether they have the skills to do so. While there are people named on the relevant section, there is no link to a LinkedIn profile or similar allowing verification of their capabilities. A developer is mentioned but they are yet to be hired which could put the project at risk if they take alternative work. \nThe budget is reasonable and value for money for the work to be undertaken and the outcomes expected as are the timescales. \nIt is not clear that all risks or mitigations have been considered. Technology issues are mentioned, but people, partners & engagement risks could be better highlighted.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A clear road map with publicly visible outputs to the community has been defined. Likewise a decent set of objective metrics has been defined, though the means of measuring these isn't explicitly stated. Specifically a 5 star award could have been given if the means of tracking engagement was highlighted. Given the outputs are public accessible guides, information & signposts, knowing they are actively being used will be the means by which their final value to the community would be deduced.

First of all, the impact section is WAY too long for a funding proposal. Ironically, there's also not enough detail in this portion of the proposal. It's all over the place for what it wants to accomplish, which I can summarize in one sentence: \"We want to onboard people into Cardano that have difficulty getting access to it.\" From there, specifics can be given for locations, organizations, target audiences, number of people impacted, etc. Second, the goals are also too general. I don't get the sense that anything is being done here that Cardano isn't already doing. \"Bank the unbanked\" or \"connect the unconnected.\" I need to see a narrower focus on a specific region or group of people that nobody is focusing on right now. This is not a TON of money (as far as catalyst proposals go), but I can't give my approval because I don't know exactly what is being done. If you try to solve everything, you will solve nothing. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The roadmap/timeline needs a lot of work but I think it's a decent start. I also don't think this is enough money to do what is stated to be accomplished. How is a DAO going to be produced without a software developer and server upkeep? How are awareness and partnership going to be established if there's no website to reference? I'm also not super convinced that anyone on the team is qualified to teach about blockchain technology. This is mainly because there's no LinkedIn profiles linked. We only get a vague one-sentence explanation of each team member's experience. We need detail, more planning, and more assurance that funds won't be wasted. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "In principle, the audibility isn't that bad. It's just not backed with strong enough detail and planning. I appreciate the quantification. This is definitely a quality that I want to see remain if a new proposal is to be submitted. I don't think the metrics are ambitious enough but that'll be a story for next time. The time-metric strategy is good and I think could be improved by a narrower target impact. It'll be much easier to appropriately quantify KPIs if your target audience is easier to see.

This definitely fits in well with Cardano\u2019s goals, especially with the added emphasis on Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) for this fund. There were many parts mentioned \u2013 creating educational materials and creating a launchpad along with other support such as collaboration features which helped to give a useful overview of what the proposers envisioned the endgame to be. But quite a number of features the proposers mentioned were to \u201csignpost\u201d or link to already existing resources like those on Cardano or other websites so it would be good to point out how their proposed solution will be differentiated or perhaps to do a collaboration instead on areas with overlaps, which to their merit, the proposers did acknowledge.\n\nSome tips: Do try to keep the background info short, there could be a tendency to over justify since it is under the miscellaneous challenge. Maybe list a few geographical areas you would like to target first.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal does not seem to present great technical complexity as most of it is focused on curating information from different places. But since the proposers pointed out their lack of a technical background and there\u2019s only one other technical person on the team, that one person might be stretched thin between their current project on getting school children to create and sell NFTs for charity in Austin to evaluating projects that they want to onboard for their impact ecosystem/launchpad and curating technical content.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot the proposers want to tackle and happy that they have the ambition, but it might be better to narrow their focus on one part, perhaps the education portion before they tackle other areas. There will be another fund to apply for in just a few months.\n\nThe amount requested for each activity is broken down and seems reasonable, or maybe even a little low depending on where the team is operating.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Goals are listed for each month. Metrics for month 1 and 5 are more quantitative and the impact can be measured clearly. Metrics for month 2-4 however, are based on whether the team has built something rather than on usage or how many people have found it useful.
