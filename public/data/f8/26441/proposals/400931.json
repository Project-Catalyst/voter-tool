The linkedin profiles are not provided, but the 2 of the 4 that I verified leads to filled in linkedin pages with upwards of 500 connections each. The schedule is well documented and split by deliverables such as Project Management, Develop the program, Run the program. The budget is also split out by the same deliverables. The requested budget is 34k for a program that would develop a business blueprint for 20 developers, this is just under 2k per developer and just under 5k per for each of proposal members which are reasonable cost per dev and reasonable compensation. The proposal is a continuation of the MVP that was funded in Fund7 and targeted 10 developers. The proposal outlines the main risks as not attracting enough participant which I agree is the main risk. I did not find any information to backup the statement that the MVP was a success, nor feedback from participants, as well there is no mention of the material that will be used in the program, for this reason I do not give full marks.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal is easy to audit as has a objective deliverable to \"put in place a robust top-level, impactful, plan for achieving the vision of the devs\".

However, the information about the 'detailed budget breakdown' has a few places that need clarification, for example the costs incurred during project management, legal and HR handling and infrastructure should be broken down and a spending plan for each issue should be made for voters to clearly see the direction of the cash flow in this proposal.

The proposer already recognized about the insufficient roles of administration implementation besides mostly efforts are put in developing and strengthening system technically. So, the proposed solution was considered to address directly to challenges of high administrative load of the domain-expert team. On the other hand, the proposer can add more information about how internship students can support professional experts to reduce the load without any disturbance. In addition, the part of how it affect to both interns is necessary to add more, to make the solutions be more reliable. If having any case-studies relating to this matter, it is better to put here, to see the win-win condition clearer. \nThere were 4 main KPIs with clear target of this proposal. It includes both quantitative and qualitative indicators so that it wil be clear for all people to think and follows. However, how to do them is also necessary to be included in the proposal. The proposer can think and provide more information about this part. \nAccording to the proposer, risk and challenges might be not exist here because this project is likely a sub project of the bigger program, where bigger risk might arise there and solve by bigger project. \nThe project also have potentials to contribute to not only Cardano ecosystem but also outside Cardano client, as one of ways for economically successful service providers. It is such a nice idea by the proposer. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As this is one of the sub-project of the overall huge project, information about human resources are available in the website provided, with core teams and experts utilization.

In this part, it is necessary to add information on what they tend to do in a period, with specific timing and duration. In addition, the propose need to clarify how they are going to realize that timeline in reality. Therefore, it is necessary for the proposer to include these detailed information. \nIn the proposal, it was mentioned that, the budget is just only for 6 months of direct implementation.

The budget is broken down and clearly linked to milestones, timelines and hourly compensation.

Without even an estimate for when the community can expect to see this course completed, it is difficult to audit the success of the funded proposal or track progress. Additionally, they have not provided any details on the current progress or success of their previously funded proposal.

Along with all the community hubs out there to draw more minds into the network, the accelerators were equally important if not more to provide the developers with proper guidance and make sure the projects were as impactful as they were promised during the submission stage. The proposer here intends to spread its wings and reach more users and embed good business practices into the developer community. The repercussions of this MVP are huge considering the quality and reach of the Cardano Community. The proposal intends to report the outcomes and identify the possible challenges that can be set for the following funds thus aiding the community with identifying the issues out there in the ecosystem and making sure they are tended to at the earliest.

The team has already developed an MVP that was funded during the last round, which shows the passion the team carries around. The team members introduced are heavyweights in their fields and come with a lot of experience. The names put out there with their expertise almost fill in every shoe the team thinks is required to pull this off. Since the proposal is more of an engagement phase rather than a development phase, the feasibility metrics can be a little more simple to evaluate, as a working MVP is already available to go forward with. The requested funds being less than 10% of the total challenge funds seems reasonable and the proposer provides the readers with a proper division of how and to whom the funds are distributed. With an hourly work plan and a detailed infographic project roadmap, it shows the community that an extensive amount of groundwork has already been done and the chances of successful implementation are very likely.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Taking into consideration the well-defined roadmap, the KPIs are very much aligned to the milestones set by the team. The number of engagements, number of participants, number of returning Alumni are all verifiable and quantifiable metrics. This being a miscellaneous challenge, there lies no standard benchmark to compare the metrics to. However, the success criteria the team has defined for themselves look just about right and could be good enough to assist the auditing process to make it prolific. The team has already raised funds and successfully delivered the proposed project, which would in no doubt provide all assistance the community needs to track their progress. However, coming into the funding with prior experience, I personally would had loved to see some numbers thrown against the mentioned KPIs beforehand so as to show the confidence the team has in their proposal, and then comparing the progress would have been more undemanding for the auditors", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "\u00a0Implement our purpose led accelerator MVP developed in F7 with a wider pool of developers.\u00a0", "experience": "As Impact focused experts we run high growth coaching & mentoring programmes from tech startups, through to Global businesses & Universities.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis is a continuation of our MVP for the F7 Accelerators and Mentors challenge, in our Impact Innovation Accelerator project.\u00a0\n\u00a0"}
