I loved this idea. It is about creating a laundry service called \u201cEco Laundry Center (EcoLC)\u201d, where people take their dirty clothes and pay for the washing service with waste that they would discard in the trash, of course, properly separated. This project also relates to our blockchain because it would make NFTs available that people would buy in order to be sure about how this initiative is helping to reduce the emission of cardan in the atmosphere, as the excerpt says: \u201cEcoLC really helps to reduce the carbon emissions into the atmosphere, and this will be certified with carbon credits. NFT owners will receive an annual airdrop with carbon credit certification.\u201d The logic is that the garbage that would be disposed of inappropriately receives a useful purpose, as it would be used as the currency for people to wash their clothes in this innovation center, I think I can call it that, because it is something that already exists, seen in a different way. brand new and that will surely benefit the environment and Cardano. The benefit would not only be environmental, as already mentioned due to the amount of waste that would not be discarded, if the application were a success. This would also have a social impact indirectly, as holders of these NFTs might see them appreciate in value over time, so this would be a form of investment. Depending on the initial price of NFTs, people in developing countries could buy them and then sell them, which would help improve local income. I think the proposal is very good because in addition to these clearly environmental and indirectly social benefits, it could help popularize our blockchain. Let's say that a certain portion of the population that has never even heard of blockchain, let alone Cardano, became aware of this \u201cfree\u201d laundry service, for sure if this project succeeds it can attract new members to the Cardano ecosystem. And also for the fact that the proponent says that payments could also be made in cryptocurrencies (it would be better if they were exclusively in Ada). This would also open up a new possibility of use for our currency. Anyway, the only criticism I have would be that it is not explained in this part of the impact how Dapp would relate to this physical space, would there be appointments to go there? Would there be information there like \u201chow much organic waste do you need to bring to wash X amount of clothes\u201d? Anyway, I really liked the idea, and for the reasons explained, I think it has the potential to have maximum impact. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The viability of the project is good, despite having some points to improve. Let's start with the script. The general idea of \u200b\u200bwhat will be done is described very well in this paragraph: \u201cThe solution offered is a system that combines four different technologies already known: small Biogas installation with small co-generator, wetlands built for recycling water, waste compactor, NFTs. all four of these technologies are well known, just combine them. I have dealt with each of these technologies in the past.\u201d Although the proponent describes some activities that are necessary to make this idea a reality, this description is not exactly a roadmap, because we have no notion of time. In my view, this project is complex, so how long would it take in total to develop? It is necessary for the proponent to place us better in relation to temporality. He doesn't need to start the script from scratch, he could take the information we already have and relate it to some time intervals. For example, the first task would be \u201cCreate an NFT crowdfunding campaign and promote it accordingly\u201d. How long would this last? 1 month, 2 months? Who would work on it? Now moving on to the second point of feasibility analysis: the budget. Usually people ask for a total amount and divide it into small parts, but without explaining well what each of them would be. This does not happen here, the proponent is concerned with arguing well what the uses of each requested part of the budget would be, making us understand the need for the 10 thousand dollars requested. From what I understand, the actual price of each such installation would be in the range of 100 thousand dollars, it is not very clear to me how the rest of the money would be used. If the bidder had made available the file he cites in \u201cWe can provide a detailed file with each component, but it's a huge file\u201d, I think a higher budget could even be requested. Now, speaking of the team, we have the names and information of each of those involved. Regarding Marcello Ambrosio, his presentation is ideal, he provides many details about his academic and professional background and even provides an article that talks about him, but in relation to his colleagues, the level of detail is not the same. The information passed on about the other team members is quite basic, I would like them to also make their resume available through linkedin, preferably, so that we could verify the information that is said. In general, auditability is good, yes; but the description of activities should have been related to time intervals and the detailing of team members should have been similar for all involved. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability suggested by the bidder is good, but there is room for improvement. Let's start by analyzing the development process: first, it would be nice to understand how far this proposal intends to go. We know that the construction of the floor plan (floor plan, I imagine, as from what I understand the proponent is a landscape architect) would be a strong indication that we are heading in the right direction. But until then, it will be necessary to carry out the crowdfunding campaigns, then launch the first NFTs that would also help raise funds for the project... In short, there are several partial results to be achieved, so how could we from the Cardano community follow these small advances? I think the bidder successfully outlines what needs to be audited, but not how it would be audited. I suggest that he and his team make a monthly survey of the activities carried out in that period of time, of the achievements, difficulties, mistakes and successes, in short, of everything that happened in the development process of this project that month. And then, these variables need to be made available so that the whole community can consult them, either through online tools preferred by team members, such as google docs, or a written report is made and posted on our website. Telegram group \u201cProject Catalyst\u201d. Regarding the final results, I think that this part is still a bit abstract, since we are so early in the project, but certainly the proponent already traces well that \u201ctrue success will come when we have the first initiative started on our own, for someone who heard about EcoLC and decided to create an NFT crowdfund initiative on the platform.\u201d However, as I think this is still something that will be far ahead, I would like him to have traced other KPIs that could make us understand that the project has finally achieved what was planned for with the funding of 10 thousand dollars. And once again, when formed and organized, this information should be easily accessible to all members of the Cardano community. In summary, I like the auditability, but I think there was still a certain notion of \u201cwhat is really captureable at the moment and how can we perceive it, in relation to achievements\u201d still lacking. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 386, "q0": "We see that the project works directly on mitigating environmental impacts by finding a sustainable destination for waste. This new laundry concept involves using Cardano's technologies to promote its financing, in addition to targeting a resource-intensive market (the laundry market); it is also known that this waste problem is especially serious in less developed countries with weaker regulatory measures.\n\nWith this, it is clear that the proposal is in line with the goals established for the challenge in which it finds itself, in addition to being innovative. It is also notable that a possible expansion of this laundry model would increase Cardano's visibility. We realized, however, that the action plan chosen for the proposal may not be the most appropriate for the degree of maturity of the idea, which makes the budget of $10,000 possibly not so adequate for the objectives to be achieved.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Due to the characteristics described in the proposal, we realize that the idea has not yet been implemented, and the path that needs to be taken until the model is really validated, it appears that new modes of financing will need to be used. The idea of \u200b\u200bselling NFT's to raise funds is sensational, especially because each location is planned to carry out its own campaigns, which opens the door to the creation of unique NFT's for each city and with a lot of personality. It is possible, for example, that the NFTs are images of typical figures from each region. While this financing model is quite interesting, we are a little skeptical as to whether it will be able to raise the funds needed to set up a laundry facility, as the total costs for this are around $100,000. Even with other possibilities of raising funds, such as through local communities, it seems important that new well-defined metrics for this are established. A possible suggestion would be to seek to establish partnerships with other companies that could finance the implementation of a laundry in exchange for carbon credits, since, as stated in the proposal itself, the value of these credits only tends to increase.\n\nThere is also a plan to expand this model across several communities, but for that it seems that some questions still need to be answered. For example, assuming that funding has indeed been secured, is there really evidence that the venture can be highly sustainable? Despite these points mentioned here, we also find great ideas in the proposal, such as the possibility of paying for the laundering service with cryptocurrencies and the demonstration that, once functional, this project would also boost local commerce.\n\nThe professionals involved in the proposal seem to have great experiences that add to the project, but it would also be nice if their CVs were made available. Regarding the budget details, we noticed a plural division of expenses, with a lot of focus, including the creation of a community around the project, which helps in its exposure. A suggestion that seems to fit with what has been exposed so far, would actually be to request even a little more funding, but that the plan would become more focused on a total structuring of the idea before planning its expansion.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Regarding the ways to measure the progress of the project, and also in relation to what was being commented previously, we noticed the following. There are two ideas here that are a little contradictory at first, we see that the first fundraising is being planned for the first project plant to be built, and just below we see that the creation of a platform where everyone can create their own campaigns of collection. But why would the way of raising funds be generalized, if the funds for the consolidation of the first project will still be raised?\n\nGiven everything that was exposed during the proposal, we realize that this is a project with great potential, but it is important that some points are better polished so that a first laundry unit is validated and established, and that thus the project becomes more scalable, reaching its full potential.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1029, "q0": "Very commendable idea to tackle the environmental impact of waste water of a launderette and  improve recycling of waste.

Is the project scalable? Are the funds raised by the NFT needed for the first Ecolaundrycentre. It is not evident if the Ecolaundrycentre sustain itself after being build?

While the description of the team is good, it would be more positive if the team could make it public on LinkedIn or social media so we can know about them. The member we know best is Marcello Ambrosio, there's an article about him. For a biogas enthusiast, the interview can be read easily. his link https://www.motherearthnews.com/renewable-energy/biogas-all-stars-marcello-ambrosio-zbcz1411\nThe article has given a very detailed solution, a clear solution. However, the proposal does not provide a roadmap with verifiable milestones and a definite timeline.\nThe proposal also mentions that a complete installation of the EcoLC would cost around $100,000, and this part of the cost would be able to be funded by community organizations. So the required budget of the proposal is $10,000 of course considering the size of the project this is quite a small amount and the costs are well explained.
