As the number of users increases, it is necessary to educate users about Cardano knowledge. Cardanocube.io is a project directory of the Cardano ecosystem, it has a large number of visitors, but not everyone understands Cardano deeply. Therefore, when this proposal is completed, it will be an educational channel for a large number of users to properly understand and deeply understand Cardano in a mainstream way. The recommender's ability to optimize SEO will attract more new users to Cardano, as evidenced by the nearly 800,000 monthly Cardanocube.io visitors and growing numbers. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to have an additional Cardano blockchain knowledge education platform.  I give 5 points.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponent has many years of experience in building professional UX/UI websites, the ability is proven by the Cardanocube.io website platform being used by many people, I am also one of these people who often visit to find information. This proposal is to expand Cardanocube.io to include more categories for content, knowledge videos about Cardano. Technically I see the Educational Platform as a news website, so it can be done quickly and best by proponents. Cardano's educational content will be a challenge, but the proponent has over 5 years of experience in the crypto space, I believe he can write educational content based on his self-taught knowledge. In addition, the proponent also has a plan to get information from other sources, by cooperating with many partners and content providers. However, I have not been able to check which partners or content providers he cooperates with; this is a minus point. I give 4 points.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "If this proposal is completed, Cardanocube.io will be a library of Cardano blockchain knowledge, which will help educate the large number of users who are accessing this website. Not only that, the educational content here with good SEO will pull new users to the website, which can be verified by a number of traffic measurement tools available on the market such as: Ahrefs.com; Semrush.com; Similarweb.com\u2026 Regarding the budget of this proposal, the proponent has also clearly divided each item, in which the budget allocation for the 2 parts of feature development and content writing is the highest. These are the 2 most important components of this proposal, I think the budget proposal is perfectly reasonable.

Well organized educational system and materials for the newcomers to Cardano is extremely important for attracting new users. \nThe proposal could have been placed in the new members on boarding challenge if it is more focused to the Project Catalyst new members, but the proposer does not state that, and that implies more broad educational material.

More reach, means more ideas will come. \n\nJust one thing, the most crucial thing is the educational content that presented. This is because, to attract more mainstream people, you need a good interactive content to make them stay and learn to the end (taking myself as an adult that wants to learn something new, im more attracted to content that have progression and make we feel good innit.) \n\nI hope proper people are to be chosen to do the content so that it will give full impact rather than just another reading material in the internet", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Since it will start in Q2 and fully implemented in Q4 this year, I think it is enough time to prepare all educational content with improvements from time to time.\n\nI believe the requested amount is reasonable given the detail of the manhours and development of content.

The proposal described that \u201cWe will extend the Cardano Cube platform with an educational section. This section contains different sections\u201d, but this is confusing the reader because we do not know what information will be provided to educate people. Therefore, I believe explain in detail these questions such as what specific contents will contain in these educational sections? How does the project custom the content to help the learner understand and get to use the Cardana ecosystem? Moreover, the language barrier should be considered, for those who do not know English and translation is needed for them to understand the provided content, so will these educational contents be provided with translation for the non-English speaker?

The proposal should give further information such as Who are the partnerships? And do they have enough experience to write educational content for the Cardano ecosystem? so I suggest providing their name or link to their work would significantly improve your feasibility. The timeline in the proposal needs to add more detail to give the reader vision to follow up your project. For example, Q2 has 3 months, in 1st month the content will be written, then 2nd month the written content is delivered through Cardano Cube and get feedback to improve, the 3rd month is increasing the learner on Cardano Cube.

From my understanding after reading through the proposal, it aims to add an educational platform to the already existing (and well known) Cardano Cube. Having been through several funds as a CA, adding this to Cardano Cube will bring further value to the ecosystem as a whole. The need for educating people in Blockchain technology, crypto and especially Cardano will never grow obsolete. Adding different levels of complexity for both new and intermediate users (as stated in the proposal) seems like a good choice for addressing more people in the ecosystem. \n\nThere is an argument to be made that this proposal would be better off in the Onboarding new members-challenge, but as the proposer states in the comments section it is aimed more towards general Cardano members rather than introducing people to Catalyst directly (even though lots of people may end up there eventually). All in all, I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is no doubt that the developing team is highly competent and have been incredibly successful in its previous implementation of Cardano Cube. They have a growing follower-base on social media, along with an active platform that is growing rapidly. As hinted in the proposal, the biggest potential challenge might be the assurance of quality in regards to the actual educational content. Which the team (of one person) seems to be aware of. The budget breakdown is pretty simple and realistic, suited for a smaller project with few team members. Despite Cardano Cube being a well known platform in the Cardano Ecosystem, it would highly benefit the proposal if it had included some verifiable information of the developer. (linkedIn profile, projects that this specific developer has been responsible of before, etc). My purpose as a CA is to assess the proposal in its presented form, despite what I know outside of it. From my experience as a teacher, I would have loved to see maybe an example of a curriculum for the educational content. That would further increase my trust in the project, and believe more in the credibility of the team.\n\nWe are presented with some development milestones (that seems feasible) on a realistic timeframe.

The only way of measuring the development of the project is NOT only finishing the project, but can also be to communicate with people who are interested on social media. Providing updates of the progress, etc. \u2028I would have liked to see some measurements of success/KPIs describing how much traffic the educational platform is expected to see for the project to be deemed as successful. Also, how many different collaborators are planned?  These are the types of questions I would have liked to see being answered.
