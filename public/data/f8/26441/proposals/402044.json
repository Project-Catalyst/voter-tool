But whether it's a good investment to put $50,000 into a taco truck that will ultimately onboard just 100 people at a bitcoin conference is an important question when considering the success of this proposal. \n\nI would like to encourage these proposers to think bigger. Why is there mention to using this taco truck at the bitcoin conference, but no thoughts on establishing a permanent, profitable business selling Cardano Tacos in cities across the nation and onboarding them with free wallets with each taco? This truck could tour New York, Boston, L.A., Houston, Cleveland, Omaha, and warm sunny Colorado. And you'd be stretching more out of the money granted out of the treasury that way. Food for thought, hmm?\n\nIf doing this sort of thing is something the proposers have in mind, they should detail their long-term dreams some, where they'd like to go with this and the benefits long-term taco trucking could offer the community.

What can the proposers show the Catalyst community (and of course the greater public) with this clever idea that will impress us with your originality? Perhaps they could even let the Catalyst community audit the contents of their menu.
