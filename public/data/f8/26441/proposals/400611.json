From my personal experience, one of the most important things that we can do in this industry is to educate ourselves. I agree with the statement that we will be able to help educate the community about synthetics and other defi related topics. With the booming interest in the \"metaverse industry.\" I think it would be really smart to implement more use of a metaverse into the cardano space. Especially being included in such a strong project such as indigo that will help others learn about defi and synthetics. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This team already have a lot going on with the community. They have been able to reach expectations of their users and I know that they will carry out what they plan to do with the given funds. The way that everything was formatted shows that indigo labs is ready to do what it takes to strategically implement what will be beneficial to the cardano ecosystem.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I enjoyed reading through the proposal and finding exact information in regards to how the MetAcademy will be beneficial to the ecosystem. They gave exact amounts of where the money from the fund would go. I really appreciate that because it shows that they are going to be truthful with what happens to the funds and why it will be beneficial.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1448", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6705, "q0": "I strongly agree that this proposal is a perfect fit for this challenge setting and effectively addresses the challenge. Indigo protocol has come up with the idea of synthetic assets which are parallel to derivatives from the traditional financial world, but more flexible as they can be linked to any real world asset. The goal of this proposal is to create an educational library that focuses on spreading deeper knowledge about synthetic assets and DeFi to the community. \n\nAlthough, The team will make the result of this proposal fully open source, this proposal is more in line with educating the community hence it is placed in miscellaneous challenge settings. The goal of this proposal is to eventually provide metaverse based learning in DeFi on Cardano space. This is a very impactful idea, in my opinion, because incremental improvements and progress of this proposal will catalyze the spread of both DeFi and RealFi.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind this proposal is the Indigo team. They already are well known in the community for creating the Indigo protocol. The youtube video link provided showcases their webapp which showcases the work they have already done and the team holds a great knowledge of Cardano, both in technical terms and domain wise. \n\nThe timelines are over a period of 3 months from May - july 2022. The team plans to launch 10 pairs of articles and videos to release educational material in a 5 module program. Additionally, they want to involve 3D assets in metaverse to engage community initiatives. However, in my opinion, a real world example would have been a lot more helpful and further improved the quality of this writeup. The budget for 3D asset creation is well justified, as I have myself worked with 3D artists in the past and the hourly rates are market standards.\n\nThe risk/challenges section provides details that they are planning to develop across multiple Metaverse projects and this could be overwhelming, however they have mitigated this risk by integrating everything to their platform. \n\nFinally, based on the plan and experience of the team, I strongly agree that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I strongly agree that the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of this proposal. The KPIs of having high quality 3D assets on different metaverses and with smart contract integrations on each metaverse, the users/learners will have access to real world synthetic assets use cases, and along with the text content they will also have the ability to play around OR gain practical experience. \n\nThe timeline and roadmap to achieve them is clear, and the Indigo team has been quite interactive with the community the entire time (e.g. community voting on their platform about their ISPO launch) so I see no reason that the community will have issues providing feedback/getting progress details of this proposal.\n\nThe success of the proposal is also envisioned in the longer run and the first steps are taken as an attempt to find new and interesting ways to educate the general community, and I find it very interesting because blockchain technology is oftentimes quite a brain teaser for the general population out there. This will be very important in the long run, if blockchain has to become what the internet is today. I wish all the best for the team, and thank them for their great work in the Cardano community.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_454", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7949, "q0": "The team wants to develop a defi field educational resource center in a metaverse environment.\nCurrently our cardano platform lacks specialized educational backgrounds, as the UTXO engine, Haskell language and cardano blockchain structure is different from previous platforms.\nTherefore, having a well-rounded training and guidance platform at different levels of study, especially in the technical field, will open up many opportunities for those who want to develop in depth, and go with them for a long time. with our background.\nMoreover, if the platform is online and intuitive when applying metaverse, it is very suitable for today's educational needs, not limited to national borders.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I like the idea of combining the metaverse and education, which will make our lessons more interesting.\nThe curriculum is designed into 6 modules, the job objective is clear, but you need to give more details about the content of each module. From there, calculate the number of working hours of each group member.\nI am also impressed with the previous project Indigo that you guys are working on, so I think the team has the capacity to carry out this educational project.\nThis section should be developed so that the course is of a high standard and can become regular courses at universities or colleges.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Your group's project has not set numerical goals, duration of courses, number of students will participate...\nThis will increase the persuasion and show that the project is planned in advance.\nAlthough the team has its own github channel so it can be followed.

The proposal addresses the issue that as the Cardano ecosystem grows, users need an easily accessible space within the Metaverse to learn about and interact with growing Defi projects. This helps Defi greatly benefit from joining the Metaverse. The Solution is an educational library from Indigo Academy focused on synthetic assets and their use within the Cardano ecosystem, all within the Metaverse. We can easily view Indigo's information via https://www.indigoprotocol.io/. The starting problem and the intended solution presented in the proposal match the challenge in a clear and logical manner.\nThe recommendation also includes how to reduce some of the risk of putting everything on one platform by building on multiple projects. With the level of the team, I believe they can completely handle the risks that may be encountered and complete this project well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Since the proposed work has already taken place, I take it as an answer that the proposal will be successfully implemented. It's great that Indigo's proposal has provided enough information, through which we can understand more from the scale to the roadmap, the team as well as the major partners behind this project.\nThe site provides a list of groups and experiences and will aim for an experience high enough to run this campaign. The required funding of USD 30,000 for the project is also explained very clearly and convincingly. In addition, the proposed plan is also very detailed, making it easy for the community to check the progress of the proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal has clear and measurable goals and a fairly reasonable budget.
