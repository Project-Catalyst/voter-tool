I would agree that the proposers have correctly placed their proposal in this challenge. The proposal does articulate how it intends to add value to the Cardano ecosystem and I would say that the team's problem statement (\"Malicious actors can launch distributed attacks and spread disinformation to undermine trust in the Cardano ecosystem\") is very pertinent for any burgeoning technological and social system. The proposed solution sounds potentially interesting as the proposers claim to have two important and seemingly powerful tools at their disposal that they can apply to resolve the problem: (1) Skyros's global network of hackers and (2) a threat detection software to discover attacks before they are launched. The team states that its proposed solution addresses the challenge by \"proposing a great idea that offers a valuable service to the community\". The two tools and the valuable service seem to promise a great impact. The team identifies a \"major challenge\" in the form of successfully alerting the broader Cardano community when an attack has been discovered. The solution is a website and social media channels. The proposed impact score has been lowered due to the inability of the team to provide verifiable experience with this type of projects, that would certainly increase the expected added value to the Cardano ecosystem", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The feasibility of this proposal seems to be it's Achilles heel. The team behind the proposal does not provide any evidence its claims of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal. The company's website states that the company Skyros Intelligence was started by security experts. No references, no names. The two core elements of the solution are presented as concepts with no verifiable information (1) Skyros's global network of hackers and (2) a threat detection software to discover attacks before they are launched. These are key components of the proposal - but remain completely out of the picture. Yes, of course, the proposer may claim that Skyros Intelligence is unable to reveal the innermost details of its two critical pieces of operations. Fine. Even so, if these two solutions are so efficient, we could have been presented with a list of verifiable previous successes/results and Skyros Intelligence's previous clients and recommendations. Maybe even this is not in the public domain? There is nothing in the minimum verifiable about previous experience on the Skyros Intelligence website. The proposer has not shown the type (specific hacker expertise - which operating systems, programming languages, network expertise - maybe also Haskell, Plutus?) and number of team members required to implement the proposal. The plan does not contain any verifiable information that there is a Threat Scanner that is operational AND performant. It is left to the voter to believe that this is a fact. Skyros could prove its efficiency indirectly through accounts from its clients or through press releases or other forms of proof that is certainly has at its disposal as a - a security firm with expertise in ethical hacking and the dark/deep web. The very existence of the Hacking Network is based on voter trust, as it has also been backed with as much proof as the claims about Skyros's expertise in ethical hacking and the dark/deep web. If this proposal is not voted in. I would recommend that Skyros provides verifiable proof of its expertise, the merits of its technical solutions (Threat Scanner) and what do the updates to Threat Scanner consist of? What are the Cardano Threat Scanner updates all about? Will they monitor distributed attacks on Cardano AND how will this be done as Cardano is a decentralized system itself. The philosophy - if not the technical details - behind these solutions would be of interest. What is also the nature of the relationship between Skyros and its  hacking network - exactly? A monthly stipend of $500 to monitor for attacks has not be backed up with a breakdown - how much time, how much monitoring, what kinds of reports are provided by these hackers? Skyros offers performance bonuses of up to $1,000 for hackers who uncover potential attacks and alert, meaning that without any discoveries the monthly stipend is paid out regardless of success. I would recommend that Skyros details more information about the ways it can prove the value of its service to Cardano - in a verifiable way, if this proposal is not accepted in this fund. The \"team members and network of hackers prefer to remain anonymous\" - however, that has a negative impact on the Feasibility of this proposal, taking into account that the company itself seems poorly transparent based on its skeleton website. \n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The team specifies that Quantitative metrics will be difficult to use to measure the success of this project (claim: \"because it is hard to anticipate the volume or nature of the threats that our system will uncover\"). Still, not being able to anticipate the general nature of threats may seem a bit strange for a company that has plans to retrain its hacking network to monitor the Cardano ecosystem and to deploy an updated version of Threat Scanner in the first 3 months. What does this training consist of and what is the nature of these updates, would be interesting to explain? \n\nHere are some possible metrics:\n(1) Number of prevented attacks. \n(2) Number of reports provided to the Cardano community\n(3) Number of hours spent by the hacking network (that is paid a monthly stipend of $500 to monitor for attacks) per week and per month and which technical tools are used for monitoring (is it the Treat Scanner alone?) \n(4) Number and technical qualifications of members of the Hacking Network and their geographical distribution \n(5) Number of false positives\n(6) Nature of attacks and classification by groups of attacks and regions where they originate from\n\netc...  It took me 30 seconds to come up with these ad hoc metrics. They might not be good, but then Skyros can surely provide us with better ones if these are not good. \nA company such as Skyros Intelligence that is self-defined as a security firm with expertise in ethical hacking and the dark/deep web, should be able to provide metrics based on its experience with previous work for its clients, fighting against distributed attacks and spreading disinformation. The timeline is present but not detailed and seems difficult to audit from the outside as it is very generic in its formulations.  \nUnfortunately, the solution that Skyros provides is essentially unauditable at its very core - as it is based on complete and full trust in the claims of Skyros Intelligence. Yet the company  has provided no proof of its competencies, of its previous successes, of the capabilities of its Hacker Network, of the ability of the solution to address the problem of its team. The proposed solution resembles a piece of fiction - if there are no facts to back it up and it is not auditable - because the auditing will seemingly be dependent on full and utter trust in feedback from the anonymous team, anonymous hacking network, unproven Threat Scanner. This could be remedied (in Fund 9 if this proposal is not voted for) by including sample reports authored by Skyros Intelligence from other projects that can demonstrate the wide breadth of experience and capabilities that Skyros, its team, its Global Network and the Threat Scanner have. Essentially, the question here is how can claims of prevented attacks be audited? Show us. Launching a new website to list threats that have been detected is seemingly not enough as the presented information again requires a component of full trust in components and participants that remain invisible and anonymous - apart from the Skyros webpage. Catalyst is financing and Catalyst needs more than verbal assurances. It needs proof that the Wizard of Oz really exists behind the curtain.

The idea is to partner with a company that specializes in this and monitor possible attacks on the Cardano network before they happen, this would be done through specialized software that would constantly monitor the deep/dark weeb, identifying possible malicious actions aimed at a specific audience. I think the explanation of what would be done is very accessible, but it could be more detailed. How would that work? Does some kind of software like this already exist, and are the results consistent with what is expected? I would like the proposal to be more detailed, although the idea is good, I would still like to understand it more deeply. It would also be interesting to explain more about this company they want to partner with, what exactly it does, examples of previous work and what ethical hacking would mean (to me this seems contradictory).

Talking about the budget, an amount of 33 thousand dollars is requested, which was duly explained (we know it would be divided into some parts, such as payment to hackers, system maintenance, server costs, etc.). It is explained why each of the parties would cost what is asked, mainly in the payment of the hackers. We know very well how this would work, so this part of the proposal is quite adequate. The team says they prefer to remain anonymous, this to me is a bad thing, even though the nature of the work requires privacy, we need to know who we are dealing with in order to have confidence that they are capable of executing the project. In this case, it would be essential to know the names and CVs of those involved, and how they relate to Cardano.

Regarding the final results, unfortunately in this part the proponents do not say anything new, nothing that has not been said in the impact itself. It would be interesting for them to think of ways to measure how Cardano and its community would benefit from this project; it is certainly useful, but how can we prove the improvements?

Extra hands in this task never hurt.  However, I believe that IOG, the Cardano Foundation and EMURGO, among other related organizations, have done an excellent job coordinating and executing defense and prevention actions from the basis of Cardano's own technology.  Our record in security and protection measures is outstanding: we are out of the headlines of news related to computer crimes or hacks of information or assets.  Even in the Hard Forks our performance has been satisfactory.  The point is: threat prevention is so important to the sustainability of our ecosystem that it is beyond the reach of the Catalyst community. Catalyst is the beating heart of the Cardano ecosystem's creativity and innovation, yet the line of defense is taken on directly by entities like IOG and the Cardano Foundation, and as I said, they have done an impeccable job.  The proposers describe in their proposal the provision of a service (of course, a specialized service that only a few can offer) but not the request for a budget to develop from scratch a product or service that fits the specific requirements of one of the non-generic challenges of the fund.  \n\nIt makes sense that the proposal was submitted to the Miscellaneous Challenge, because ultimately threat prevention issues are not dealt with directly by Catalyst, they are dealt with directly by IOG and its partners.\n\n\nIn my opinion, at this stage of the ecosystem, this type of proposal does not allow an adequate decision to be made without prior technical consultation with the organizations whose role is precisely to provide protection to the ecosystem.
