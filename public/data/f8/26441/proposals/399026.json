You're asking for Catalyst financing to a) procure hardware to operate your own stakepool, b) develop/operate a website to monitor and provide analytics on stakepool operators, c) create a use case for solar powered stakepools, and d) run marketing campaigns targeting cardano awareness in Sri Lanka, which partly involves launching a native token to incentivize referrals.  The ideas are interesting, but practically unrelated.\n\nWhile I don't dislike the proposed ideas, I'm leaning towards disagreement because the proposal isn't focused enough, and therefore voters will be unable to selectively support your initiatives.\n\nI believe you could be more successful by separating the ideas from this proposal, and asking the community to review, then support each initiative as an independent project.  Alternatively, you might consider to revise the proposal to explain in more detail how your initiatives are directly related, to make it feel like a more unified project.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal does provide for time/financial resources which I believe are overly sufficient for accomplishing the proposed plan.  However, I think a more important question is whether or not it is appropriate for Catalyst to finance stakepool operators at this stage - and simply for the purpose of providing geographic diversity.  While the team seems sufficiently large enough to execute the project proposed (perhaps even oversized), there are multiple comments in the proposal about fixed time commitments (maintaining the website, setting up and maintaining the stakepool), and it's unclear what happens after those commitments are completed.  Perhaps continued operation could be supported by the fixed/variable income from stakepool node operation, although the proposal does not clarify the fee model for their proposed stakepool.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Other than measuring the success of this proposer's stakepool at attracting local stakers, as well peripheral benefits presumably earned through building value in a native token distribution aimed at incentivizing referrals, the auditability section completely forgets to include the solar element which was detailed earlier in the proposal.  In any case, the proposal seems aimed more at personal gain rather than community expansion.   And any positive outcomes regarding solar use case are shadowed by the up-front price tag for that system, and no evaluation on the economic model or cost saving value to run that system - especially as an independent, single pool set-up.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1224", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposer wants to build a stakepool in Sri Lanka powered by solar power. The reasoning behind this proposal is that there is no native Sri Lanka stake pool and that is why the people stake with Binance. The voter should know, that Binance offers close to two times higher rewards than the native staking on Cardano, maybe that has something to do with the people staking there. I\u2019m not advocating it, everything has a price and being outside of the blockchain has lots of risks. Anyway, the proposal is for a local stakepool in order for the local community to move out of Binance.\nIn the impact part of the proposal there is a huge explanation without any fact check on the text that is there. For example: \u201cCardano\u2019s staking pools allow people to delegate their stake to a manager, who collects stake from multiple individuals then decides which validators to delegate to.\u201d Why this text exists I could not tell you since there is no connection with the creation of a stakepool. Following down the text things really get out of sync and make no sence.\nI suspect the proposer has multiple proposals in this and previous funds and he pasted parts of another proposal in this one. I have checked my suspicion, the proposer has more than 20 proposals in fund 8 alone.\nThis proposal could have been placed in in B2B challenge. \nI agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has no experience in the field of engineering and software development. According to his CV his main occupation is a translation company.\nThe proposer has more than 20 proposals for this fund alone. This worries me a lot.\nThe proposer is elected member of the Catalyst Circle v3.\nThe proposal has a road map divided into months. The detail of this complex endeavor is nonexistent. And the time allocated for the different tasks is, to say it mildly, insufficient. I\u2019m making these comments as an electrical engineer with more than 12 years experience.\nThe proposed budget is broken down roughly, without real offers for the hardware that is needed. There is no mention for an expense for electrician or design of the PV system, just some arbitrary numbers.  \nThe team is presented and has linked in links to profiles, although some of them quite new and empty, and there is a face book link to a personal page of a team member\u2026 which is strange. However I don\u2019t see any electrician or electrical engineer in the team and the budget does not provide a slot for such person, so I wonde who and how will calculate and make the electrical drawings and the electrical project as a whole. \nI disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The auditing part of the proposal suggests that we can make audit by the metrics that a regular stakepool would measure and some extra. However I don\u2019t believe this is the correct way to audit a project like this. The auditors should be able to track the progress of the paper work and permissions, planning and construction of the PV system and the computational system. If this is already done, it is obvious that it will work, the question is if the proposers could build it to that point. \nI strongly disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1417", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal addresses the issue that there is not currently a stake pool operating out of Sri Lanka.

The ability to set up a stake pool from a technical perspective is one thing, the ability to build the infrastructure for a completely off grid pool is another thing.

If the team wanted to setup a off grid pool in Sri Lanka, it would not cost more than $10-15K max for two laptops (relay and block producer), some deep cycle batteries and  some solar panels and internet connection. This would have a minimal electricity foot print. There is a large budget targeted at marketing.
