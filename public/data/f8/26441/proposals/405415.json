Historically, we know the need for this type of action for sustainable development, so the idea itself is not that innovative. However, the way of execution that is being planned has a differential and can bring a positive impact to Cardano. We realized that the proposal fits the goals established in the challenge (also because it is a unique idea). With the success of the project, other sustainable practices can start to use technologies from Cardano's ecosystem to implement innovative solutions, with a beneficial repercussion of this proposal in the long term. We noticed that the plan is initially to validate the operation of an installation for possible expansion in the future, so we also have the characteristic of scalability in this idea. Regarding the budget being requested, we note that the amount of $28,000 is consistent with the project's planning, as we will see below.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "When we understand the purpose of the project, initially there is a fear that the execution plan is too complex and ends up becoming unfeasible. But we realize that this possible problem is circumvented, since the focus of this funding stage is to 'model' the idea, which helps make the whole process more viable. Regarding the steps chosen in the plan to organize this modeling of the process, we noticed that they are quite coherent, starting with simpler actions, such as the search for places that supply raw material, and gradually getting more complex, until actually getting to the test of what that will be produced through recycling. This organization of steps is another positive factor for the viability of the business.\n\nClearly, the process of structuring a recycling system involves a lot of technical knowledge on the part of the participants. By observing the cited experiences of the professionals working in the project, it is possible to understand that they have the necessary requirements to successfully fulfill the mission since they have, together, complementary attributes for the work. Such attributes include knowledge in several areas such as entrepreneurship, construction and the use of innovative materials. But it would be important that all resumes had been made available in the proposal, we realized that only Carl Henry's resume is indicated with a LinkedIn address.\n\nRegarding the detailing of the budget, the capital distributions seem coherent and a positive point that we can notice are the different allocations of capital destined to auxiliary actions, before a greater expenditure actually occurs. In other words, we realized that several less costly steps such as mixing testing, prototype analysis and filling in reports are performed before a more aggressive amount is actually used (such as the $10,000 being allocated to manufacturing the molds).\n\nBut as one of the project's great differentials is the negotiation of carbon credits with the use of NFT's, I believe that this point should have been addressed in more depth here. Even because, without this feature, the business does not have much difference in relation to traditional recycling projects. However, as this proposal intends to be part 1 of a larger project, there is room for this aspect to be better worked on in the second stage.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding the determined ways to follow the development of the project, we see that they make sense in relation to what was exposed throughout the proposal. The KPIs in each of the months are basically the check if the works indicated in the feasibility plan have been completed. A valid observation here is that it would also be interesting to use some project monitoring tool, such as Miro, that would facilitate a periodic demonstration of the fulfillment of these tasks.\n\nRegarding the team's perception of success, we see that the general idea conveyed makes sense, but something else could have also been included that could better demonstrate the success of this first stage of the project. One possibility would be to have a goal of partnerships to be carried out with organizations related to the environment to increase the dissemination of the project and try, since then, to foster people's interest in buying future NFT's.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 5, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1581, "q0": "Getting Cardano ecosystem into recycling is a good gesture for the  community. It improves the awareness of plastic disposal as well as Cardano to general public, Creating carbon credit and Tokenizing as NFT is a fair move. The generated carbon credit implementation lacks good views , It can be be traded on the Cardano Ecosystem using NFTs but it it not clearly explained about this process in the proposal. This whole thing is able to negate the CO2 emission at a grassroots level. Although this can actually position Cardano as an environmental focused ecosystem.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The feasibility structure is okay to be considered and generally in line with timeline and data points addressed.  The team they have come up have necessary exposure in these kind  of things and looks confident, The conclusive challenges I see in this project requires a large amount of funds for the purchase of equipment and I see they have put forward to  invest in stages to mitigate the risks. They are looking into first build a prototype of the paving block and then subject it to a series of tests, I suggest this to be done. Overall this good proposal to begin with. the team assigned to this funding should carefully look into each stage if they are funded", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This progress can be tracked by the team when if it could be funded. The auditability is quite good. KPI points has been very neatly addressed  structure is okay to be considered and generally in line with timeline and data points addressed.

The proposal does not feature a clear problem statement, rather the problem statement is assumed as plastic is a well known environmental problem. Therefore, it cannot be said that the problem is aligned to the solution.  The solution to the problem is clearly described in a step by step process and it connects to Cardano ecosystem by trading Carbon credits on the Cardano ecosystem.       ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "From my understanding this is a preparatory project (no actual production of plastic tiles) therefore the core project team of three professionals would be considered enough to implement the project. The time frame of implementation is a total of 12 weeks which seems a little ambitious especially for the actions of week 1-4 and 5-8.  Additionally, the tasks under week 5-8 will be performed by a third party, therefore, the team will not have the whole control of completing the tasks and there might be delays.   Furthermore, it is not clear enough as to how carbon credits will be distributed and exchanged to NFT. More clarity is required on the exchange process and how this will relate to Cardano. In regards to the budget, taking into consideration that no machinery will be bought at this time, the amount requested is representative of the tasks and the work that will be performed.

It plans to incentivize reducing the amount of tons of CO2 emissions using Carbon Credit which can be traded as NFTs on Cardano ecosystem. However it should be noted that since it is a new project the metrics that are being used in this proposal are aimed at building the facility and funding the resources needed for the recycling process, not aimed at the adoption of aforementioned NFT in the Cardano ecosystem. The scalability of the proposed solution would heavily depends on how successful they are at following the timeline. It would also be more impactful if they plan on using the recycled paving blocks to fix roads on remote areas in India because as of now it is unclear where would they install the recycled paving blocks. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal has outlined the budget and plan for implementation, although they could be broken down even more into identifiable items such as work hours. It is a bit hard to determine whether or not the budget is reasonable because, as I\u2019ve mentioned previously, it is not identifiable enough, for example the travel expenses and sundry expenses. The proposer has stated that the main challenge would be the huge upfront cost, though they don\u2019t have any verifiable plan if the project were to go over-budget. I am personally concerned because a lot of the steps depends on a third-party which might spawn risks of increasing the total budget or slowing the progress. The proposer did listed their relevant experiences although only one of them has a verifiable profile. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposer have outlined the 3 months metrics that would define the success: first month would be securing the materials supply; second month would be to finish the paving block prototype; and third month would be to secure letter of interest from purchasers. However I think the proposal could be extended 3-6 months more to include the development phase of Carbon Credit NFT on Cardano. Otherwise this project would not really add any value to the Cardano ecosystem because the whole steps so far are only focusing on building the recycle facility.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1522", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5251, "q0": "There is too much detail here and not enough of what I'm looking for. I'm personally very enthusiastic about environmental movements/missions but I do have to be objective in these reviews. I'm rather impressed by the impact this project could make but I'm very underwhelmed by the integration with the Cardano ecosystem. If the goal is to drive forward innovation and progress within the Cardano ecosystem, I don't think I see that here. Technically, this proposal has no impact on Cardano, only an intended impact when CNFTs are later integrated (which I have many questions about what these CNFTs might do and why that's relevant for the impact on Cardano - I'll save that for the next proposal). It feels more like this proposal is a charity request from Cardano to this program. Which is awesome, if that's what we're doing! I would be 100% more willing to give a positive score if there was more explanation on what this does for the Cardano ecosystem. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I'm a HUGE fan of this feasability section. This is exactly what I hope to see in these propoals but in staying consistent with my commentary in the impacts section, I'm not sure if Catalyst is where the proposal is supposed to be. I'm still going to rave about this section, just in case voters decide that this proposal is relevant enough for Catalyst. The roadmap is SO detailed and is very specific about what key things will be done in the given timeframes. This is very well planned and plenty tangible to see what's really going on. The budget is, I think, rather impressive. Major points for the specificity of categories and sub-types. I think they get a decent amount of mileage out of the budget. There are some areas that seem rather expensive but it definitely doesn't seem unreasonable by major proportions. Lastly, the experience of the core members is as elite as it gets. While I do wish I could see more than just 1 LinkedIn profile, I'm still very impressed in the end. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Normally, I'm very critical in this area of auditability. I've criticized a lot of projects for identifying their completion of the product as a measurement of success. In most cases, it is the use of the product that makes the real impact. However, this case is a little different in that the production is what makes an impact on the world. 260 tons of plastic waste per year pretty much says it all. I suppose it is worth setting goals for how much of the paving blocks they hope to sell, so that their operation can be self-sustaining. That's about all I would change/add.
