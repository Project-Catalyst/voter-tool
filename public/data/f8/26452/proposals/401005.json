This proposal suggest that the next stage of their growth should be from distributing media content to their community.  From descriptions of the shows they have already done (translated, so forgive me if I don't have this quite right) but it really seems like they are focused on teaching and learning about Cardano and the space, which is a breath of fresh air from the constant FUD and price speculation which I am sure their listener's have to wade through to find them.  As a small project, the impact is limited, but it seems proportional to the modest funding request, and it plans to deliver 24 weeks worth of material, a mix of sub 30-minute audio and youtube podcasts.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "With 150+ episodes and counting of their general crypto show, the pivot to Cardano should give them plenty more to talk about.  This track record gives a high level of confidence that they can keep up the good work.  The budget works out to sub $200 per episode, which seems...well, like a great deal, to be honest. They include a small marketing budget, and if I have any concerns here, it seems like with their experience they could really be targeting more marketing specifically to upgrade their outreach and keep the community hub project growing.  It seems this approach is more about solidifying a media base before targeting more growth.  The timeline is short and sweet, and it amounts to just keep doing what they are doing.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They are up to date on current IOG reporting for the hub, which consists of multiple social channels like Telegram and discord, which is both a sign that they understand the reporting process as well as a source of connection for the community to be able to follow and see how they are doing and growing.  They included a roadmap that indicated in the months ahead they would be evaluating growth opportunities for the Hub, and I think it would be helpful if they identified some general KPIs to help them better target opportunities.  Right now it seems like they are going to gauge which media platforms are providing the best feedback for the podcast, and then orient in that direction with marketing, but I think they could also be gauging the value of Catalyst onboarding in their area, maybe by coming up with a referrer program  (also a source of funding for the show if it works) for their listeners who have ideas and can be onboarded as proposers or assessors.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 5, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Thank you for this review and feedback.

This challenge addresses the important of creating educational and inspiring content about Cardano in different formats, available to the public. As the team members mention, we need to push forward the production of multimedia tools and teams collaborating to produce inclusive, high quality media content to increase knowledge and Cardano adoption. In this regard, the present proposal is perfectly aligned with the objectives of the challenge about bringing a series of Cardano centric podcast with close cooperation with Cardano Center in Poland. One of the great powers of podcasting is the attention it attracts. It\u2019s tricky to encourage people to spend 30 minutes reading an article or watching a recorded lecture, rather than offer audio content accessible at any time and place. In addition, we require blockchain content available in different languages, as is proposed to be implemented in this proposal.  Even though ADA has been positioned at the top 10 of all time cryptocurrencies, we can provide educational knowledge to bring it to the top 3. The proposers have already established series of Cardano educational content and have them available on different media platforms such as: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, RadioPublic, etc. All these are verifiable links with Cardano and blockchain content. The proposers clearly articulate how this podcast series will add value to the Cardano educational content, also making them available on various media platforms. I believe in its current form, this proposal  offers great valid points, variety of solutions, and educational resources that show the proactive efforts and work done for the Cardano ecosystem and crypto community growth.\nScore given: 5\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "FEASIBILITY:\nThis proposal has previously published Cardano content podcasts in various social media platforms (Spotify, Apple Podcast and Google Podcasts, and many others). As mentioned before, all the educational social media links attached are active and verifiable. Therefore, I consider the project goals for future podcast implementation is likely to be feasible and successful. Moreover, the proposers provide a roadmap where they aimed to create 1 podcast per week (within 6 months plan), which will have a duration of 30 minutes each. I believe this as a sensible expectation, that also offers a reasonable time frame to complete the work. The content of each recorded podcast will include crypto news, educational blockchain content, project reviews or interviews. The marketing campaign media they will target this time will be Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.  Wieczorow\u0105 Por\u0105, has been creating and producing Cardano content and workshops on different social media platforms for public consumption. This shows his experience as a communicator and crypto educator. In addition, the proposers specify the budget they require for covering the cost of the content creation (brainstorming, scripts, recording content, editing, and multiple platforms marketing costs). The budget requested is by far, reasonable (6000 USD), and will cover the content creation and the set goals established in the plan. The team behind the project offer different links where we can identify their professional experiences as Cardano community ambassadors and blockchain supporters. The only thing I would suggest at this phase is providing the potential challenges and risks that could occur or affect the implementation of the plan; however, the feasibility of the project looks sensible to be accomplished based on their previous professional experience, community involvement and Cardano educational content.\nScore given:5 \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "AUDITIBILITY:\nI believe that the references, links, professional team experience, educational social media content previously produced, and all the information provided, are sufficient resources to audit the progress and success of this proposal. Moreover, the team mentions that the development and progress of the project, will also be verifiable. The solution for the metrics and progress will be the weekly episode updates of Cardano-themed podcast, that will be available on multiple social platforms. In addition, they proposers will define the success of this podcast content based on the platforms with more social media interaction. In my opinion, this is a solid and strategic point, since the team has already created social media platforms and have vast experience on showcasing Cardano content. They also refer to yearly project expectations, based on the consistency and content weekly update and mention they want to be present in the online format in a more effective manner, while continuing to deliver high quality content for crypto enthusiasts. This shows that the team is interested and focused on scalability and how to promote Cardano community growth. I must mention that this is by far, one of the best proposals from its category I have reviewed, since they recognize the challenge, provide feasible solutions, cover details to meet the standards and expectations of each area evaluated in a project, and have already put the time and works in building an educational foundation before requesting funds. \nScore given: 5", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1557", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 3, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you for the review and feedback."}, {"id": 4580, "q0": "People of present generation are moving towards social media or podcast for entertainment purpose, hence podcast would be excellent idea where they can even continuously work with podcast on.\nPodcast is even used in physical working place where people will love to have knowledge about the future projects or understanding the importance of the block chain in the future hence proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The success of the plan wont be difficult as it just needs one excellent speaker where proposer has even mentioned the speaker's name, and all the other platforms collaboration would take time to engage , once people start loving the podcast it wont take much time for people to invest in block chain and engage in the nation building activities therefore, Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer has clearly mentioned about the speaker and all the platforms where they want to host their podcast ,the proposer has even done research on duration of the podcast so that it wont bore the audience ,these small crumbs are mentioned in very detailed manner in simple words by the proposer and also provided the areas where they can market their podcast hence  information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1747", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you for your review and suggestions."}, {"id": 4652, "q0": "Podcasts are currently the popular mode of communication especially knowledge transfer.

Furthermore the weekly podcasts would promote educational content that is reality accessible. As a frequent listener of podcasts, they would be an effective tool in learning about Cardano and other crypto related topics and the fact that the podcasts are on a platform that is frequently used, encourages listeners and thus enriches the Cardano ecosystem whilst increasing knowledge, which is also an essential part of the challenge. Moreover, one partner (Nikodem Zegzda) already has a platform and the other (Kornel Gajewski) is well versed in blockchain translating this shows and collaboration and coordinating between professionals and creatives, and the project is decentralized whilst encouraging new discussions and sharing of information between people. However, it is unclear what language the podcasts will be in and an aspect of the challenge is multilingual teams, however this is a simple task to challenge and the project still acts in educating and inspiring.
