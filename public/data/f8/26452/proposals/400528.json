Forgive the metaphor, but this is rich soil to till.  I have an off-grid, self-subsistence lifestyle with a heavy and growing reliance on blockchain technology, and the communities I am a part of all participate in this kind of lifestyle because of problems they see in the legacy institutions that surround them, from food production, to employment to health(sick)care.  While I don't get the impression that the intent of the creators here is to show how to use blockchain technology to address specific sustainability processes (such as track and trace, SSI and double-spend protection), I don't see how they will be able to avoid it in the longterm success of the project.  For example, an idea they intend to cover is how smart contracts could be understood by contrasting them with the way a farm works.  I often describe the work of Catalyst as being like a beehive, an integral part of maintaining the health of its ecosystem.  The reason these natural metaphors hold water is because like beehives and growing plants, blockchain is a network effect that reflects the values and needs of its ecosystems.  Cardano is unique among blockchains in that it is rigorously proven to be logical, and all of its adaptations that allow us to rely on that logic, to do things like conduct commerce between consenting adults, are also rigorously validated against that root proof.  When the content creators use the analogy of a farm to explain SCs, they are begging the question of whether a SC could be used to express something about farming, such as seed-to-sale for organic produce or avoiding double-spend ($) in the trade of critical supplies or knowledge.  I would expect that the topics this team seeks to cover, while valuable in their own right, will take on a life of their own, as Cardano gains exposure to the kinds of communities that need it most:  communities of radical change and inclusivity and self-governance.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind this proposal already has a permaculture video project, and offers training and teaching for permacultrue and sustainable living, so the addition of a Cardano-->permaculture learning resource is quite easy to imagine.  From their website and in the proposal itself you get hints of an understanding and appreciation of Cardano and blockchain, but the real strength they bring is the ability to translate the basics of Cardano to their well laid out platform and targeted audience.  The timeline and budget make it clear that they are looking to leverage their experience in this space with the help of these funds to build a content studio, of which the deliverables for this project will be their first production.  They look to be creating somewhere in the neighborhood of 14 total videos for this first round of the experiment, with the goal of monetizing the studio in such a way as to be self-sustainable, likely as a youtube channel.  To that end, the majority of the budget is aimed at some pretty great equipment...I dare say they would be able to onboard full fledged documentaries with what they have laid out here.  The budget is a big ask within the challenge fund, requesting almost a quarter of the total fund, but there does seem to be a lot of value on offer here.  Looking for areas of the budget where the team may be able to be more competitive, I really only see the marketing item ($3k) and the promotional event ($4k) at the end.  Because the promotional event has not been broken down more into how it would be conducted and have the money spent, that is an area that could be tightened up, but it isn't clear that it would make the budget more competitive.  As it stands, the risk here is one of under-delivery, of taking on a mid-budget project and getting low-budget results.  Here I feel that a lot of the risk is mitigated by the strengths and experience of the team, and the fact of what they delivered for the educational courses of the big websites Udemy and SkillShare.  I think they are ready for this.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The timeline they drew up has clear steps that will be easy to audit:  studio buildout can be expressed as a %complete metric, the release of the films at a rate of two per month are easy to track and measuring the project platform youtube channel will provide metrics for engagement and growth.  I did have two concerns, the first regarding the challenge KPIs.  While I believe they align well with the challenge, I am not seeing a clear way to measure the impact in terms of understanding Cardano.  It is implied in the content intentions and in engagement metrics with the channel, but it would be nice to see something more direct, such as a part of the platform that directs users to create ADA wallets, or a portal to Catalyst to put the knowledge gained in the videos to use.  The other concern was the nature of the final event.  It makes up a decent portion of the budget, but there is no indications of what kind of impact it is intended to measure.  It is obviously to increase exposure (and has the potential of creating a piece of the audit puzzle, which is the required final report due upon completion of the project), but how will it be conducted, who will participate and who will it reach?  It almost seems detached enough from the guts of the project to be a separate idea.  As a marketing idea, the proposer needs to consider how to capture its impact via metrics, and use those expectations to validate the line item in the overall budget.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 7, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Unfortunately, I have my doubts about how much this idea will add so much to the Cardano ecosystem. Starting with the fact that the proposer intends to create a channel on youtube, where we already have a good base of content about Cardano and also a considerable amount of viewers. As I see it, this challenge aims to release videos, photos, audios and other forms of media on platforms other than those on which we already have a strong base. The idea is to reach other, more traditional media, such as television and radio, for example, in order to have access to a different audience, which would be the people who would consume content on these alternative platforms. I think that for even more money to be invested in the creation of content for youtube, it is necessary that the project is very well structured, that we know exactly what would be done and that this was very positive and differentiated for our blockchain. The idea here is to create a series of videos that address topics related to permaculture. I think it would be necessary for the proponent to better conceptualize what area of \u200b\u200bstudy this is, I did some research on the outside to understand what it is about, since I had never heard of the term. In short, it is something that relates to ecology and how society can organize itself in alternative ways. The proponent defines some subjects that would be addressed in the channel: \u201cEthics in Permaculture, Sustainable Design Principles, Blockchain solutions, sustainable practices, alternative societies, off-grid solutions\u201d. The problem is that the content seems to be much more about design, permaculture and sustainability than blockchain. It is unclear how the proponent will impart knowledge about Cardano, he says he will cite blockchain practices, but where would our blockchain specifically fit in here? When talking about this technology, the impression that is given is that the proponent would generally explain what it is about and focus on use cases. However, it is essential that the contents created make clear the specific characteristics of Cardano, what is the difference between our blockchain and the others, what are the advantages (even ecological) found in Cardano. I would like to know which exact topics would be covered on this, as there are several, from the most general (what is blockchain, what are cryptocurrencies, what is Cardano and etc) to the most specific (how to propose to Catalyst, which language of blockchain programming, such as programming for smart contracts and etc). The proponent even mentions what topics will be covered, but the quote is superficial, even though he has given the example of how he would explain what smart contracts are. Finally, my opinion is that it is not clear how Cardano will be portrayed in this channel, the percentage of videos that would be dedicated to our blockchain in relation to the other subjects mentioned, which specific subjects would be addressed, etc.; therefore, not much confidence is given in the impact of this proposal. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "We have a roadmap attached, but I thought the proponent should have explained the proposed activities for each period of weeks. He cites what will be done, but does not detail the activities. For example, in the first week, \u201cBuilding the team and forming alliances\u201d, how will this be done? We see in the part of the team presentation that he has already defined the professionals involved in the project, but in relation to alliances: with whom does he intend to try to establish them? And how will you make that contact? What exactly is he looking for with such alliances? As in this week, the others should be better explained, in week four, for example, the proponent intends, together with his team, to start producing the videos. How would this process take place? Which professionals would be involved in this part of the project, and what tasks would they perform exactly? The script is ok, but not deep enough for us to have a solid visualization of the process. Regarding the division of the budget, 35 thousand dollars are requested for the project, a value that I found quite expensive, because we don't know how many videos would be produced in total (I believe there are 24, since the project would last 12 weeks and the each of them 2 videos would be released, but this information would need to be confirmed). The way in which the money would be used, however, is well explained, we know well how the total would be distributed. The proponent explains this division into a few parts and within those parts he even delimits what exactly the expenses would be, for example, for \u201cVideo Production Equipment: $9,500\u201d the expenses would specifically be for the rental of \u201cA-cam: Body of 4K Full-Frame camera, a set of 2 lenses (prime and zoom), a more economically priced B-Cam, professional-grade 3-point lighting system, monitor-recorder, an A-cam filming rig and mounts tripods and miscellaneous equipment\u201d. My suggestion that would serve to further improve this part of the proposal would be for the proponent to say how much each of these pieces of equipment would cost to rent. If he specified how much each of the little things within those larger parts would cost, I think the budget explanation would be flawless. However, it's still good the way it is. Finally, analyzing the team, I think this part was superficial as well as the script, because all we know are the names of the team members and also the roles that they would be assigned. However, more detail is necessary, such as, for example: to know a little about their previous experiences, in other words, the curriculum of each one. Where did they study, where did they work before? it would also be very important for us to know if they have any previous experience with Cardano, we know that Vinay Deva is an expert in blockchain, but is it specialized in our blockchain or another? Anyway, more details should have been provided about the team. In summary, my opinion is that only the budget is well explained, with both the script and the team needing more details. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I believe that the proponent already has a good idea of \u200b\u200bhow the auditability of this project would be possible. Regarding the development process, he divides this analysis into 3 parts, explaining what would have to be monitored in each. I think the explanations are about both the tasks to be performed (such as going after equipment rental) and the small goals (partial results) to be achieved, as in phase 3: \u201cpromote the content to maximum reach\u201d . The question here would only be how to make so much information within easy and practical reach of the entire Cardano community. Will any online document sharing tool be used, such as Notion, Miro or Google Docs? Could it be that at the end of each of the aforementioned phases, the proponent and his team would prepare a report, gathering the main information, advances and difficulties encountered in that period of time? It is necessary that such a report be produced (it can be written, or recorded, it is at the team's discretion) and that it be freely available for any members of our community to have access to it and be able to exercise auditability in a constant and safe way. The ideal would be for someone who understands sustainability/permaculture to audit the project and maintain contact with the Cardano community, this would make the auditability process more practical and simple. Regarding the final results, I also think the proponent suggests very good ways to monitor the results, both quantitatively (e.g. he aims for the channel to \u201cGet 1000+ YouTube subscribers with 4000+ watch hours\u201d) and qualitatively (Establish a similar presence on at least 3 other social media channels and 1 other video sharing platform for maximum reach). I think that a direct survey could be carried out with the channel's subscribers, with the objective of understanding how they are using the knowledge that was acquired with the hours watched on the channel. In other words, in what ways are they getting involved with the blockchain universe, if they have become active members of the community and if so, in what way, in what activities of the Cardano ecosystem they are currently involved and etc. All information collected in this final phase should also be easily accessible to members of the Cardano community, as I also suggested in the partial results part, on any of the various communication platforms available. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 7, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "There is a strong educational component to this proposal, and it seeks to explore similarities between the cardano ecosystem and the real world ecosystem, its excellent in this regard. \nThere is a real opportunity here to collaborate with the decentralized media producers as well as blockchain educators.
