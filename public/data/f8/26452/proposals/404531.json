The ability to tell a story about a group of people is way easier than to pin Cardano down, and yet there should still be ample room in the documentary to drape the landscape with a living vision of Cardano and the opportunities it is affording people in Ghana.  At 30 minutes I think the length is just right, not so long that you have trouble with viewer retention, but long enough that the story can open up and have room to breathe.  On top of the Ghana work, there is a real story in the background, about the people of WADA itself, and I could see this having a teaser format where we follow the work of people on the ground making a difference in Ghana, while drilling into the under current of Cardano as a reality altering phenomenon, then pull back on the way out of the story to highlight the network impact effects, in the character of the WADA reps and their overall connection to the Catalyst community, a net of helping hands, growing ever wider....

The lead proposer's experience with documentaries should shine trough here (and do yourself a favor and check out his ultrasharp post processing on his website link...beautiful), and his knowledge of the WADA team through the adatruth project should generate the bandwidth needed to deliver the project.  By already collecting film they are actively mitigating maybe the biggest concern, the logistical issue of getting the footage to work with.  The timeline they have laid out is crystal clear, putting everything in order to have a release of the film in midfall.  I really appreciate them taking the time and resources with this budget to add multilingual support, especially since it is support for the very locals who will be the subjects of the documentary.  All in all this project doesn't look like it can go wrong.  There is a possible issue in that it is not clear that the proposer lead, who I believe is the driving force on this project, is going to be doing the actual filming, but instead managing the project from afar, and then digging into it in his studio in Prague.  They made a point of noting the surfeit of talented people around the project, and I think this is a nod to that factor.  I worry he may not know of something specific he wants until it is to late to have it, but I also believe that in a story that won't be able to avoid underlying themes of the power of networks, it is probably ok to lean into the principle in the first place.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The knowledge of craft shines through here, as they keep their eye on the goal (release in October) while noting the requirements to stay up to date on progress reporting in order to keep the funding flowing.

The proposal presented to achieve this goal is clear and straightforward with a very positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem. The problem statement which looks at the awareness of the WADA project is low, despite the outstanding work the WADA organisation is doing in Africa strongly defines the problem in this challenge category and needs a solution to that. We are to note that the optimal aim of the Film and Media challenge is to boost knowledge and adoption of Cardano for the global audience and am happy to find out that this proposal seeks to help achieve that. The key performance indicators that show the overall long term performance of the project can very well be identified in the proposal and adheres to the challenge setting key performance indicators.

Leveraging the WADA network of resources will also contribute to achieving the expected outcome with a pool of good human and technical resources. One of the core reasons for the launch of this challenge is the establishment of a project that spotlight the multitude of stories within the Cardano ecosystem and that is the exact mission this project intends to achieve. The total budget looks reasonable and clear with a view of the detailed budget breakdown. I will like to urge the team to ensure good accountability of funds to ensure the going concern of the project.

Documentaries that tell significant and frequently unheard tales raise awareness among a larger number of people and are often the best sources of knowledge, creativity, and entertainment. The Wada documentary setting appears to provide a pretty good insight into the lack of awareness of WADA projects in Africa, given the overwhelming contribution the organization has made. The issue is intertwined with the WADA project's awareness. The ideal goal of the Film and Media challenge is to increase global awareness and acceptance of Cardano through art, drama, and film creation, and it's intriguing that this proposal aims to help with that goal. Because awareness of WADA projects is limited, the proposer stated that they will use a documentary on WADA's journey to describe the organization's projects and accomplishments in Africa.

The plan appears to be quite feasible and is divided into three stages: production, postproduction, and distribution. Using the WADA network of resources will also help to achieve the desired result by providing a pool of qualified human and technical resources. The main goal of this proposal is to create a project that would highlight the many different tales that exist inside the Cardano ecosystem, and that is exactly what this project will do. The proposal outlined specific steps for completing the project. The budget appears to be reasonable and well-allocated, with a hint of detail. The main obstacle or risk of the project implementation, according to the proposer, is contacting people on the ground in Africa and developing a sustainable workflow that is suitable for all parties involved. Contacting people should not be a problem, but the method of contact and the response rate should be examples of potential concerns.

According to Charles Hoskinson, Africa is a continent with vast amounts of resources, however with difficult access to them, due to difficult centralized systems. Cardano could leverage and improve economic growth of this region through technological implementation. The WADA project is a resource network for unlocking the potential of Africa, with Distributed Ledger Technology, AI, and Automation. Through the creation and production of a documentary about WADA, this proposal not only assesses the main objectives of this challenge, but also enhances and motivates the educational mission and vision of Cardano as a blockchain, by bringing Web3 resources for regions with less opportunity. It is also crucial to consider that individuals who do not interact with technological devices, need the implementation of educational tools with understandable and easy language to absorb. A 30min documentary is long enough to introduce and raise awareness about the opportunities that Cardano and Catalyst Project provide as a blockchain. WADA has already been connecting people all over Africa to IT, promoting Cardano as a blockchain throughout different projects as: wada.org and Afrixx CNFTs. This in my opinion, offers credibility of the impact and set of objectives that this proposal intends to achieve to add value to the Cardano ecosystem and regions (Africa) with less opportunities. \nScore given: 5\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "FEASIBILITY:\nMost of proposers involved in the film documentary, provide valid professional evidence. However, Afia Owusu (The WADA West African Lead) has not updated her social media links. Her Cardanoideascale account only mentions that she is an entrepreneur and community manager. It would be ideal that all members of the proposal offer working references links, to show more credibility and professionalism within the project. On the other hand, I like the idea of the proactive work that the team has already been doing by gathering on-the-ground footage (interviews, photos, and film shots). I would like to see some of those files attached to this proposal, that would provide a plus on the auditability area evaluation. The requested budget looks organized and clear. They offer amount cost for each procedure in broken down identifiable items. The proposers also provide a road map where they specify the working process expected by the end of each month (from May-October 2022). It is important to understand each film stage, and the team describes what it would occur during the production, postproduction, and distribution of the film content in a summarized version. I believe that the month working process break down established in the road map, shows a reasonable time to achieve to set the goals for this documentary. Finally, the proposers also explain some technicality aspects involved, such as: the postproduction studio based in Prague (for the editing, sound design, voice over and final mastering) of the film. These logistics opportunities explain why the amount they are requesting for the funds (15000 USD) are relatively cheaper than most documentary production flat costs. \nScore given: 4", "q1r": 4, "q2": "AUDITIBILITY:\nThe information provided by the team members including: Previous working references, past collaboration in Cardano, the vision and documentary goals, budget and break down of the items involved, roadmap and film expectations, are considered in my opinion, valid to audit the progress and success of this proposal. They also mention that the documentary progress will be measured based on the timeline outlined on this proposal (which are properly described, broken down into phases, and monthly deadline expectations). It would be appropriate to add the list of social media platforms they are planning to utilize for the advertisement and film engagement (besides the WADA official website I am assuming), as future references, and early film adoption. Another aspect to take into consideration at the distribution stage is, the potential specialists or organization name, which will qualify for the massive film production phase. I also agree with the language content diversity the team is considering for the future film reproduction. English, as mentioned, is the predominant second language most spoken in African countries, but West and Central Africa are highly French dominant. This makes the film, an educational and versatile cultural tool for Cardano new adopters and crypto enthusiasts. The WADA team also describes there is a mix of bilingual members and professional translators to make this language introduction feasible for the film project. As a last opinion, it would be interesting to list some more metrics, in terms of tangible progress verification (such as: Excel spreadsheets, online repository publicly available, or social media files attached), as they mention on the clarity plan (by marking milestones to see the progress along the way). Overall, the proposers offer a clear explanation of how they will periodically report the progress of the film and future success in their road map and postproduction phase. \nScore given: 4\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1557", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5565, "q0": "The goals of this proposal is to make a 30 minutes documentary about WADA - another group of Catalyst proposer, that in this project are described as \u201c a resource sharing network connecting people all over Africa and the Diaspora to IT, human, and financial resources to make dreams come true\u201d.

With good storytelling and strong visuals, WADA and Cardano could mutually benefit from the successful production of this 30 min. documentary.

However, and not to be too pedantic, but 'Pre-production' is one of the '3 P's' (Pre/Production/Post), and should also be put into the roadmap (it is here, as part of 'Production' in a sense), but, good pre-production will lead to more successful execution in the production phase, and always should be included. One thing I miss is a 'pitch formulation', one that gives us a direct, visual sense of the 'story' and storytelling abilities of the film maker! Otherwise, the proposal is well structured, and gives a good sense of the necessary processes involved in a project of this nature. The inclusion of a French language version is important, and I could see followup funding proposals to cover other languages if the production's success warrants that. As evidenced from the links provided, the principal film maker/director is very competent visually and in terms of editing. I could not access (as it was not available 'in my area') some of the films in the Bio page of the filmmaker, but given the successful procurement of local film talent in Cameroon and Ghana, I feel confident that the proposed film will come to fruition under his direction. The WADA members on the team are crucial to the success of the project, and are all strong Cardano community members as well as gate-keepers to the Czech director. When it comes to distribution, YouTube is of course widely used.  Vimeo is a more professional moving image platform, and could be leveraged as well.
