The media artifacts will be professionally designed short clips for target groups that act as DLT/Blockchain/WEB3.0 and Metaverse primers for the businesses they consult.  As media creations, and employing creatives in the Cardano space, this proposal lines up well with the challenge.  Where I think it is less in alignment is the decentralizing priorities, as this really goes into a silo at DLT360, with only more investment if one wants to keep them up to date.  There also is the question of immediate impact, but this can be understood as a long-tail effect:  it is doubtful, no matter how cool these clips turn out, that they are going to go viral and onboard a lot of curious onlookers.  These are slow burn, they are for influencing C-suites.  And when C-suites are influenced, then product and service teams are influenced.  And when these teams are influenced, shareholders are influenced, and depending on what you do in life, that is probably the point where you start to feel the effects of this.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has done a very professional and fantastic job laying out their process here.  Not only do we get a clear roadmap and timeline for the deliverables of this proposal, we get a high level integration and overlap for how this project fits into the DLT360 universe, and some teasers about the project almost being ready to go from walking to running (it certainly doesn't seem to be crawling anymore).  The thing I found most useful, just in terms of orienting me to their vision was the section entitled: \"Why are we doing all this?\"  I really like seeing purpose driven statements from enterprises (especially when they are throwing out an ionstorm of C-speak, like DLT360 is here) and this one not only helped me see the angle they were coming from, but to appreciate a bit more the role that their service can bring to my use and enjoyment of the Cardano ecosystem.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As always, DLT360's audit reports are the absolute Cadillac of Catalyst reporting.  There is nothing that can be added here, but I do encourage any proposer or prospective proposer (or even any CA who struggles to parse auditability) to give the auditability section here a good looking over:  buried in the lede here is \"why\" the section exists, to isolate the impact, and to show a path which can be seen and not just felt that leads to a finalized, deliverable project.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 4, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "DLT/Blockchain, WEB3.0 and Metaverse potential are still poorly understood due to poor communication.

In addition, the required budget is explained in a coherent and reasonable manner for each budget to be allocated.

This proposal is judged partly through its individual merits, and partly through the way it fits into the wider DLT360 project. My assessment takes into account aspects common across all proposals (team specific like adequacy, competency, workload, or similar reporting mechanisms / budget logic). You shall therefore find common parts across these proposals (labeled as such) and parts specific to each proposal, which should offer a good balance of looking at each tree but not missing out the overall health of the forest. \n\nSpecific part: This proposal aims to create targeted video clips covering DLT / Blockchain, WEB 3.0 and Metaverse in general, showing the potential in economy and industry and highlighting specific examples.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "COMMON part: Great team. DLT360 is operated by an outstanding and growing team of regulatory experts, very active in the Cardano community. They also benefit from a scalable network of contributors from the Cardano community, academia, industry and EU institutions. In terms of team competence, skills and experience, they are well positioned.The multitude of projects funded under their umbrella showcases the great capacity to identify opportunities within the Cardano community and clearly articulate them into actionable projects. \n\nCOMMON part: Significant existing and future workload. DLT360 is a wider project initially funded in Fund6, and greatly supported by at least 5 proposals in Fund7, for a total funding so far of 85.000 USD (own calculations), many of them being still ongoing. During Fund8 the team is casting a very wide net with 13 additional proposals across several challenges, for a total funding of 295.000 USD. Onboarding so many projects so quickly can potentially lead to: too much workload, overlapping deadlines, increased risks of under-delivering, inability to distinguish added value of one project versus another, unnecessary stress and a lack of focus on and core scope and competencies. Future iterations that can bring comfort to these worries will of course be highly appreciated. \n\nCOMMON part: ALL of the 13 projects have overhead items included in the budget (project management, social media, back office, etc.) consuming an overall 30-40% of each budget (an educated guess let\u2019s call it). I think there was a missed opportunity there in terms of gathering all overheads under one roof and simplifying the budgets for all proposals by keeping them strict for core-activities.\n\nSpecific part: Video production covers 50% of the budget and analyzing Fund 7 presentation kit and writing the overall plot would cover 20%. For budget core-work rates are 50 USD/hour.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "COMMON part: Existing track record. DLT360 projects are interlinked and since there are a number of running projects the team is definitely familiarized with the standard procedures and reporting process of the Catalyst team, so there are very low risks in terms of failing to communicate properly or inability to implement the necessary KPIs. \n\nCOMMON part: The website is a great opportunity for improvement. A concern is the fact that glancing at the DLT360 website, there is no reflection of recent live presentations that were perhaps delivered to the community in Q1 2022. I am aware that it is a work in progress tool, and a very nice-to-have feature would be for such live presentations / slides / supporting materials to be uploaded there as soon as possible and be accessible for the community as an intermediate deliverable until the projects are finalized. Also for the sake of transparency, a user-friendly list of funded (any why not unfunded) proposals would definitely be appreciated, at least by future CAs. \n \nSpecific part: basic KPIs are presented: number of views, number of partners, ratings.

This is very clear and aligned with the challenge questions. The given solution is to build videos and presentations focused on their target audience. Very nice.\n\nHowever, Although the proponent asserts that there is no specific challenges and risks, I find it challenging to break down the DLT360 project into different components and submit it to many different challenges because most likely one of these proposals were not funded.
