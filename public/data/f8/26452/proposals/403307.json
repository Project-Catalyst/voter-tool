The art produced for shlomocohen's Hoskintoons cNFT project is ridiculously  vibrant and detailed, and the chance to see some thematic idea from a Hoskinson AMA or deep thoughts at 2am vid are simply too good to pass up.  Images like that, which I'm guessing will be \"Cardano and systems that change the world for the better\" -centric, have a real chance to exhibit viral behavior, and with Cohen's history in print, could easily be syndicated for even wider circulation if a paper ever picked up a story on Cardano.  Beautiful visual art based around Cardano definitely engages the challenge metrics, with a talented creative onboard wanting to extend their Cardano outreach.  As a marketing effort, I have to wonder just how many outside of Cardano's inner circle will hear or care about such a project, but there is only one way to find out, and at this price, the art is a steal.  Oh, but he needs a totally new name for this thing...flood his inbox people, get some ideas out there.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is no doubting the artistic talent, and seeing the dedication to the Hoskintoon's cNFT drop (5000+ hours, and it shows) indicates this guy ain't lying when he says he really digs Charles' message.  The planned release of 1 graphic per week is ideal...plenty of time to get it right, not so slow that interest can wane.  The budget looks fine, plenty for 3 months of legit marketing, the rate per graphic is screamingly low.  You aren't going to find any problems with this rollout plan.  I also appreciate that they are looking at the long game before the rollout to see if there is any cNFT synergies that can be realized to give the project some longer term sustainability.

The fact of using the medium of the caricature could for example make it possible to reach a different public, This could perhaps even expand later on caricatures beyond the videos of Charles and be an opportunity to bring another dimension for the atmosphere in the community ? The same is true for the link between the challenge and this initiative, which could have been developed a little more. We do not need to convince people already convinced by the benefits of art, but what about people who are foreign to this medium?
