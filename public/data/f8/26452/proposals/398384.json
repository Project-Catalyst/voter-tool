Goodwall is solving this by eliminating the barriers with the use of a well designed mobile application which brings years of combined expertise in accordance with Youth Council members to continuously forge new paths of direction in order to deliver the proper education and knowledge needed. This Impact on the entire Cardano ecosystem is beyond crucial for the future generational growth. It's clearly articulated by the proposer that this group of Goodwall members will be given incentive to share their blockchain experiences which \"include monetary prizes, access to further blockchain education courses, mentorships, etc.\" The proposer understands raising a child takes a village, and a strong Global village within Goodwall is a sure fire way of producing, collecting and analyzing the most useful information useful to those without prior knowledge of the ecosystem that is Cardano. In doing so, the proposer emphasizes the multilingual teams from around the world to diversify and maximize the impact to a scale not scene thus far in blockchain education. With already 2 million members on the Goodwall mobile app, key objectives from the proposer for 1 million impressions, 30k engagements over a course of 2,000 video entries from users that clearly demonstrate Cardano technology use-case solutions is very likely to not only impact the existing user base, but for future adoption into the community. Scaling up the amount of users to Goodwall, there's a clear indication from the proposer that solving the problems of communication, or lack there of is of the utmost importance to ensure all the content presented is peer reviewed by community managers to allow for quality content for the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Diving further into the member's expertise, with a combined 40+ years experience, and an already engaging, successful launch of the Goodwall application, it's clear the proposer has presented a well established team to accomplish the goals set forth within the timeline. The shared Linkedin profiles of each member is a clear indication of professionalism and diversity within the team's overall goals in mind; communication of Cardano technical aspects as well as educational content for it's user base to learn and grow within the ecosystem of blockchain on a global scale. With each member having more than 500+ connections, the source of knowledge and experience is perhaps the best established group of individuals presented to Project Catalyst. The proposer has given a series of detailed solutions to stay on course throughout the timeline in an identifiable manner in which all items can reasonably be completed and any outsourced materials that might present themselves in the future of the program; user based submissions and verifiable content reviewed. Having such a diverse team from a multilingual standpoint, this proposal clearly has a team capable of producing excellent results from the funding provided by PC in hopes to help motivate and excite the next generation of young entrepreneurs and like-minded individuals coming to Cardano.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer has implemented the proper links and tools which will be used to measure the KPI/Metrics of the problem solution with the use of Google.docs to have a clear and public report of what's to be accomplished within the proposal's milestones. Having the application data available, it's easy to see the Impressions from it's user's and scale the demand of engagements while video/photo of program submissions are being made. All of which proposed in the timeline can be seen by Project Catalyst members to follow the progress of the team's challenge all in one place. With a targeted response from the community engagements, a minimum of 2,000 entries are being monitored and reviewed to successful apply these experiences to mobile app for the new youth of tomorrow to learn and grow from others. These publicly shared documents will be the tool needed to assess the milestones presented from an identifiable means to measure the proposals overall goals to solving the problem, ensuring the growth of the Cardano ecosystem as well as future members young and old.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1529", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 7333, "q0": "I really liked the idea and I think it fits very well with the specific objectives of the challenge. Here, we are proposing that media content (videos, photos, audio, etc.) be created on Cardano, and that this content circulate on different platforms that escape from places where Cardano already has a good circulation of content and a good audience, such as for example , youtube. The idea is that, with content circulating through new platforms, new audiences are reached, thus increasing the expansion capacity of the Cardano ecosystem. This proposal is about a platform called Goodwall, which is focused on young audiences and educational content, from what I understand. The advantage here is precisely that, in addition to posting videos, this platform has some different features from youtube itself. This can be seen through the excerpt: \u201cA constant dialogue and feedback collection is carried out through a number of means, such as: dialogue with the Goodwall Student Council, a group formed entirely by young people that has an advisory and consultative role in the Goodwall's governance and strategy; ii) regular communication between Goodwall's Community Management Team and young users of the platform through chats, pages and posts; iii) focus groups held regularly and composed in order to provide a representative sample of the target audience; and iv) post-program surveys to assess performance and impact achieved\u201d. I confess that, the first moment I read the proposal, I thought: what's the point of releasing videos about Cardano on a platform that is much less known than youtube? However, when I got to know these features, I was convinced that it can be an impactful initiative, as this bridge and communication between the users of the application is the differential in relation to youtube. I also think that the project fits well with the objectives of the challenge because the proponent explains that young people would be encouraged to create and submit content of their own creation on blockchain; this is very positive because I believe it can generate a boom in relation to the subject, due to the fact that this content would be encouraged through prizes, financial rewards or access to more educational content. I think it's a great way to captivate this target audience to learn and mobilize in relation to the cause, after all, everyone likes to receive these rewards, let alone if they are in cash. Another positive point that I see in this proposal is that the proponent is very aware of the possible problems that he will face during the project, and already proposes solutions for this, which demonstrates a lot of maturity and planning. The only negative point I found here is that the proponent does not say exactly what topics within the blockchain universe would be addressed, in what order and why, if this were said, it would generate a more solid understanding of what will be created here in the future. Other than that, I think the idea is very good, and deserves to be carefully evaluated for possible funding. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Regarding the script, I think this part is well executed, but it could be even more detailed. For example, about program preparation, we know that this would involve the following activities: User Journey Design + Promotional Asset Design + Video Shooting and Editing Challenge + Education Series Video Shooting and Editing + Education Series Video Shooting and Editing Speaker Session Videos + Landing Page Design. We also know that all of them would result in a total time of 8 to 12 weeks to start, develop and finish. However, the information could be passed on more precisely here. For example, we could know how long each of these activities would take, exactly (or approximately) to develop. Let's see, user journey design, how long does the team intend to work on this? And what exactly would that user journey be? It would be positive if, in addition to a more precise time determination, the proponent attached a short explanation about these parts, because this way we would understand more accurately each step of the process and this would result in a better understanding of the whole. Now speaking of the budget, something similar happens. The total amount is divided into a few parts, but these parts are gates of many other small parts. Let's exemplify to make it clearer: \u201cCreation of Program Material - Creation of promotional and non-promotional assets - social media, videos, landing page, content, profiles, newsletter, etc: $3785\u201d. How much would go towards creating promotional and non-promotional assets? What would these assets be? What social media would be used to publicize the materials created? How much money would go to the newsletter? I think each of these parts could be better detailed, because we know the value that will encompass all these parts of the project, but we don't know what each one individually would take in relation to this larger piece. I believe that both the script and the budget are good, but they could be better if they were more specifically detailed. Finally, in relation to the team, I think this part is excellent. We know a lot of information about each member of the team: their names, professional roles, previous experiences and the responsibility they would have, exactly, in this project. I think this is all very essential so that we have a solid view of who we are dealing with, generally in the proposals the proponent only informs the name and previous experiences of those involved, and in this we also have the definition of the exact role that each one would play in this project, which gives us a very deep understanding of how this team works. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proponent suggests 3 ways we could track the development of the project: impressions, engagement, and challenge submissions. I think they are really good indicators to see how this project is developing in practice, but it is not clear how this information would be accessible to the Cardano community. In my opinion, it would be interesting if the team carried out a monthly survey on these variables and made the survey results available to the Cardano community, through any of our various communication channels, such as telegram or discord channels, in meeting rooms. debate after Town Hall and etc. It is up to the team to choose the most appropriate means of communication to convey this message. It would also be important, in my view, for us to know how their work routine was being developed, that is, did everyone manage to fulfill the tasks planned that month? Did everyone work the hours (hours) that were agreed? If there were problems and/or delays, how can these be overcome and compensated? In addition to understanding the achievement of partial results, it is also necessary to monitor the tasks that are being carried out so that such results are achieved. Now talking about the success scenario, in other words, the final results, I think this part of the proposal turned out great because the proposer gives us numerical data that would be used to measure success: \u201c1 million impressions + 30,000 appointments + 2,000 entries challenge\u201d, and also qualitative. It would be important for the proponent and his team to seek to understand how these young people who had access to the created content got involved with Cardano, if they followed their studies in the blockchain area; it would also be super interesting if some of the content generated by them were shown in Town Hall, because then we would see with our own eyes the fruits of this initiative. Finally, I would like the proponent to carry out a qualitative research on the results of the project, which would allow us to understand beyond numbers how this has all impacted young people and also the Cardano ecosystem, if we actually have new active members and how they relate to our ecosystem. This data could be presented at a Town Hall meeting, as well as a small snippet of content produced by young people, as I suggested above. I think the auditability is almost perfect, it just lacked a little detail. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 10730, "q0": "This Proposal is novel in F8: Film + Media (FAM) creatives unite Challenge. The proposal wants to create a playground, a starting point for young people worldwide to know and start their journey with blockchain. The proposal leverages Goodwall, a large work and education platform with 2 million members across 150 countries. The project team has a lot of experience in creating Programs on Goodwall. The proposal wants to make a Program/Challenge on Goodwall to introduce Cardano. I believe Proposal if implemented in practice, will have a positive impact on Cardano.\n\nThe proposal provides key targets (1 million impressions, 30,000 engagements, 2,000 challenge entries). In the Marketing industry, there is a concept of conversion rate, assuming this rate is 10% - 20% (depending on industry); I believe from 30,000 engagements, there will be 3,000 - 6,000 people interested and learning about Cardano. A percentage of people ( in 3000-6000 people above) will join the Cardano ecosystem (search for career opportunities, join Catalyst, write proposals, become a CA... for example). For a proposal, these numbers are a positive result.\n\nI searched the keyword Cardano and the names of a few other blockchains on Goodwall, but there is no such content. So, if Cardano is the first blockchain to be introduced on Goodwall, it will make an excellent first impression in the hearts of the young, future generation of the country. I believe the proposal is suitable for Challenge, and the main goals are ideal for Challenge settings", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the roadmap, the Proposal provides a plan consisting of 3 main stages, each of which explicitly lists each job with actual time to complete. Looking at the roadmap, I know what the project team does, one by one. I find the proposal to provide a good roadmap. However, I would expect the roadmap to list more videos the team plans to make, for example:\n\n- Challenge videos: 5\n\n- Educational series: 6\n\n- Speaker session videos: 4\n\nRegarding Budget, the proposer fully lists each item. Looking at your presentation, I believe your team has a lot of experience implementing such Programs. However, to be better, in some Budget sections, the proposer should list in more detail, for example:\n\n- the proposal's plan: make 4 Speaker session videos,\n\n- Speaker salary for one video (assuming the video is 30 minutes long): $300\n\n=> Speaker salary: $300 * 4 videos = $1200\n\nThis specific presentation will make it easier for the community to assess the reasonableness of the Budget items, thereby determining whether the proposal has enough funding to accomplish the goal.\n\nRegarding the Team, the proposal has a strong team; each member has responsibilities in each specific job. All members have Linkedin links for community reference. I believe the team has enough skills and experience to complete the proposal.\n\nThe Proposal has a complete list of associated challenges/risks, with a resolution for each challenge/risk. I find these workarounds reasonably doable. The team's risk management skills are good; I appreciate this.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The metrics/KPIs that define Proposal's success are obvious. The Proposal clearly describes, without ambiguity, the definition of KPIs (Impressions, Engagement, Challenge Entries). \n\nIn addition, the Proposal has a professional report upon the completion of the project. I have seen the sample report that the team did before; it is detailed and precise. In addition, Proposal provides a Google form for the community with recorded information and documents. I appreciate this willingness and transparency.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_998", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 643, "q0": "When it comes to diverse, decentralized growth networks, it is a fundamental truth (whether network participants recognize it or not) that education and learning nodes are the first things to grow in sustainable ways.  So it says something when an already well established network participant boasting millions of proven members steps into a new role and relationship and says \"Lets start with education\".  That indicates to me that the team behind the initiative \"gets it,\" and in this case, that is the Goodwall team.  If you aren't familiar with Goodwall, it is sort of like a LinkedIn that prioritizes early growth and opportunity, and thus focuses exclusively on young people (think: students, graduates).  What they are proposing to do here is to leverage that worldwide youth community to create a library of content revolving around their learning, experiences and ideas within the Cardano ecosystem.  There is really too much to describe in terms of how this looks, so I encourage voters to check out the project they recently conducted centered around youth opportunity in Ghana (https://youthshapeghana.goodwall.io) to get a feel for what a Cardano program could look like.  And keep in mind that the Ghana effort reached over 4.2 million people.  A LOT of that engagement revolved around entrepreneurship, which translates to a LOT of Project Catalyst engagement, especially proposals.  On top of creation of a ton of emergent onboarding material and the actual onboarding of what could be a huge cohort of proposers, there is also the additional scaling potential of Goodwall adopting Cardano to build out DAO style governance for its in house and community driven protocols around things like program selection, which could additionally serve as a model for many of its member to adopt their own approaches to DAOs...  All in all this proposal seems like the tip of an incredibly robust opportunity, that is a direct hit on decentralized media generation.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind the proposal is well equipped and backed with tools and resources.  With a recently completed program that can only be described as spectacularly successful, the chance to execute a Cardano program is very easy to envision.  They are extensively staffed, with every major role you could imagine for a project like this:  there are leads for marketing, social, design and more.  The budget is surprisingly reasonable for the proposal, but it makes sense as the team is salaried and supported by Goodwall, so the requested funds are all targeted at the specifics of running the new program itself.  The timeline they provide looks identical to their Ghana project, with an implementation phase that is a bit shorter at 3 months, and then a full four months for the \"challenges\" to run, with a month or so to gather up and do a retrospective on the results.  I would advise the proposal team to maintain close communication with Project Catalyst during the design period, as the Goodwall challenges and the Catalyst challenges could be in-sync and perhaps even both taking cues from the other in their categorization and design.  Each of these phases is characterized by 4-6 steps that follow-on logically from eachother, and plot a course to completion that is easy to visualize.  They do a fantastic job of mapping the basic risk management of the project in a professional way, but special attention needs to be paid to the \"Fake news\" risk.  Cardano FUD will likely be the most significant deleterious behavior that is faced by the program, so a robust approach to respectful community guidelines (which appears to be in place on Goodwall) as well as a solid base of factual resources for their moderators to rely on for \"fact checking\" the FUD will be critical.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The plan is well laid out and should be easy to track.  The early portion of the project will be harder to track than the latter, and will consist of updates regarding design deliveries for the program (landing page, protocols, etc) along with creation of the challenge videos and education materials.  As noted above, it would be good to include a deliverable of the resources that will be the basis of \"fact checks\" in the community (especially if they wish to get good feedback on the resource before leaning on it).  Once the challenge portion of the program begins (and in the marketing leading up to it) the team plans to track the number of times the Cardano educational (etc) resources are posted amongst their community (impressions), the number of likes/comments that those impressions drive (engagements) and the participation in the challenge protocols they design (entries).
