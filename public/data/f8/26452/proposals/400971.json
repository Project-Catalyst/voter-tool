As we know, English is the number one predominant language for blockchain learning and cryptocurrency training. \nAccording to the latest United Nations Data, in 2020, Japan reaches the 11th place, based on the population ranking worldwide (125,715,982). This means that educational crypto resources are necessary to be implemented for this target audience. In this context, I agree with the proposed solution of creating a collection of master class videos that introduce blockchain and crypto fundamentals, showcasing Cardano. In addition, as the world\u2019s third largest digital asset, Cardano, has overcome Japanese regulations to finally launch on \u2018BitPoint\u2019 (Japan\u2019s digital asset trading platform) in 2021. This a great achievement for Cardano as a blockchain, and future growth as a cryptocurrency.\nOn the other hand, Japanese culture is very particular in terms of advertisement and crypto marketing. For instance, if we look at the social media content, Japanese ads are less functional, mainly focused on highlighting brands and names, comparing to the massive American marketing strategies. Japanese are more interested in laughter. They consider laughter one of the best marketing ingredients, and this is why many call Japan a \u2018creative culture\u2019. Based on this information, the idea of fun videos, combining real and animated individuals who cover blockchain fundamentals, could potentially generate positive interest between the Japanese community. \nMy concern would be the lack of key metrics or goals that the proposers are planning on implementing for this video proposal. I would like to see a more detailed description of the Cardano content for this proposal. Also, how this Japanese film is going to address future challenges if they team gets funded. We want to make sure that the creation of educational tools in different languages, are sustainable and scalable for future references and crypto educational growth.  \nScore given: 3", "q0r": 3, "q1": "FEASIBILITY:\nThe implementation and production of this proposal does not look clear in my opinion. The proposers break down the master video classes into 3 different phases: Planning, preparation, and video launch. However, I believe necessary to specify details about each phase, and how they are planning to accomplish the master video classes set goals by timelines. It is hard to measure how the process is going to be completed without a specific explanation of the procedures of creation, production, content selection and marketing strategies. In addition, even though they offer a detailed budget breakdown, it does not look clear to me how the budget is going to be distributed in some of the areas such: Talent (Who are the talent professional required for this proposal?), Make-up + style (Which make up tools this production include?), Camera (What type of camera it would be required for the videos production?), and copy (What does copy mean on this proposal?). \nWhen offering a budget break down, it is needed to be as specific and meticulous as possible. For funding proposal requests, the proposers need to provide a verifiable plan and fair budget for a better understanding of what is required, and for the effectiveness of the proposal.  \nOn the other hand, Joe Trubenstein and Brano Beres appear to be the proposers for this project. I am assuming one of them are also called \u2018Nick\u2019 (found on the team member details of this proposal). They provide their job and professional experience in a brief narrative way on the feasibility section. However, I consider important to add links and social media verification resources, where we can find additional professional and working references. This relevant skills and experience resources are needed to verify the correct implementation and success of a proposal. \nScore given: 1", "q1r": 1, "q2": "AUDITIBILITY: I do not find enough clarity on how this proposal is planning on assessing the Cardano master class video. I understand that the purpose is attracting the Japanese community by creating fun educational videos about Cardano. However, we first want to ensure the information provided on a proposal, is sufficient to audit the progress and success of it. As mentioned before, this proposal is lacking on the team professional links, previous work and experience references, clarity on the feasibility phases, and limited break down details of the video creation, production, and post-production process. The budget is also lacking information about some of the ergonomics and logistics cost, previously mentioned at the feasibility review. In addition, they offer a 12month milestone break down. But they do not specify how they will achieve their monthly goal. Instead, the team provide a brief and short title for each month. Within the 6 month time frame, the project expects to achieve a minimum of 5000 views. My question is: What are the marketing and advertisement strategies the team is planning on implementing to achieve this milestone? Do they have a channel or website with Cardano or crypto enthusiasts on it to base these significant expectations? In addition, they mention that within 12 months, they are expecting to reach 20, 000 views. That\u2019s a very optimistic number of views and online interaction, however, we want to make sure to offer reasonable milestones expectations based on identifiable measurable goals such as: social media active interaction, effective marketing and promotion strategies, experience video production, etc. In my opinion these video interaction expectations remain ambiguous, based on speculative assumptions.\nScore given: 1", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1557", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 716, "q0": "The proposer correctly identifies a problem which I personally find flabergasting:  why are the technologically innovative Japanese not a leading cohort in the adoption of Cardano.  I have heard many possible suggestions, but what the plausible ones all have in common is a cultural barrier of some type.  Without attempting to explain this paradox of qualifications vs adoption, this team suggests using their experience, in rebranding major products (porsche, fashion brands) for Japananese consumers, to reframe the Cardano/crypto onboarding conversation in a way that may just be able to bridge that divide.  Curious about what types of fare might make it across the gap, I spent some time watching Porsche commercials from Japan...but it was inconclusive.  It is a different kind of presentation than I am used to, no doubt, but if there is a secret sauce than I am not bright enough to see it.  Having said that, I still think the proposers may be on to something, and what I am sure of is that translation only begins with the language used, and it should also include cultural imagery and context, and if that is something they can bring to the conversation, by all means, they should take a shot.  If I have an issue here, it is the idea that the Japanese aren't perfectly capable of understanding the nuances of Cardano, and why wouldn't their own Japanese Cardano Ambassadors (of which there are many) not have had better luck making in-roads already.  Hand in hand with this is the idea that Cardano is most definitely not a \"brand\" but I am being forgiving with the proposer's use of the word.  \"Reframing\" is how I would prefer to describe it.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I would have liked to have seen either something the team had personally done, or at least a solid example of the phenomenon they are talking about, where a product is rebranded to cross the cultural divide, preferably a high tech one.  I don't doubt the phenomenon, I just would like to have an idea where this team is coming at it from.  I found the timeline interesting, as it opened with a large window for branding, where I thought they should start with filming, but the more I thought about it, yeah, the branding makes sense because they literally have to rebuild the content to suit the audience.  They don't indicate an expected length to be targeted for the film, so it is hard to parse the budget and come away with how adequate it might be, but I can say that it is a well distributed budget among the tasks.  It is a weird roadmap in that it doesn't clearly have the workflow for the actual filming part of the work, so it is hard to say if that is 6 months out or only 3, whether they classify the filming process as the \"launch\" part of the plan (which sounds like a release), or if it occurs before that.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Whether the filming begins 3 months in or 6, they start including the metrics for quantifying success (views pretty much) at month 9 and have set a target for 20,000 views by 12 months.  The early phase of rebranding and planning may be the hardest to track, maybe by creating a script as the deliverable and trying to fit it all in in the first month.  They had KPIs for the acquisition of equipment and the buildout and preparation of the studio.  They didn't include any KPIs for the filming phase and I am not sure just what format they will be filming under (a description of just what they meant by a Master Class video, format-wise, would have been helpful) but presumable they will have some kind of workflow document to track the progress.

The proposal is well aligned with the challenge setting, it matches the description of the campaign brief a lot. It could be questioned if it would fit better in the \"Grow east Asia\" challenge but this proposal aligns better with the \"Film + Media (FAM) creatives unite!\" challenge. \nA point to improve in the proposal is to explain more thoroughly about the content that will be produced.

In the feasibility section you should provide a detailed plan. In its current state, the all details are group into the first 3 months and nothing more of value is provided really. You could reduce the scope of this plan and only provide details for the first 3 (or 6) months. Things should also be split up into more concrete milestones each month. \nThe team is credible and described as experienced but an issue is the lack of evidence for knowledge within blockchains.

Eg. \nWe want to achieve a minimum of 5000 views within the 3 months following launch. \"We want to achieve a minimum of X views within the Y months following launch.\". Also consider adding KPI's for things such as likes, shares and other interactive elements.\nThe score will be neutral in this section (3 stars), the proposal has the fundamentals down but it needs refinement.
