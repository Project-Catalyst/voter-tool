First understand that the Checkpoint platform is extremely diverse, with a core platform of free digital magazines and a wider metaverse (also free) that connects up their properties, and the thing that ties these all together are a couple of basic ideas about community and the value of learning (thus a lot of material for kids), with an overlaid concept that games can be the \"medium\" within which all of this is explored.  Where it starts to get interesting is the platform's work to integrate Cardano, with a metaverse utility token (no real world value) and a governance token (sort of the way to buy into the company if you like what it is all about), as well as an extensive NFT program for use in the metaverse.  After all that, where this proposal comes in...is unclear, lol.  I think what it is asking for is the funding to develop its Learning cohort of materials.  Think of these as programs that schools will be able to sign up for, and, content-wise, think of it as an established model for teaching through video games.  What they need are actual educators to onboard and help them build this material, and then to get schools signed up to use it.  A detail hidden in the roadmap, is that this school onboarding makes up the VAST majority of the company's income growth projection, so it is understandable they desire to build this out.  The benefit of building it out, is that (outside advertising space, school program sales and the sale of the governance token, whose tokenomics I would classify as better than most) all of the content they offer, and a lot of it is geared to educating kids, is absolutely free, and this aspect is built into the governance of the company.  If someone were to invest in them (buy their governance token) and they grew as they expect to, that would mean lots and lots of schools onboarding their program (value of the governance token increases), and lots and lots of kids and their parents onboarded into their educational metaverse (adoption of Cardano increases).  For Cardano growth, 5 stars, for tenuous challenge setting alignment (video games are absolutely within the challenge parameters, IMO, but the development of the school programs and onboarding of teachers isn't well described in those terms) 3 Stars.  I'm splitting the difference.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The budget was surprisingly low, which is part of why I settled on the proposal being specifically about the educational cohort.  The other part was the actual content of the budget which didn't seem to have any development related expenses in it.  The main concern, as far as assessment goes here, is the creation of the teacher lesson and how it integrates with the teacher onboarding.  This part of the process is where the project syncs up with the challenge setting, so sussing it out is important.  I am assuming that the lessons they create are actually video games, with a component, either a backend or frontend that interacts with the metaverse.  Because this is what the company does, I don't find it odd that it isn't in the budget.  But it would have been helpful, if somewhere the team had mentioned that the purpose here was to onboard teachers to help them make their educational video games \"school ready\".  The only issue I have is that this isn't clearly stated.  Instead the header tells us this is about integration to the Cardano blockchain, the audit tells us this is about video game advertising and a crypto version of their magazines, the impact tells us they will run editorial pieces (on Cardano presumably?) across their magazines, and the budget tells us they will onboard teachers.  They will onboard teachers with this proposal, is my analysis.  Yes, they will do all the rest to, but not under the scope of the proposal.  With that in mind, I believe the team is up to the task, and that they will be able to successfully onboard the teachers.  Whether they will gain widespread adoption in schools (or among homeschoolers), there is no way to know.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditing the process of creating the video lessons should probably be no problem:  track the onboarding of teachers, the lesson development (I assume they can be tracked with something like Agile, or any other software workflow).  The rollout to schools can be tracked by noting the commits from schools, the number of teachers trained (would be nice to have a description of how they see the rolling onboarding process going, as it is hinted at in the budget).  The one audit point they note that is relevant might be the people onboarded to the checkpoint platform, but, as to the impact of this proposal, they should probably add how many schools actually get signed up, since the growth of Checkpoint can come from so many sources, you want an idea of how much this project helped.  They will also want to maybe get some mentorship for the IOG auditing process...on the one hand, the overall platform and roadmap make me think they have the organizational strengths to fulfill audit requirements easily, but the state of the proposal kind of makes me wonder.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 9, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1020, "q0": "The problems proposed by the proposal are impractical and confusing.\nThe method of solving the problem is not clear.\nI think this proposal does not help solve any of the problems that the FAM challenge presents.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Information about members in the project is detailed but there is no reference source.
