However I can't leave the statement of value with just its current film alignment, as it also offers strong value for its auditability traits as well, particularly the ability to capture some of the hard to measure ROI that many funded projects achieve, yet struggle to prove.  These qualitative aspects of funded projects hold back the adoption of some ideas that could be extremely beneficial, so the ability to experiment with media functionality to express those more human aspects of Cardano's impact is definitely a welcome addition to the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is experienced with the role it is pursuing in the auditing community, having been funded previously to begin the support work that this proposal is being submitted to continue.  The team also has the support of the WADA team and community, and will be relying on the WADA led funded proposers community to iterate and experiment on the template that they are seeking to deliver.  Indeed, they fully expect to already be collecting feedback on the process of testing the templates before this fund is even finished, which should allow them to hit the ground running.  The funding being sought is designed to cover a full 12 months, which is excellent, as chasing funding for these sorts of community support measures can often make it hard to provide as much support as is needed.  Having said that, the budget is quite reasonable, and at $1000 a month does a decent job of incentivizing the creation of the templates, mentoring the proposer's in its use, and capturing the data around its use and effectiveness in order to report back to the community. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Outside the template, which could be created almost immediately after funding (the data for it will almost certainly have been sourced  before then), this project really doesn't have any deliverables.  The video content is intended to be created by the community based off the template, but the team will still be able to capture its adoption and use, since they will be the main source of support for funded proposer's who use it to meet their progress reporting requirements.  Oddly, it is other teams progress reports that will be most useful in this team being able to effectively show ROI for this project, so it may be an example of a long-tail, where there is some delay in seeing the results bear fruit.  However, being under the umbrella of WADA means that we can expect transparency and clear communication, leaving little doubt that the Community will know if the project is staying on track.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 4, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1262, "q0": "The proposal sufficiently addresses the challenge.\nThe most impactful part of the proposal is the creation of a template for funded proposers to be able to use and create an auditable video journey of the work done.\nIf executed well, this can create some impact.\nThe reason for a score of 3 is that proposals can be vastly different and there needs to be a large variation of ever evolving templates to fit the needs.\nThe score could have been much higher if there was an explanation for the template creation process.
