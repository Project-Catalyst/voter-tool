The proposer is a long time Catalyst member, having been funded previously, and able to roll leverage from that funding (in the form of equipment obtained) into this new project, which significantly keeps the costs down.  I am curious about the choice to make the 20 videos all livestream interviews....I suppose the liveness is a fellow traveler of the NFT phenomenon, very much in the mold of limited-window drops, but it feels limiting to the idea.  Maybe it the desire to have the Q&A ability of the interview with the live chats.  Regardless, that will amount to a lot of NFT projects, within Catalyst (and if the cohort isn't robust enough, from without) and probably eager for a little extra help on the marketing side.  The real synergy of the product comes from funded projects being able to offload some of their responsibilities with the outreach and marketing, which means this project will be able to be measured by how much it is helping others as well, including being able to direct projects outside of Catalyst to become proposers.  The ability to bring in multiple projects under the umbrella speaks to the challenge setting requirements of decentralizing the effort of getting more FAM content generated.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer lines out a the specific tools and software he will be using for the recording, and budgets the time to each video by the hours spent, which makes it very easy to assess the budget as an hourly rate, which is not something you see much of in this challenge.  Where it was a little fuzzy was the actual timeline for delivery.  Due to how they have the onboarding of funded proposers laid out, including proposers from previous funds who they want to be able to start with a retrospective, I expect that their timeline for this project is the 3 months that make up Fund 9, with the idea that it could then roll over into new funding for Fund10 if it proves popular, though this does entail a ramp in the production needs, with the proposer estimating 3 shows a weak at the peak rate.  I am reminded how important the \"marketing\" funding area was considered to be in the original IOG \"Treasury\" document, and I find it surprising how much potential reach small projects like this can have for really penny-ante funds comparatively.  The only real risk one might point to is that this is a solo project to deliver 20 productions, but the proposer notes that they have become a Full Time Catalyst Member, and so they expect to have plenty of time to deliver.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The listed deliverables are adequate, with a measure for general community growth around the livestreams, along with onboarding of projects, but I think they can add another metric, which would be to track how successful the projects he is interviewing are.  This would give an idea of the impact on the larger ecosystem, and measure more of the actual challenge impact contained in this proposal.  Beyond that, being sure to track the early work networking and collecting info from funded projects is the only other piece of advice I would offer.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 6, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2555, "q0": "The challenge of communication between \"PC Community / Voters & NFT Project Creators / Developers\" is something Cardano is currently building beyond the scope of Youtube and unheard podcasts with the introduction of \"Spaces\" on Twitter (the main source of NFT promotion/information alongside Discord). This solution from the proposer is still more of a niche to the Cardano community, as many Developers/NFT creators and collectors, buyers/sellers are still unaware of Project Catalyst. Speaking with a number (10-15) of successful CNFT Project developers, they have little to no knowledge of what Project Catalyst is, what it's accomplishing in the *background* of the Cardano community. Projects presented for Fund 9 could greatly benefit from the proposal if the content could be guaranteed to reach a wider audience. As far as impact goes, it might even be better to interview PC members with Fund 9 Projects as well as established projects developers that have had success and are still building strong communities within the ecosystem for more efficiency to the cause; two birds one stone. This may pose a bigger challenge for the proposer, but consequently providing a much greater impact to Cardano.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Given the scope of the proposal it seems feasible to consider many content creators produce 1-2 videos per day and are able to live stream or record/edit that content within a 24-48hr periods. It is not unrealistic to believe all parties involved, the proposer, PC member and NFT Creators to be scheduled for an interview would be most difficult. Though it does seem like it could become overwhelming for one person, the proposer, to manage alone. As mentioned, taking advantage of an extensive network within the Cardano community to seek outside assistance would be in their best interest for i.e.: keeping content fresh and engaging Q&A's. Until Funding round 9 begins, a realistic timeline would be challenging for the proposer to truly commit to. It would be best if what is stated here, \"During the weeks preceding Fund 9 I will make contacts with current fund 8 proposers and fund 7 cohorts with direct involvement in NFT space, as well as Project Catalyst, who may be involved with Fund 9 again. We will discuss this project and how it may have helped them, then build around that,\" could be well defined in a more than \"this is the plan\" type criteria. Having a solid course of action proposed would be better suited for achievable results. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer states they have an extensive network within the Cardano ecosystem which can be utilized. It would be beneficial to this proposal to include references of past accomplishments in relevant fields to Cardano blockchain and NFT creation in order to bring factual content in the future interviews. Seeing a list of previous interviews, perhaps links to the mentioned discord link so more members reading this proposal might join now and prepare for any videos that might be funded. Now with funded content under FTC guidelines required by law with any connection to Project Catalyst, would these videos technically be \"Sponsored\" videos? As each video, the proposer is asking $400usd (20 videos) totaling $8,000usd. The current content being produced under the Youtube channel lacks some production value which could be elevated from the funding, bringing more than the average 50-300 views of past videos/content to hopefully 10 times that, making a bigger impact and adding much more value to the Cardano community. How one might audit the progress of such content, could be established through the views and amount of listeners to each episode. This may be the only way to gauge the proposal's progress without weekly reports, and solely relying on community outreach to determine demand for more related content. As for viewing the website provided, it is important to note the Discord Invite Link is outdated and leads to no additional information that could verify current members interest or involvement moving forward.
