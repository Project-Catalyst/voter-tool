It is also concerned with areas outside the Campaign Brief, such as \u201clearning styles\u201d and \u201cexperience levels.\u201d These areas may be helpful if first the goals of creating content for National Media, TV, & Film (a main thrust of the Brief) and other stated goals are first clearly met.\n\nThe author addressed creating content in multiple languages, indeed part of the Brief. Though, if unfunded this round, this assessor suggests specifying which languages the team will be working with. At present, the lack of detail compounds with the unrealistic notion of \u201cevery\u201d used when they talk about the \u2018challenges or risks foreseen\u2019: \u201cThe main challenge is making content\u2026for EVERY learning style, language/culture and experience level\u201d (assessors emphasis on \u201cEVERY\u201d). Surely, an unattainable goal in 3 months. The author might instead answer: \u201cwhat can we do in 3 months?\u201d For instance, voters could trust a proposal that specified the exact number of languages (perhaps 2 or 3) in which, again, a specific number of DAO-related videos (maybe 5 or 6) would be produced under the particular titles X, Y, and Z.\n\nIn short: Simplify the proposal for the 3-month funding round, specify what work is to be done, and cater only to the needs of the Campaign Brief. These are the elements of successful Catalyst Proposals.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "This section asks for a detailed plan and timeline. The author\u2019s answer begins with: \u201cContent is never a finished product\u2026\u201d The problem is that this is more a philosophical answer part of an unrelated conversation about film-making, etc. Instead, we only need specifics of finished products (i.e. the number of videos uploaded for distribution). Eliminate the fluff.\n\nOne area of great clarity is \u2018whiteboard videos.\u2019 We can see this image! Now you can add further insight with answers to questions such as: Who will use the software? Who are they? What is their rate? Who will write their script(s)? What does that individual charge? Who are they? Adding this clarity will have your voters only concerned about asking themselves: \u201cshould funding be spent on making content around the often confusing topic of DAOs on Cardano?\u201d Of course, it is likely a resounding \u201cyes!\u201d\n\nWith many years of experience consulting groups on business plans, I offer the following. Budgets are easily readable when they are number-driven. Detailed breakdowns can make a reasonable budget feel \u201clazy\u201d to a reader\u2013\u2013but you are not lazy! Clarity earlier in the proposal will lead to a more number-driven budget that comes as a natural outcome of the work put in.\n\nThe Feasibility section reads like you are searching for agility. However, this assessor believes that if specifics are added, from the outset, the team could predict potential gaps and be able to predict more accurately where they will be spending on items such as hiring outside help.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "If, first, the author employs clarity in the other two sections of the proposal, it will undoubtedly lead to an audibility section that will be far superior to what it is at present. Their answer to the first question is representative of this point.\n\nThe suggestion above of clarifying the number of videos to be produced, in a specific number of named languages, etc. would then lead to a list of tangible KPIs that will measure outcomes directly related to funding. At present, this section is severely lacking in mechanisms for measurement that would offer a voter any hope of success.\n\n\nSocial media follower counts are easily manipulated. That being a widely known fact, this notion should be seen as a disqualified metric. Instead, a concrete number of how many viewers/learners directly benefit from the funding you could receive would be a far superior measure. Again, once a more concrete goal and roadmap are established in the earlier sections, this section will be able to offer a clearer vision for auditability.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1134", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 7, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 755, "q0": "The proposal is for a series of short whiteboard videos that explain concepts around DAOs in general, and ADAO in particular.  This proposal also seeks to provide significant multilingual support which I give high marks for.  One thing I appreciate, is that in assembling the team for this project, they are relying on a decentralized team spread across the ADAO community.  To the extent that specific skillsets don't present themselves from this cohort, they will go outside the DAO community to find someone suitable, but my early investigation on their discord indicates they have plenty of volunteers.  On-chain and decentralized governance is a topic near to my heart, so seeing proposals that address education on the subject always get my approval.  The only area where I hesitate is that this info will need to be well thought out, and the general approach from the team is scattershot.  I would like to see them dial in  a couple of parameters, specifically which language support they will offer to start, and what learning styles they aim to capture here.  My impression is that they just mean the videos will help reach learning styles their articles aren't or something like that, but it would be nice to see this clarified.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The budget is well laid out and as a scriptwriter, I love seeing them put most of the work in that area.  After all, this is an educational project, and that starts with getting the lessons right.  Another big chunk is available for the translations, which I love, but again, I would like to see some specificity here about which languages are supported.  I appreciate what they are saying about pulling the team from the community but I would prefer that they had already gotten some commitments for that, or some sample work.  The budget does seem adequate to assemble a team on the fly, but for the illustrator especially, I would like to see some work.  The number of videos made is left a bit open ended and I don't know if the timeline is ideal, with 2-3 months being listed for, I think, 30-50 small videos.  I don't think they have pinned this down enough, and I would be surprised if 2 months is long enough to even make all the scripts for 30 shows.  If these numbers were more specific, this would be an easier grade to raise.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As DAO builders I trust that whatever other shortcomings are present, they won't have a problem setting up a project workflow with natural audit points.  With that many shows being released, they should have multiple metrics going up each week, from scripts finished to videos.  They final target is unclear...is it 30 shows?  50?  I appreciate that they see a potential for plenty of productivity, but the point of having the number is so that the progress towards completion and full release of funds can be monitored.  They will need to settle for a number in order to present this to the Catalyst audit facilitator.  As an opensource team, I expect that all the relevant tracking will ultimately be done, however, so this project should be able to stay on track, once that destination is defined.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 3, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2974, "q0": "Having a library dedicated to educating all levels of the Cardano community members in multiple languages is vital to the success of scaling Cardano, especially when you factor in the new influx of people on a regular basis we are seeing daily. We are only going to continue to grow so having a library with different levels of expertise gives newer community members a chance to learn from the beginning which builds a foundation as they will have access to higher levels of information. This will also save Cardano members time by not having to spend several hours searching various search engines filtering through material that isn\u2019t always accurate information. There is a lack of knowledge of DAOs as well as new DAOs being introduced to Cardano every week. This proposal will help bridge that gap by providing information for people of all skill levels. You hit it right on the head when you mentioned having different learning styles as everyone learns differently. Some people are visual learners while some are readers and having the content in multiple languages will allow for more people to have access to the information. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "What I did like about your proposal is that you broke down the topics which would start off as an educational mini-series and develop into more in depth topics so newer community members are not intimidated by the more complex information. Three months would to be enough time to generate some solid content which would give you a great start. What languages were you planning on translating in?  I did not see that in the proposal. I think Spanish, French, Chinese, German, and Japanese are a great start but would love to see many more languages added in the future. I liked how you broke the budget down by price with a detailed description so we know where the funds would be allocated. It is a good start to getting this proposal executed. The more content that can be distributed about Cardano DAOs on various social media platforms the better it will be for new members looking for information. Your team is solid as they have a wild range of skills and talents to complete this proposal but maybe it would have been nice if you shared a little intro to introduce the team members. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As they say numbers don\u2019t lie which means by tracking the numbers you will be able to measure how effective each area is within the 90-day, 180 day and 12 month marking period. Tracking social media analytics is a great way to measure progress as well as judging what content will work best for what social media platform you choose to use. The subscriber/ follower goal you have set is a very obtainable goal. The only thing I could suggest is starting the Facebook sooner than the 6-month mark. I would say get it set up right away. Creating a content calendar is very helpful and needed when structing your posting schedule. Plus, then you can develop a posting plan by telling a story where each post grows into the next post. This is a proposal that the Cardano community can benefits from regardless of if they have been around for several months or years or even if they are brand new to the Cardano Blockchain.
