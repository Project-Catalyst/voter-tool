This film production could potentially reach many more outside the ecosystem as it sits now, through the medium of film that can potentially encapsulate an audience beyond cryptocurrency, but at the same time educating individuals on what Cardano globally may look like once full scale adoption occurs. The proposer is well versed in filmmaking and has a unique way of keeping audience's attention by offering real world experiences in a documentary genre, showcased by the widely successful \"A Failed Artist\". The solution to bring more awareness to Cardano by creating a documentary on the work that's being done in Africa now, putting boots on the ground and seeing what life changing accomplishments are being made through the ecosystem and technology of Cardano's efforts is something that is in dire need of sharing with the world outside of cryptocurrency. By using this artistic style of medium, it is a promising solution to the problem Cardano and other cryptocurrencies face when trying to explain real world applications available to the citizens of Africa now and beyond. The proposer should take into account, that this media can only truly be measured once the film is completed, therefore the Impact on the ecosystem could be massive if proper marketing of a successful release or even add live updates from production in real time. This could increase awareness even before completion and build more anticipation of said film.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer presents a feasible outline on what must be done before and after the production of said film. It is imperative that the funding more or less kick starts the team members, which are not clearly defined here though that would add merit to the proposal, allowing all parties involved a little reassurance that Project Catalyst and the Cardano ecosystem have faith in said idea to get the ball rolling. The relevant skills needed to produce and deliver on such a task, is highlighted within the previous film production \"A Failed Artist\". Having done that amount of quality production without a truly funded budget is quite remarkable, as anyone who watched the film can see, it was done with professionalism and captured the true essence of the story. If the same dedication is brought to the making of the proposed idea of a story on African citizens and the people who are working to build Cardano there, this could be an excellent way to showcase and bring awareness to one of/if not the only proof of stake blockchain platforms performing such globally challenging tasks. The artist and network of the proposer and their team could and should be given more detail within the proposal for clarity towards past accomplishments within the Cardano community. As an avid NFT collector, knowing of these two mentioned members, they have been well received in the Cardano communities and have built a network amongst their socials via Twitter and discord that I feel could benefit Project Catalyst, Cardano and the ecosystem. In terms of budget, there are some areas that may have higher estimates than what actual cost may total, but also some costs which may not be realistically defined: i.e. Travel expenses could be cut with properly timed planning which could reduce overall budget. Also Equipment needed such as \"Gear\" might be a low evaluation in order to properly complete such a task. Taking into consideration damages to equipment or lost items over the course of travel and transportation, this number may exceed the proposer's initial amounts. This particular proposal does not specify definitively the risks, but most likely has an understanding of what may or may not happen along the way.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As mentioned above, the community outreach and success of such a film and it's production would rely heavily on the social networks of the proposer and any other parties involved in order to spread awareness outside of the Cardano ecosystem and audiences unaware of what's happening with the Cardano Africa Initiative. This funding seems fair to the proposer's overall ambitious tasks ahead. Creating a film production within a timeline is not something any professional in the same field would agree, always goes to according to plan. There will be some downsides to such a proposal and that must be taken into account before funding is received. Initial budget of $75,000usd could be more than enough to produce a film that aims to bring awareness into the Cardano ecosystem, but given the task that number could be even higher, if the proposer delivers an exceptional representation for Cardano Africa and all the detailed research that has gone into the project already, and what's to come in the future. The auditability from the team is somewhat undefined though mentioned within the proposal, it is said that, \"The community will be holding us accountable as we will be holding spaces and giving updates via twitter/social media on the current progress of the project\". Producing and filming of said solution may require weekly to monthly updates to Project Catalyst team members to track the progress being made. This type of understanding would better insure that catalyst funding is being allocated properly towards the expenses outlined and reiterate the milestones achieved from the proposer for the utmost transparency.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1529", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 7, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal is very interesting and aligns well with the objectives of this challenge, in addition to dialoguing with the challenge focused entirely on promoting the growth and adoption of Cardano in Africa. I thought this challenge that encourages creatives and artists to work in the Cardano ecosystem is essential, because I believe that there is no point in creating amazing technologies and having technically very qualified people working on our blockchain without this being able to reach the general public. And the media are diverse, as it is said in the description of the challenge, Cardano already has a good base of reach through youtube, but I believe that this platform reaches a more specific niche of the population, when we want to build something that goes beyond the bubble. Speaking directly about the project in question: first, I would like to comment that we need to analyze carefully, because funding of 75k is requested, which is a lot for a challenge that has 150k as a total fund to be invested. Secondly, speaking of the idea itself, I thought it was very good and the team was very smart. I think this is because they had the insight that it is necessary to create an interesting and engaging script, capable of transporting the audience to the narrative, and whose main objective would be to understand we should be interested in the Cardano ecosystem. The team promises to use narrative strategies, according to them, merging the rational and emotional areas of the audience in order to captivate them, so that they can come to the conclusion of how necessary and important Cardano is for the world from now on. I can speak with a little experience here because I studied Cinema and Audiovisual for two years, and in fact, there are some basic ways to make a movie successful: creating projection and identification is one of them, that is, the spectator \u201cturns\u201d the character. And in that case, the viewer can become a member of the ecosystem, whether through Catalyst, proposing or simply using Ada and other technologies present in the ecosystem. I found it interesting how the team justifies the difference between producing a feature film versus creating multiple individual social media posts. I really believe it is a good strategy based on good principles: the team expressed their awareness that not everyone will take the initiative to research what blockchain is, and bringing this information in a simple and understandable way is more than necessary. However, some issues (besides being a very high budget, compared to the money dedicated to the challenge) concern me here about the impact of this project. The team argues very well why it is positive to produce a feature film, but does not give detailed information about this film. We have a sort of synopsis, but that's it. It would be interesting for them, as an audiovisual team that is already active and that already has previous experience, to inform: whether or not there is a script; if there is, I'd like to see it. If there isn't a script, I would at least like a more extensive explanation, one that gives me an understanding of the narrative as a whole, not just the premise. What will happen in this movie? Which characters? What are the conflicts, and how would Cardano be inserted here? What's the climax? How would problem situations be resolved? How would the movie end, how would the established scenarios be presented and what would our characters end up with? I believe that in order to have a greater force in impact, it is not enough to know the intention (however excellent it is) of the team towards the feature film, but also to know everything about it. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Unfortunately, I found several problems to be solved in this part of the proposal. Let's start with the plan. Here some phases are established, but they are quite superficial. For example, in pre-production, partnerships would be made with others (which others? I would like to understand who these people are they intend to contact). Meetings would be held (where, for what duration and for what purposes?). In phase two, it would be production of the film itself. I'm worried about the 2 months time, I think it's a very short time for a feature film and whose investment is so high, which doesn't mean it wouldn't be possible. But I would like in which months this would happen and what the shooting rates would be (how many days they would be, how many times a week, in which locations, etc.). It would also be necessary to understand what these flights are - who would be going from where, to where and why? And about these accommodations, where would they be? I think it would be more than necessary to make the shooting plan explicit. In other words, I would like to know what would happen on each recording day, which scenes would be made, which audiovisual professionals would be working on these parts, which actors (even, this part of the actors is quite vague, it would also be important for us to know the characters, their characteristics and which actor profile would be suitable to fit here). Without this filming plan, it is very difficult to understand how this phase two, the production of the film itself, would take place. Part 3, which is post production, is a job of editing, adjusting the color, sound and so on. This part does not need as much detail as the previous one, although it would be good that we had more explanations. And finally in part 4 I would like to understand the distribution plan: this is essential for the success of any audiovisual work, and can be decisive between the success and failure of the feature film. Where would this film be distributed, streaming services, movie theaters...? In which countries would the investment in distribution take place, how to make the film accessible to everyone and not just to those who have the purchasing power to go to the cinema or have a subscription to some streaming service? Regarding the explanation of the money requested in the financing, I also feel a lack of details here. For example, his team 20k for equipment, but we don't know what equipment would cost how much and why it would be needed. There are about 14k invested in flights, accommodation and meals for the team. I would like to know, as already mentioned, why these flights would take place, from where to where, how many people would the team be composed of (between 3 and 5, but if there are 3, would the same money be needed?). In this part: \u201cFilm (B-roll / Interviews) = $22,000\u201d: What is this all about, exactly? It's not very clear to me. I also missed the money invested in marketing, distribution and paying actors. The financial breakdown needs to be revised, in my opinion. And finally, about the team, we barely know who they are, unfortunately, we are only told their names and roles to be performed. Some important information that was missing were: a kind of curriculum, in addition to the film \u201cA Failed Artist\u201d, which they have already produced, what other works have been developed throughout their careers? Very important point: how do these people relate to the Cardano ecosystem, how did they get to know our blockchain and how do they relate to it? Is there anyone who is quite knowledgeable on the subject, or would an outside person be hired to further explore and explain Cardano's technologies? In general: both the division of phases, the budget breakdown and the explanation of the team exist, but they are superficial, lacking details to have greater confidence here. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I found this part of the proposal rather superficial and inaccurate. I say this because little information is provided on how the community could follow the development of this project. It is true that we can do this follow-up through the information provided in the project phases, but, as I said earlier, the detail in this part is also insufficient, which leads us to have little exact material to monitor. The team claims it will keep the community updated through postings on social networks such as Twitter. But I wonder: how often would these posts be made? And what happens to those (like me) who don't use this social network? I would like the team to make access to such information more plural. It would be interesting for them to prepare follow-up material that would be disseminated on several channels, not only on social networks. It is important that you participate in events in our Cardano community, for example. It would be interesting if, as I said about impact, the script and characters were already presented to us now, and not as a form of auditability. Auditability, in my view, is used to monitor whether the project is going well or not, and we don't know its most fundamental characteristics, you know? It would be positive for the team to provide us with more solid means of monitoring this project, the information given both in the detailing of the phases and the forms of auditability proposed here do not seem sufficient for us to carry out a solid monitoring of the project. In addition to the construction of the feature itself, it would be important for us to know what would be happening in the post-production process, that is: how would the film be distributed, if the expected audience is being reached, how is the audience's return, the acceptance of this feature beyond the audiovisual community and so on. With that, unfortunately I suggest that the team rethink the auditability, improving it through these suggestions or other ideas. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 8, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "There is a lot that I like about this proposal.  It suggests that there are more and better ways of engaging with crypto and Cardano than following social media feeds and blogposts.  It further suggests that if that engagement is an emotional focus on a relatable character than we tend to get more out of what we do learn, as any viewer of Hoskinson's videos can probably attest.  The benefit of a \"story\" being told in a compelling way around the use and impact of Cardano on lives of real human beings could have immeasurable impact.  Having said that, this project doesn't have to set its sights on such a lofty goal, or to look for the perfect story or find some critically important character.  It almost doesn't matter which subject matter they settle on or which locations they pick.  All they have to do is tell the truth.  Cardano should take care of the rest.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The film included with this proposal is really all that this team needs to provide for a resume.  It makes it clear that they know the work the are embarking on, and the history of the film, from its rapid development schedule to the bootstrapping of it with a Cardano based royalty NFT mint tells us that they have the right attitude for approaching a project like this and of getting it done.  Even though the team looks good, I'll be perfectly honest:  I don't think they are going to create the greatest thing since sliced bread.  They don't have a lot of experience and the project they propose will be very emergent (ie: uncertainty everywhere) with a lot of logistical hurdles, no matter how small they try to make it.  However, I do think they can make something BETTER than what they have already created, which means it will probably be pretty good...  I appreciate what they are saying with their budget, when they indicate that the goal isn't to outcompete their fellow proposers, but to collaborate and bring as much talent into the big tent as they can (another logistical issue that will require management, big teams), so I don't think a yes vote here should be considered an either-or choice in this category.  If there is one risk for this project that I hope the proposer fully appreciates, it is the risk of losing sight of the landscape, the vision of the film, and getting caught in an advertisement for Cardano.  I think it is a great idea to have \"cameos\" by projects like WMT, but impactful, polished projects like that have their own charisma, and it can dominate a scene if allowed to.  The team needs to frame such things as true collaboration, with equal value from both parties.  ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap indicates a classic shooting schedule with roughly equal allotments of time for pre-, post-, and filming.  But it should be noted that the included budget does not appear to include post-production or the finalization and circulation of the film.  And while post- can be some of the most important work on the film, having something to work with is an eminently reasonable deliverable for this budget.  Post can be bootstrapped later if need be, and having something to leverage will help (and Catalyst can be the target of that leverage).  The deliverables for this project appear to be the interviews, supplemental footage for intercutting to build scenes (what is being called \"b-roll\" in the proposal) and a main film or story roll. (The interviews may be considered the main roll, depending on what kind of film this turns into, but I expect they will be able to have a story roll.  As far as tracking the development of these deliverables, there are some early milestones that will help, such as finalizing the initial storyboard and firming up partnerships, and as the process starts to pick up, they will be able to use location and travel to measure progress.

However, it is an ambitious project on a delicate issue and, if not well-executed, could have a negative impact on how people view Cardano. \nAfrica is a big continent with many different cultures. It is a risk to pictureAfrica as one thing. I think the proposal could have presented some examples of regions they plan on focusing, or some people already mapped out to tell their stories in a cohesive way. And if the project was indeed executed with stories from different parts of Africa, the marketing should be extremely careful to avoid conveying the idea that Africa is just one singular thing. \nAnother risk that should be considered is that some countries in Africa are very unstable, and any unexpected event could delay the production.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "While the timeline is detailed, it is very ambitious.

This part is key for achieving project successl. In my view, it has to be advertised not as a film about Cardano or blockchain, becase it might not have the right appeal for people from outside.

Will it help to pay for the film only or is it intended to get prof ? If it is the latter, maybe some part could be donated to Africa charities institutions or for Cardano projects in Africa not being funded by Catalyst. It would would help to address point number 3.
