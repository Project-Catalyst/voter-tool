Over half of the budget is expected to be directed to these animations, so they are a pretty critical element of the plan.  In addition, there will be some written content to accompany this as well, along with audio-only podcasts, however, as noted, the budget is for those juicy visuals.  This is worth noting because it is something that would separate such a media channel from almost all the other similar projects in Cardano, and would definitely bring the best aspects of visual creation to the ecosystem in a vibrant way.  Building out all the rest of the planned content from these \"hooks\" as the team calls them, puts the visuals front and center which puts the project in good alignment with the challenge setting.  Using artistic rendering to capture new attentions also has the benefit of presenting old information in a new way for the already onboarded community, and makes a case for how other projects could start to seriously consider adding the value of a creative to their team in a more integrated way than static web design or a project logo.  They intend to start with partnerships more local to Cardano, but indicate that within 3-4 months they will be able to reach out to more traditional media partners, and their proposal suggests this could be non-crypto influencers or platforms.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team gives some great background on themselves and their association with mLabs, a major development and networking contributor to the Cardano ecosystem.  While they have an adequate timeline sketched out here, and the budget is (very) roughly imagined and distributed, the real issue here is going to be the addition of the visual artist themselves.  They indicate the challenge of needing to get some combination of visual impact, video and animation skills, and blockchain knowledge.  It should set their mind at ease to know that on at least one count they can reduce that challenge:  any artist brought into the work will be able to feed off of mLabs knowledge of the ecosystem and principles at play in blockchain and learn as they go.  One could actually make a case for the benefit of bringing in someone with fewer preconceptions about what the team will be looking for.  On another count, the team indicates enough experience with their own forays into video editing, that they can probably either choose to lean on a video expert with artistic touches, or to support an artist with some experience in video, or any combination in between.  One thing is for sure, they should expect to spend some time onboarding the visual renderer(s?) to the team and the vision.  Since the studio itself will need some time to come into being, there should be time for such a task.  One thing that is missing is any discussion of whether there is a plan for monetization of any of this content:  the team indicates that Youtube may not be the best choice for them, but they also don't rule it out.  What is the plan to sustain the content going forward?  The team points towards \"decentralizing\" the content as the answer, some combination of community creation and curation, however it isn't really explained at length.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The included roadmap is broken up into 3 phases, starting with obtaining equipment and onboarding the artist.  The second phase begins with establishing the content and cadence of the shows and ends when a steady release scheduled has been established for the videos, explainers, documents and podcasts.  Expect all of this to take the majority of the first 3 months of the project and likely bleed into the next three as well, with a far out timeline of 6 months at the latest for final delivery (steady, offsetting bi-weekly shows, podcasts and articles).  The final phase is more theoretical and it isn't clear if it should be considered a deliverable of the project, what they call \"decentralization\" of the content, where it is ideated, even created by the community.  Most of the KPIs suggested to track the progress are of the \"influencer\" type, suggestions about recognition within the community, strong branding, etc.  It is expected that they will use the accumulation of deliverables, such as total podcasts to-date, as well as social media engagement metrics to prove progress on their monthly reporting.  As a weekly show, it should be easy enough for the community to keep track, as long as communication is strong through the first phase of the project, before much content is being created.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 7, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The idea is good, but I don't think it fully meets the requirements of the challenge. I think that because, through reading the challenge, I understood that the main goal is to make the content related to the Cardano ecosystem expand to different media besides youtube, where we already have a good base of content and viewers. What is said here in this proposal is that a team, apparently quite diverse and prepared (they have a website where we can get to know them better, as I will mention in the analysis topic below, and we can prove that they already have experience in activities it proposes) will produce content in various forms of media about Cardano. However, where would this content be released, exactly? It is said that podcasts, videos in animation format (to facilitate the understanding of complex technical content) and educational articles for those who want to delve into the subjects would be produced (I didn't quite understand the format of these articles, would they be written texts?). These are certainly extremely valid formats and content, but I miss two things here. The first is, as I said, to understand where these contents would be released. In addition to youtube, how does this team intend to make these contents reach the public? After all, in this challenge, we want to get out of the bubble a little and reach a more traditional type of media (perhaps TV or radio), with the objective of reaching different types of audience as well. Another thing that aroused my reflection was which themes, precisely, would be addressed in each of these contents. Who would talk about what and in what way. Because, of course, podcasts are on the rise, but what kind of subject do they intend to talk about besides the most recurrent subjects, which they themselves mention (the unit price of Ada and speculation). I think that in order for it to be understood whether this proposal meets the challenge well and is something that we should certainly fund, it lacked a better explanation of what types of media the created content would be released by and exactly what subjects would be addressed (in addition to who would address which topics). \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team provides a pretty satisfying breakdown of who they are. We know their names, what would be their roles in the project and a small text is also attached that exposes the history of those involved. It's good how they attach links, whether it's Anthony's youtube channel or Maksymilian's GitHub, that way we can have real proof of the work they say they do. Another very positive point is how we have several team members who have a lot of involvement and experiences with Cardano. Often the team is even technically prepared to perform the intended tasks, but does not have a strong connection with our blockchain, which in my view is essential. So, in terms of the team, everything is almost perfect. It would be more suitable if they already had all the members, for example, from what I understand they will still hire a video editor and an artist to do the animations, it would be better if they already had these people defined so that we had 100% confidence in the team, after all the animations are a fundamental part of the success of this project, as well as the editing of the videos. But I understand that it is not always possible to present a proposal with all team members defined; in that case, I suggest they introduce these new team members when they are hired. Regarding the explanation of financing: I found this part superficial. They ask for a total of 25k, and explain how much would go to each part. But it would be important for each part to be further explained. I'll cite an example: in marketing, partnership and promotions, they claim that 7k will be spent, but why? What kind of marketing campaign will they adopt, how will these 7k be employed? Who do they plan to partner with and what kind of promotions are they thinking of establishing, and what part of the 7k would these things use? Likewise, other expenses could also be better detailed. Finally, as far as the script is concerned, I also think it could have been better explained, they establish phases, but we don't know how long (in months or weeks) they would last, what month each would take place, who would work on which step. Although they explain the basic activities to be carried out, without placing us in what time and space (and who would do each task), it is not possible to fully understand the development of the project. In the refinement phase, they touch on a crucial point that, in my opinion, should be better explored: building bridges with other forms of media. This is what we are explicitly looking for in the challenge, so I would like to understand at what point in the project this would be done and what forms of media and partnerships they intend to contact. So my suggestions are to explain in more detail both the roadmap and the use of funding, the team presentation looks great. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As with the budget explanation and the roadmap, auditability is present, but could be better detailed. Progress is forecast for 3 and 6 months, where it is succinctly explained what is expected for that time period. However, dividing the progress into two quarters seems to me a very long time, I would like to understand on a smaller scale what progress would be achieved. For example, such information could be given from months. In the first month, we expect this and that to be achieved. In the second month, we want this extra progress. And so on. That way, we would have a more solid view of what they are expecting. As in the script refinement phase, at a certain point in the auditability they claim that they will \u201cpartner and release with more traditional content partners\u201d, reinforces the need for more information on this. It is necessary to know what forms of media these are and how they would be able to establish this bridge and arouse the interest of such traditional media to disseminate our contents related to the Cardano ecosystem. Regarding the final product, that is, what is expected as a success of this project, I believe that sufficient and satisfactory information has been established. We know what to expect, in terms of project growth, partnerships, public response through interaction, etc.; what we really need is to establish this follow-up. In this way, it would be interesting for the team itself to establish a follow-up, gathering data and information and presenting this to the rest of the community, either through participation in Town Hall, discord channels or specific virtual rooms that take place after the general community meeting.
