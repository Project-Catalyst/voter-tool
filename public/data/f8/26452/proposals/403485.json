As we move forward in media outreach within & outside of Cardano, it seems like these types of educational tools will have an impact on listeners and viewers. Content itself is not enough to reach a wider audience, but with the help of known entities in the space, companies/businesses and other entrepreneurs building on Cardano, it may highlight this information and overall awareness in the ecosystem. Having a loyal following via social media such as Youtube and podcasts, it is important to note that without an existing subscriber base (under 5,000-10,000 viewers) it may be difficult to have a guaranteed significant impact on the Cardano ecosystem. Having reviewed previous content from the proposer, it seems likely the channel will grow but by how much is still uncertain.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "From the proposal presented, it does not seem feasible that one content creator, the proposer, could verify the numbers given in the timeline. What makes the number of listeners continuously grow within the months of one episode to the next? From an estimated 2,000 listeners for the first interview (optimistic) to a massive one million listeners/viewers by the final episode, this seems unrealistic in regards to past impressions/views of material, and user activity thus far on the channel. Properly marketing the episodes and it's future guests presented on the podcast/youtube channel, it could seem more likely the results of these interviews will add significant value to the Cardano community. Budgeting evaluation for such tasks towards the solution of the problem facing Cardano, bringing more awareness and educational content representative of the blockchain and the people involved within the ecosystem, this proposal fails to validate it's expectations. Starting with Project management, what exactly is the breakdown of this expense? The proposal of 30 interviews over the course of 8 months, in total would equal $1,160 per episode ($34,800). This over the course of the timeline seems more understandable on a macro scale, but will this amount of funding bring an audience of this caliber the same value back into the Cardano ecosystem, in terms of cutting edge information? Who is being interviewed and are they a valid members growing with Cardano; are they well known or newly building on the platform? Project Catalyst must weigh all these variables. The proposer could possibly work on building their media presence first before funding is granted or perhaps sharing more detailed intentions towards the content mentioned. There's no doubt that the more media presence to the Cardano space, the better informed new users as well as the veteran members of community will be long term.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposer has set some very ambitious goals in terms of accomplishing a solution to the overall problem of bringing forth more information and highlighting businesses/companies/projects in the Cardano ecosystem. The auditability aspects of the proposal mainly depends on if the interviews can be done, in accordance to the press releases (where these will be released is unclear but should be noted for progress of milestones to be viewable from PC members) and the number of listeners/viewers across all platforms. None of which really can be defined successful until the first interview is aired. Where can the numbers of these listeners/viewers be seen from each episode? Is this publicly shared information that could gauge the impression it may have on the Cardano ecosystem? There does not seem to be a clear understandable solution that addresses the problem, that funding such a proposal would solve. It is thought that after funding the listeners/viewers will come flowing in with every subsequent interview, yet the subjects of these interviews are still undefined. Having some sort of details to whom and what importance they will bring to the Cardano community would be best outlined in the proposal before any further actions can be taken.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1529", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 5, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1025, "q0": "This proposal is a blueprint that lacks detail and clarity.

The professional capacity of the proposed author is not good such as lack of creativity, lack of attractive host, no communication ability.

But that is not enough to make a successful project. He has very little views and it is vital to not only record people but being able to gain popularity for the message. \n\n\nAs he states he will get one million views but on the perspective of even 4 interviews gaining two thousand views it doesn't necessarily equals one million if you turn them into thirty two interviews. In my experience people view what is relevant to them. So the hopeful thinking here is not backed up with any strong evidence of success.\n\n It is very hard in the world full of media to stand out. I would suggest that he spends more research into how to spread the word and which platforms he could use to benefit the relevancy to the audience.  \n\nHe is stating that it will take 8 months. It is not clear how the process look.  I would like to see more details indicating the amount of work for each step/time required x corresponding remuneration.\nHow long takes the editing, what platforms he is planning to spread press releases so that they can inspire/educate and be interesting.  Actually there is not much knowledge of the Cradano community backing up the interest to make interviews. You can be interested in everything but you need to know what you are promoting to the world. So in Glory Tshokama proposal I didn't gain enough of research onto what he knows about Cardano itself.  It would really help if the person behind the media message is passionate about the project/community itself.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Though there is clarity in the description of the problem and good enthusiasm in solving it the rest lacks good plan and reliable value. We can make million interviews and post them somewhere but I believe that's not what creates momentum and inspires others. In the world clogged with information we need to know how to stand out as well as spread the message. The roadmap of tasks and actions needs to be backed up with more research of different relevant platforms. The metrics of time is needed and budget are not clear and indicate lack of understanding and research into the problem.

The podcast content is interviews with leaders in the Cardano ecosystem. Podcasts are then posted to available media sites. In my opinion, this Proposal meets the objective of the challenge. Sharing the knowledge and stories of the founders and leaders in the Cardano ecosystem provides accurate, valuable, and engaging content for me. I think that content has value and can attract the community. This helps the good knowledge about the Cardano ecosystem to spread widely. so the Proposal will help add value to the Cardano ecosystem. I am confused about the solution to the proposal. The author should show how to do it instead of just talking about what to do and achieving what results so that readers can better visualize the solution offered. One podcast per week seems a bit low. it would be nice to be able to produce 3 or 4 podcasts per week.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unfortunately, there is no information about the project team. It is better if the team provides information about the experience, relevant knowledge to carry out the project, and the link to be able to verify the information provided is true.

Enough for readers to grasp the roadmap and implementation results. The lack of solutions presented in the plan makes it impossible for me to assess the feasibility of the proposal even though the numbers appear to be feasible. It is better if the timelines come with specific tasks. (Eg: Contact the founders of the projects; prepare interview content; Filming and video editing;...).

The budget is not clearly described at all, there are 3 main categories offered, but I cannot assess how those numbers have been calculated and if the are feasible.\nThe proposer does not offer any concrete information about his skills, previous work or professional social profile links, there is only a bullet list of some skills he claims to possess, but I am not able to verify those claims.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The progress measurement is somewhat well described, since it will be a series of podcasts, that the community will be able to verify their upload on the social media channels easily. \nThe success description is very idealistic, with no clear milestones provided \u201cSuccess for this project is providing lots of exclusive interviews\u201d and as such, it will be hard to evaluate the impact it will have.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_20", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5619, "q0": "The idea of offering innovator's stories is a good one.

On Youtube the proposer has a subscriber base of ~1000 and low engagement of those subscribers, low ongoing viewership. On the other platforms Rankadvertising is on there is no viewship information available.\n\nGiven in the first month the proposer expects 2000 listeners. Although this is possible to obtain with the suggest marketing budget of 10K, the growth trajectory to 1 Million over 8 months appears unrealistic and require significantly more marketing. Further, the level of ongoing engagement obtained through marketing rather than natural growth is shown to be lower as maintaining an audeince can be challenging over a long time frame. Take the example Kaizan Crypto, one of the major influences in the Cardano ecosystem who has been in operation for a significant time. He has ~30K subscribers and a few ~1000s views for their videos. https://www.youtube.com/c/KaizenCrypto/videos.\n\nA breakdown of the various budget points is desirable. There is no way to gauge the current worked required to achieve the stated outcomes. \n\nThe model of participant acquisition also appears to be that projects will approach Rankadvertising to participate - this is also unrealistic, at least while viewship numbers are low.\n\nHighly suggest this proposer look to offer a shorter project (say 3 months) for less funds that would allow them to establish creditably and viewership in the community and to provide a proof of concept before expanding. The budget ask is ~1/3 of the total challenge and it is therefore not possible to support.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The existence of the Rankadvertising Podcast is confirmable.

This project has identified part of the problem to be solved of this challenge, but the scale of the impact of the project is very large, as it is heard every day all over the world.\n\nCardano's scale is increasingly expanding, so it is necessary for projects like this to accompany, in addition to conveying messages from successful project owners, people will see the growing popularity. of Blockchain, of Cardano, and they will have confidence that they will be as successful as the VIP guests invited to interview. This solution is amazing, it identifies almost every problem in this challenge, the author's arguments are logical and clear.\n\nThe project has mentioned some risks when implementing, in addition to some of the solutions that the author proposed to overcome it, but the community needs more solutions for those risks if the project is Funded. Managing all the risks that the project will face when it is implemented will help keep the project on track, in addition, it will also help the community understand the difficulty if the project is funded.
