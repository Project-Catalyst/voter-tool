No reach is done on community education and engagement because of cultural barriers.", "f6_no_assessments": 5, "f6_rating": 3.4666666666666672, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"q0": "The project seems focused on broad goals around enhancement to blockchain education within Tunisia, where particular cultural barriers exist. This appears to be the target issue the content will help with, though not explicitly stated. The proposal shares how it will add value to the Tunisian people (governance and blockchain legislation) but not directly to the Cardano ecosystem. If not funded, I suggest the author rewrite to answer how the proposal would benefit the Cardano ecosystem. The key metrics and KPIs are lacking from this section and only partially addressed later on in auditability.\n \nThere seems to be no plan to scale. The proposal includes the creation of 2 videos and 7 articles that are Cardano-focused, which may be added to the content of the \u201cDar Blockchain\u201d website, though that is also uncertain. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Relevant skills and experience needed to meet the goals and the type and number of team members required are unaddressed. Instead, we are only given a brief list of skills. It isn\u2019t clear how many people will be engaged in the work. This is a red flag and should be addressed immediately if not funded.\n\nIn the budget, we see the same lack of clarity in broad descriptions of what the money is for instead of a detailed breakdown. Lack of specificity aside, it does seem that the budget is reasonable for the video portion of the proposal. The budget is NOT appropriate for the writing portion as only \"article content editing\" is budgeted for (60 USD).\n\nSidenote: Proposal budgets written in rounded numbers can be seen as lacking specificity and care translating to fewer votes.\n\nThere are no future/scaling plans projected in the budget.\n\nTimeline details are severely lacking. Only two dates are mentioned, one for each video none for the articles. We also have no information about the relative complexity of the videos in terms of creation. Thus, whether the proposer (and any team they may have) would be able to meet stated goals is not able to be assessed. Also lacking are any mention of a sensible and conductible plan for implementation and any technical aspects that might be crucial for implementation. There is no list of topics, lengths, or publishing info listed for the articles. Thus, it is impossible to assess if the expectations are reasonable for that writing. Also in question is who the writer is, if that position is contracted out, and what costs are associated. No needed resources (aside from funding) are addressed.\n \nChallenges and risks are missing from this section and are only loosely addressed in the Impact section as: \u201cNo risks are foreseen at this point of the funnel.\u201d This assessor reads this as alarming and over-confident since any project has associated challenges.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There is no roadmap with milestones/time horizon mentioned in Auditability. Only the number of planned videos and articles are listed, along with the goal of 500k views on the videos they are planning to produce. Perhaps a call to action for viewers would constitute a more accurate metric. There are no KPIs listed.\n\nThe success statement reads like a broad wish for the future for the people that the videos and articles target, and not any transparent tool for the voters or Catalyst Community to measure if the funds were well-spent on this specific proposal. The proposer should rewrite the section to specify what success will look like to allow voters to look back and see if the funding resulted in a successful outcome.\n\nThe video provided is focused on building a \u201cblockchain ecosystem\u201d in Tunisia. Though well produced, it is unclear if this is the vision of the author for the videos to be created, a sample of their work, or both. Either way and as a point of clarity, the video is not on the topic of Cardano in specific.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1134", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 8, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal is for a collection of videos and educational documents (blog posts, articles) addressed to the Tunisian region specifically, and North Africa more generally.  Because North Africa has some of the oldest, most centralized institutions on the continent, it is one of the more difficult regions for blockchain to take hold.  And in the places where it is both illegal yet heavily adopted (such as Morocco and Egypt), it is under a lot of institutional pressure to be little more than an illicit investment.  With Tunisia trying to take a more forward thinking approach, by not suppressing the technology itself (but still with not a lot of regulatory clarity), there appears a crack in the old thinking, and perhaps an opportunity for the adoption of decentralized approaches to business and governance.  The proposer aims to step in and fill that space with targeted content.  Looking at his website and other projects, it looks like the message he wants to convey is something that Catalyst can get behind, such as supporting decentralized innovation and governance with clear guidance for regulators and how to approach regulators with blockchain principles.  The only suggestion would be to increase the multilingual aspect of the project,  which it is clear the team has the skills to do.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This is a seed budget for something with the potential to grow much larger, but to start off, they intend to create two videos with educational resources to support them.  The first video will be targeted at potential adopters of Cardano, positing the blockchain as an inclusive solution for all, the second will be directed more at regulators, which gives a tool to any working groups or lobbyists that are trying to make a case for blockchain.  Including the backing material, the proposer expects to spend approximately $3000 to make each video, and claims to already have the team together to start creating them immediately upon funding.  While team details are sparse in the proposal, following through the linked video to their website, and then digging deeper into their social media including a discord server, there is a robust community coming together in North Africa for Cardano and they are among its leaders.  It would, however, be nice to A) not have to do all that digging and B) have clearer representations of what skills and background are being brought to the table by the proposal team.  Having said that, their results speak well for them, with established work with partnerships like DarBlockchain in North Africa.  They include a sparse timeline, with both videos expected to be delivered within 3 months, and possibly as soon as two months, which makes sense, since they and their partners need these resources yesterday to keep up with the opportunities arising for Cardano in N.Africa.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is no reason to think the team will have trouble keeping the community up to date on the work.  They will be able to start right away and are jumping straight into first video production at funding, so first month reporting will likely be on the completion of the first deliverable.  Along the way, 7 articles.  The Second video should be done within the following month, boom.  Reports finished.  What they haven't included here are any measurables on the impact outside of getting some views on Youtube.  What Catalyst cares about is if the message has been heard and if it resonates.  Can they show that the regulators are listening? Get a video retweeted by someone involved in crypto governance in Tunisia?  How about click-through rate to or from the educational articles, or even better, clicking through to Project Catalyst?  These are the metrics that will help Catalyst determine the real success behind an initiative like this.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 5, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Educating people by using their own culture is effectively tackles the challenge such as difficulty in understand, linguistic issues or foreign way of teaching.

Deeper penetration can only be achieved via local language vloggers which cannot be achieved through English vlogs. Dar seems to be an ongoing project the content is not available anywhere to judge.

Considering the population of 12million 1000 views on a 1 hour long podcast video is appreciable. Dar Blockchain (partially Cardano funded has a low YouTube viewership and subscribers) has been mentioned as the content provider, but neither its website nor its YouTube channel host any educational videos. They mention \"Training\" as a service provided by them but no further details available on their website. Hence it is difficult to come to a conclusion about the effective implementation of the proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "2 videos with 500views each.
