The pitch is to use the funding to support the team's already underway project.  That project is a continuous cNFT mint that marks the purchase of music tracks from the team's music co-op, with the proceeds (and I'm filling in the blanks a bit here from research into other initiatives the proposer is involved in...these points aren't clear from the proposal) filling a general fund that then makes regular, equal distributions to all the musicians who are participating in the co-op.  This distribution is called the UBI (for the creators) aspect of it.  As support for a platform selling cNFTs for music singles, and as a unique, decentralized participation  model for cNFT creators, it aligns with the challenge setting.  The proposal does mention something called \"The Listening Room\", which I was unable to clarify, but assume to be a venue for marketing or performing, live or virtual.  Going forward, if the co-op model was successful, they could potentially branch out to labels for different genres, or even add more multimedia properties to it with NFT album art or dedicated creator channels for other media.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal isn't asking for a huge budget, and intends to fund its operations for 4 months on this proposal.  The budget can be seen as 100% support of the co-op's creator, so there really isn't a need to break it down, but rather to understand the viability of the co-op itself.  And this is where the proposal struggles for clarity.  There aren't any indicators of what tasks will be undertaken in support of the co-op, such as a particular outreach campaign, onboarding of more co-op members, more visibility for the cNFTs that are minted and how any of that is accomplished (can't really use a song as an avatar).  We don't know if the current model is successful (no metrics have been included on releases, artists participating in the co-op, etc) so we can't estimate the value of continuing or changing it.  A major improvement to this proposal would be to start with a timeline and sketch out what actions would be taken over the next four months in support of the co-op.  From there, the rest of the elements could start to come into focus.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "We have already addressed several of the clarity concerns, as they have made it difficult to assess elements of this proposal.  In particular importance to the KPIs, the inclusion of \"The Listening Room\" participation metrics, with no clues about what the listening room is makes it hard to understand how the increase in those metrics helps, or is even reportable.  If a live venue, how can the metrics be captured and validated?  If an online venue, what technology or platform are we talking about.  They do list some good metrics for tracking the success of the co-op, which is what this funding is meant to support.  The total ADA tx for the cNFTs is useful for both a participation measure as well as a Use measure.  The target of approximately 6 singles released over the covered period of this funding (4 months according to the budget, 3 months elsewhere in the proposal) is useful to track the progress of the project, but less useful for the impact of the project if we don't know what was the rate before, or the ROI expected for each release.  When combined with the last metric, the $500 UBI dividend paid out each month, we get closer to measuring the impact, and the proposer suggests surveying the participants as a condition of receiving the distribution, in order to better capture the individual impact it can provide.  Again, if we knew what the target numbers were for number of recipients, trends in growth of number of recipients or payouts, these metrics would have more value.  In terms of reporting, the monthly progress reports for this project won't have to be too robust with this budget:  progress measuring the number of releases, cNFTs sold and total value and participation rates for the UBI should suffice.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 8, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The idea is theoretically good, but it lacks a lot of explanation here. Let's start by analyzing if the proposal fits with the objectives of the challenge: I don't think so. The goal of this challenge is to produce content about the Cardano ecosystem and disseminate it on different media platforms, preferably traditional media and go beyond platforms (such as youtube) that our blockchain already has a good foundation for, and this would all be done with the objective of making Cardano known and understood by a new and different audience than usual. I think that the proposal does not fit into this, because its idea is to bring exclusive content from the music world to the Cardano blockchain, through NFTs, with the intention that people are forced to use the technologies of our ecosystem if they do. want access to it. In my analysis, this can work if the content taken to the blockchain is from large, very famous artists who have enough engagement to make their audience seek to learn new things (how to acquire an NFT, how to make transactions on the blockchain and etc) to consume these unique songs. This might or might not bring a new audience to Cardano, but I don't think it would be as effective as, for example, creating content that is aimed directly at media like radio and TV. That way, people don't need to go beyond what they already do to get to know Cardano, understand what it is and how it can be beneficial, which would cause new participants to enter our community. Do you know what I mean? I believe that we need to make it easier for the goals of this challenge to be really achieved, and not force the public to learn about Cardano in order to get some content they want, because in my view this would work for those who are already familiar with blockchain and cryptography; I'm not really sure that older people, people who don't know anything about blockchain, let alone Cardano, have the energy and interest to do this. In my view, this idea would fit more into the Dapps challenge, because if this were all done from Dapp, it could help create a relevant application that could make a difference for Cardano, since the monetization problem in large streaming services it is something real, which has already been mentioned several times in Catalyst and that certainly deserves investments and that projects are made about it. Even so, I think the proponent should have detailed his idea better, we know what would happen, but we have no idea: which artists would participate in the project, how they would be convinced to do so, how the public would be taught to acquire NFT to access the these contents, how many tracks are intended to be released in NFT, approximately, by which platform the whole project would be developed (would it be a Dapp, by computer...?). Anyway, it's still very abstract what would happen and how, in addition to that, as I explained, I'm not sure that the proposal fits the challenge so well. \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is not good, we don't have any kind of roadmap attached, the proponent states he would like there to be: \u201c3 monthly music releases (for sale, not airdrops) from Humble Records artists / 500 Total Sales Volume ADA / 50 Total UBI ADA dispersed per month, as well as participants\u201d. But how would that be achieved? It would be necessary for him to explain which phases would make up the whole of the project, which activities would make up each phase, how long these activities would take to start and finish... For example, phase 1: in the first month, contact artists, select track that would be released on the Cardano blockchain, start building the NFTs access platform, create a guide on how to use these technologies (aimed at end consumers)... . Thus, understanding the process is unfeasible, all we have are the goals, we do not know how we can reach them. Regarding the budget, 1500 USD is requested to carry out the project, which is a very small and affordable amount compared to the funding requested by the other proposals. However, it is not very clear how this money would be used. It is said to be the salary of the creators, who would move \u201carts-centric Twitter spaces to grow the arts community in Cardano\u201d. But what about the other things? What rewards would artists receive for stepping out of their comfort zones and benefiting our blockchain? Who would work on the technical side of things, developing smart contracts, building a Dapp (it's not clear if it would be built, but anyway) how would the people who are going to develop Cardano's technologies get paid? Regarding the team, the names and a small curriculum of those who would be involved in the project are presented, however, some things are still very uncertain. For example, what would be the role of each one in this project? Who would program here, who would work on the technical side of things? Do people who have something to do with blockchain have any direct connection with the Cardano ecosystem, if so, which one? Are they active members of the community? It seems to me that, in general, they are artists and musicians, who are undoubtedly the key pieces for the realization of the project, but we would also need programmers, designers, publicists... These professionals are indispensable for the creation of basically all projects. of Catalyst, and in this case it is no different. Anyway, unfortunately I think that the information about the script, the explanation of the budget and the presentation of the team left a lot to be desired, making this proposal a little difficult to be viable. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The auditability of the project is also not good. Proponents do not tell us reliable ways to monitor the progress and final results of this project. About the progress, what would the Audition Rooms be? And how do they relate to it all? I think that first a linear, detailed and well-placed roadmap would need to be established, so that we know exactly what we are auditing and how certain rules must be respected. In the background, it would be necessary to establish frequent contact between this team, their work and the Cardano community, whether through a Notion (organization application where you can share a series of things), a github, a google docs, meetings on video... Finally, a way to make this contact direct and effective, allowing the Cardano community to vigorously monitor the achievement of partial results and the progress of the stages. And as for the end results, what the proponents include here is exactly the same thing we found in the previous topic, feasibility. Do they intend to release just 3 songs with this funding? Would the sale at 500 adas refer to these 3 NFTs, or something else? What would UBI ADA be? As it is a proposal that is not well explained, I find it difficult to suggest ways to audit the results, but here goes. An individual follow-up of the artists who agreed to participate in this adventure could be done, in order to understand if they were satisfied with the results and intend to launch more content on the Cardano blockchain. It could be measured if from this project new people created digital wallets, bought Ada, somehow started to use the technologies of our ecosystem, in short: if this proposal helped him to become more popular. It would be interesting to see if there is any kind of impact on the music sector, that is, if more artists show interest in releasing their content in NFT, if they believe that this way can be generally more advantageous for them... In general, I I think the proposal is not easily auditable, the proponents lacked definition of what would need to be monitored in more detail, how the project development process could be followed, and not just the final products, and what would be the platform (bridge) that would allow the community to do that. \n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 8, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The reason for a rating of 2 is that Cardano feels like an afterthought in the proposal.\nAlthough the idea of connecting music with charity/universal basic income is a novel one, it needs to be flushed out a lot more.\nAlso from what I understand the Humble Records Collective wants to sell music on Cardano but the connection between universal basic income, charity and sales is not very well explained.\nAt this point, I do think the proposal brings little to no impact.\n\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal as a whole suffers from a lack of technical expertise.\nThis is the reason for the low feasibility rating.\nI do believe that the Humble Records Collective will be able to deliver the music but will face roadblock in terms of actual NFT minting, traction, finding a market place, figuring out royalties etc.\nAt this point, I\u2019d suggest the proposal team to attend Cardano Townhall meets and join the telegram groups.

It's not very clear.\n\nFurther, no recognition of the costs associated with creating the smart contacts/or other mechanism that might be needed to implement the concept of \"incorporating UBI via the inherent automation of blockchain\".
