Probably depends on who is being interviewed) of the top 100 projects on Cardano as voted by the community.  The vote, more so than the videos themselves, is what lends this project most to the challenge setting, by decentralizing the choice of what media content the community wants to see created, though the potential of the interviews as character pieces is no slouch.  The question then becomes what  value does this interview format bestow upon Cardano?  Well, I must have fifty different project servers on my discord app, keeping up with announcements, progress reports, you name it, and the number one question that is on every server (um, besides 'wen moon?') is when team members on the project are going to give interviews or answer questions.  Cardano enthusiasts tend to understand that the projects and the ecosystem are in a dance, and that progress can't always be defined by how far ahead someone is or how complete their roadmap is.  So when excited participants are asking for connection to the team, it isn't always about progress, but about understanding the project and the people behind it.  Education, in other words, and there is no one better suited to inform us about projects than the project teams themselves.  The key to success in this area is to move away from the \"big announcement\" format that characterizes the crypto space and to focus on the people and their vision, on the trials and mistakes, on the successes and, yes, on the big announcements when that is relevant.  It would be great to see a commitment to that kind of coverage for the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "While the team isn't composed of videographers, what it does have is experienced hosts, entrepreneurs, writers and marketing skill.  And for the task at hand, that seems to have it covered, with the big unknown being what kind of interviewing skills will they bring to the table.  As well, the importance of the community curation of the interview choices is probably something that could use more detail.  Assuming the team intends to rely on the existing vote mechanism of their Cardano Ecosystem website, my suggestion would be to create a landing page specifically for this 100-program, and when marketing it to send voters or vote results here, based on the team curating a top 20, where participants select the top five projects they want to see first.  They can, of course, leave open the option of selecting from among the hundreds of other projects on the Ecosystem site (or even suggesting others), but this suggestion would be to drive the initial 20 or so preferences in a predictable way until the protocol has momentum of its own (which could involve trending choices, or specialty episodes as needed).  The 100 episode timeline, if truly 6 months, would mean creating a video 1 to 2 times per week, which is an extremely ambitious goal, but definitely possible.  It may behoove the team to consider stretching the timeline at least one more month, as the timeline doesn't seem too important for delivering the full impact of this proposal.  The big risk that the proposer identifies is about the level of engagement, beyond just the marketing arm, they can expect with project teams.  Obviously one way to mitigate this is by not always needing a team lead or the whole team, and respectfully working through the marketing principals to get the access.  The proposal team suggests keeping the talks non-technical (be careful...some of these projects are only ever really comfortable when talking about the tech) but any way that allows the conversation to breathe will be the way forward.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "One issue with the proposal itself is something that needs a bit of clarification: the team makes it clear that their target is 100 interviews of 100 projects, and the budget seems to reflect this, however the timeline indicates 20 videos to make up season 1 over the course of 6 months.  The assumption here will be the delivery of the repeated goal of 100 videos.  Obviously, once they are set up and recording, the progress reports will be easy to maintain, as they can report both the total videos for the month as well as the progress towards realizing their progress totals.  Another area, which their KPIs hint at, is the measuring of the effectiveness of attempts to decentralize the content curation.  Social media impressions and engagement is good, especially if presented as a ratio related to the voting for any particular episode.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 9, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Thank you very much for your comments, ratings and feedbacks. We are confident in the approval of the proposal. \nWe will actually deliver 100 videos in 6 months, we made a typo in the roadmap, but this is clear at several points in the proposal. \nWe count on your support in approving the project."}, {"q0": "IMPACT:\nThis proposal is aligned with the main objective of this challenge: Film+Media (FAM) creative unite! When providing educational videographic content about the Cardano ecosystem, we need to make sure to communicate a clear message to the community towards media. On this sense, this proposal specifies the need of easy language for the public, while learning about diverse content about Cardano. Short videos (about 30min long) are easy to digest and creates initiative for the viewers to get involved when offering them in a livestream format, as the team is planning to assess according to this proposal. Also, broadcasting these videos on Youtube and other various social platforms will bring easy and broader accessibility for community and new users\u2019 engagement.\nAdditionally, teams collaborating equitably to produce inclusive, quality media content, increase knowledge and generates adoption of Cardano, according to the metrics and goals of this challenge. This proposal describes the live video interviews the team will participate in by having conversations with the founders of the projects, who are developing and building in Cardano. These interviewed projects will be selected and voted on by the community. This is a clear inclusive way of paying attention to what the Cardano users want to learn and hear from.\nHowever, as mentioned in the metrics of this challenge, we cannot forget the need to create, produce and execute inspiring and educational content that reaches not only bigger audience (100 thousand users specified in the proposal), but also diversity in terms of culture and languages. It would be interesting to see how the proposers could add the translation of the video content into different languages, since most of them not only speak English, but also Portuguese and Spanish. \n(Rating given: 4)\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "FEASIBILITY: In my opinion, this proposal offers an organized idea of how they can successfully accomplish the intention of this challenge by offering educational video interviews for the crypto audience and new blockchain adopters. They specify what will be accomplished by the first season (first month), such marketing techniques, voting process, project scheduling and team preparation before the interviews per sei. In addition, within the 2\u20136-month frame, they expect to release a roadmap, which will allow proof of action. The recording and publication of the video content is also crucial and necessary. This shows how clear and prepared this proposal is. However, it would be ideal to understand what platforms are going to be used to produce the marketing communication to start the voting or the team project selection beforehand, so users can expect faster interaction and feedback.\nOn the other hand, the budget offers the dollar amount to be paid for the time/work for each participant (journalist, editor, video maker, developer, etc.). These amounts are broken down into identifiable items, but still a little ambiguous since we do not understand or know the hours each person will realistically invest to be involved in the project (such as dollars per hour of work). The total requested amount of the proposal according to the ergonomics and team experience sounds reasonable only if they reach the 100 videos specified in the proposal and the amount of people they are compromised to work on the curation and production of these.\nFinally, all the social media links (LinkedIn and Twitter) of each member of the team are real and verifiable. They also offer a brief description of their skills and how they will fit into the needs and success of this proposal. \n(Rating given: 4)\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "AUDITIBILITY: This proposal describes how they will assess and provide the progress of its execution by the implementation of a roadmap with the description of each activity before the video interviews at the feasibility description phase. This will help the community understand how videos content, dates and times will be distributed through social media platforms usage. In addition, the team assesses the current problem: lack of Cardano content in an easier and practical language for the consumption and as educational tools for the masses and new crypto adopters. In conclusion, I believe that the team involved with this proposal have a clear and executable plan to address the creation and production of video content about the Cardano ecosystem. They will have the recordings displayed in different platforms to report the progress of the project to the community.

It aligns with the challenge goals of utilizing YouTube and Media to educate a global audience in a clear manner, promoting adoption. \nThe proposal adds value to the Cardano community by turning 100 educational YouTube interviews that explain Cardano projects into an interactive experience where average people can participate in voting on which projects are highlighted. In addition, the voters have an opportunity to be included in the interviewing process. \nWhile the key metrics and goals of the proposal align with the outlined challenge settings, identifying the challenges with mitigating scammers would be helpful. Also, it would be nice to know if there is an opportunity for the video's to be translated into other languages in post production. \n\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The globally diverse team behind this proposal is made up of 5 members whose professional experience ranges from tech, digital marketing, journalism, stake pool operation, and education to entrepreneurship, coding, e-commerce, and being the Lovelace Academy YouTube channel creator with over 13k followers.

The timeline and plan to execute is simple and understandable, showing a high probability of achieving it's execution goals. However, the roadmap states only 20 episodes (season 1) will be released when a total of 100 live interviews will be conducted. Each interview is said to be 30 mins long. It unclear if the 20 videos being produced will require the total budget of 39,300 or if the budget covers all 100 videos, since they are not mentioned in the roadmap.

I like this idea. I think this proposal meets the challenge. However, interviewing founders only meets the need to provide information, which is not attractive enough. It would be better to add a review and comparison section after each interview project. That will help listeners have a more comprehensive and accurate view of the projects.\nThe heart of the challenge is to create educational and inspirational content that the national broadcasters and media outlets readily use in their daily programs. It would be better to include this goal in the plan.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "According to the information provided by the team, they have rich experience and skills such as technology, marketing, Crypto journalist & content editor. They are holding high positions in cardano related fields such as Founder & CEO at Cardano Feed, Co-Founder of Cardanista Stakepool at CARDs, and Ex Cardano Ambassador. I am impressed with the team on this proposal and believe they can execute the proposal as planned.\nThe plan divided into 2 periods of 1 month and 2-6 months is not detailed but also describes what they will do to achieve the goal. The cost is divided by category (Journalist, Videomaker, Full-stack Developer, Product Owner...) and it is fixed for each month.

More than 50 hours of content, and interviews with TOP projects (voted on by the community involved with the 'Ecosystem Cardano' site), covering so many areas of interest in the blockchain/web 3.0 'cardanoverse', all sounds very appealing. And, yes, I agree that the proposal fulfills the goals of the FAM Challenge Brief, and could be very impactful for educating a myriad of people interested in learning more about the Cardano ecosystem and its many developing projects. If well done, this could be a useful tool for others to get the word out and market Cardano's flourishing developments.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "When it comes to feasibility, the proposal provides a some structure to the proposed workflow, although I could hope for more detail in the roadmap and how the interviews will be conducted- 100 is a daunting number! I am guessing that this is a multi year project? If the 'first season' takes Month 1-6 to complete and publish 20 interviews, then, one can deduce that there are 5 seasons that might take up to two and one half years? To me the timeframe not clearly articulated in the proposal. Perhaps I missed something. It seems like the proposal was done in haste, and it is not particularly nice to read 'More complete details [about the budget] can be provided if and when we are selected by Catalyst.' In order to  fund you, I want to know before 'we' fund you, and for garnering 26% of the Challenge total. On the positive side, I do like the idea that it is for those who are less informed, or, that the interviews will avoid technical talk and keep it in a 'friendly way.' We need more of that kind of populism to be sure. On the other hand, I am not sure how the proposers will involve 'the real-time participation of users in the chat' in the recording of these interviews. It's a nice idea, although it may complicate the editing process. And, I would like to know what tools will be used 'that reduce recording, production and editing costs, without compromising the quality of audio/video and online transmission,' because it sounds like magic! Don't we all need that (I use Zoom's recording function, but...). Although the team is known within the Cardano ecosystem, and has a nice basket full of accomplishments and credentials, I am skeptical about the successful execution of this ambitious media-based project, and I could be wrong, but I do not see that there is an experienced, skilled 'Program Leader,' being the person who drives the interviews, and keeps the 'content flowing' so to speak. In conclusion, I can neither agree nor disagree that the proposing team, although enthusiastic, will successfully complete the intended goals. It is one thing to produce an aggregating website, but to successfully make this kind of media production, much less 100 of them, we need to see evidence from previous work, in my humble opinion (informed by 35 years of media production and 20 years teaching it).", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In the first section about 'how you will measure the progress and development of the project, we have the 'usual suspects': number of views, number of hits, etc, which are fine. But how do we measure the 'engagement of the dissemination of videos on social networks', actually? Engagement is not articulated by a simple number. What achievement targets have the team set for these KPIs? Also, how about giving the community some form of progress reporting as you go, in the form of a blog, vlog, etc, to measure the progress? With a professional journalist, developers, and enthusiastic entrepreneurs, the team can surely produce such content, keeping us informed. You have the website. You just need to activate its potential. Finally, I am not at all sure what 'Visualization of the interviews' means... but it is surely not a KPI. I assume it is the result of recording the interviews. Hopefully a well done interview, and well-produced final result! Given the lack of specificity, I can neither agree nor disagree that the proposers have provided appropriate ways of measuring the success of the proposed project.
