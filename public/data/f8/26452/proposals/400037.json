By creating 6 multilingual versions of each video, this number will bump up to 60 but the real product here is the underlying 10.  The problem, as they define it, is that there is too much junk content, and their high quality animated shorts are the antidote.  What is not clear is what junk content they intend to displace.  FUD related to Cardano?  Wen moon price prediction?  Is the junk they are referring to even related to Cardano?  They indicate in their proposal that they will need to onboard a Cardano consultant, and there isn't much in the proposal that indicates they have any familiarity with the protocol or its needs, so this project comes across more as a company offering its help working on Cardano's advertising campaign.  The problem is that a decentralized protocol with a decentralized community doesn't have an advertising campaign, and without some sort of intiative on the side of the proposer, we really have no idea what the final result of this proposal might be.  If the consultant isn't chosen wisely (and they include no parameters or characteristics that they are looking for in a consultant) we could very well end up with \"advertising\" that really doesn't reflect what Catalyst or Cardano are all about.  Without a clearer statement of an ROI that meshes with the values of Cardano, and the  FAM challenge setting, it is hard to give this otherwise qualified team a high grade.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team maintains a solid repository of their extensive explainer video work, and the included roadmap indicates a tested and proven methodology for creating the videos, with sprints on the timeline measured in days.  Despite an issue with their estimation for the creation of each video (20 days) not matching up with the timeline's estimation (26-32 days), and thus throwing some confusion into the mix, the overall order and actionable plan is well laid out and makes it clear what happens and when.  The budget is considered in relation to a cost per minute of video produced ($1000/minute) and the detalied breakdown in the google doc shows how the funds are distributed to the work tasks around the videos.  Because the team has made so many videos of this type, it is assumed that the video costs are pretty accurate for their process, but it is disappointing that there isn't more detail around things like the cost of the Cardano Consultant, or the multilingual support.  For a budget that is approaching a fifth of the total challenge fund, it feels like this project could deliver a little bit more, but perhaps I am underestimating the value of a 2 minute video.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The well laid out timeline reassures me that the process is well known enough for this team that they could have a high likelihood of success to deliver the videos as described.  Whether that is 20 or 30 days, the expectation is that they could be reporting progress of 1 video for each month for approximately 8-10 months.  They indicate they report the work as it happens in a public repository as a gannt chart, which is a type of bar chart used to track projects with parallel development paths.  This is a good thing to see for a video project, as usually video projects are limited to tracking by release, which in this case would barely keep up wth the monthly reports.  The suggested tracking of engagements with the released videos will be a way to capture the impact of the videos, but it would also be useful to have a dedicated mechanism comparing the multilingual results, to identify regions where more or less impact and uptake was occurring, in order to inform other projects as well.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Hello, first and foremost, thank you for reading our proposal; the proposal was changed to 5 2 minute videos; when we refer to junk content, it is more because there is a large amount of information, much of which is confusing and not very clear; sometimes it is very long and makes you lose interest in important people who do not have time to see this type of content; We have a lot of expertise with global explainers. The plan is not to market, but to create a series of animated shorts in which we explain things regarding Cardano such as what Catalyst is, how a CA should qualify, how we should propose, how we should vote, and so on.\n\nThe topics are numerous; the objective is to begin with really high-quality videos that the audience may utilize anyway they see appropriate.\n\nOur goal is to create films for the community to use, and they will be made available to the Cardano community's different media, which may include the schools that exist all over the world, or any person who needs to easily transmit an idea, as they will be in multiple languages and can be used by a community other than those who know English.\n\nYou may follow the project online at the following URL if you want to stay up to date. \n\nhttps://app.instagantt.com/shared/62326eb62bf08c7847ce2ac5\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": 5623, "q0": "I strongly agree that this proposal would have a significant impact on developing the Cardano ecosystem, and communicating with those outside of it.  The use of creative animations to communicate diverse messages definitely would 'open the gates for both education and inspiration', as stated in the Campaign Brief, and the proposing team seems to have a proven track record in making visually interesting and inspiring animations for different clients (see the work done for the Bertelsmann Foundation, etc., in their 'See for Yourself' section of the website https://criteriaanimation.com/ ). The deliverables, 5-two minute animated films in 6 languages (which according to my math is 30 videos, not 60, unless my calculator is missing something!), are impressive for the budget asked for, and making them available to anyone needing them to use is a significant plus for their impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As someone working and educating in the film industry for for the last 30 years, I know how much work it can be to produce even a short animated video, and although things have become 'easier' with the amazing progress made in digital production technology, even a short 2minute 'infographic' can take an oversized amount of work. Given the track record of this team, I believe they would successfully achieve their stated goals, have the tools needed, and understand the risks and difficulties involved. My only question is what 'the most important issues identified by the Cardano community' are, and how will the team settle on these? Thus the score of 4. How do you determine what is most useful to a broad swath of people interested in pitching to others, what the benefits of Cardano are? Otherwise, I am confident in the teams ability to produce the content: their use of metrics to follow viewership, tools to make real-time auditability for those interested, awareness of the risks in 'going over budget' and meeting deadlines, all point towards people who know what it takes, and for 12-13% of the Challenge Budget, would be a good investment of community funds. It seems quite modest, to be honest.  Given success in this endeavor, the team could certainly warrant continued funding in subsequent funding rounds.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Here I have to say that I neither agree nor disagree that the proposal understands how to measure the progress of the proposed project.  While I love the instagantt idea, that anyone interested can check in and see the schedule, progress, etc., I do not see any specifics on KPIs and how the success of the videos will be measured. Yes, the videos have to 'Increase the conversion rate to increase the number of people who understand and begin new projects' and 'A large quantity of views suggests that we are supporting more folks in comprehending Cardano', but, the actual question is how does the team propose to measure these? I would like to see more about who, what kinds of clients, etc. will receive these videos, what platforms will them be made available on, some kind of way of measuring that if  they are downloaded and used, as specified in the Feasibility section- for pitches, etc., then what is the feed back from those using them, and so on. Number of views, downloads, etc. sure.  But, what and how specifically will these be measured. To achieve a better score in this category, I would have to see a better alignment between the intended goals of what videos are produced, how they are distributed and how successful they are in reaching intended audiences (people 'in the know' using them in pitches, and people 'not in the know' who would see them, are two different kinds of audiences).", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_210", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Hello, and thank you for carefully reading our proposal. It is essential to emphasize that the goal of our project is to create animated videos of higher quality than those now available on the Internet in order to help individuals who are or are not involved in the ecosystem grasp various themes. It is not a marketing strategy; that is a completely separate project. As a result, the KPIs of how many people it will reach are not our primary goal. For the time being, it is only the production of the videos, and the channels that will be use are those that already exist in the Cardano community, in the various Discord channels, such as Catalyst Swarm, or for any user who requires it, and they are free to use.\n\nWe are not ruling out the potential that this may not be done in the future, but for the time being, the focus is only on producing high-quality animated videos.\n"}, {"id": 7390, "q0": "I think this proposal is very good and meets the objectives of the challenge well, the idea is a series of 10 animated videos in high quality (who would do this would be a studio, which has attached its website, where we can see their previous work and really are very beautiful animations). From what I understand the intention here would be to publicize these videos in different places, it is not clear if they would be posted on a youtube channel, or if the files would be shared directly with the Cardano community, so that we can choose where the videos would circulate . I believe it would be the second option, because, from what the proponents explain, the idea is precisely to present these videos in meetings, send them to different platforms, use them as a kind of ready-made tool to explain what Cardano is and its technologies. In fact, it is a little difficult to conceptualize what our blockchain is and the things that surround it for those who have never heard of it or know nothing about the crypto world. In this sense, having ready-made media content that explains such concepts in a simple way that is compatible with all audiences, through animation, is certainly a more practical and safer way to do this. I think the proposal would align even more with this challenge if the intention to take such content to more traditional media, such as local televisions, were explicit (we know that the videos would be dubbed in 6 languages, which would make them very accessible to different groups). In this way, the goal of reaching a different audience through more traditional platforms would be achieved, and the objectives of the challenge 100% achieved. I think that three things should be explained better in this proposal: 1) what is the content of each video. We know there would be 10, but what would each of them address, and in what order? 2) which languages \u200b\u200bthese videos would be dubbed into (probably the most spoken, such as English, Spanish and French, but having this information could help to measure the impact of the project. 3) as I said, how would the distribution process of the videos, whether this part of the work would be entirely the responsibility of the Cardano community or whether the studio would also invest in some form of outreach. With that, I think it's a great proposal that has a chance of generating a positive and real impact, but it could be a little more detailed in terms of explaining its characteristics and, consequently, its impact. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The viability of the project is not good, unfortunately. There is no roadmap, even though we know that each video would take approximately 20 days to create, and how long each task would take (e.g. query and roadmap 10 days, voice 2 days and so on), it is still not possible to visualize how these tasks would localize over time. That is, a roadmap with probable dates is not established. For example, it's 10 videos, right? Each one would take 20 days to produce, which would give us a total of 200 working days. But let's simplify to the preposition: 1 video per month. It would be necessary to build a script as follows: in June, after funding, video 1 would be created and made available, which would have such a theme, would be translated into such languages \u200b\u200band would start to be produced, for example, on the 5th and delivered on the 25th of month. Each week, such tasks would be accomplished. In this way, we would have a more solid view of the process, in relation not only to what would be needed to produce the videos, but also how this would relate to time and space. Regarding the script, we don't know why it would take 2k USD per minute of animation. This is very very expensive, it would be necessary for the proponents to argue the need for such a high investment for such a short time of video. I would like to understand how much each professional involved would receive per hour of work, in this way I would be able to have a clearer view of how the requested money would be used and if this is fair. I would also like to know if there would be any portions here being used for marketing, since this issue of distribution was very uncertain, in my opinion. And finally in relation to the team, we are not properly introduced to who would carry out this project, even if the studio's website has been attached and they have proved through previous works that they know what they do, we would need to understand: who is this producer, this screenwriter, the consultant Cardano and etc? We would need a series of information about them to be said, such as: 1) their full names 2) a small resume of what they have done so far 3) how they relate to Cardano (in this case, I understood that only one person would have a connection with our blockchain, but how would this knowledge be passed on to the audiovisual team?) 4) a way to prove all the information said so far. In short, you can't trust people you don't know. Therefore, I think that all the important information about feasibility (script, staff and budget) is not adequately explained and a revision is necessary. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Sounds like an auditable proposal to me, but I would like more detail here as well. Proponents claim that the video development process can be tracked online through a website called Instagannt. It would be interesting if they made available the link that would be used to monitor deadlines, layouts and scripts, so we could go in and see how this tool works, which I didn't particularly know, hadn't heard about before. Generally the proposals are shared by github, notion, miro, google docs... As it is a different tool from the most usual ones, the inclusion of this link was quite necessary. Anyway, it would also be interesting for the proponents to explain in more detail the contents that would be posted on Instagannt, how often they would be updated, etc. of these videos. However, I usually suggest that this be done, that is, some bridge between the project team and the rest of the community, so as this has already been proposed, my only suggestions are really that this be further explained and the link made available. Now talking about the final results, the proponents mention what could be evaluated: the videos themselves, their reach, if new projects are being created in Cardano from the moment that new people understand about our blockchain and etc. I agree that this is how we can measure the impact, the results of the campaign, but I think it's not appropriate to just wait for the community to run after such data. It would be much better if the team itself made a report, trying to numerically measure each of these variables, trying to establish contact with its audience, in order to really understand how these videos helped in what would be proposed, and that this report was sent directly to the community Cardano. In this way, we would be aware of all the results directly and safely. Finally, I will give 4 for the auditability of this proposal, because I think it is already good, but it can improve, through better clarification about Instagannt and the elaboration of reports with the final data of the project. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 9, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Thank you for taking the time to read our proposal.
