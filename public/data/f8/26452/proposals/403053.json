What exactly happens to these communities? From what I understand, the process of generating identity is bureaucratic and there is no political interest for them to solve it, \u201cbecause they use the identification situation to move voters to areas where they are likely to increase the number of votes\u201d. However, the explanation of this situation is still quite superficial and somewhat confusing. I wish the proponent had provided longer and more detailed explanations of this issue and how our blockchain technologies could help solve it. From what I understand, DIDs would be created for these people, however not much security is passed on how they would be instructed to use them, we also don't know what the situation is there regarding access to technology. Do these people have access to cell phones, computers, tools that allow them to access and manage decentralized identities? If they do, how would these communities be taught how to handle DIDs, what advantages would they gain from this over traditional identities issued by their country? It is not very certain that these people will be educated to use DIDs and how this will benefit them, because if they are a pastoralist community, we are led to think that they live in rural areas and probably do not have as much access to technology. In my opinion, it is not valid to promote a project that does not dialogue with the cultural and behavioral characteristics of a certain people, we do not know to what extent these communities will accept using DIDs, what would be their opinion and reaction to the project. It would be necessary for the proponent to explain all this, how this project would be useful in the practical life of the target audience (in this case, these pastoral communities). I'm also not sure when to what extent this proposal aligns with the objectives of the challenge, because our intention here is to disseminate content about Cardano in different media from which we already have a good base (such as youtube), in order to make these contents reach new audiences, different from those who consume the platforms already used. It is not clear where this documentary would be shown, nor how this project could help new people to get to know Cardano, what seems to me to be the intention here is to make more people aware of the situation in these communities; and not the wide dissemination of our blockchain and its technologies and differentials. Therefore, I have serious doubts about the impact of this project, both for the Cardano ecosystem and for the communities involved. \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The script provided is quite superficial, at first we only know which activities would be developed, without any in-depth explanations about them. On the part of auditability, we also have a temporal notion of when each of these activities is expected to be carried out (May 2022 Plan the dates for the interview / June 2022 Conduct interview scripts / June 2022 Filming and recording / etc). However, I think that it would be necessary for this information to be made available on feasibility, that is, that in addition to the proponent saying what would need to be done, we should also already place ourselves in that part of the proposal when such things would have to be done. In addition, as I mentioned, each activity should have been better explained, details should have been provided about each one, so that the understanding of the process was more solid. For example, \u201cConducting interviews with filming and recording\u201d: who would be interviewed? How many interviews would there be? How would the interviewees be approached, how would they be captivated to participate in the process? How much time is planned for the recording process of each interview? Would respondents receive some sort of reward, whether financial or otherwise, for participating in this project? Unfortunately, the notion of process that is passed on to us is quite incomplete, not generating much understanding of the daily work that would need to be developed for the proposal to leave theory and become reality. Regarding the budget, I think the asking price is quite fair and compatible with the project, in terms of the salary of the professionals involved (photographer, editor, sound manager, etc.), the only thing I could suggest is that in addition to how much they would receive we were also told how many hours of work they would dedicate to this project. That way, we would have an idea of \u200b\u200bthe price of your work hour and we could have a more accurate view of whether this value would be fair or not. Now, other parts such as the value used for travel and accommodation should be better explained, in my opinion. In terms of travel, who would travel, from where and to where, how many people, how long would they be traveling? The accommodation, in the same way, would be for how many people and for how long? Finally, in relation to the team, I think the presentation was not done in the most adequate way, although it was not bad. A summary is given about who this team would be and also their linkedin profiles, where we could check their previous experiences and get to know them in practice. However, the ideal would be to have an individual explanation about each one, containing their names, roles in the project, a summary of their past experiences and if they have any kind of relationship with Cardano. Therefore, I think the project's viability is average, with positive points but also a lot of things to be improved. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Regarding the auditability of this proposal, my suggestion is that the proposer creates reports at the end of each month, as it clearly defines what will have to be done in each month, that is, we know what to monitor, the question is how this information will be achieved by the Cardano community. For example, in May, important people would be identified, but how could the community audit this process? I think that a bridge between the work that will be done and the members of our ecosystem is not clear, this bridge could be given through a summary of what was actually done, the work routine of those involved, if the monthly goals were reached, if there were problems and how they were overcome, etc. In my view, the way the proponent reports on the auditability of the process says a lot about the goals, but not about the tasks to be performed in order for these goals to be achieved. Using the same example from the month of May, we know that the objective is to select the interviewees, but what would the team have to do in the pre-production of this? Travel, accommodation, contacting interview candidates, a number of things, do you agree? All this should come to the knowledge of the Cardano community. Therefore, I suggest that the proponent organize a monthly report and make it available directly to the community, it could be on some discord channel in the Cardano community aimed at monitoring proposals financed by this fund. Finally, talking about the final results, I think the proponent did not provide a good explanation of the success. What he basically wants is the main product, that this documentary be recorded and released, but that's not enough for us to understand the impact of the project. We would also need to know two main things: a) how did this documentary impact the Cardano ecosystem? Were DIDs actually created for the members of the communities in question? How has this all helped popularize our blockchain? b) how the communities were benefited, what was the real impact on their daily lives, what benefits are they having from now on, how are they managing their DIDs, if they learned about Cardano and so on. Once these two issues are explored and the results of such research are made available to the Cardano community, I would say that the auditability is complete and adequate. Unfortunately, as presented to us, this part of the proposal still needs a lot of improvement. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 732, "q0": "I want to thank the proposer for giving me something new to learn about, and for making my world a little smaller, a little more connected.  I grew up on a ranch, so my life revolved around livestock and that way of life.  The sun rose with the animals and set with them in my world, so I feel a small sense of connection to any pastoral way of life, and I hope I can add some insight for voters on this proposal.  The documentary the team proposes to make will show the kind of use case that SSI is ideal to solve.  Without getting into the difficult issues of how DIDs might be technically rolled out, the proposer believes that with a compelling film, the story will attract the attention needed to draw the right people who CAN bring the technical side to the conversation.  If the film successfully shows the marginalization of pastoral (ie, livestock lifestyle) people with a history of barter and migratory economy, and the way that modern institutions have encroached on this lifestyle without giving them a voice, then I think it could definitely draw a use case for Cardano.  The area where this will shoot appears to be Kenya and Tanzania, close to where the WMT rollout is happening, so it is easy to imagine near-term synergy there.  And just in case no one has thought about it, other use cases are present, especially for a bartering society:  for example, tokenizing their cattle and goats, long the medium of exchange they have used, could actually create unique credit markets for them while preserving heritage and custom.  Landuse DAOs for the commons is another way Cardano could help preserve culture, by helping establish self-governance for their so-ancient-its-modern approach to shared land use.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is a challenging task at hand here to effectively comunicate the potential of the solution, and unfortunately the team is not providing much in the way of describing their technical qualifications.  They will need to either have a good working knowledge of DIDs and trust registries, or need to bring on someone who does, as this is the message within the film, that Self-Sovereign Identity is overdue for too many people.  The timeline is rough, and could use more details, particularly the time horizon for the film (looks like 4 months total?), and the overall roadmap for developing and delivering the film is sparse.  Despite being a small project, it still needs to have a bit more organizational and logistical mapping done.  The budget has been thought out, and for the amount seems to be granular enough.  This feels like a very grassroots project, but there is no reason it can't get that little bit of professional shine, and that starts in pre-production.  ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team has listed the deliverables in a rather ad-hoc manner, as some of them would be better classified as part of the workflow for the film, but they can still be worked with.  Lining up and confirming all the interviews, script in place, step 1.  Film main roll and b-roll, step 2.  Edit, post-production, step 3.  With distribution marking the completion of the project, that should give them good marks to aim for on the monthly progress reports.  Beyond that it would be good to see them set up a dedicated social media channel to keep people in the community updated on the project.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 5, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1022, "q0": "The goal of this proposal does not address the problem that the challenge posed such as increasing the knowledge and acceptance of cardano for a global audience.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The information of the team is clear and detailed.
