I don't believe this proposal will provide the \"bridge\" between traditional film/TV media and \"new media\" that the challenge setting talks about; in fact, if anything, it misses an opportunity to put money and time into building professional connections between the videographers and the theatre artists involved, which is something that it could have done. I also think it's very unlikely that the proposal will communicate a message which the \"national media and TV stations\" will pick up (as stated in the challenge setting), since there are no resources or time given to trying to make this happen. However, maybe all this is a shortcoming of the challenge setting itself, and perhaps the challenge is a little too restrictive in its focus on national impact and bridges between different types of media. Since this proposal will be educative, and will produce creative content, I feel it's broadly in the spirit of the challenge. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unfortunately, I can't agree that this proposal is feasible as it stands. The proposal doesn\u2019t seem to show sufficient awareness of the practicalities of getting a TIE production performed in a school. As someone who has worked in TIE in 3 countries, I know it\u2019s extremely rare that you just contact a school with an offer, and they agree. There is usually a need for several weeks of building relationships with teachers and head teachers; discussion of practicalities; explaining how your work is curriculum-linked and what the school will gain from bringing you in; and managing dates and times, legalities such as public liability insurance and child protection (yes, it\u2019s true that with an audience age range of 15-21, some of the young people involved are technically adults \u2013 but many are not) and so on. There is a small budget element for \u201cTeam + coordination\u201d costed in the proposal that might cover this engagement and project management, but it is not accounted for in terms of time \u2013 the project will simply identify 6 schools and \u201cinform\u201d them, and perform at two of them that same month. This also allows very little time for scriptwriting and rehearsal.\n\nAlso, I think it is over-ambitious to work with 6 schools and expect to onboard 1,000 people into Cardano. That equates to over 150 people per school. Onboarding (e.g. helping people set up a wallet, etc) will almost certainly require some 1-2-1 support for the audience members, and the team doesn't seem to be big enough to do this for 150 people per performance; possibly, they pan to do it after the performance by going back in to the school, but this is not clear, and if it is the case it\u2019s not clearly budgeted for in terms of money or time. Also it\u2019s not clear who the performers will be, and how they will gain the knowledge needed to help people onboard. Are the performers already in the Cardano ecosystem? If so, the project plan should explain this. Or will they need to be trained themselves, so that they can onboard audience members? If so, that training process should be resourced. \n\nLeading on from this, the proposal says that a measure of success will be \u201cTeachers being familiar with and can introduce Cardano Blockchain Technology to new students\u201d \u2013 but there is no training or support offered for teachers to do this, and no consideration of how it might sit within the curriculum. In most countries, teachers are overworked, overstretched, and find it already difficult to cover the curriculum they need to cover; so it feels unfeasible to ask them to additionally support the onboarding of students to Cardano without training or support, and without helping them link it to the learning they are supposed to deliver. I think if the proposal had at least looked at connecting this TIE program with the local curriculum \u2013 which I can imagine multiple ways to do \u2013 the proposal would have been much more feasible. \n\nThere is also a feasibility issue for me with the age range being covered. Ages 15-21 is a very wide range, and young people\u2019s lives, their capacity, and their interests change dramatically between these ages. It feels like a very big ask to create a TIE program that will appeal across this whole age range \u2013 I would have felt it was more feasible if the proposers had narrowed down the ages they want to reach. Leading on from this point \u2013 best practice in TIE would involve doing at least a little research or engagement with potential audiences in advance of scriptwriting, and having their input into what they are interested in and how they would want to see the themes presented. The proposal does not mention whether any of the team currently work with or have any links with young people, which might give them this kind of background knowledge in an informal way; but if they do, then it would have been great to explain that in the proposal, so that we know that the performances will be pitched right and will be engaging to the young people watching. But from the information given it seems that nobody involved does have this knowledge, which from my experience is a major contribution to the feasibility or success of a TIE program.\nAlthough the pay for the scriptwriter seems OK in terms of Ghana\u2019s average wage, I would like to see more clarity around the performers\u2019 pay. How many performers does the figure cover?  Without this, we can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s a reasonable amount per performer. I\u2019d also like to see it broken down a bit more, so we can see how much of the performers\u2019 work  is to be actual performing, how much is rehearsal, how much is post-performance engagement, evaluation with the audience, etc. This would tell us whether all the needed elements are appropriately costed.\n\nAlso - the proposers say \"we shall convey our message in the language in which the target audience understands best\" but there is no budget given for translation, and there is only one scriptwriter, who is not being paid enough to create multiple versions in different languages; so I\u2019d value some more information about how this will be achieved.\n\nIt\u2019s also concerning to me that the proposal subscribes to and references the concept of \"learning styles\", a non-evidence-based myth that educators have repeatedly debunked, but which is oddly persistent and keeps on being used. (For some background to this issue, see for example https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA628405045&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=15399664&p=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=anon%7E1a955a2  or https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/04/the-learning-styles-myth-is-still-prevalent-among-educators-and-it-shows-no-sign-of-going-away/  or https://leftypol.org/tech/src/1627217656435.pdf/, or just Google \u201clearning styles myth\u201d for multiple references. The proposal basing its methods on something widely discredited, has a negative impact on how I see its feasibility, as it suggests the proposal team are not well informed about best practice in learning.) \n\nAlso, as someone who has worked widely in Theatre In Education, I can say it's concerning to see the proposer talk about TIE being used to \"make\" students do something (A quote from the proposal reads \"Live theatre is a powerful way to attract students\u2019 attention and... make them adopt Cardano Blockchain Technology easily\u201d). This approach is completely contrary to best practice in TIE, which is meant to stimulate students to develop critical thinking and draw their own conclusions, and definitely not to \u201cmake\u201d them do this or that. Yes, this could just be a slip of the keyboard \u2013 but coupled with all the other unfeasibilities in the project plan, it gives me pause. \n\nI realise I\u2019ve written an essay here \u2013 that\u2019s because although I would love to support this proposal, and think using TIE in this context is a good concept, unfortunately I don\u2019t think the proposal is well thought out or likely to be implemented successfully, and I wanted to explain properly why not.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The audit metrics given are measurable, and are clear in terms of timescale and what will be measured, so it feels reasonably likely that the project can be audited. However, for me, these metrics do raise questions about what \u201conboarding\u201d means. Does it just mean young people creating a wallet (and maybe even delegating that wallet to a stakepool) that they will then never look at again? The \u201cwhat does success look like\u201d section hints at more meaningful onboarding with its mention of students using blockchain technology for their final year projects; but I would ideally like to have seen a little more audit of medium-term outcomes. So although the project is certainly auditable in the very short term (counting numbers who \u201csign up\u201d immediately post-performance), I would love to have seen more clarity on what successful onboarding would look like, and the inclusion of one or two more longterm success metrics for those onboarded.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1157", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Feasibility: As we mention in the proposal the team members are highly integrated into the theatre space: \"Samuel N. Lamptey is the projects coordinator for a local Community based theatre group that are having a major positive impact in their society.\" in addition, the assesor mentions that the team doesn't seem capable of providing the 1-2-1 support needed to onboard members, however the proposal specifically mentions the Wada Ghana team that will be backing this project to support the onboarding of new members. In regards to the age range the assesor is neglecting to consider the local context in Ghana where 15-21 year olds do sit in a similar age range in terms of even potentially being in the same class in school. In many countries in Africa, Ghana included, it is more common than in the US for example for students to be held back  (major difference from US system-- where we are used to associating age and grade in school very predictably), therefore it is not as uncommon to have a wider range of ages in different school classes, which explains the age range further."}, {"id": 481, "q0": "This proposer has very well in my view provided a clear and incisive description in relation to the problem statement and I give him a big thumbs up for that.

Theater brings a unique element among the arts to the expression of ideas:  immediacy.  It is action, and the audience is a part of it.  When the performer and the work are in concert it has the effect of impressing upon the viewer a sense of \"THIS...NOW\", a very visceral, lived experience.  It would be fascinating to see such an experiment try to represent and express Cardano and the principles underlying it, of decentralized governance, self sovereign identity.  It is an exciting prospect to think about.  While not asking for a broadway performance running for weeks and being seen by thousands, the scope and reach of the proposed project isn't anything to shrug at:  they expect to reach 2000 participants.  My only question regards a clarification.  They expect to do 2 shows in 2 schools.  In the proposal they mention secondary schools twice and second-cycle students once.  The first is grade school students, the latter is higher education students, typically masters or graduate students.  The difference seems significant to me as to the intended audience.  Also, I have some concern about the proposed focus of the play, in terms of trying to explain concepts like SPOs and NFTs.  As long as there is a rooting of these concepts in human needs and nature, I'll be happy.

It provides the chance to test and explore an art form that is usually seen as distant from the technology world. At the same time, it will bring local youth closer to the Cardano community because of the more personal contact. Therefore, it is worth exploring how local theatre might impact the Cardano ecosystem.\nHowever, I am not completely sure it fits the challenge. The challenge demands a more global approach, not so local, so it can reach a wider audience. The proposal mentions that 6 recordings will be uploaded for educational puporses, but since the social network environment is so competitive nowadays, simply recording and uploading doesn't feel like it is enough to have a digital impact. Recording the plays and uploading them feels like social media is an afterthought, when the challenge is about multimedia content.\nIn my opinion, the project would benefit for a more careful look on social media. They could film scenes specifically for social media, both to educate those who will not be in the plays, but to also make the ones who will be there, interested.

For the number of team sets, there are 4 members and the Wada team listed. Wada team is a reputable team with many successful funded proposals and implemented proposals. The team will definitely need more personnel but I believe they can totally arrange it. The budget is broken down in detail for the production team, Marketing, theatre,... and the amount seems reasonable for the 3 months period. The roadmap is clearly stated with 3 different phases for each month and the final outcome, what am I concerned about is that is 1 month enough for the team to set up everything stated, it seems to have a lot of hard work, practicing, scripting, editing, marketing. they will perform for 6 different schools and 6 videos will be made, and 3 months is quite a narrow time to evaluate for the final result or to track for progressing. The challenge risks are also considered as language barriers and different sources of education and learning that students may have their free choice to choose from, but their solution stated is to target to a specific audience.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal can be auditable with the Wada link provided. There are clear key metrics with a detailed number - 2 live performances in 2 secondary schools for over 300 students in a month. A number of teachers will join Cardano Blockchain technology, practical usage of Cardano theatre video in Cardano conferences,... Everything seems logical but the number of students deciding to delegate to the stake pool might be hard to gain as they are secondary school students and may not be financially wealthy to join the crypto world yet. Unless the video reaches university students. The successful metrics are also listed and no detailed number is mentioned but general ideas as the successful details the team outlined are pretty hard to measure, only in a long term can tell its success. To sum up, this is a very cute and wonderful idea and if there is chance, I would love to join the team to meet those lovely students.

Its link with the challenge is felt in its educational approach, and its original way of introducing Cardano to future generations and in its way of using human creativity in the arts to enrich the Cardano ecosystem and more, (especially since the performances will be recorded). But these aspects could have been a little more developed, especially for people who are foreign to these areas, as well as what impact this could have in terms of sustainability for the ecosystem.\nThe KPIs are well linked with those of the challenge and it is hard to imagine that this proposal will be able to address future challenges.   \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The members of the team are briefly mentioned, a little more description on each of them as well as links as proof could have been provided. ( to have many informations about members gives the basis for trust, it really helps to remove doubts, to be able to clearly identify the people behind a project).  Although there are several links in annex, and also the Wada reference. The budget is well detailed and seems consistent with the needs of the project. The same goes for the execution plan. The details of the actions to be implemented seem realistic and the technical aspects are rather well addressed. The fact that this project is the continuation of an initiative of Wada, already founded, is a plus. Risks are addressed with a solution provided.

KPIs make sense, they provide both qualitative and quantitative benchmarks. The explanation of the success of this proposal is very precise and transparent, which is a plus. It will be possible to view the post-Live performance Videos (unless I am mistaken, it could have been specified where, on youtube, or their blog, or other medium). And to attend the Cardano Conferences. I also imagine that information will also be transmitted thanks to the Wada site?
