One of the aspects the educators and community members need to address is providing valid information about layer 1 and 2 blockchain improvements and advantages. As is mentioned by this proposal, it is necessary to clarify the difference between PoW and PoS, and their vital aspects within blockchain technology. This is clearly, a proposal that identifies a problem about false information spread on blockchain technology, and it is needed to be addressed. The way this project will address the solution, is by creating a short series, talk to local SPOs, calculate energy and CO2 consumption, offered a scientific and technical lecture as educational resources. In addition, the team mention the connections they have established with some local radio stations and tv channels (Deutsche Welle and AlexTV). I suggest including links or references that provide information about this media platforms, and perhaps pictures or any type of document that shows the team and these media organizations have established a formal collaboration or ideas to work as a collective project. These steps will help to provide validity on how the project will scale to address the current challenge, and the growth and adoption of Cardano projects that get financial support. It will also bring more awareness and professionalism of the team behind the project. It is important to cite that this proposal plans to implement the content in social media platforms (YouTube), to diversity the availability of these educational tools , which I consider important according to the challenge in place: Bridging between YouTube, the traditional media, TV and film. \nScore given: 4\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "FEASIBILITY:\nIn terms of planning, the proposers describe a 4-month timeline for delivering and implementing the educational series production. I understand that they will get in contact with TV& radio stations to talk and coordinate about cooperation. I am not sure if this process will take a couple of weeks to get a positive response from these media organizations. Even if that\u2019s the case, I would have suggested to prepare ahead of time, by reaching out beforehand, to have some clarity about how long it really takes to getting contact with a radio station and the tv channel based on their actual location, what the times slots are, if these are flexible and accessible for the team to work around, and the cost of livestreaming or sharing the content will cost for these traditional media platforms to showcase the educational videos. The team does not provide information about these previous aspects, so I would suggest taking this as a future reference, since we want to make sure that the project offers a realistic timetable to complete the work, and the plan process can be implemented successfully. On the other hand, the budget describes the identifiable items needed to achieve the set goals for this proposal. I consider this a reasonable monetary requirement taking into consideration the pre-production, creation and post-production stages that are described in the project. However, I do not see details (links and professional references) from the proposers, but just brief introductions about their working experiences. It is important to provide as many details as possible to add clarity and validity to the project, and to judge if the proposers have the required skills to conduct the plan effectively. I would also advise adding more links in general about the SPO, their experience and involvement with Cardano, as well as the film maker and links related to his numerous awards and short films. \nScore given: 3 \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "AUDITIBILITY\nI believe that we would need more information about the team experience, abilities, and skills to assess, so we could elaborate a better judgment in terms of auditability for the success of this project. The team describes that as soon as the video series are created, they will provide information about the numbers of views in the social media platforms that they will utilize. However, I do not see what platforms specifically they have created to do so. Therefore, I would suggest providing the links of the platforms they are planning to utilize and provide references if they have previous experience with social media content management, marketing, and promotion. In addition, to measure the progress of the project, they will provide the cooperation they are planning to establish with the traditional media (radio station and tv channel). I believe that we would not assume that this collaboration will happen, unless we can provide references or documents that show we have gotten an answer from this organizations. The auditability part of this projects has some weak aspects to work on before we can define the success of the proposal. I would highly suggest adding more references, links, documents that can support the plan in place the proposers want to implement.

Of course, we all know who wins that argument, but for those that don't, the proposer is suggesting leveraging their experience as a filmaker (proof not provided) and contacts in German Media (proof not provided) to create a short, informational documentary on the subject.  The proposer believes their contacts in a couple of major media outlets, combined with youtube distribution will get the message out sufficiently well, and hopes that it is successful enough to get picked up by a major streaming service as a regular show.  If that were to happen, this project could indeed have huge impact, and it is assumed that any major network exposure in Germany could also make some significant ripples for Cardano.  But based on concerns outlined below, I am not sure about these assertions.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Unfortunately, the biggest signal for success for an idea like this is going to be the team behind it, but we have no real details to go on.  I would have liked a link to any of the awarded filmwork of the proposer (or even a name for the proposer so I could go find it myself) in particualr, to see what kind of content we are talking about here.  There are also no links for the teams, or their names, so it is difficult to parse their history.  What is the nature of their connections to the media stations they mentioned?  Did they work there?  The plan starts with 4-8 weeks to create a script and presumably pitch it, as it notes \"Get in contact with TV & radio stations about cooperations\" as a milestone on the timeline.  It is unclear what type of cooperation they expect from the pitch, maybe a timeslot or understanding of intent.  Another 1-2 months for filming, and a final 1-2 months for post- and distribution...there is just not enough granularity provided in this roadmap to know if the proposer understands the process they are engaging in.  If the approach is a youtube documentary, then a lot of this lines up and is doable, I think, but the whole TV/Radio/netflix thing is kind of throwing me, since that is a whole different animal with major competition and high barriers to entry that Catalyst Funding probably doesn't provide a way around.  As a youtube pitch, I am seeing this proposal in a whole different light, but as a professional pitch, it isn't measuring up.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The roadmap has deliverables that can be achieved, particularly the script, scheduling and delivering some pitch sessions, and of course the shooting schedule (not included, as the content of the documentary has not been scripted yet) will have a lot of the details on how long it will actually take.

Metrics for views, maybe any major pulls where it gets some media airtime, those will be the metrics for success.
