These videos would focus on creating learning material based around guides and resources in Cardano and Project Catalyst, but the approach would be explainers on whiteboards, possibly with animations.  The point would be to use highly visual examples to do explanations, and if a person searches around Youtube, you can find this popular style being used throughout the Crypto space to explain complicated DAOs or difficult tokenomics, and there are multiple platforms for users to create their own.  This seems like a really great idea (and as of Feb 2022 Vietnam was the the highest ranked user of cryptocurrency in terms of valuation of transaction and of individuals engaging in transactions...and 2nd place wasn't even close) and the proposer has already been working on creating these videos.  The opensourcing of the underlying video content, in order to allow reuse with other languages, is a huge perk.  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The skills required seem evident based on the provided sample, and the proposer has provided a good plan to increase the quality even more, by getting dedicated voice talent and bringing on content writers, creators and editors.  The timeline provided is a bit sparse, with most of the details in the first two phases already accomplished, and little detail in the post funding phase, however the budget is well laid out and sufficiently captures the steps required to roll out each of the videos.  The schedule roughly works out to one video released per week, and that schedule takes into account the initial process of assembling a production team over the first months after funding.  It isn't indicated if the team is perhaps already ready and awaiting funding, or will need to be completely sourced after funding.  The content used to create the videos will be organized as articles on a website, which can increase the exposure and the mileage from the work.  The proposal doesn't clarify how it will distribute the opensource video for others to use, but that could be accomplished via the website repository or even on GitHub.  The budget is quite reasonable on a per video basis, and only adds up because of the large number of videos to be created.  24 is an ambitious goal on a tight timeline, and the only real risk I see with this project is overrunning either the budget or the delivery date.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The only place where the work will be tracked is the youtube playlist of the proposer, however they have budget for marketing so it can be assumed that the community will be able to follow developments as they advertise and build up social media following.  There is a bit of concern regarding the timeframe between funding (around May or so) and the expected startup date for creating videos (expected to be July) as that is a couple of months without anything obvious to report progress on.  However I believe we can assume that this buffer is being built-in in case there are any funding delays (won't need to move timeline in negotiations with contributors) and in a pinch the proposer can make progress reports based on getting their team assembled.  Once production starts the auditing should be a simple process of reporting how many videos have been made and progress towards total amount expected.  The proposer could also include metrics on views, and number of pull requests for the opensource videos.  In terms of some of the deeper implications of the challenge setting, it would be a real positive for this proposer to seek out talented creatives to do the drawing and voice work, and to consider making a report, interview or article on the process, to inspire and help others who are seeking creatives to work with them, or seeking creative work.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 2, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "You can check my budget breakdown, there is a specific amount of time for each position to make a video.

I like there's already one demo clip to show how it would work.

Even the key metrics also told that and we have our key metrics that are well aligned with them. Moreover, in the scope of this proposal, we will focus only on production and don't have any plan for communication yet. For that, it should be made on other proposals. \r\nSo, instead of helping us make better content to stick our solution and implementation plan - that did align with challenge objectives - the assessor advise deeply into our idea and plan that violate the 3rd principle of the CA guideline. \r\nMoreover, we did our prototype that he can check for assessing the quality. We also provide a detailed publishing schedule and production plan clearly that can show they will never be our risk, but the assessor tries to add it to our challenge and risk for lower our rate. So, these comment is nonsense and unreasonable. \r\nFEASIBILITY \r\nAgain, the team forming is also not our risk and challenge. I provided clearly the time-bound for each role to produce a clip. Employee a student to adapt those tasks is very easy because they even do it better than me because they're just focusing on one task at a time. But the assessor once again, instead of assessing the content and its structure, tried to advise our idea and plan with unreasonable information. \r\nMoreover, his last sentence is really nonsense for assessing the feasibility of a proposal. I don't understand what that means. \r\nSo, rating at 3 is absolutely unreasonable with his nonsense comment.

I am concerned that the guideline will update from fund to fund and if the video can adapt to the changes if there are big changes in the process but I can see the address it in the risk management and also give out the solution by adding more small videos.
