So having meetings and seminars is really important. The solution is a coffee shop where people can hold meetings in person or online. This proposal is on target of the challenge because I think this implementation is core to the Cardano community, which will help more developers to come to the playing field and grow the Cardano ecosystem in Japan.\nAs the proposal mentioned crypto-asset-based cafes have a history of operating while prices are booming, but closing when prices are down, and the team also argues that there are plans to reduce costs. of Cardano & Web 3.0 Cafe to the limit and create a model that can withstand a drop in price. It would be good if the proposal could be transparent about what the above cost reduction plan is, and how it can be countered with the price drop if the market is volatile.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This proposal does not provide a roadmap with milestones. The proposal states that the cafe will be opened within 2 months and maintained for 1 year from the date of opening. It would be better if the proposal provides details such as the start date, location and size of the shop, strategies for maintaining the shop and how you can get the community involved. The $50,000 request budget represents 33% of the entire challenge's funding, but it's explained in a rather general way. In order for the community to be easily auditable, I think the proposal needs to clearly list each item with the amount spent in more detail. Examples of labor costs: how many people will be hired, how long will it take, the cost per hour worked? What are the required equipment and other costs that the proposal talks about? This proposal does not have a link between the budget by workload and labor, making it difficult to assess the feasibility of the budget.\nRegarding the project team, it is described that there are so many members on the team that it is impossible to write them all down and only list one key member, which is president Tsuda Toru. After reviewing his profile, I agree that he has the appropriate experience and qualifications to undertake this project. His work can be easily understood through the link https://www.metafrontier.inc/. However, this proposal lacks a detailed plan that would greatly affect the testability of the proposal. For the above reasons I do not think this proposed possibility will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "With that said, this proposal does not have a specific roadmap, has no budget breakdown nor describes specific actions, so it is difficult to assess the progress and success of the proposal. The nice thing is that the proposal provided key metrics to measure that seemed doable and a good indication of a successful challenge setup. It would be great if the developers put in some more data on the number of participants (growing month by month) and the way this changed so voters can see how many people depend on it. This proposal is a completely new proposal that has never been funded before.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1167", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 4, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1271, "q0": "The proposal in my opinion needs to give more clarity in terms of the uniqueness of the Cardano cafe.\nThese are the questions I\u2019d like to see answered:\n1) How is this better than finding an existing cafe and making it a local spot for the cardano community to meet? (Having web3 books is unique but seems to me it can be implemented in existing cafes)\n2) Adding an explanation how interior design can aid more ideas and collaborations.\n3) How does the cafe aid in interactions with the community outside of Japan? (Eg: Conference space where Townhall meets are live streamed, Computer access for small groups to discuss Catalyst proposals etc.)\n\nI do think there is a merit to the idea if the cafe itself is named after Cardano or ADA. This will serve as a publicity tool and bring more eyeballs.\nTo add to that, it can possibly become a great hub for a budding catalyst community.\n\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I give a rating of 2 for implementation because there are not enough details presented.\nIt\u2019d really help the proposal if the expenses are broken down further.\nEg.

I think the proponent should have a more specific plan. For example, in 2 months, for an offline Coffee shop, there will be stages such as searching for premises, designing, purchasing materials, building, taking over, creating menus, recruiting service staff... For an online coffee shop, it is built on the website platform, there are stages such as web ideation, interface design, feature programming, content creation, test implementation, editing, and completion... Each stage will have a specific completion date. With the plan stated in general as in the present proposal, it is difficult to assess the feasibility of the project accurately.\nIn terms of costs, the proposed budget is $23,000, however, there is no detailed spreadsheet. The budget is only the sum of the cost of labor, equipment, and other expenses. The budget should specifically state each cost corresponding to each work item, which will be more logical.\nRegarding the composition of the team, it would be great if the proponent could write down the information of the main active members and have a link to the CV, proof of experience, and skills. I understand that your team can be very large, but we need more information about the implementation members before we can check if your experience and skills are suitable for the project.
