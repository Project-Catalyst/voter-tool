The Challenge seeks proposals that help increase adoption, wallet activity, stake pool engagement, increasing the number of Catalyst participants from East Asia, and ultimately likewise the number of proposals coming from East Asia. These being the goals of this Campaign, along with other ways to benefit East Asia, this translation project seems perfectly suited to meet those needs and help Cardano expand into that market. \n\nAs the Challenge states, the entire Cardano community will benefit when it succeeds, and directly, intentionally funding proposals like these seems one of the most cost-effective tactics to help us understand and learn the needs of these communities, like the Campaign seeks. Wikipedia shows that the Burmese language is not merely relegated to being spoken in Burma/Myanmar, but also in other East Asian countries like Bangladesh, India, Thailand, and even Korea and Japan. The Challenge emphasizes focusing predominantly on East Asia, but being open-ended, and something I find fascinating is that Wikipedia even shows the Burmese language being spoken all over the United States, to the point of meriting its own \u201cBurmese Americans\u201d article. This further enhances the Impact that this proposal has at growing Cardano. \n\nThe high SDG rating extends the impact of this project further still, again aligned with the Campaign. Similarly to how the team adding transcripts, subtitles, and/or closed-captioning ensures that even the Deaf population will not be overlooked with this project. \n\nThis project will therefore have very strong Impact. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This project is extremely likely to succeed, as evidenced when one combines the well-planned out roadmap and then sees the team in place to enact it. A realistic goal for each few days, each month, and the project is set and already planned out, with a logistics expert and project manager ready to mobilize a team that they each seem connected with. The proposal states what to expect at the end of each of the 3 months, including social media and YouTube channel creation and engagement, and states a very reasonable budget breakdown spelling out costs that are considerably cheaper than elsewhere. \n\nOf the initial, main team that will recruit from their network of masters they\u2019ve worked with for decades, all four members seem very well qualified to carry out the proposal exactly as described. The credentials are impressive, including having worked for so long doing nearly exactly this line of work. This shows that the only thing the team needs is the go-ahead and it is very likely to be completed in the timely manner prescribed. \n\nThere may even be added benefits, in that although the proposal budgets for a very realistic amount of output, they mention that they will not charge any extra for additional work they provide. Meaning the proposal is likely under-rating how much they will put out; a win for the Catalyst and Cardano community. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "By virtue of month 1 of the project creating and launching their YouTube channel, everything thereafter such as views and engagement by commenting or sharing should be very easy to audit for the KPIs. The proposers explain what results to expect every month of the way, so additionally to an auditor following or verifying the team\u2019s reporting, any community member should be able to check in as well on output volume. \n\nI expect that the team will check in with Catalyst along the way to provide some updates additional to what is freely visible to the public, for instance in the first month which Master Translators were selected and how far the YouTube or social media channels are into creation.

This kind of defeats the purpose of reaching out to new communities.\n\nIf this is the case I have done a rudimentary research on number of people speaking each language to help the voters make an informed decision.

At a proposal level that is $7100 budget with $2000 contingency. \nMy project planning head immediately points to the 28% contingency. It is not clear what this is set aside for. A risk of ADA price fluctuation is noted in the proposals, however one of the proposed mitigations for that is a 10% contingency, the other being to sell funds privately to ADA holders.\nIn addition the proposals states \u201cWe have ample resources to complete the project on time and within budget\u2019, once again raising the question on the need for such a large contingency in proportion to the budget?\n\n  \nNow looking at what is to be delivered.\nEach proposal states the YouTube channel will be launched with 6 videos.

All languages cannot be done by same people or same social media campaign.  This is why we broke up. Smaller proposals enable people to clearly see we are not here to grab money.   Each language needs its unique Social media campaign to reach people.  We cannot lump everything into one.   \n\nSecondly Why consider the total ask?  The rules state that each proposal has to be considered on its own merit.  Therefore even if  i had a hundred language proposals, if i had a hundred teams of two Master Translators and Two Proofreaders, then it will get the job done. We are doing this for 25 years buddy.   We know exactly how to run a translation project.\n\n\n\nHe goes on\nThe proposer claims to have many years experience in this field but this is impossible to verify based on the evidence (LinkedIn profile) provided.

It states clearly as follows\nThe number of people required to complete this task has been calculated.  \nWe will be using our inhouse resources as well as obtain our Master Translator Partner network to handle overflow of work to ensure that our deliverables remain on track. They would be brought on board as and when needed and budget would include their costs\n\nI can see clearly that this assessor is merely following the wrong ideas of some CAs to say that the feasibility is not good because they believe I alone  is doing Or Mr Muthiah D is doing,  the translations or this internal team is doing the translation of all the 10 languages.  This is completely WRONG.  As mentioned above we are using our External partners who are Master Translators with many years of experience and qualifications in translating as Native speakers of Tamil both in Sri Lanka and India. So his feasibility assessment is wrong. \n\nHow the budget was calculated has been clearly laid out as follows.. if he claims he has read the other proposals he will know that we are doing 15000 words per project. Each word costs 0.08 for complete translation to voicing. This cost comes to 1200 and into 3 months it is 3600.  Then this language needs its own Social media campaign since the users of one language would not care about social media campaigns in another language. So all languages cannot be lumped together to do one campaign.  The cost of that being 1500..  Then for contingency we have allocated 2000.    \nSome specific statements that are absolute nonsense=\nHowever, because the primary responsibility of this position is to translate text from English to Tamil, the proposer should include more specific information on their translators' expertise in their Master Translator Partner Network.   As stated we have been doing projects for over 25 years. The definition of Master translator if this assessor doesn't understand is a MASTER OF HIS CRAFT.  A SENIOR IN THE INDUSTRY.   Each one will have different qualifications.  As for our specific master translator, he is the ONLY ONE IN SRI LANKA to write for the Mahawamsa which is like the BIBLE OF HISTORY of SRI LANKA for over 4000 years. It has been written from the time of kings.  This is a role that he alone in Sri Lanka has.

The team KPI clearly defines the success of the proposal through the number of views, number of followers, shares... The idea given by the author is great, effectively solving the challenge, If this project is funded I believe the project will be very successful, it will have a good impact on making more people aware of Cardano.
