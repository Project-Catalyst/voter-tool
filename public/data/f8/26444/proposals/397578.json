I say that it does not meet 100% of what we are looking for because Vietnam is not located in the geographical region targeted by the challenge, East Asia, but close to it. However, I believe that it is always good to make content related to the Cardano ecosystem accessible to the most varied number of people, and the most solid barrier we face in this process is linguistics. I am sure that Vietnam is a very strategic country for us to invest in, I say this because I have already evaluated several proposals aimed at it in the previous fund, it is a country that has a lot of activity in the cryptographic world. Instruction is never enough, so in the application there could be a guide with basic concepts about the Cardano ecosystem, such as what cryptocurrency, blockchain and a pool are, in order to clarify this initial part in case someone downloads the application out of curiosity but doesn't know it well. indeed to Cardano. I think the project will succeed because it is not something new, the author already has this application translated into several languages, according to himself; what would happen here would be just another version of a project that is successful. As much as it is not focused on the geographic point we want to invest in, I believe that by being close it would have an effect as necessary, increasing the number of Ada holders, transactions on our blockchain, delegations in community pools, etc. are the objectives of the current challenge. So I'll give it 4 stars (I would give it 5 if it was geared towards an East Asian country/language). \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "We have the necessary information, but not to a degree of detail that I find satisfactory. I will explain: we know that the project will be executed by two people, the developer and the translator. Despite having a lot of experience and a successful application, we lack accurate information about who the author is. What's your name, academic background, example of other apps he's developed (I'd like to see them on my phone's play store), how does this person relate to the Cardano ecosystem? As much as he claims to be experienced and successful, it is always good to see examples of the work of the people involved in practice. And about the translator, I think the same; who would it be? How would you be selected? Does he have any knowledge about blockchain? What are examples of your previous work? I think trust is passed on to the bidder by the fact that the app already exists, but it would be even more interesting if we had a complete picture of who he is and his translator. Regarding the process, it is not detailed how long each of the two activities would take to happen. The development of this project should be specified in weeks, or months, I believe it would not take that long to do it since it is not highly complex, but a more detail would help the CAs, vCAs and voters to have a more solid view of the process . And about the budget, it's a low value for the standard of Catalyst proposals, but as we don't know how long this work would last we can't know the hourly value of those involved. Therefore, I suggest that such details be included, so that we can have a deeper understanding of the whole. We have what it takes, but not in such a detailed way as to be great. That doesn't mean it's not a viable enough proposal, what I said were some suggestions on how to improve it. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Finally, when we talk about auditability, we know how to objectively measure the success of this proposal. This would happen through the amount of app downloads by the population of Vietnam. But as I have suggested for other translations of this same project, I think it is important that we always do a human analysis in parallel with numerical statistics. I think this could be done in two ways: one more immediate and the other long term. Thinking immediately, surveys could be carried out in the app itself, after just a few days of use, to collect data such as: are users participating in other ways in the activities of the Cardano ecosystem, beyond the app? Are people getting to understand, even if not so deeply, how the cryptographic world works? Are they participating in Catalyst? And in the long run, the author could contact those same users via email to do a deeper analysis, with those same questions but a little more specifically, perhaps. Could an analysis of the overall picture of Cardano Vietnam also be carried out, has the community there intensified its activities? Maybe the media started to give more space to our blockchain, was there an increase, even if small, of investment in the Ada currency? It would also be important for us to follow the process beyond the results, and this would be done more effectively if the author had established a detailed timeline on the feasibility part. In addition, auditability exists, although it is more focused on numbers, it is not a complex proposal, so its monitoring should not be that difficult either. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 8, "ng": 0, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 357, "q0": "A notable way to increase interest around the Cardano ecosystem is to promote ways to allocate earnings to ADA.
