The \"Dummies\" branding and very basic style is a little too simple to do anything for the Catalyst ecosystem or Stake Pool operators in East Asia. The proposer/author does not go into the planned content in enough detail to convince me that this book will have a meaningful enough impact to justify funding the relatively large chunk of the available funding it is asking for. One third of the time needed to complete the project will be spend on researching blockchain and Cardano, so proposing a little bit later and maybe with a partner or co-proposer from the community may have boosted the quality and cost effectiveness of the proposal.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Various social media profiles linked on the proposer's website do not work (\"this account does not exist\") and the only book published by the author is very short at 59 pages and ranks only 6 million or so on Amazon, which is given as a reference in the proposal. The website of the proposer however looks good and there clearly is a lot of artistic and creative talent involved. The budget breakdown is a little rough and seems on the expensive side, and no credible references are made to people or organizations that may be used to aid in creating this project - like publisher, other blockchain influencers or publishers that could help, the community in the Philippines or East Asia, other Catalyst proposals or communities. This project does have promise, but should have done more research and been more open to collaborate.

The metrics presented however leave a lot to be desired. 20 survey responses for content do not seem enough data to judge the onboarding the research process by as the author has no previous experience with Cardano and needs to research basic content before beginning the project. The binary metric (book published or not) is also not ideal, and a more thorough process with other parties involved to realized the project could have improved the auditability tremendously.

However, in order for this book to reach a wide audience, be widely accepted, and achieve Cardano's goal of expanding the community, it takes a lot of work from the proponent.
