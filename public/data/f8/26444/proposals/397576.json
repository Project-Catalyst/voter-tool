However, the Proposer mentions needing to seek out a professional translation service, which suggests that it is only partially planned out, and that the main component of this project \u2013 the translation \u2013 is still incomplete. \n\nThe tech side of things for this is great and already complete, but the lack of a team being spelled out in the Proposal and mostly just advertising the number of downloads that the app has had limits its Feasibility. Having translated the app to several other languages already boosts confidence that it can become a reality, but I would have liked to see more details broken down in the proposal. \n\nFurther, while solo work is respectable and amazing, this project appears to have only one team member, one Proposer, and one person to do all the work, which means there may become other stressors holding the project back; reducing the resilience of the project. \n\nSomething that I am unsure how to feel about is that the budget breakdown in Feasibility calculates out to $1,500 + $400 = $1,900, however the Requested Funds for the Proposal is listed as $2,100. While that is only $200 among a Challenge that offers $150,000 available, the discrepancy between pieces of this Proposal suggest incomplete work, that may benefit from a more careful analysis and revision in subsequent Funding rounds, when I hope to see this project submitted again to become a reality. For this discrepancy I have to count off. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "(This Proposal is very similar, nearly identical, to several others, therefore I acknowledge that my Assessment is likely to be flagged by the similarity bot). \n\n\nThe only piece that I see to audit the progress of this project is the very final end result, not the steps along the way to track its development. While it is a rather simple goal \u2013 just the translation of a relatively simple app \u2013 not seeing KPIs along the way such as a successful translation team being found, words translated so far along the way, I find it hard to rate this project higher in auditability. \nIn future proposals, which I hope will still happen and will still benefit Catalyst down the line, I would encourage this Proposer to spell out each step of the way piece by piece, so that there are more components for auditors to track or follow the progress of this project with. \n\nWhile it does not impact or change the auditability of this project, and while it may have been a slip-up in the moment, I find it notable that this Proposal\u2019s Auditability section mentions that success looks like \u201cThousands of Thai-speaking users in Africa will download and use the application\u2026\u201d yet Thailand is a country in Southeast Asia and the Thai language is native to only Thailand and surrounding areas, which is not within 5,200km (3,200 miles) of Africa. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1446", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 5, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 7304, "q0": "The proposal doesn't fit 100% for the challenge because it intends to translate an app that helps people buy Ada and delegate in pools to Thai, and Thailand is not exactly in the geographic region that we are targeting in this challenge. However, I think that if we are to think about Asia as a whole and the need to bring the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem to different areas and people, I still think it's worth funding it, especially since the app already exists so it wouldn't be something totally starting from the zero, and from what the proponent says it is well evaluated, that is, it would be a good business to expand it. Thailand is not an area where cryptographic activity is that intense, as far as I know, I apologize if I'm wrong, but I'm already in the community, I have 4 Catalyst funds and this is the first time I've evaluated any proposal aimed at that country . That's good and bad, I believe. It is good because we will be taking an application in the local language to territories that are not well supported in terms of knowledge about blockchain technologies, which can be a great boost for people to start taking an interest in the activity. It would be important, in my opinion, to include a small guide that talks about the main concepts of the cryptographic world in the application. Here's the suggestion: as soon as the person registered, an infographic would automatically appear on the screen that explained through images about what blockchain, Cardano, Ada, a pool and etc. are. Sometimes people go after these things because they think they will profit exponentially, but I believe that we all need to have a broader view of what Cardano is all about so that we can understand where we fit in in the community and how we can help blockchain, at the same time as investments and we managed to get some financial benefit out of it. If this little guide were inserted into the app, I believe it would be a good way (obviously it wouldn't teach anything beyond the basics, but it's a start). That said, I will give it four stars because, despite not being a country in East Asia, it is close and the more translations of Cardano-related content we finance, the better, in my opinion, since the language barrier is the main impediment to the mass expansion of the our blockchain. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The auto claims that he already has 10 years of experience with the development of mobile applications and that some of them have millions of downloads, but it would be interesting for him to tell us more. For example, what apps are these? It would be amazing if he left the link for them on the play store / apple store, so that it was possible to know his work in practice. He'll do the development work, probably, it would be nice if he could tell us how that would go. And about the translator, I believe that finding a translator from English to Thai is not as fast as it is for languages \u200b\u200blike Spanish and French, where many translators work with it. It is entirely possible to find someone who is qualified, but I would like to know about this selection process, or even better, if the bidder already has a few candidates in mind. It would be important to see previous examples of his work, that is, to analyze his resume, just to convey more confidence in the project team. Regarding the script, it would be nice if he had provided a schedule of how long this work would last, this would even help to audit the proposal, as I will talk about in the topic below. Anyway, without understanding how this work would be divided based on the passage of time, it is a little difficult to visualize the process. Even if it is a simpler task, where only two professionals would be involved, this notion of development would be interesting to have. And finally, as far as the budget is concerned, it is divided between the work of the developer and the translator, it is not complex, but a suggestion I can make is to determine the price of the hour of work - for that we would need to know how much How long would this translation take? For example, $1500 would go towards translation, right? But how long would that take, 1 week, 1 month? Depending on the time spent on this, we could have a better idea if the requested value was fair. In general, the feasibility of this proposal is good because of two factors: the author certainly knows what he is doing since he has a lot of previous experience and this would be an extension of something that already exists, and also because it is not a complex project . However, the suggestions I made could improve this part of the proposal even further, in my opinion, because details are never unnecessary. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of the proposal is simple, the proposer indicates how we could monitor the success of the project based on the numbers of downloads of the application by speaking Thai, but I think he was wrong in the part that says that this audience is in Africa, because the Thailand is in Asia... right? Anyway, this is a pretty straightforward way to check if the main goal has been achieved, but I think we could do a little more analysis. Is it possible to measure the impact of this translation if we think about the more human aspects of the thing, for example, there was a survey in the app itself about whether these new users are able to understand the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem? Have they become interested in our blockchain to the point of doing other activities besides investing in Ada? For example, did they find out about Catalyst? Did they become CAs, bidders? Did they study about the cryptographic world, perhaps? That way, I think we would have a deeper understanding of the impact of translation on the selected target audience. But I also advise that we follow up on the translation process itself, if it is being done as promised, in the time it was planned, if the results of the process (not just the product) are within the limits. It would be positive if a Thai-speaking Cardano ecosystem member himself liaised with the project team (developer and translator) and brought feedback to the rest of the community. As in the previous topic about feasibility, I think this one is satisfactory, but I advise a further level of depth to understand the real impacts of translating this application on speakers of the language in question. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 8, "ng": 0, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 356, "q0": "Proposals designated for this fund must assume that the purpose of the idea is to increase the influence of Cardano's ecosystem in regions where this technology has been little publicized until then.\n\nWith the main objective of translating an application relevant to Cardano into Thai, we see that the proposal fits the scope of the challenge. In fact, this is not a fundamentally innovative idea, but it is possible to easily observe what its impacts would be in the short term, but also in the medium, long term.\n\nThe purpose of the app is to provide its users with possibilities of stacking pools for the allocation of ADA. In the short term, those who already own the cryptocurrency will have more options on how to make this allocation and in the medium/long term, with the disclosure of Cardano, the expectation is that more projects will emerge in the Thai community and this flow of cryptocurrency allocations (and the yield of pools) is even higher.\n\nWe noticed that despite some occasional lack of information, the general idea is well structured, as well as the amount of capital requested is quite fair, let's see these points below.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "We see that the budget breakdown focuses on two main steps, the transaction costs, totaling $1,500, and the development cost, representing $400.

One detail that was missing information here was the availability of some form of verification of the curriculum of this developer. This would not be such an impressive detail since the translation and development task to be carried out is relatively simple. However, given the history of other similar proposals by the author, which also did not present this information, we believe that this flaw could have been corrected.\n\nIt would be interesting if images were also available in the proposal to see the result of the translation of this application into other languages, proving the high chance of success of the current proposal.
