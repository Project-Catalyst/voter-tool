Cardano in Thai is a great idea to help Cardano reach this market of more than 80 million people. The translation of IOHK documents into Thai will help the crypto community in this country have the opportunity to study more deeply about the Cardano platform, thereby participating in the Cardano community as well as creating a premise for them. can start with Catalyst.

The $7100 budget is also used transparently and reasonably by the team. I greatly appreciate this. In addition, the group's KPIs are very complete, but I have a small suggestion that the team needs to give more specific numbers so that the community can easily measure.

How many new members will join Catalyst with roles such as CA, vCA, etc. I believe that if specific numbers are given, the community will appreciate it more.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1213", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 1, "ng": 10, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "\n\nThanks for your fair review. if we make it you too are part of what made us succeed.

Expanding Cardano content by rendering it more accessible to the roughly 60 Million Thai speakers across the globe, particularly Cambodia and Thailand, as the proposal focuses on, should provide fertile ground for expanding not just a more decentralized stake pool operation network, but also wallets, and teams ready to propose from these East Asian areas. \nNaturally the beneficiaries of this project will all be East Asian folks, by virtue of IOHK, Emurgo, and Cardano Foundation translation projects rendering speakers of East Asian languages more empowered to join our ecosystem, including even their Deaf by virtue of including subtitles which will also thus encompass their writing system. \n\nHaving developers and minds like these welcomed into Cardano and Catalyst spaces is sure to increase participation and help projects as a whole, while also likely yielding developers to code projects in the future as well. \n\nMoreover, with roughly 60 different languages being spoken across Thailand, making our content available in Thai seems like a great gateway to future projects involving myriad other less-common languages or that may further help communities in dire poverty, which is again right in line with the main goals of this Campaign; helping young and developing economies to grow. \n\nThe proposer shared the SDG rating, and nearly all goals are impacted, therefore this again seems like a project that is very well-suited to grow East Asia and grow Cardano. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "While the referenced YouTube channel has yet to launch, a quite reasonable pace of publishing content has been set.

Hence it is almost impossible to write 19 distinct assessments, I have tried to find specific differentiators but have also looked at the package of proposals as a whole as, I believe, this will add greater value to the voter.

A risk of ADA price fluctuation is noted in the proposals, however one of the proposed mitigations for that is a 10% contingency, the other being to sell funds privately to ADA holders.\nIn addition the proposals states \u201cWe have ample resources to complete the project on time and within budget\u2019, once again raising the question on the need for such a large contingency in proportion to the budget?\n\n  \nNow looking at what is to be delivered.\nEach proposal states the YouTube channel will be launched with 6 videos.

We know exactly how to run a translation project.\n\n\n\nHe goes on\nThe proposer claims to have many years experience in this field but this is impossible to verify based on the evidence (LinkedIn profile) provided. The other key resource (Muthiah) presents as a trilingual translator.\nI have stated as below, we have and use our extensive network of Master Translator Partners.\n\nThe assessor has not read the proposal. It states clearly as follows\nThe number of people required to complete this task has been calculated.  \nWe will be using our inhouse resources as well as obtain our Master Translator Partner network to handle overflow of work to ensure that our deliverables remain on track. They would be brought on board as and when needed and budget would include their costs\n\nI can see clearly that this assessor is merely following the wrong ideas of some CAs to say that the feasibility is not good because they believe I alone  is doing Or Mr Muthiah D is doing,  the translations or this internal team is doing the translation of all the 10 languages.  This is completely WRONG.  As mentioned above we are using our External partners who are Master Translators with many years of experience and qualifications in translating as Native speakers of Tamil both in Sri Lanka and India. So his feasibility assessment is wrong. \n\nHow the budget was calculated has been clearly laid out as follows.. if he claims he has read the other proposals he will know that we are doing 15000 words per project. Each word costs 0.08 for complete translation to voicing. This cost comes to 1200 and into 3 months it is 3600.  Then this language needs its own Social media campaign since the users of one language would not care about social media campaigns in another language. So all languages cannot be lumped together to do one campaign.  The cost of that being 1500..  Then for contingency we have allocated 2000.    \nSome specific statements that are absolute nonsense=\nHowever, because the primary responsibility of this position is to translate text from English to Tamil, the proposer should include more specific information on their translators' expertise in their Master Translator Partner Network.   As stated we have been doing projects for over 25 years. The definition of Master translator if this assessor doesn't understand is a MASTER OF HIS CRAFT.  A SENIOR IN THE INDUSTRY.   Each one will have different qualifications.  As for our specific master translator, he is the ONLY ONE IN SRI LANKA to write for the Mahawamsa which is like the BIBLE OF HISTORY of SRI LANKA for over 4000 years. It has been written from the time of kings.  This is a role that he alone in Sri Lanka has. So this assessor is talking nonsense\nPlease filter him out.\n \n"}, {"id": 8028, "q0": "(\"The author writes the proposal in different countries, but the content will mostly be the same, so when I analyze the project, there will be similar sentences\").

Whether the speakers of the language have a strong preference for local content, prefer videos or podcasts and so on has not been analyzed, and a very similar cost is assumed for each language in the 7k USD ballpark.
