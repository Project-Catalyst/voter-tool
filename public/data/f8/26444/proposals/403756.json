As one of the true seven countries of East Asia,Taiwanese are more introverted and don't like to compete with others, so they seldom participate in Catalyst projects and give the opportunity to others, so that is why there are so many projects from other countries try to get the fund from this Challenge, which I believe cannot really be promoted to people from these countries.
