With the team's solution of marketing SPO, NFT, and Cardano to NGOs, local culture is a smart way to get cardano to reach a large population that is unknown to web3 and Blockchain, unaware of Blockchain benefits, staking, SPO. The team proposes to leverage the NFT topic to reach more people; organize online seminars and SPO, NFT, Cardano for the community of artists, musicians, dancers. This is aimed at an audience of writers and artists who are completely unaware of technology, their access to blockchain is difficult work, so it is better to approach them as blockchain users.\nThe risk presented is that the coordination to organize the seminars is heavy so project management skills and experience play an important role in the success of this project. The proposal also provided a solution, detailing the implementation roadmap, appropriate budget allocation... I think they anticipated the tasks and risks to achieve the proposal's success.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposed group has given each specific work and has a detailed plan for each week.

It is even complete with a timeline or time for each activity process. It also shows that all the social media that are most often used by millennials are put to good use to expand promotions. But we don't see Facebook, which is also still widely used in developing countries, whose insight has the potential to promote wider content because it can also post to Instagram.\n\nFor SPO series video content for beginners, apart from providing knowledge about SPO, it would be nice to briefly explain what cardano is in general, although there are many videos on Youtube that explain this.\n\nThe budget is also very complete for each stage or sub-activity.

This proposal explains clearly on how they will implement such solution in details, from activities with SPO and CNFT community with workshops, to engagement between NGOs, artists, and local communities.
