This country is not located exactly in the geographic region targeted by the challenge, therefore, it will not specifically help to develop it, as is our objective here. It is a country close to Thailand; according to the author, about 50 million people speak this language. It would be interesting, however, to present the source of this information, some statistics that can prove the proponent's words, I believe that's it, but as it is a language a little less known by the general public, I think it would be important to have the source of this research. Other than that, I think it's a project that has everything to work out, due to the fact that the author already has the app, so it would be an extension of it, expanding it to new audiences and democratizing knowledge about how to acquire Ada and delegate them in a pool. Myanmar is really a country I don't know so I can't say how strong the crypto community is there, but it would be nice if the proponent included a basic guide on what Cardano is all about when users log into the app. This could introduce the subject if someone happens to download the app out of curiosity (I don't think that will be the case, but it's always good to be on guard). This guide could explain initial concepts like what is blockchain, Ada, Cardano, a pool and etc. Finally, although the country and language in focus here are not exactly what we are looking for in the challenge (favoring East Asian countries, educating their residents about Cardano ecosystem technologies, thus favoring people and blockchain at the same time) it is still a very positive proposal that could help the ecosystem to expand. I will give 3 stars because 1) Myanmar is not the target of the challenge 2) I would like some extra information about this country/language. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The author is certainly well prepared to run this project successfully, because he already has some successful apps, according to him. It would be even better if he made available in the proposal links through which we could see these apps in the play store / apple store, so we would see in practice proof of his work. He could have included more information about himself here, such as his professional background (he is a developer, but what kind of developer? What is his connection with the Cardano ecosystem?) and what was the process of creating the application in question, which will be translated into Burmese. Now let's talk about the translator: as it is a less widespread language, it will be important to find a qualified professional, preferably a native of Myanmar, to do this translation work. Due to the specificity of the language, I would like the tenderer to present us with some candidates for the job, in order to verify if this person would be qualified for it. It would be important for us to know a little about his curriculum, in addition to the translation itself, would this person have any knowledge about the Cardano ecosystem? Regarding the script, the proponent did not include a timeline through which we could understand the development process of this project, whether through weeks, months, etc. It's a simple task, I see that he has launched several proposals to translate his application into different languages, but I would like to understand exactly how the work routine of the professionals involved would be. This would give us more clarity regarding the visualization of the process. And about the budget, it is a small amount in relation to the funding requested in the other proposals, but as I mentioned in the other cases of translation of this application, it would be important to know the total time that the developer and the translator would be working on it, that way we could calculate the hourly rate of work or monitor whether the asking price is fair. In general, the author provides us with the necessary information to understand what would happen, all that was needed was to better explain how it would happen and who, in essence, are the people who would work here? \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As in the other proposals by this author to translate his app, he points out numerical data that serve to measure the success of the project, which is important and necessary. But auditability can go further, there are more humane ways, let's say, of analyzing whether the project is achieving the desired impact. As I also suggest for other translations, a user survey could be carried out to understand whether Burmese speakers, in addition to being supported in the issue of purchasing and delegating Ada, would be interested in other technologies of the Cardano ecosystem. If so, would they be able to understand about, for example, Catalyst, how to participate, where they fit in, etc? I think it would be important to establish some kind of contact with this audience. This research can be done through the application itself or, also, another idea I had: contact them via email, some time later, in order to establish this bridge. They will be supported by the application and from this input we can understand if they would in fact be entering the cryptographic world, but specifically Cardano. The translation process would also need to be analyzed, we would need to verify that the work was being developed as promised, this can be done through a member of the Cardano community, a native of Myanmar. This person could stay in touch with the team and provide sporadic feedback to the rest of the Cardano community, as well as review the final product, ie the translated app. Anyway, there is a possibility of auditing this proposal, even if we can go further with this monitoring. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal aims to translate into Burmese a tool that shows options for allocating earnings in different pools. It is only natural that with Cardano's growing visibility and scope, more and more people are willing to learn about how to invest their earnings with the platform. And the more translations there are for tools like Pool Peek Mobile, the more people will be included in this learning process. Thus, we see that the proposal fits the goals of the challenge and can positively impact Cardano's ecosystem in the medium and long term. Regarding the budget being requested for the project, we realized that it is a fair value, as it follows the same range of values requested in other similar translation proposals. In fact, the amount that will be spent here on translation is higher than in other cases, but we also note that the language in question is also less common.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Despite being an important idea, we noticed that it does not need a very complex plan to be executed, and the detailing of the steps described in the feasibility is not very detailed. The biggest challenge for the work to carry out the translation of the application is an adequate translation of the existing terms, in line with this, we realize that the biggest expense is exactly with this translation phase, $2,800.\n\nFor this, it was indicated that a professional translation service will be used, but it would be interesting to indicate what this service would be, to answer some questions such as, has this service been used previously by the team? Does it perform well when translating financial terms?\n\nAbout the amount that will be spent on the development itself, $400, we realize that this is a coherent value, as the work would be quite straightforward, since the application is already built and developed by an experienced person. It was even possible to find the developer contact on the google play store: support@colorworkapps.com\n\nAn observation that seems valid to be mentioned here is that similar proposals for translation into other languages \u200b\u200bwere also stated, so the application will have an objective of really reaching a great diversity of cultures. Given this, it would be interesting to allocate a number of resources later to promote the marketing of this one.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The ways to verify the completion of the project and the perception of success that exists around it are consistent with what is expected of this modification carried out in the application.

For example: $2800 translation cost, how will you spend it? For how many people? In how long? You also need to make your proposal's KPIs more specific in terms of numbers so that it can be easily measured by the community. Example: How many downloads will this app get?

Having translated the app to several other languages already boosts confidence that it can become a reality, but I would have liked to see more details broken down in the proposal. \n\nFurther, while solo work is respectable and amazing, this project appears to have only one team member, one Proposer, and one person to do all the work, which means there may become other stressors holding the project back; reducing the resilience of the project. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The only piece that I see to audit the progress of this project is the very final end result, not the steps along the way to track its development.
