Our objective here is to finance projects that can benefit East Asian countries and their residents, generating employment opportunities in the technology field or even as CAs and vCAs by Catalyst, in other words, helping the inhabitants of the countries of this geographic region. to be able to work and earn an income through Cardano's opportunities; educate local populations about what blockchain is, what is the difference between ours and others, educate them about the advantages of buying and delegating Ada, in short, favoring them in different ways through the possibilities found in our community. This in alignment, of course, with the benefit of the Cardano ecosystem, after all we would be funding projects and we need to have some kind of return, which in this case is to popularize our blockchain in East Asia, make it grow there, so that new people join the community and investments increase. In this case, the present proposal even promises to popularize the teachings about Cardano through content released on instagram, but that would be for the Indonesian public, which is not in the geographic region that is the focus of the challenge. I also think that the asking value of 6k is a little high for what was promised, so that the marketing of this page is intensified. There is already a lot of content about Cardano, especially in English, on youtube, I confess that on instagram we don't have such a strong base, much less if it's for the Indonesian audience. In this sense, in fact, the proposal is innovative and important, as it would help bring content relevant to our ecosystem to a different audience, and one of the goals of our blockchain is to make it accessible to everyone, democratic, and undoubtedly the biggest barrier that we find is linguistics. Therefore, I think that if two things were different here, this proposal deserved a maximum grade: if the amount requested in the financing was more adequate for the activities developed (I say this based on many proposals that I evaluated, usually they all separate a part for marketing , but not as high as 6k); and if this instagram profile was aimed at a specific audience in East Asia, as the challenge aims, whether in Japan, China, etc. Therefore, I will give it 3 stars, reinforcing that the idea is good but does not align perfectly with the specific objectives of the challenge. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The viability of this project is average, in my opinion, but let's go in parts. Starting with the script, there is a schedule here that explains the main tasks to be carried out in the project, and this is done through bimesters, that is, what will happen in the first and second month / third and fourth. It is the beginning of what we need to understand how the development process of this project would take place, but the level of detail should be better. Since the project will last a total of 4 months and all activities will revolve around marketing, it would be quite possible for the team to provide us with a more detailed schedule. It could be divided by months and those months into weeks, pointing out exactly what would happen in each week. This way, we would have a more solid view of the project development process. Some of the tasks highlighted here are quite abstract, like the first one, which is to improve the design. I see that the page already has a designer and that she will continue to work on the team during the project, but what exactly does she intend to change in her work so that the profile view is better? What kind of improvements does it aim to establish and in what ways can it achieve them? A certain task is \u201cdesigning goodies\u201d, what do you mean? Were they perhaps gifts given to followers in some sort of contest? In the second quarter they say that they will distribute some gifts like hats, t-shirts and etc, to spread our blockchain. But we don't know exactly where these gifts would be distributed, who would receive them and so on. Could it be the followers themselves? Would the gifts be sent by mail or does the team intend to have a face-to-face meeting with people? I would like more clarification on some of the tasks performed during the project, to improve the general understanding. Regarding the budget, it is very detailed, which is a positive point, although the amount asked in my opinion is high for the project, some parts of the payment could also be better explained, such as \u201cothers\u201d (we could have an idea more specific than that part would be). And about the team, finally, we have 3 people involved, a designer, the project manager and a logistics and purchasing specialist. Apart from the case of the manager, it is not very clear if other people have a solid involvement with the Cardano ecosystem, the designer would be responsible for the concept and look of the profile, but does she have any other connection with Cardano outside of this work on instagram? Does she actively work in the community? And about the purchasing and logistics specialist, it is not said at any time what his connection to our blockchain is. About this part, so I think there could be more clarity on this point and also a more detailed curriculum of the entire team, with the aim of increasing our confidence in their preparations to make the project work, in addition to their linkedin profiles, if any. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In my opinion, the auditability of this proposal is possible but not ideal. I say this because the team provides us with mostly numerical indicators to monitor the success of the project (number of new followers, number of new people on Telegram and increase in follower engagement). These are clear ways to see if the team's social media growth is succeeding, but we actually need to go further. I have two suggestions. In order to better understand the impact of the project, in addition to knowing how many more people are on social media, it would be interesting if we knew how they would be relating to the Cardano ecosystem. Did they start to acquire Ada, delegate them to some pool in our community? Have they become active participants in the sense of attending the various meetings of our community, such as the Town Halls? Do they now participate in Catalyst, are they aware of the existence of projects like the Catalys School that aim to help new members work with CAs, for example? It would be very positive for us to do a qualitative analysis, in addition to a quantitative one, of the new followers, so that we could more deeply measure the impact of this project on our blockchain. And in relation to the process, it is possible to monitor it properly, in my opinion, because there are two ways here: follow the Github that would be created and also if the tasks promised for each two months were being done on time and in the right way. It would be even better if the schedule was detailed in weeks and if the activities themselves were more broken down, as I explained in the analysis topic 2. However, I agree that, yes, there are possible ways to audit the process. So I'll give it 4 stars, since auditability can happen based on the information given, although it can be more efficient and detailed with some improvements. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 7, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 335, "q0": "We realize that the proposal defined here fits the scope of the challenge, since it has the purpose of disseminating knowledge about Cardano in a new location that currently has little engagement. The main objective of the proposal is to increase the interest of the people of Indonesia in Cardano's ideals, through the growth of the CardanoIndonesia profile on instagram.\n\nIn this regard, we were able to perceive that the idea, although not necessarily innovative, has an important aspect for the medium/long term evolution of interest in the Cardano ecosystem in the region. The fact that the idea launched here is not so complex also matches the amount requested, $6000.\n\nThus, we will analyze if this amount is adequate for the steps to be developed during the project and if the strategies adopted and professionals involved can point out good practices for the growth of this instagram profile and, consequently, of Cardano in Indonesia.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal started with a good initial idea, and we were able to see that the concepts worked on in the topic \u2018Feasibility\u2019 are relevant and have, together, the real possibility of making the CardanoIndonesia profile reach greater visibility and relevance. The professionals involved also indicate that they have relevant experience for the activity, such as experience with graphic design by Olivia Priskie and with project management by Jordy Vincent.\n\nIn addition, LinkedIn addresses were provided for us to view their resumes. As a positive point, it is possible to say that the indicated knowledge of each professional can be used together and cover well the needs of the project at that moment.\n\nWe have that each phase and the budget assigned to each of them seems quite reasonable, for example, for the construction of the posts to be published I expect to spend a total of $900, for project management the forecast is $1000. What seems to be missing here is actually a stronger indicator of how these strategies will actually be executed.\n\nFor example, regarding the new posts that will be published, it would be possible to create some and make their images available in the proposal, so that we can better understand the new dissemination strategy and the persuasion that will be followed. Regarding the products that will be developed to promote Cardano, it would also be interesting to be able to visualize some of them, such as prototypes of the design of shirts and caps.\n\nGiven the other initiatives with similar purposes that are also in this category of challenge, a good idea would be to try to adopt a joint strategy with one of them.\n\nIn summary, we have that the objective steps are clear and have detail, but it would be interesting to improve them a little more.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In the scope of how these achievements can actually be ascertained, very complex or elaborate metrics are not really necessary.

However, the idea of \u200b\u200bcreating a github where people can check the progress is a little vague and could be more detailed.\n\nAdditionally, it would be interesting, as mentioned above, to seek partnerships with other projects from this or previous funds on how to increase engagement in locations where Cardano still does not have relevant penetration.

Starting from content production, interactive marketing up until content creation.\n\nJordy's proposal also includes realistic timeline (4 months) to do several interactives events via Instagram stories within these months. Including also the interactive marketing using promotional merchandise.\n\nIt's quite interesting also because the proposal also provide/identify the risks & challenges, so it shows that the team considered what to do if they face problems during the progress if they get funded.\n\nI am quite optimistic that Jordy & his team will deliver the proposal on time and within the scope that the proposal has written.

So that we could prove that their works are really done at the end. \n\nAside from that, it would be great if the team provide numbers on their KPI, so public know how to measure their achievement (for example: increase new followers from 500 to 1000).

Indonesia is a huge market for Cardano because there are many people who could get involved in many different ways, from general users, to stake pool operators, to proposers. Social media is a great way to attract newcomers because there are no boundaries with social media \u2013 the proposers can interact with people all throughout Indonesia on social media, so they aren\u2019t limited to only in-person content or events. Awareness leads to more users, which eventually will lead to the desired outcomes that the challenge setting aims to achieve. While it may take a while, slowly building the user base of Cardano into Indonesia will greatly benefit the Cardano ecosystem. Good engagement, which it seems like the proposers have already started on, will be important to encourage an engaged user base who will want to participate in the ecosystem. I agree with the proposers in that it may be challenging to reach new users since they might not be interested in Cardano simply because they do not know about it. However, the proposers could potentially use some other methods, in combination with their current social media accounts, to reach out to new Indonesian communities. I would encourage the proposers to consider using their account to reach out to other groups and organizations, such as schools or community groups to build relationships. This way, the proposers aren\u2019t casting a net out into the void of social media and hoping to catch a few individuals here or there.

The proposers have set realistic goals that can be achieved in the given timeframes, such as the two bi-weekly posts and the merchandise creation. The proposers have also provided a good breakdown of the funds needed to complete this project. While I do not have prior experience in social media marketing, the funds requested seem reasonable for the scope of the project. The proposers have considered some potential challenges they might face, but they have not exactly mentioned how they could counteract those challenges (reaching out to new community members \u2013 see my impact rationale for a potential solution). I also do have one question for the proposers: How exactly do they plan to give out the merchandise they create? If they are operating from behind a social media account, will they ship the goodies to fans? Or will there eventually be in-person events? If the proposers could answer this question, it would greatly strengthen the proposal.

The proposers have acknowledged that it is hard to justify success for this kind of project, but I would encourage the proposers to set more numerically based KPIs, such as a specific target goal of how many additional followers per month, rather than just a vague \u201cincrease.\u201d In my mind, any specific number would be sufficient. This way, the cardano community can have more concrete evidence to see that the proposal was successful.

This keeps the community more involved while giving the team enough time to come up with the next idea for posting.\nFor example, during one of the IG live sessions, you can offer a free Cardano Indonesia T-shirt/Mug raffled to one lucky winner amongst everyone that joins the discord group. Same with Twitter followers.\nTo add to that, I noticed that the YouTube channel already has 17 subscribers even without any content posted. Based on this, I assume there is a demand for youtube content. I really do think recording live IG sessions and posting them on YouTube is a zero cost way to increase content interactions on YouTube.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team seems well equipped to implement the proposal based on their roles and experience. They also have a track record of creating IG posts although the video content seems to be slightly limited.\nThe cost for each post is $75 which seems a little steep for a post but makes sense for video or live content.\nIt\u2019d also help assess the proposal better if the \u2018project management\u2019 budget is broken down further.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The reason I have given a lower rating for auditability is that there is no internal assessment and pivoting process involved. For example, if a specific IG post or story receives more interactions than others in the previous weeks, maybe the future posts should take from this and make necessary changes. \nThis helps the auditing team understand that your process is flexible and is constantly taking input from your audiences.\nAlso it\u2019d really help if there are analytical details presented that compare interactions before fund 8 and after fund 8.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1330", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10470, "q0": "The proposers have a good initiative they intend to embark on. This is because the challenge, 'levelling up cardano Indonesia IG' is a way to broadcast the message of Cardano. However, I think their problem wasn't properly stated. They couldn't state clearly the problem and how they intend to use their Instagram page to solve the problem.\n\nSince this is about mass education, I suggest they could have used all social media to do the mass education. However, if there are reasons they want to go by Instagram then I suggest they spell it out so it can be clear.\n\nThe proposers from what I read said having live interactions or marketing is their main solution to the problem. I however think that just providing one solution key solution isn't enough. Their method of engaging and at the same time maintaining followers might also not work and so it needs to be looked out well. \n\nI however score them 4 because I agree that the challenge in levelling up cardano is a good one but needs to be relooked at especially with to provide a strong problem statement that addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The presented plan is well laid out unless the problem statement I think should have been broad as well as the methodology to include other sucial media handles eg Facebook and Twitter.

The budget allocations were not also specific. You must work to bring clarity to the entire community. \nThe proposers didn't also bring out possible challenges they might face in this project. They could work to add up the challenges so it helps gives a clear picture to anyone who reads it. I therefore rate this proposal 4.
