From there, it seeks to address challenges that should be overcome to drive more participation into the space (Cardano & Catalyst). The first challenge is people's reluctance to learn more about cryptocurrency and blockchain due to its inherent complexity. The second challenge is having to deliver what\u2019s already a complicated topic in various languages. The third challenge is to assess the audience with varying levels of knowledge, interests and motifs. From my observation as a Malaysian, these challenges are all valid to me as news coverage, workshops and financial talks in Malaysia tend to shy away from any cryptocurrency-related topics due to its target audience who are less receptive to technology (middle-aged groups). Besides, cryptocurrency only became a recent household topic among most Malaysian youth in their 20s-30s due to price actions, exorbitant NFT sales. They merely view cryptocurrency as another means of trading, with minimal intention to actively participate in the space. \nIn light of these challenges pose by the Malaysian community, the proposal\u2019s solution is  to create an exclusive tribe (group) called \u201cCardano Malaysia\u201d through a decentralised, community-led platform called Konmahood. Under Konmahoood, pressing topics often discussed in the blockchain space such as lifestyle, art, earth and community are covered under Wings of Konma. This is bound to attract many people. \nI find CM to be an effective, well-thought out solution that can introduce more Malaysians to the Cardano ecosystem, which ultimately leads to Catalyst. Firstly,   CM has a dedicated team of moderators and content creators for exposing newcomers to Cardano, whilst remaining engaged with community members. Additionally, the team will curate content, training and activities of varying depths in multiple Malaysian languages to cater for Malaysians. Ultimately, this would reduce the community\u2019s learning curves. Shall this come to fruition, I believe it will contribute immensely to Cardano and Catalyst. This is because most Malaysians are well-versed in several languages. Once CM becomes more established, it could extend its reach to several East Asian countries such as China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, India and more. Secondly, CM bears resemblance to Cardano\u2019s and Catalyst\u2019s ecosystem through its voting mechanism which is proven to possess high community integrity. voting mechanism to educate participants Given its decentralised nature with multitude of topics, it is expected of Cardano Malaysia (CM) to bore resemblance to Catalyst\u2019s mechanisms. Notably, CM under Konmahood will have a voting system that is proven to have strong community integrity, leaving less room for potential exploitation. Thirdly, the community is founded on the spirit of comradeship (which is a form of empowerment). For instance, it provides participants a conducive, collaborative environment, coupled by proper guidance to share, discuss and refine their ideas for Catalyst proposals. To conclude, CM has provided a holistic solution to first introduce newcomers to learn more about Cardano, which then translates to encouraging participants to be involved in the Cardano ecosystem through collaborations and involvement in the Catalyst space.   \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Generally, I believe the team consists of members highly competent in the realms of education, entrepreneurship, community management and blockchain. Other than the team\u2019s expertise and experiences, the proposal does not showcase any members knowledgeable in the Cardano space, nor does it demonstrate how these members can contribute to the project, Cardano and Catalyst. Without having this properly planned and delegated, this could be detrimental to the proposal\u2019s goal of introducing Cardano to the masses. I would like to propose the team to clarify further in terms of the relationship between the team members and they seek to contribute to Cardano and Catalyst. \nI am satisfied with the proposal\u2019s budget breakdown as it has covered multiple aspects important to the success of CM. The budget consists of  educational content curation, server maintenance fees, rewards for participants and manpower to maintain CM\u2019s activities. What\u2019s lacking is an explanation of what their allocated budget is for. To illustrate my point, the proposal allocates a total of $3600 to clubhouse & special event moderators. Question is, what are the tasks delegated to  clubhouse & special event moderators?  Assigning roles and task delegation must come hand-in-hand for more clarity. Besides, qualifications of recruited trainers are not provided under the proposal. Reflecting to the timeline provided, if qualifications of recruited trainers are not provided to Catalyst board, there is no way to ascertain whether one week is enough to ensure Train the Trainers (TTT) will produce trainers well-equipped enough to conduct workshops and moderate activities. \nThat aside, the timeline is well-defined. Milestones is certainly not an over-promised and pivots to Catalyst.  The deliverables on its own is not a complicated one as it does not evolve around technical complexities of the blockchain and Cardano. I am confident the listed deliverables are good indicators that allow others to gauge the effectiveness of CM when it comes to fruition.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Due to the nature of CM for being mostly a community site/forum to engage with participants, auditability is fairly easy to achieve. The given KPIs can be easily provided by the team, and performance can be gauged by public through observations. Growing member count, growth report, community feedback and participants\u2019 conversion to be a part of Catalyst are great indicators of the project\u2019s success. Problems/challenges the proposal seeks to address are also well-defined, namely reaching Malaysian crowd through easily digestible, beginner-friendly and engaging content. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1373", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 4, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3077, "q0": "In Malaysia, there is an active community involved with blockchain and Cardano. It is good to include people of all various cultural differences in this community. The forum addresses approximately a population of 32 million inhabitants. This can certainly be an added value for the cardano ecosystem. A complete system has already been developed in which the forum will be built. The tribal system is a unique system that can ensure that a sustainable community is created and in which they can help each other. A clear upscaling has been made to challenges that may be encountered in the future. It is good that a few solutions have already been invented on how to avoid them.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is clearly defined in the proposal. The advantage of these people is that most people can speak the language from Malaysia. The team has people with relevant experience to manage the project. A clear timetable has been included stating what this project wants to achieve. At the moment it only states what they want to achieve in the short term. It would be helpful to record the long-term goal as well. A budget has been drawn up that clearly states what the costs are to complete the project. It will certainly be possible to get about 150 \u2013 200 new members in the community. I think they should aim a little higher. It is good to put part of the budget in rewards. This will attract people more quickly to work with. It would also be useful to include specific locations where the workshop will take place in the proposal. The technical aspects are not reflected in the proposal. The proposer takes into account the risks and challenges being considered. The most important thing will be to run a good campaign in which people are convinced to participate in this community.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A clear roadmap has been drawn up with the milestones that the team wants to achieve. Several KPIs are included in the proposal to see if this project is a success. It is clear that a community needs to be started in Malaysia that will make the Cardano ecosystem known. This project offers a clear solution and tackles the problem directly. It will not be easy to start a motivated community because Cardano is almost unknown there. This project has a long-term future. It will take longer than a few months to build an extensive community.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1606", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8944, "q0": "The idea is interesting, about to create Cardano community in Malaysia with an existing community forum named Konmahood. The proposal definitely fits into the challenge as well as adds value to Cardano ecosystem, because the community would allow people in Malaysia have a place to learn about Cardano, to connect, share and support each other in Cardano engagement. If it is successful, the proposal will help to increase number of new members onboarding, number of active members (CAs, vCAs, voters, developers,ect) and number of proposals from Malaysia community.\nI found one of the authors propose this existing forum (Konmahood \u2013 the same link) to create another community hub in India in the proposal \u201cCardano India Tribe \u2013 Konmahood\u201d with link following:\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398927 \nand the link of this proposal here:\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398931 \nI would like to ask: if these two proposals will get funded, is it possible to create 2 community hubs in India and in Malaysia on the same forum?

The financial amount is broken down in details and explained very reasonable, which allows us to understand what needs to be spend money on, and how much it costs. The cost of multi-lingual resource development is for 7 languages, even though the authors do not tell which languages will be available in the plan, but we can understand those will be English, Malayalam, Mandarin, Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Marathi due to the information of team members. Regarding to the team\u2019s information, we can see their names, their professional majors, number of experienced years, and their social links where we can know more about them, I believe the project is in the good hands with fulfilling experience and skills relevant to conducting the project.
