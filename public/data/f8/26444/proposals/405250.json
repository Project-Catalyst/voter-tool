This impact to bring on new players from other cultures/ ethnic backgrounds through the translation of it's content is something that every project launched now and in the future of the NFTs market, should be striving towards as Cardano grows to become a universal blockchain from all walks of life. It is no secret that cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, aside from Non Fungible Tokens, is still cursed by the poorly represented media presence along with it's overall complexity before further global adoption. More so for games launched on blockchains, this particularly could be a stepping stone in the right direction in terms of both adoption into Cardano NFTs and the Cardano community growth as a whole. The challenges are defined clearly, one line resonates more than others in this particular proposal when describing the solution adding, \"porting game content across linguistic and cultural boundaries, more gamers from around the world are given access to a global community in a way that is more familiar to them\". This is definitely something within game development across multiple nations must take into account when creating something for everyone.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Taken into consideration the accomplishments of Revelar and the DUO NFT card game through prior Catalyst funding, this proposal has stated clearly and definitively the solutions to making its game even more successful, by adding value to it's current form, and introducing it to more people from various cultures. With regional marketing outlined as one way to expand and promote the additions, this will help the game itself and the ecosystem of Cardano by adding new users from various backgrounds. Having a strong experienced set of team members, all with mentioned credentials and experience from previous funding rounds, the plan to budget for partnering with Linguistic experts and having a set timeline in order to accomplish the challenges in place, seems very reasonable for on-time completion. Also highlighted within are remote collaboration risks, which members and attendees to Catalyst Townhall Meetings surely understand all too well, can be difficult to manage and plan. These factors have not been missed by the proposer and their team efforts moving forward will rely heavily on communication to and from existing and additional members.

But the success of said challenges are more than achievable given the allotted timeline the roadmap describes. There are systems available for translating material today making it easier and perhaps less of an issue to possibly complete this idea even sooner than the proposed target, but as the proposer stated early on, being politically correct and not disrespectful to other cultural differences with the comical material, will be one of the biggest challenges to solve by the regional linguistic members who will determine what's best for the game and it's audience. This proposal is solving a problem many we in the crypto and NFT space find to be lacking, be that blockchain or games, we're all humans who want to be understood and express ourselves.

Pointed out as \u201crisks\u201d I see the issues as awareness of the dimensions of quality for this product.\n\n* Humor is a universal concept but it is heavily influenced by our language and cultural experiences. By porting game content to different languages and adding in culturally relevant humor, Duo can create a truly global user base whilst accelerating the adoption of crypto for all.\n\n* Lost in translation: To facilitate the porting and creation of content in different languages, we need to partner with native speakers and people who understand the culture. \n\n* Cultural translation - Some of the current humor archetypes within the Duo humor archetypes are funny in English, however, they may not be funny in other cultures or languages because they are not compatible with the culturally accepted humor. \n\n* Remote collaboration risks - The proposal will most certainly result in a global collaborative effort with parties working remotely. \n\n* Product fit: we are keeping the game-play of Duo simple Translating content into another language does not guarantee the adoption of that content by the intended audience. There is a chance that the game of Duo may not resonate with the intended audience as expected.

The main goal of the project is to translate the Duo NFT card game into other languages to make them more applicable to non-English speakers. I believe that this goal is directly in line with the challenge setting to onboard new members into the cardano community from East Asia. By translating the game into other languages, it opens the door for new people to discover cardano and the many other services it provides. These people who play the game might become voters, stakers, proposers, or even CAs/vCAs with time. However, the proposers did not mention which languages they will translate the game into. Based on the title of the proposal, \u201cFilipino gameplay,\u201d I assume that it will be translated into Filipino. However, the proposers could have made this more clear throughout the proposal as well. Having this information more clearly presented could make a big difference in perceived impact. For example, if the game was translated into a language that is spoken by over 1 billion people (Chinese) versus about 75 million for Filipino, it would make a big difference in terms of potential number of people it will reach. Making this information crystal clear in the body of the proposal would make it more understandable for voters, especially since the proposers have other proposals with similar goals.

The proposers themselves all have the necessary qualifications and skills that will be needed to make this proposal happen. For example, they have skills in development, marketing, communications, etc. Additionally, the game is already in development, so I think that translating it should be a relatively easier task than the actual backend development. One concern I had that the proposers addressed is how they will translate the jokes appropriately for the different user base. Their solution of cross-referencing different translators should mitigate the risk of cross-cultural misinterpretation. \nThe proposers listed a solid roadmap that is well thought out. It has a good breakdown of the different tasks and when they will be completed, such as finding the translator (2 weeks), translating (2-4 weeks), etc. Given the scope of the project, I think that the time allocated for each step is sufficient. \nThe proposers also provided a good breakdown of the budget. I can easily see where the funds will be going, which gives me confidence in the success of the proposal.

A page will be created on said website where people can see the progress of the translation. Additionally, the proposers listed a good number of numerical KPIs that the community can use to make sure the proposal was successful. For example, they have listed the number of new players in relation to 3, 6, and 12 month intervals, which is simple enough to confirm. They say that these new players must be speakers of the language and will be in their discord server. I am personally not sure how exactly the proposers will know that a certain member of the discord is a Filipino speaker, but I trust that they can find a way to do this. Addressing this question would strengthen the proposal\u2019s auditability even more. Overall, if these metrics are published on the site, I don't see any issue with auditing this proposal.

The idea is to translate an NFT card game minted at Cardano, called Duo. The proponents are part of the Relevar group and claim that this game is their main play to earn project. What I missed here was a better explanation of workability. What happens in this game? How are matches? What would players be looking to gain? I believe there are many unanswered questions; if the game itself were better detailed, the impact would be better understood. Anyway, I agree that it is necessary to translate projects like this because they can attract a very large niche (players, interested in NFTs and also in profiting from matches).

Speaking of the script, I thought it was great how the time division is based on weeks. Generally I recommend that proposals be divided into months, but as this one is not that extensive I thought it was right for the proposers to make such a very detailed division. Speaking of the budget, it's broken down into a few parts and I can say that our understanding of how it would be used is solid, but not perfect. Some parts (the most expensive and main ones, something in my opinion), such as translation and marketing services, should be better sorted out. What would these translation services look like? Who would work here, how many hours a week, why would that cost $1850? And who in relation to marketing; how would it happen? It would be essential for us to understand the project's publicity campaign, as it is an essential part of success.

It is said that progress could be tracked via catalyst.revelar.co, but we don't know how often updates would be released or exactly what kind of updates would be. Maybe about the pre-production process of the translations, the partial results? Regarding the Duo Translation page, I found it a very interesting way to understand how the content is being gradually translated. But there is also a question about the frequency of translations and how the Cardano community would be informed about them. Turning now to the final results, this part leaves something to be desired as the proponents focus a lot on translating the game but not how it might affect Cardano's cryptographic community in the Philippines.

It's high adoption is one of the reason's for the blockchain game's rise over the last year. This indicates an affinity for play-to-earn gameplay in the country so there is a chance Duo can be adopted easier by the population if marketing is done correctly.
