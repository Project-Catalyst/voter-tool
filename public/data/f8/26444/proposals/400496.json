We need more excitement generated for ADA now more than ever in the region", "f6_no_assessments": 10, "f6_rating": 2.9, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 7406, "q0": "I think the idea is very good and necessary, and theoretically fits well with the objectives of this challenge. What we are looking for here is the benefit of East Asia, that is, a direct investment in this part of the continent, so that it can prosper economically, environmentally and humanitarianly. At the same time, of course, we need our blockchain to also take advantage of the situation, that it be popularized, that the number of Ada holders increase, that new digital wallets are created, CNFTs minted, Dapps built and so on. The proposal in question aims to promote some face-to-face meetings in Japan, which promote Cardano, giving lectures on our blockchain and its technologies, so that investors, technology students and blockchain enthusiasts (as the proponent himself lists) are captivated to adopt. Ada/Cardano on the Bitpoint market. The proponent explains that Cardano is now officially available for the Japanese market, but this does not exclude the presence of competitors, other more famous and widespread blockchains both in that country and around the world (such as bitcoin and ethereum, for example). In fact, the promotion of such events can generate more knowledge about Cardano, so that people discover the advantages of our blockchain compared to others, and are motivated to adopt it. The idea can cause a boom for our ecosystem in Japan, as we wanted in the challenge, and with that also directly benefit the Japanese, who can discover job opportunities (both as CAs and vCAs, or as developers/designers/advertisers/etc in the Catalyst funded projects), for example. The problem that I identify here is that everything is very good in the theoretical field, but in practice, little is explained about these face-to-face meetings. The proponent claims that most things, like their location, speakers, translators, etc., would be defined post-funding. As a result, we were unable to understand how these events would be constituted in practice, and especially what specific issues would be addressed here; this, in my opinion, is the scope of the project and we would really need to have this notion so that we could trust and fully understand the practical part of the thing. Therefore, I will give it 3 stars, because I think the idea is promising, but the impact is not well assured (it is not possible to understand and trust it) due to the lack of explanations and details. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Unfortunately, a serious error occurs here. The proponent states that a plan will be made if they are financed. But for the funding to become a reality, we need to know several things about the project, including the planning, the roadmap. One thing must not come after the other, but before. All the things that the proponent claims are defined should already be present and well explained, namely: best locations for events, list of speakers, team of translators, etc. Therefore, I will suggest what an ideal schedule would look like in my view. First of all, we would need to know how many events would happen. How often too, for example a total of 5 events, 1 each month. Then we would need to know their exact location, as it is said, the list of speakers and translators. We would need to understand what would happen on each day of the event: the moment of the talk itself, then an open chat session, perhaps? Would some community members who already have funded and ongoing projects participate to report their experiences? Would there be a coffee break, where the focus would be networking? What exactly would happen in those moments of the encounter? What topics would be covered in each lecture? How would the aforementioned target audience (investors, students, blockchain enthusiasts) be contacted and enticed to participate here? Anyway, in addition to all the characteristics of the event itself, I would like to know how the pre-production process would take place, which activities would have to be provided before the meetings, and by whom. Ideally, the total time should be divided into months, and those into weeks, and that the activities of each week should be listed. And for the script to be 100% it would also be interesting to know when things would happen, for example, in June, the first event in city X. Now talking about the budget, a total of 15k USD is requested, which is a high value taking into account account that we do not even know how many events would be made. The explanation of the budget division should have been more detailed, for example, how do they ask for 1500 dollars for rent if they don't even have the locations defined yet? What if there is no money or money left for that part? What salary for translators, how many hours would they work? And finally, about the team, we are told the names and main functions of each involved. However, we would need more details here as well. I would like to know a small CV of each, examples of previous work, linkedin profiles of everyone (only those of some people are available), and that the relationship of each one of them with Cardano be explained more deeply (we know this information about some , but not all). Therefore, the viability of the project is not good, it has a lot to improve, mainly in the script part. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This topic is also not good, the auditability is low. Regarding the roadmap, for example, we have little information that would serve as ways to measure progress. We know that the number of participants, digital wallets and interactions on social media are indicative of how big the reach of these meetings is. However, it is necessary that we know much more profound and varied information about the development of the project than just numbers. Starting with the improvement of the script. Without a detailed schedule, the Cardano community would not have the means to properly audit the project process, as we would not know what has to be done, when and by whom. We don't have small goals to continually achieve, nor deadlines to meet. Therefore, it is essential that this be resolved. Afterwards, the team must maintain direct and constant contact with the Cardano community. Some members of our community could be chosen, preferably Japanese, who could maintain closer contact with this team in order to receive feedback at least monthly. These feedbacks would serve to inform us not only about how many people attended the event that month or how many people are registered on the project's social networks, but also to understand the construction of everything done during the pre-production process. Regarding the final result, we know that the main objective is to strongly drive the adoption of Cardano in Japan, especially since our blockchain is officially available in this market now. But how can we understand this impact? The simplest way, in my opinion, is to do a direct survey with the participants of the events. Are investors investing in Ada? Did they buy a lot, delegate to any community pools? Are young students now captivated by learning about our technologies, such as the Plutus programming language, and do they intend to work on our projects in the future? How did the enthusiasts behave after the events? All this would need to be raised, summarized and taken to the community, whether through written forms, sharing of personal questionnaires (of course, with the proper authorization of each person involved there), video calls and etc. Therefore, as well as feasibility, I believe that this topic of the proposal needs to be reviewed and improved. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 7, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 390, "q0": "We realize that the proposal has an objective to promote lectures in Japan that aim to disseminate the ADA. Thus, the proposal fits the scope of the challenge in question. However, we noticed a certain lack of detail on how these lectures will take place, which raises a little doubt about the possibility of the project having a positive impact for Cardano in the long term. Along with this, we see that a considerable amount of capital is being requested, and since we have little information about how the project will go, $15,000 seems to be a very unreasonable amount.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Although we have a team of professionals who seem to have the technical skills to execute the project, since the main objective is to disseminate about the Cardano ecosystem through lectures, perhaps it would be interesting if more information had been given on how such lectures will to occur. For example, we noticed that the locations of the lectures are not yet defined, as well as the speakers have not yet been nominated. And while the cost of each event is set, this lack of information makes the $15,000 order not very reasonable.\n\nPerhaps it would be a better strategy to reduce the total amount of funds being requested and aim to produce materials with information that will be presented in the lectures. Then it seems like a good idea to define some test locations and choose speakers to present these produced materials, thus validating the project. In addition, it would also be a positive factor if the CVs of all professionals involved in the proposal were made available.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Given that a viable path for the evolution of the project is chosen, we realized that the team knew how to choose good ways to audit the evolution of the proposal. For example, the number of portfolios being created and the amount of interactions on social networks around the project are good parameters to verify the success of the proposal. But it is worth mentioning that, in addition, as there is still not much information about the proposal, it would also be nice if some goals were established for better monitoring, such as a number of followers to reach in the first months or what the average number of participants expected in the lectures throughout the event.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 4, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 948, "q0": "The proposal could address the challenge, but may not have the impact they want to achieve. Since Japan is not only the CARDANO ICO country, but also one of the countries with the most Cardano holders, it may not be the main country that really needs to be promoted. In addition, language and cultural issues are also need to be carefully considered, due to the language barrier, the team mentioned that they need to find a translator to help them, sometimes the translation process will not be in place, the cost will also increase. From my experience of living abroad, organizing and promoting something abroad without knowing the language and culture will not be easy. It would be easier if you find a local CARDANO member to work together and organize the event.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The feasibility of this project is not high, as mentioned above, they have to deal with language and cultural berrier, they have to assess whether the funding fits the local expenses, they have to organize a total of six events, but they still do not know where to apply. In addition, due to the Covid virus pandemic situation, Japan is still not open to tourists from many countries, or is open to some countries, but has to carry out more than 14 days of isolation, which is a potential risk that the project has to face, so the team members are recommended to learn about the latest developments of tourism in Japan.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "According to the above, this project will not be easy to implement before the current restriction in Japan is not fully open to tourism, moreover, if one of the auditable points is to see how many wallets are created during or after events, then they may have to analyze the wallet data, which will not be an easy way to analyze or be audited.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1245", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3253, "q0": "The proposal gave the idea is to create networking and promotional events in Japan.

Maybe give more details on the contets they are thinking of, how many days each event would last, if it would have discussion forums or just speakers, if it will be in eglish or japanese (with or w/o simultaneasly translation) and so on. Of course this can be better explored in project planning phase, once funded, but some idea on what proposers are thinking would be welcomed. A communication plan with Japanese community could be pre-elalborated also for the proposal.

A possible scope expansion would be to broadcast the event online, but this would raise challenge costs.\nLast, the target audience should also be better highlighted here. Specially when we are working with a different culture, it is good to start small, learn and then scale up.
