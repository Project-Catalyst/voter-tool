The KPIs are the number of podcasts, number of subscription, and number of views. The set targets are within the time frame of 3, 6 and 12 months. \n\nThe primary KPI is 20 podcasts over one year.  The proposers can control the production of videos (podcasts) to ensure the target is met. \n\nThe secondary is not controllable. The team members have to find solutions to uplift the chance of getting to the goals they set. To do that, they will put in a quality assurance in their podcast contents. They ensure the crypto technical terms in the narratives are understood well by newbies by trying out with at least 3 people who are  blockchain / crypto illiterate before they put the videos on air.

The podcasts are broadcast regularly every month, the main languages \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bare English and Filipino. The purpose is to bring information to the Philippine community in particular and the East Asian community in general. The proposal fully meets the criteria set out by the challenge \"Grow East Asia, Grow Cardano\".\nWith content edited by the proposed team, the language of communication close to life will help podcasts attract more views. Thereby helping to improve the knowledge of the Filipino people, attracting more people to propose projects on Catalyst. Also, increase the country's crypto adoption.\nI have an extra impactful addition to this proposal which is a report on the popularity of cryptocurrencies in countries around the world. In which, the Philippines only ranked 15th on the chart.

Nowadays, it is easy to come across videos on how to create an ADA wallet, how to buy and sell on Binance when users search on Youtube, an in-depth content but explained in common language will increase the view\n\nEach member of the proposal has years of experience in education and translation.

The proposer has identified the problem effectively and has addressed the solution to it. In order to effectively market or spread the knowledge on Cardano to all the people of the country, translation of the content of Cardona to local language is required and is the most effective way to reach a larger group of people. In this case, the local language would be Filipino, which is very huge community and they are very proud of the language. Hence translating the contents of Cardano in Filipino would reach a lot more people than expected and also be appreciated for translating into Filipino. Most of the people are educated in their local language and might face difficulties in English, by translating the content to Filipino it would benefit a lot of people in getting familiar with Cardano and also the advancements of it. The proposer has effectively addressed the challenge and I strongly believe this application will be a success to Cardano as it will be reach more people and more people will be knowledgeable through this with the comfort of learning in their own language.

The proposer has also provided links and their team has the relevant skills and experience to implement the proposal. It would also be helping a lot of people educate about Cardano in a better way. The budget is also clearly mentioned and they have shown the broken down budget and its use cases. This whole together will be indeed bringing a new community to the Cardona, once someone sees the content in Filipino & English they will be more likely to promote the videos on their own to friends and family to watch them and it will be of a better reach. The proposer has a proper plan and will achieve the goal in the projected time and also has pointed out the necessary resources required to complete the project.
