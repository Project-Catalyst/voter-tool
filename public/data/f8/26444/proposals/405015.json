The idea is to expand the activities performed by the Mediators.ai platform (formerly known as Win-Win) to Japan. A good snippet of the proposal that might sum up what Mediators.ai is \u201ca decentralized dispute resolution platform and marketplace built on the Cardano blockchain. It allows disputing parties to find a suitable mediator to help resolve their dispute in a timely and cost-effective manner outside the court system.\u201d That is, people seek to resolve their conflicts by avoiding bureaucracy and involving blockchain technology in this action, through so-called mediators. The problem here is that this platform has much more scope in the United States for the simple fact that most of the team that makes up the administrators of the platform is from there, so it is much simpler for them to perform activities in an already known system. . It is said in the scope of the proposal that in order to expand this activity to different locations, a study is necessary, because as I have already mentioned, each country has its own laws and its own operating logic. Therefore, the proposal is based on doing such a market study, a research that makes the evolution of the Mediators.ai platform safe. I think this aligns with the challenge because it would help the Japanese a lot, as the opportunity to solve problems in a more transparent and less bureaucratic way would be available to them. Also, it would be an extra income opportunity for those who become mediators. In addition, this project, if successful, will certainly be a good way to popularize Cardano across the country. So both Japan and our blockchain would benefit, we know that it is necessary that all proposals are interesting in order to give return to Cardano. Another positive point that we can take into account is: the team at Loxe Inc. already carried out an expansion in Latin America, so they already have some previous experience with the issue of evolving their activities, molding them in a new context. With this, a lot of security is passed that this new stage will also be a success. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I found the proposal script quite simple to understand and very detailed. We know the activities that will be developed each month, they are listed in a linear order and that allows us to have a very solid view of the process. I don't think more detail would be needed in the case of this proposal, so I consider that the development process is already very explicit. Regarding the funding requested, of 15 thousand dollars: the amount is quite compatible with the complexity of the proposal. It is not cheap, but at the same time it is fair in the sense of providing the remuneration necessary for those involved in the proposal to work properly. The total amount is apportioned based on participant salaries (Japanese mediator compensation: $2,000/month + mediators.ai team member as part-time support: $2,000/month + mediators.ai platform location for Japan: US $3,000). I think the only thing I would like to suggest to raise the level of understanding of this part even further is: the hours that the mediator and the mediators.ai support member would work on this project could have been reported. How long in the weeks would they devote themselves to this? I believe that if this information had been passed on, we would have had an even more specific view of the budget. Now talking about the team, there is a lot of trust in each of the professionals involved. We know their names, areas of academic training and professional performance, as well as we have listed several activities/tools/projects that they have already been involved in. They are very experienced people in what they do and also very active within the Cardano community, so I believe they would be very capable of successfully developing the proposal. Therefore, I will give maximum marks for feasibility, because despite the observation I made about the working hours of those involved, I think the information that is attached is enough for us to understand very well what would be done, how, by whom and for how much money. . Not to mention the fact that the proposal is an evolution of a pre-existing project, and that in itself has already contributed a lot to trust that this new stage will work. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability of this project is very high. To monitor the process, the team states that it would use a methodology called Agile, I don't particularly know this methodology and I think it would add a lot to the explanation of this issue if it were briefly explained. However, what we are really looking for is for the team to take responsibility for delivering partial results to the community, and they promise to do this through monthly meetings with the IOG coordinators, which are standard procedure in our ecosystem. It would be interesting if these reports were available for the community to consult as well, especially the Japanese public, which I believe would be very engaged with the project. Now talking about the final results, the proponents inform in a very rich way what is targeted in the 3, 6 and 12 month periods. We know the number of institutions and mediators that are targeted, so we have a good understanding of the level that the proponents want to achieve. In addition to such quantitative data, I would like to suggest that after a certain period of funding, when they are already relatively stabilized in the Japanese market, a survey be carried out with those involved in the project to understand two things, firstly so that conflicts would be resolved in a more transparent, secure and faster way. Second, I think it is very fundamental that we understand exactly how this project helped Cardano to become popular in the country in question. Could it be that we are seeing an increase in the amount of Ada in circulation, new digital wallets are being created, in short, was this a way for the Japanese people to understand one of the possibilities of using blockchain technology? I think that if this research were done and delivered to the Cardano community, the level of auditability would grow even more. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal not only effectively solves the challenge, but also makes sense for society.

Japan is also no stranger in Cardano and one of the most prominent nation-state in term of ADA holders which should making introduction and penetration easier due to warmer audience there. Law in Japan and US, although fundamentally different with Japan being civil law country and US being common law country, still shares few commonalities.

An honest mistake that is not affecting my rating. All love to Japan and India including the Cardano communities there!", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Loxe Inc. has experience in writing many proposals and it shows on this one (including the exhaustion). The best thing I can do is walk us through the mandatory three parts on this aspect which are timeline (usually accompanied with the deliverables on each period), budget breakdown, and the team capabilities. Overall, the three parts are presented well and on-standard for a Catalyst proposal writing practice. Looking at the timeline and action plans, I found no issue since they look realistic and necessary to achieve good implementation of this proposal, especially partnering with universities are a great way since lot of talents we can recruit and support us with good contributions to some degree and also example cases that can help us research the necessary information. Budget also looks solid and rates are normal and according to local standard. For quick (probably non-relating) comparison: a fresh bachelor graduate in Japan likely gets monthly salary of USD 2k in 2022. Based on the soft fact above, figures in proposal could afford decently experienced associate-level for part time support for the sake of this proposal implementation, just justifying my rationale a bit here. Moving on to the team, we can see the usual suspects from Loxe here. Experiences are abundant and we can skate to their LinkedIn if curious. Fun fact, Matthias the CEO holds an associate degree-equivalent in Japanese. I know from reading Loxe ADR whitepaper available on their website. So yeah, I am serious about this. There is a small risk mentioned but the reward could be greater so probably nothing.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Loxe Inc has lots of skin in Catalyst so I really trust them doing their best to deliver every proposal Catalyst funded and working hard to achieve satisfying results on each of those.

Their social media are also rich so community can receive regular updates there and ask few questions too. The choice of metric and KPI are good and suitable to measure accurately the implementation of this proposal.
