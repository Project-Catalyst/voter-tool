With Covid-19 burdening the economy at present and climate change being a constant threat to human's life, projects that attempt on environmental issues should be most welcomed. \n\nHighlighting the conventional perception in Vietnam i.e. blockchain technology mostly applies for cryptocurrency, the project seeks to utilize blockchain & NFT to improve effectiveness and efficiency of reforestation NGOs, among which, the proposers have chosen to partner with Gaia - an established organization with proven planting track record. The technology, should successfully be rolled out, commits to tackle Gaia's current obstacles in communicating with plant funders, auditing/verifying reforesting efforts and apparently, encouraging more and more people to get involved in restoring mother Earth. These obstacles are realistic and I do believe there's necessity for a blockchain-based application to come into sight. There's also my personal anticipation that initial succesful demonstration of this project will be the premise to expand its reach not only among organizations in Vietnam but also to other countries in East Asia that suffer the same predicaments (Indonesia, for instance).\n\nThough the proposal did identify this particular challenge and explain how resolving this will promote social and sustainable effects for Vietnam environment in general and Catalyst community in particular, I feel the eventual target set by the proposers has not yet made aligned or as clear as to achieve its expected and beautiful purpose. The number of trees planted during a certain period of time serves very well as a metric to measure success of a foresting project, whilst, in my opinion, for a technological project, how fast/cost effective/time saving/etc the blockchain protocol results in would be more rational KPIs. For example: How funds raised from community are how much % easier distributed to the organizations/foresters/workers compared to traditional bank transfers? or How frequent/real-time fund donors can check in on their donated trees? and noticeably How much/How the Cardano community grows during this project development and so on. \n\nI do believe the proposers already have these up their sleeves, yet not exhibit them here and I highly suggest they do so. With that, I access 4 for IMPACT in general.\"", "q0r": 4, "q1": "\"The proposal set 200,000 as the target number of trees planted through the project from being funded towards 2025. With proven record of Gaia (a total of 226,000 trees planted through community fundraising in 2020), this target is understandably achievable and hopefully, with effectiveness and efficiency brought about by this project, the number might be achieved sooner than expected. \n\nThe proposers include a clear layout of timeline/budget allocation for different phases of the project. The team capacity impressed me in terms of its diversity and thoughtfulness bringing on board various people from necessary expertise, those who are already backbones of the Cardano community locally and those who are well involved in plantation and technology. \n\nThey also have foreseen the challenge in shortage of initial ADA funds and asked for a prerequisite amount to start off with. Considering the parties that will be involved in this project, I, however, have concerns over two other issues of which the budget proposed have not covered. First is technology barriers, assuming that the workers and foresters are not young and tech-savvy, which means they would require training sessions and implementation coaching. Second is upfront cost of implementation, assuming that the facilities and equipment facilitating transformation to blockchain protocol have not been available. \"", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As mentioned above, there are clearly outlined timeline and targets for each phase of the project.
