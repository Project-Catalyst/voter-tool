As the authors mention, this platform is product of the team\u2019s project which got funded in Fund7, the team are currently developing the first MVP and the platform will be releases in June 2022 with the goal is for all investors. However, they realize East Asia is the potential region where there are many voters come from, so that their platform jumps to target East Asian investors.\nIn my opinion, the proposal fits with the challenge very well because if it is successful, it will attract investors from East Asia, increase the number of active Cardano wallets , attract people outside the Cardano community come to know about Catalyst Project. Therefore, it certainly adds big value to Cardano ecosystem and helps to grow Catalyst Project.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The author provides information of the project in details to make it feasible: The plan is described succinctly to tell what need to be done in chronological order; The budget is broken down clearly into identifiable items, allows us to know what the money is asking for and how much for each of them; The team who build the project is provide in details about their names, their professional majors, how many experienced years they have, their skills and experience related to the successful conducting of the proposal, with Linkedln of each member.

I found intersting with watching the short video which introduces the Token Allies platform, I believe the proposal will be successful implemented with all the information given. However, I see in the plan of the proposal, the activities are listed in 1st week, 1st month and 2nd month, but the budget is asking for 3 months.

Asia, East Asia is home to a young population, high entrepreneurial spirit, and interest in blockchain and crypto. Many small startups lack capital, making it difficult to bring their ideas to fruition. There are not many crowdfunding platforms because of the legal issues of each country.
