It clearly identifies a solution for expanding Cardano as a community and whole, via translating the content of IOHK into Lao, along with news and current affairs of Cardano, including Subtitles, ensuring a positive Impact. \n\nThe Proposer noted that \u201cSouth East Asians are hard working and have been known to be natural coders and developers\u201d which shows that the Cardano community will likely grow by expanding our talent-pool, growing the Cardano ecosystem, considering the cited 30 Million native speakers of Lao that this project could reach. Furthermore, teaching about blockchain and crypto technology beyond merely Cardano project, seems likely to have a bigger-picture Impact of expanding blockchain adoption altogether. \nSubtitles for each translated video ensure Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing speakers will also be included, potentially expanding the Impact of the project into the disability community as well. \n\nThe Proposer states that Emurgo and Cardano Foundation YouTube channels can be translated in the future, thereby adapting for future expansion, thus a cascading Impact and growth over time. \n\nThe Proposal addresses 13 of the United Nations\u2019s 17 \u201cSustainable Development Goals,\u201d further showing positive impact. \n\nIn my own research I see that Wikipedia lists Lao as a lingua franca that gets used all across Laos even for speakers of other languages, and also that Wikipedia says that Lao is mutually-intelligible with Thai and with Isan, therefore the Impact of this Proposal may stretch even beyond what the Proposal itself has stated. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Proposer sets a very realistically Feasible goal of how many videos by the end of 3 months, as well as the goal translation of a video every 3 days.

In all other respects they are essential the same. Hence it is almost impossible to write 19 distinct assessments, I have tried to find specific differentiators but have also looked at the package of proposals as a whole as, I believe, this will add greater value to the voter. Looking at this specific proposal for translating videos into Laotian, it largely meets the challenge brief in seeking to broaden the horizons of the Cardano ecosystem. The proposer should be praised for taking the initiative. I would suggest the proposer uses the comments section to explain voters their rationale behind this multi-proposal approach. That should help with transparency and help people make an informed decision. For example: Are they looking for voters to decide on which languages they prefer thus restricting the choice to the existing community. This kind of defeats the purpose of reaching out to new communities.

Each language needs its unique Social media campaign to reach people.  We cannot lump everything into one.   \n\nSecondly Why consider the total ask?  The rules state that each proposal has to be considered on its own merit.  Therefore even if  i had a hundred language proposals, if i had a hundred teams of two Master Translators and Two Proofreaders, then it will get the job done. We are doing this for 25 years buddy.   We know exactly how to run a translation project.\n\n\n\nHe goes on\nThe proposer claims to have many years experience in this field but this is impossible to verify based on the evidence (LinkedIn profile) provided. The other key resource (Muthiah) presents as a trilingual translator.\nI have stated as below, we have and use our extensive network of Master Translator Partners.\n\nThe assessor has not read the proposal. It states clearly as follows\nThe number of people required to complete this task has been calculated.  \nWe will be using our inhouse resources as well as obtain our Master Translator Partner network to handle overflow of work to ensure that our deliverables remain on track. They would be brought on board as and when needed and budget would include their costs\n\nI can see clearly that this assessor is merely following the wrong ideas of some CAs to say that the feasibility is not good because they believe I alone  is doing Or Mr Muthiah D is doing,  the translations or this internal team is doing the translation of all the 10 languages.  This is completely WRONG.  As mentioned above we are using our External partners who are Master Translators with many years of experience and qualifications in translating as Native speakers of Tamil both in Sri Lanka and India. So his feasibility assessment is wrong. \n\nHow the budget was calculated has been clearly laid out as follows.. if he claims he has read the other proposals he will know that we are doing 15000 words per project. Each word costs 0.08 for complete translation to voicing. This cost comes to 1200 and into 3 months it is 3600.  Then this language needs its own Social media campaign since the users of one language would not care about social media campaigns in another language. So all languages cannot be lumped together to do one campaign.  The cost of that being 1500..  Then for contingency we have allocated 2000.    \nSome specific statements that are absolute nonsense=\nHowever, because the primary responsibility of this position is to translate text from English to Tamil, the proposer should include more specific information on their translators' expertise in their Master Translator Partner Network.   As stated we have been doing projects for over 25 years. The definition of Master translator if this assessor doesn't understand is a MASTER OF HIS CRAFT.  A SENIOR IN THE INDUSTRY.   Each one will have different qualifications.  As for our specific master translator, he is the ONLY ONE IN SRI LANKA to write for the Mahawamsa which is like the BIBLE OF HISTORY of SRI LANKA for over 4000 years. It has been written from the time of kings.  This is a role that he alone in Sri Lanka has.

Sadly, no specific regard for the culture or people of Laos are provided. I have Laotian friends who speak very good English, and in Laos the Thai language is widely understood and very similar, and Thai TV is watched. There is a lot of Thai Cardano content that Laotian speakers who do not like to learn in English (for which I see a low number of potential Cardano users) could research or simply watch on daily updated Youtube channels. Whether speakers of Laotian actually want Laotian-language content, prefer videos or text was not studied by the proposers, and the same cost is applied to each proposal for each language (around 7k dollars). \nAll the proposals of this format offer\nto translate the entire IOHK website content, which should probably include product documentation and IOG Blog, plus transcripts of all (?) videos published on the Cardano Forum.\nThis completely falls short of the challenge setting, which is to improve Cardano, more interaction of Laotian proposers or proposals looking at Laos, stake pools in Laos, or improving the lives of people in Laos.
