Therefore, it will frustrate a lot of technology enthusiasts, they don't know where to start to learn, what information to learn first, what information to find later.\n\n- The project helps technology enthusiasts save a lot of time to synthesize knowledge in a coherent way.\n\n- The project helps users have an overview and multi-dimensional view of blockchain, cardano and catalyst\n\n- In the future, the project plans to let the community self-post information, self-assess posts and will be rewarded for providing useful information to the community. This creates a great motivation for users to delve deeply and analyze carefully about blockchain, cardano and catalyst. Thereby creating a knowledgeable community and the website will become a trusted place for people to find information as well as contribute useful information to the community.\n***Suggestions/ advices:\n- At the stage when users can post information on the website themselves, in order to select quality information for readers, the project can build a mechanism to accumulate points for those who post information on the website. . In addition, it is necessary to build a mechanism so that it is possible to filter out users with good expertise, who have posted high-quality and useful articles for the community, and then can classify them according to each level. Thereby helping the community to access the best quality knowledge first automatically. Because if only based on the assessment of the community in the early stages, the quality of the assessment may not be high, because the community has not much knowledge and is not deep enough.\n- If the project can add a tool to scan duplicate content of articles, it will eliminate duplicate articles, make the website have cleaner content, and help users save a lot of time when looking up information.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "- The project has a clear work plan according to each item for each month\n- The evaluation indicators have also been clearly quantified by month\n- The project has envisioned a general format for the website, how to distribute content, divided by levels from basic to advanced. This requires good general knowledge and the ability to assess the need and difficulty of the content posted on the website.\n- The project has now built 2 Vietnamese facebook communities who are passionate about projects on the Cardano platform, with a large number of members and frequent interactions. When the project is formed, it will reach a large number of members in the existing community. Or will find members who are willing to experience the project's services in the initial stage to give evaluations to help the project complete.\n- Expenses are clearly allocated for each work item. Most of the cost is for information search and translation.\n- The cost for translation is relatively low compared to the common ground. The content that the project translates is all technical content that is difficult and picky for translators. This speaks to the project team's desire to contribute to the community. This is also the strength and weakness of the team, because the low cost will lead to difficulty in adding additional human resources from the outside.\n- The team has a large force with knowledge and experience that is very suitable for the project:\n+ Lots of experience in participating in the cryptocurrency market\n+ In-depth knowledge of blockchain\n+ High level Japanese translation team from N3 to N1\n+ English translation team with many years of experience in teaching English, skilled technical team\nWith these skills, I think the project is completely feasible and can do more for the community in the future\n- Information of each member is publicly and transparently easy to contact\n***Suggestions/ advices:\n- The project should re-evaluate the cost of translation, especially Japanese translation, or build a reserve fund so that it can easily add additional resources from outside in case a team member for some reason unable to participate for a period of time. This will help the project have more flexibility in terms of human resources.\n- Besides, the project needs to add a marketing plan as well as a marketing budget so that more people in the community know and use the project. A good product, but if it is not widely communicated to the community, it will be very wasteful and will not spread value to many technology enthusiasts.\n- Currently the project does not have a Japanese community, so if the project can have a plan to build a Japanese community now to prepare for the future when the website has a Japanese version", "q1r": 5, "q2": "- The project has its own website\n- The project has clear specific commitment indicators for each stage. This speaks to the strength as well as the careful preparation of the project team\n- The project knows what it has to do to be successful. They know what the project will look like after success, which helps team members have the confidence to follow the project for a long time.\n- Indicators can be easily checked through the website. Besides, the project also commits to publicize other website indexes if necessary, this demonstrates the transparency of the project.\n***Suggestions/ advices:\n- In phase 2, the project will let the community provide information and self-assess that information. Therefore, classifying information providers is very important, it helps readers to quickly select quality information, saving readers time. Besides, it also stimulates information providers to try to provide better quality information to receive more incentives from the project. From there, the project can build one more indicator on the number of members providing quality information to be achieved in each stage to serve as one of the criteria to evaluate the success of the project.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1192", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 6, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal gives the idea of \u200b\u200bbuilding a library for the website, which stores articles about Cardano and research articles on blockchain knowledge.
