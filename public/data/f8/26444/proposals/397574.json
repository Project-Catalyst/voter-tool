That said, this proposal totally fits the challenge, South Korea is in the geographic region that we are looking to invest in this challenge. The proposal is about translating an existing application into Korean, which according to the author has a 4.5 rating on the play store, which helps its users to buy ada and delegate it to some pool. If this application is translated into Korean it will certainly be a substantial gain for us, because it will help to spread our technologies in a country that already has a good base for cryptography and in my view it is a key market. It would be interesting for the application to dialogue with all audiences, that is, to be understandable not only by those who already understand what blockchain, cryptocurrencies, etc., but also for laypeople. A short guide explaining the main concepts of the cryptographic world could be included in the application itself. Furthermore, yes, it is a proposal that perfectly aligns with the specific objectives of the challenge, in which we aim to invest in East Asia in order to increase the number of holders of Ada, transactions on the blockchain, NFT and future members of the Cardano community. And all this will be possible if we are able to establish a bridge between our technologies and the local population, and there is no better way to do this than producing content in the native language. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Who would compose the team of this project would be the author of the proposal, who would be the developer, and some translator. Although the author already has experience in what he intends to do, as he says he already has 10 years of experience with mobile application development, and also has millions of downloads, I would like to see some examples of his work. It could be some applications that he has already developed, so we would get to know his practical experience. In addition, it is always important to know the relationship of the proponents with the Cardano ecosystem. How did they discover our blockchain, besides this app, does the author have any projects at Cardano? In addition to being a developer, does he have other occupations, what was your academic background? In the same way, in my opinion, it is necessary for us to know who the translator would be, for us to know a little about his/her curriculum, what other translation jobs he/she has developed so far, if this person understands anything about cryptocurrencies, etc. Ideally, the proposer would already arrive with his candidate for translator, but if this is not possible, he could even tell us how he intends to select this person. The proposal development process is not very detailed, we know that two parallel activities would take place here, the developer part and the translator part. Would one happen before the other, or at the same time? How long would each part take to work, in which month would these works start and what is their expected completion date? In the same way, the budget division is informed in a basic way, if we do not know how long the work of the two professionals would take, we cannot calculate the relationship between time and price, and thus it is a little difficult to assess whether the requested amount is fair. I also don't know how the author would go about spreading this translation, how would people in South Korea be aware of this app? Due to the absence of these details, I believe that feasibility, while possible, is not at its best, so I will give it 4 stars. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditability is performed here based on very objective indicators: the number of downloads of the app in the Korean version and whether people who speak the language are using it, thereby increasing their participation in the process of delegating Ada. This is the essential thing to know, but we can also go further, seeking to know a little more about the impact of this proposal on their lives. As with the author's other proposals to translate his app, I think it would be necessary to establish some research here. Could a survey be carried out to understand if the target audience would be getting involved with the Cardano community in addition to this initiative, that is, would they be participating in Catalyst? Have they become CAs, vCas or even bidders? Are they betting more on our blockchain than others? Have there been significant changes in Korean investment in Cardano? As I say at the beginning of the evaluation, in terms of impact, it would be nice to understand if the focus was more directed to our blockchain with the help of this app, because South Korea is a great power, which already has a significant portion of investments in the cryptographic world, but as with most places, the most famous coins take up almost all the space, we need to invest in ways to strengthen Ada. Has this proposal contributed in this sense, based on the experience of its users? Finally, the auditability here is possible, but it can be deepened with some qualitative analyzes added to the quantitative ones, presented by the author. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 355, "q0": "For Cardano to achieve a global impact, it is increasingly necessary to reach a plurality of cultures and peoples. The proposal in question here aims to translate an application that helps teach how to allocate ADA in different staking pools. The target language of this translation is Korean, so we see that the proposal fits the purpose of the challenge.\n\nIt is easy to see that the proposal is not absolutely innovative with what it proposes, but that does not make its usefulness any less important. An impact is already perceived in the short term for this proposal, as an application translated immediately can attract users who speak the language.\n\nAdditionally, the total amount requested to carry out the work seems quite reasonable, as we will see below.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As the final objective is reasonably simple, it will not be necessary to establish a very complex plan for the execution of the proposal. The main jobs basically consist of actually carrying out the translation and inserting this translated material into the application.\n\nThese two steps are described in the feasibility plan; $1,500 will be allocated for translation costs and $400 for development costs. A positive point to be mentioned here is that these values \u200b\u200bare consistent with others that were requested in similar translation proposals.\n\nRegarding the team that will carry out the project, it was stated that the application developer is quite experienced, it was possible to find his contact in the play store: support@colorworkapps.com. This seems to be an indication that the application is scalable and that no major problems should be encountered in translating it.\n\nAs for the translation itself, it was indicated that a professional translation service will be used. It would also be valid to provide a contact that would indicate what this translation service would be, but this does not seem to be a problematic issue at the moment.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The main way to verify the success of the project would be through the launch of the translated application on platforms such as the app store and play store. Because it is a relatively simple idea, its auditability is also quite straightforward. And we realized that this is exactly what was indicated as a work progress metric.\n\nThe way of perceiving the success of the project also seems very coherent, it was indicated that this perception would be given by the greater use of the ADA and its allocation in stake pools by the speakers of the Korean language, this is exactly what we expect as a result given all the features described so far. It remains to be noted that, as a further detail, some numerical parameter could be established to measure this adoption of the use of the translated application. Something like an expected average monthly downloads.\n\nIt is also interesting to mention that this proposal, as well as other similar translation proposals, has the power to jointly increase the influence of Cardano's ecosystem.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 5, "ng": 8, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3337, "q0": "Note: This assessment would be similar to other of my assessments since these proposals are also similar.\n---\nIt\u2019s great to help non-English speakers feel better to be with us in this ecosystem.

This proposal is in line with the challenge setting because it has the potential to bring in many new members into the cardano community who will participate in staking. These new members could then become further interested in starting stake pools or even getting involved with catalyst.
