The proposal does not demonstrate knowledge about either Cardano or the Japanese crypto community, and simply promises to bring the \"coolest things about blockchain, crypto, and Cardano\", create \"cool content, and connect cool people\" - this is as vague as it gets. The problem statement that the Japanese are hesitant or reluctant to get involved in blockchain or Cardano are simply untrue and ignorant about the vibrant community, large ADA holdings and active crypto trading happening in the country. There are a lot of things that could be improved, like taxation, adoption of DID, separation of blockchain use cases and crypto as a speculative asset for example, but the proposal does not mention any reasons in the specific. This is a shame, as Japan and the Tokyo Metropolitan area are not a bad place to start with realizing the challenge brief of getting wider adoption and more SPOs in East Asia.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The individuals mentioned do not have surnames or Linkedin profiles, and their agency's website does not reveal the members or track record of the team or proof of involvement with the brands mentioned.

Although it is stated that the proposal is the \"second installment of a previously funded proposal\" the proposers do not have any such track record or Kudos inside their IdeaScale profiles. A Google search about a first Summit only results in information about the Tokyo Cardano summit that was part of the global Cardano Summit and organized by well-known members of the community, instead of the company or individuals referenced in the proposal. The attachment of the proposal does not work or provide meaningful content. This is a shame, as I am left with no information whatsoever to believe that the event can be carried out successfully by the proposers. It is also disappointing that the budget breakdown is not detailed and lacks information about hourly rates, items of equipment, information about hosts or talent to be invited.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proposal consists of a life event to be held within three months and a total life span of 12 months with 20,000 views on Youtube of the event in total.

I see a conflict between feasibility and auditability arising because of this mismatch, which might require a complete resubmission of timeline and KPIs or a failure of the event, unless costs for hosts, talent, equipment, venue etc. are funded out of the proposers' pocket - which is unlikely given that it is not mentioned in the proposal.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1243", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 949, "q0": "Japan may seem openminded but it is still a conservative country in some issues. Therefore it is best to have local people involved when organizing this kind of event, as japanese are more traditional in this aspect.

As a result, events like this, require people who understand the local culture to run them, otherwise will have a lower chance of success.\nBesides,it\u00b4s hard to generate Impact via online.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "When we talk about the likelihood of success of a project, we are considering whether the results can actually be implemented, but when the above-mentioned problems are not the current problems faced by the Japanese community, it is less meaningful to assess its feasibility.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "There is no previous videos or references to see whether the project can be auditable.

Therefore I give the proposal a four star rating in feasibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo achieve a higher rating I recommend that the proposers discuss possible ways to mitigate the risks discussed in their risk analysis. Would it for example be possible to complete the event fully online in the case of stricter Covid 19 restrictions? I would also like to know how likely they deem changes in venue availability and talent bookings to be. I would also like to note that there seems to be a smal mix up in the \u201cfeasibility\u201d and \u201caudibility\u201d section, as a more detailed plan to action is described in \u201caudaility\u201d and some KPIs are discussed in the feasibility section.

According to the author, Japanese interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is growing, but many are still hesitant to invest or participate in the community. I really like that they bring ideas with a visual identity. The target audience is Japanese people who have heard something about these issues, but do not have enough guidance, to believe in these technologies and thus adopt Cardano or actively participate in projects like catalysts. The solution is the Tokyo Cardano Summit, which showcases the most exciting things Cardano has to offer, attracting newcomers to blockchain. By hosting online events, the proposal will create interesting content about Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies and Cardano that will help newcomers get more interested in learning. The problem raised and the solution presented in the proposal match the challenge in a clear and logical way.

It would be beneficial to suggest if there is some evidence to verify the experience of the team, e.g. Linkedin or the website. As for the step-by-step implementation of this project, I found it very superficial. Little is known about what will happen in 3, 6 and 12 months, it is better to suggest providing a step-by-step plan with broken down timelines and specific goals.

They will hold a second online event for the individuals in Japan who may have limited idea about crypto and have no idea where to start from.

What did the 1st time achieve and what did not achieve? If the second time is implemented, what points need to be improved? If we can analyze past results, we can offer a better direction for the second time.\nIt is recommended that this workshop be held offline or online.

It is necessary to list more detailed items and detailed budgets so that Catalyst can assess the reasonableness of the proposed budget with the content of work to be performed.
