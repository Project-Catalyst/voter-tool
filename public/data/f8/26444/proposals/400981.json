The proposal does not demonstrate knowledge about either Cardano or the Japanese crypto community, and simply promises to bring the \"coolest things about blockchain, crypto, and Cardano\", create \"cool content, and connect cool people\" - this is as vague as it gets. The problem statement that the Japanese are hesitant or reluctant to get involved in blockchain or Cardano are simply untrue and ignorant about the vibrant community, large ADA holdings and active crypto trading happening in the country. There are a lot of things that could be improved, like taxation, adoption of DID, separation of blockchain use cases and crypto as a speculative asset for example, but the proposal does not mention any reasons in the specific.

Although it is stated that the proposal is the \"second installment of a previously funded proposal\" the proposers do not have any such track record or Kudos inside their IdeaScale profiles. A Google search about a first Summit only results in information about the Tokyo Cardano summit that was part of the global Cardano Summit and organized by well-known members of the community, instead of the company or individuals referenced in the proposal. The attachment of the proposal does not work or provide meaningful content.
