The best way to bridge cultural and language barriers is through creating NFT art", "f6_no_assessments": 9, "f6_rating": 4.222222222222222, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 7427, "q0": "The proposal fits the objectives of the challenge, but more details would need to be provided about the project so that we could really assess its impact. We know, as the proponents say, that one of the best ways today to attract people to the crypto world and to our blockchain is through CNFTs, as the concept is on the rise and everyone (practically) is interested in it, in addition to of not being something so technical and complicated, such as, for example, understanding how a smart contract works, which makes it easier for people to fully understand and get involved with the thing. From what I can understand in this proposal, the CNFTs festival is already a reality in japan, probably this was a proposal launched in some previous fund and financed; it is clear that it is an event that brings together English and Japanese speaking communities, in favor of the purchase/exchange/exhibition of CNFTs. However, not much is specified about the festival, some doubts such as: if it is in person or online; if in person, where it takes place; who are these people who participate, who exactly is the target audience, we know that they are English and Japanese speakers, but this information could be more specific; we know what activities will make up this stage of the project, but what has happened so far in this festival, and how has the public reacted? Anyway, in general, I couldn't visualize as clearly how it would happen in practice, and with that I can't measure the impact it would have either. It certainly seems to me a proposal that would meet the objectives of the challenge, that both the expansion and popularization of the Cardano ecosystem, through the purchase of Ada/CNFTs, creation of digital wallets, new people becoming active members of the community, new smart contracts being brothers-in-law at Cardano and etc; and for the benefit of the geographic region in question, that is, East Asia, driving this territory to grow both economically, with a more social and human bias, as well as environmental and so on. This proposal seems that it will certainly popularize Cardano in Japan, through the dissemination of CNFTs, as well as benefiting its local population, since they would be getting to know and starting to consume a technology relevant to the system and will probably also research more about, and with this they will be able to enjoy the advantages and ease that our blockchain offers. That's why I'm going to give it 4 stars, because I think the idea is good but it should be better explained. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "We know in detail what will happen after funding, that is, what activities would be developed. This includes the theme of the conference, its dates, times and who will present it, which professionals will be involved. Really, the only thing that was outstanding in my opinion was the issue of location. All conferences would be and a single location, which one? Or would they be in different locations across Japan? Online, on which platform? It really isn't clear to me. I believe it will all be in the same corner, but I would like this information to have been confirmed, so that we could fully understand the project development process. Generally, I suggest that a script be established that includes exactly what will happen and when, I think this is already exposed in the proposal, another thing that could happen would be a greater detail in relation to pre-production, that is, what would be done before these meetings, so that it would become possible. However, this is just a suggestion on how to make the script even more fun, because the way it is is already very good. As for the other things, budget and staff, I think they're presented quite adequately as well. We know how the total amount would be split quite clearly, although this could have been further specified, for example when they ask for \u201c$5000 - Hiring Video Production team and Video Graphics\u201d, why would it take 5k for that? How many videos would there be, so what their individual price? Likewise, other expenses could also be better detailed. Regarding the team, in this case it is a duo, a lot of information is provided about them, which relate to professional CVs about what they have done so far and also how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem (it is not so explicit which it would be Timothy Vang's work in the community, though). I think it's a good level of detail so that we can get to know them, but their things were still missing, seeing: both a way to prove their CVs, either through a linkedin profile or some other platform that can prove the information said, how much to explain what the tasks of each would be, exactly. With this information attached, I believe we would be 100% sure who they are and if they are indeed equipped to perform these tasks. However, because this proposal is the continuation of another that already exists, a certain confidence is already transmitted in the team. For these reasons, I think the feasibility of the project is good, but to become ideal there are still things to improve. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I don't think this part of the proposal is as good as the others. It's not bad, but it has a lot to improve. Only a few ways to monitor this project are given, which, in my opinion, are superficial. Basically, the suggested audit forms are through videos uploaded on youtube, which would be recorded from the event, and also by the festival itself. But these ways are very basic, I would like to suggest some improvements that could be made here. Regarding the development process, other ways could be created to monitor how activities are being developed. Before the festival starts, the pre-production would be carried out, this could be informed to the rest of the Cardano community if the two proponents elaborate some kind of return to the community. This could be done in several ways, such as establishing video calls, or even through office reports, in short, some way for us to make the information about the progress and preparation of activities for the festival to take place known. of all. Regarding the final results, I think it would be useful if, in addition to the event videos, the proponents made a summary containing basic information about each day: approximately how many people attended, how these people interacted with the speakers and also with each other, how they did captives of participating in the Cardano community and if so, in what way, in general: direct ways to understand how the days of the event itself were. In addition, further research could be carried out, some time after the event, so that we would know how these people would be getting involved with the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem, if they are acquiring, exchanging or exposing CNFTs, etc. This contact could be done by email, as a kind of satisfaction survey about the event and a way to deepen our understanding of its impact. Through these improvements, I think it would be possible to establish a more specific auditability, in the way it is suggested by the proponents, it would be a somewhat superficial follow-up, in my opinion. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 231, "q0": "The proposal coincides with the desired objective, combining art (one of the most powerful communication tools) with Cardano's CNFT technology, and a mix of artists from the West and East, will undoubtedly make Cardano grow and spread in East Asia.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "They have previous experience doing this type of event successfully (funded by Fund7), so they have already demonstrated that they have the necessary skills to carry it out.

It would be better if all team members included a linkedin or other link to verify each other's expertise.
