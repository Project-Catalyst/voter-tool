Further, the embedded 2-minute-30-second YouTube link shows evidence of the team already building the teak farms/tree farms that they set out to make. This, to me, suggests that it is not just feasible, but that funding would further expand and boost a project that\u2019s already in-action, thus that funding would add to their momentum. Their amazing FlorestaProject.com website shows partnerships with several organizations/\u201dSupporters\u201d that could likely also help make this project a reality. \n\nHowever, there is somewhat of a \u201ccircular\u201d problem in that the Feasibility section of the Proposal claims that visualization of a budget breakdown can be found by following a link to a Gerolamo.org website, which is rather bare and empty and merely links right back to Catalyst IdeaScale proposals, without a clear way to see the supposed \"more information\" funding breakdown. It is for this reason that I cannot rate this Proposal higher on Feasibility: without being able to clearly see the budget breakdown, it is difficult to imagine or envision just how exactly the funds would realistically be put into action. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "While I am sure that there is some way to follow along the Cardano Community Hubs and measuring CO2 reduction and reforestation, I struggle to find clearly-measurable and easily-measurable numbers as KPIs for this project.

Aside from the monitoring of numbers minted and sales or transfers of their Floresta Tree Note (FTN) tokens, or perhaps regular updates provided by the team on acreage/hectares planted of their teak tree farms, I am not quite sure how anyone would measure the success of this project\u2019s funding. \n\nI would have liked to have seen a more clear, explicit mention of exact, quantified ways to measure the progress of this project, but details written in the Proposal seem quite vague and nebulous and hard to count.
