I also foresee this itself becoming a potential future growth point, in that coders and programmers who learn how to use Cardano from this project may wind up producing Exchanges that facilitate easier conversion between currencies, which may yield Impact beyond what is immediately planned. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There seems to be a team and well-connected network of minds and available workforce to put this plan into place well within constraints.

The proposer has acknowledged the potential for covid to affect their work, but they have provided a good contingency plan in the event that their translators fall ill. (score given: 5)", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the information in the proposal, I do think that the proposal has the potential to be successful. The proposers have experience at the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corp. and over 30 years of experience at the Ministry of Languages as an Official Languages translator. Additionally, they have knowledge of software development. These credentials give me confidence that the proposers will be able to successfully translate documents and make content videos for the khmer-speaking population. The proposers have given a solid roadmap with good goals that I think can be achieved in the given timeframe. 2 hours of content per month is a lot, but I think that the proposers can keep up with this goal. I have one question for the proposers, however. It is mentioned that the YouTube channel will launch with 6 videos and more content will be added daily. But the proposers then say that after three months, the channel will have 10-20 videos. If content is being added daily, how exactly will there be only 10-20 videos at the end of the 3 months? If the proposers could answer this question, it would greatly strengthen the proposal. The breakdown of the cost is thought out very well \u2013 costs have been divided up into three chunks: translation, social media campaign, and contingency fee. This breakdown helped me understand what funds they were asking for, and it made things clear for me. I have not personally performed translation for videos and documents, but I think that the requested funds are sufficient given the scope of the project. (score given: 4)", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Given the information provided, there is some information to allow for auditability of the success and progress of the proposal. The content produced can be used as a metric of success. Seeing that the videos have been produced can be a way for the cardano community to check and see if the proposal was successful. Additionally, the proposers have given a monthly roadmap with goals, such as 120 min of translated content per month and marketing locally and overseas. These are good goals that can be measured by the cardano community. However, I would encourage the proposers to consider adding more specific quantitative KPIs in the future. They have already listed broad KPIs, such as numbers of viewers, number of watched hours, and number of followers, but are there specific numbers that can be set as goals for these metrics? This way, the cardano community can see if the project was successful at reaching its goal. Lastly, the proposers have listed generally creating awareness as a metric of success. How will the proposers know that they have created genuine awareness and interest in the community? Besides the analytics from the YouTube channel, are there other ways to track this success? These last two questions are more for thought, rather than a critique.

In all other respects they are essential the same.\nHence it is almost impossible to write 19 distinct assessments, I have tried to find specific differentiators but have also looked at the package of proposals as a whole as, I believe,  this will add greater value to the voter. \n\nLooking at this specific proposal for translating videos into Khmer, it largely meets the challenge brief in seeking to broaden the horizons of the Cardano ecosystem. The proposer should be praised for taking the initiative.\n\nI would suggest the proposer uses the comments section to explain voters their rationale behind this multi-proposal approach. That should help with transparency and help people make an informed decision.  \nFor example: Are they looking for voters to decide on which languages they prefer thus restricting the choice to the existing community. This kind of defeats the purpose of reaching out to new communities.\n\nIf this is the case I have done a rudimentary research on number of people speaking each language to help the voters make an informed decision. Given more time, an in depth analysis of demographics would be useful showing current literacy levels, access to technology, levels of education, English speakers, etc in East Asia.\nKhmer bottom so maybe not the highest priority?\n\n1.\tThai:50M\n2.\tBrumese:36M\n3.\tLaotian:30M\n4.\tKhmer(Cambodian):15M\n\n\nWhere the voter needs to pay particular attention is the entirety of the ask.\nThe proposal therefore under assessment are:\nGrow East Asia, Grow Cardano \u2013 4 proposals\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404470\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/403932\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398994\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398993\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The contents of feasibility are duplicated across all 19 proposals.\nIn simple terms we are looking at a total ask of $135,900 of which $38,000 (28%) is contingency. At a proposal level that is $7100 budget with $2000 contingency. \nMy project planning head immediately points to the 28% contingency. It is not clear what this is set aside for. A risk of ADA price fluctuation is noted in the proposals, however one of the proposed mitigations for that is a 10% contingency, the other being to sell funds privately to ADA holders.\nIn addition the proposals states \u201cWe have ample resources to complete the project on time and within budget\u2019, once again raising the question on the need for such a large contingency in proportion to the budget?\n\n  \nNow looking at what is to be delivered.\nEach proposal states the YouTube channel will be launched with 6 videos. We have to assume that means 6 videos translated in all 19 languages should they all be funded. \nAfter 3 months 10-20 videos (each translated in 19 languages)\nThat gives us 380 translations in total at an average of 4 per day. I have run this by someone with experience in this area and their reaction was \u2018its going to need a considerable team\u2019. \n\nSo, let\u2019s look at the evidence of a team with the skills to deliver this proposal.\nThe proposer claims to have many years experience in this field but this is impossible to verify based on the evidence (LinkedIn profile) provided.\nThe other key resource (Muthiah) presents as a trilingual translator. Specific languages are not mentioned so very difficult to validate of if they have the skills for this specific proposal\nTwo other individuals are listed, their LinkedIn in profile are well populated but don\u2019t display the skills required to deliver this project.\nThat leave us with the \u201cextensive network of Master translators\u201d. Again no evidence of their existence of previous work exists so impossible to evaluate.\n\n\nI believe the proposer has a lot to offer the ecosystem and can suggest the following:\n\u2022\tHelp the voter understand the need for 19 similar proposals\n\u2022\tProvide evidence that they have access to the skills required\n\u2022\tLook at a small scope with a set of languages he or Muthiah are comfortable with. Use this as a POC on both the translation and engagement side. SHOW the community this proposal is growing adoption.\n\u2022\tTake the learnings (e.g. which types of video are interesting your audience) and if a larger (multi language) proposal is what is required submit it in a future fund leveraging in the economies of scale that will naturally provide on the maintenance of socials, contingency & marketing.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The metrics are sensible in terms of measuring engagement on youtube which is a great basic piece to measure.\nHowever to really get to the crux of the challenge we need to see the conversion rates into Cardano and/or Catalyst\n\u2022\tincreased interaction between Catalyst and Indian focused projects\n\u2022\tNumber of Indian focused Catalyst submissions\n\u2022\tNumber of Indian focused dapps/services actually built\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_45", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "\n\nThis has to be filtered out.  So many reasons..\nCombining into one proposal may make sense to this proposer who may not be from Asia and recognize the huge diversity from state to state or region to region. All languages cannot be done by same people or same social media campaign.  This is why we broke up. Smaller proposals enable people to clearly see we are not here to grab money.   Each language needs its unique Social media campaign to reach people.  We cannot lump everything into one.   \n\nSecondly Why consider the total ask?  The rules state that each proposal has to be considered on its own merit.  Therefore even if  i had a hundred language proposals, if i had a hundred teams of two Master Translators and Two Proofreaders, then it will get the job done. We are doing this for 25 years buddy.   We know exactly how to run a translation project.\n\n\n\nHe goes on\nThe proposer claims to have many years experience in this field but this is impossible to verify based on the evidence (LinkedIn profile) provided. The other key resource (Muthiah) presents as a trilingual translator.\nI have stated as below, we have and use our extensive network of Master Translator Partners.\n\nThe assessor has not read the proposal. It states clearly as follows\nThe number of people required to complete this task has been calculated.  \nWe will be using our inhouse resources as well as obtain our Master Translator Partner network to handle overflow of work to ensure that our deliverables remain on track. They would be brought on board as and when needed and budget would include their costs\n\nI can see clearly that this assessor is merely following the wrong ideas of some CAs to say that the feasibility is not good because they believe I alone  is doing Or Mr Muthiah D is doing,  the translations or this internal team is doing the translation of all the 10 languages.  This is completely WRONG.  As mentioned above we are using our External partners who are Master Translators with many years of experience and qualifications in translating as Native speakers of Tamil both in Sri Lanka and India. So his feasibility assessment is wrong. \n\nHow the budget was calculated has been clearly laid out as follows.. if he claims he has read the other proposals he will know that we are doing 15000 words per project. Each word costs 0.08 for complete translation to voicing. This cost comes to 1200 and into 3 months it is 3600.  Then this language needs its own Social media campaign since the users of one language would not care about social media campaigns in another language. So all languages cannot be lumped together to do one campaign.  The cost of that being 1500..  Then for contingency we have allocated 2000.    \nSome specific statements that are absolute nonsense=\nHowever, because the primary responsibility of this position is to translate text from English to Tamil, the proposer should include more specific information on their translators' expertise in their Master Translator Partner Network.   As stated we have been doing projects for over 25 years. The definition of Master translator if this assessor doesn't understand is a MASTER OF HIS CRAFT.  A SENIOR IN THE INDUSTRY.   Each one will have different qualifications.  As for our specific master translator, he is the ONLY ONE IN SRI LANKA to write for the Mahawamsa which is like the BIBLE OF HISTORY of SRI LANKA for over 4000 years. It has been written from the time of kings.  This is a role that he alone in Sri Lanka has. So this assessor is talking nonsense\nPlease filter him out."}, {"id": 7842, "q0": "The proposed solution to translate the IOHK content into Cambodian is not backed by supporting data - such as why Cambodian - Khmer ? is there any raising demand there? how is their English proficiency index or is there any other insight? or do the proposer already collaborating with Cambodian Cardano Community? \n\nThe mitigation plan to address future challenges is described in detail including the risk of volatility to pay the translator  - although topping up 10% may not solve the problem - imagine all the funded proposals need 10% top-up - that's a 1.6m USD to handle volatility.
