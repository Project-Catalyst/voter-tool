In proposer words, \u201dThe project will unlock the inherent potential of the Cardano blockchain technology to create a truly decentralized digital infrastructure\u201d.

Eventually, they expand the Symons business model overseas. The process to raise Cardano value is clear. The team members to build this project are experts in cross-industrial network system.

The budget is expected to use for design, prototyping point insurance system, prototyping client application. It is clear and can be implemented thoughtfully. This project is led by Mr. Saikawa, who is strongly trusted by government agencies for regional points. He is an expert in the point system industry, the project could therefore be reliable. The project also mentions the risk it may face, that is the adoption on the Cardano blockchain will be difficult in terms of fees and processing speed.

A slightly more detailed plan for how the proposal can be measured will help ensure that the right progress is being made.\nMy biggest criticism of this recommendation is the budget item. The proposed $50,000 request represents 33% of the total challenge funds, given the size of the proposal, of course. But it will be more convincing if the budget is divided so that it is easier for the community to check the spending of the project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "KPIs are very clear and consistent with the definition of success emerges a good understanding of the target problem. However, as mentioned, the proposal did not have a roadmap with milestones associated with the budget presentation, so it was not possible to measure the progress of the proposal.
