On reading the \"How does your proposal address the challenge\" section, it\u2019s clear the proposer has accidentally referred to the challenge metrics for a completely different challenge - I think a fund 7 one. This is clearly an editing error. From reading the rest of the proposal I believe the proposer actually intended to submit the proposal into this challenge. So operating with the principle of charity in mind, the question for me is whether this proposal addresses the CA challenge or not; and, perhaps controversially, I feel that it does. It\u2019s true that the challenge setting does not refer to d-Reps at all - but of course, it wouldn't, because at the time it was written, d-Reps had not even been suggested yet. Things move quickly in Catalyst, so on principle a challenge should not exclude proposals that respond to relevant new issues that emerge; in fact I think we should applaud a proposer for their responsiveness in doing so. The more complex question is whether something about d-Reps actually belongs in a challenge about the CA process. On the surface, it's not obvious that it does - but delving deeper, the d-Rep role will serve many of the same functions for voters as CA reviews do now (i.e. basically, helping voters to decide how to use their voting power); and the CA and VCA system will have to respond to d-Reps as part of the support system for voting, so it will be important to consider d-Reps in the context of the CA process. As this proposer puts it: \u201cI think dRep is a kind of advisor, increase this number.\u201d  Overall, I feel this proposal actually does address this challenge quite strongly. But as it would be unfair to completely  overlook the proposer\u2019s error in that section of the submission form, I have to rate it 3.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal is clearly very feasible. The time-plan is good, and allows plenty of time for iteration, revisions and full community engagement; and the budget also gives fair costings for a proper iterative process that engages the community. The proposer clearly has the skills needed to deliver the proposal (although some links to his work would be a useful addition to the \"team members\" field, his Twitter account is referenced later in the proposal, and besides, he is well-known in the Catalyst community.) There is also an astute assessment of risk, and thoughtful mitigations, which demonstrates that the proposer fully understands the Catalyst ecosystem.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project is definitely auditable. The KPIs identified are clear and measurable; and there is a good mix of quantitative (numbers of  people giving feedback, numbers of people who delegate without thinking) and qualitative (whether people understand, how clear the rules are, etc). There is also a good focus on sharing the progress of the project with the community via social media, and engaging them with it.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1157", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 2, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 713, "q0": "The first issue face by this proposal is a conceptual one.  The suggestion here is that the as-yet-not-fully-defined role of dReps in the Catalyst ecosystem are a type of CA, and that doing translation/support for a Japanese dRep community would thus fit under this challenge setting.  Unfortunately, while I understand that dReps will have an aspect of \"informing voters\" to them (thereby having a CA-like quality), because they actually *vote* on proposals as their primary role, I can't agree here that this proposal should be in this challenge setting.  And while I might suggest that the proposer could have chosen Groe East Asia or Misc. for this proposal, the better suggestion would be to actually resubmit in a later fund after we know more about dReps, period.  While translation of what is known (which isn't much) is always a value, and I personally am supporting any projects working towards a more multi-lingual Catalyst, this proposal seems to be about 3 months before its time.  The benefits of this proposal are of course multi-lingual support, but also the ability to onboard a significant number of dReps which, in theory, should lead to a lot more staked ADA and ADA mobilized towards Cardano's self-governance.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer is well known in the Japanese Cardano community as a data-hound, and what they propose to do here is essentially a survey to draft a charter, so their seems to be alignment there.  Through iterating a draft document in their community, the hope to create an ethics statement, which I take to mean a guide that aligns prospective dReps in their community with the role as it is eventually proscribed by IOG and the Catalyst community.  The timeline, which is a bit difficult to parse, seems to be targeting 3 months to create this guiding document, and then to capture that participation in the form of nascent dReps participating in another questionnaire to establish their expectations going forward.  The budget is small, and basically covers the costs of drafting the document and running the survey, but then it has a weird line-item I couldn't figure out...  there is $10 per dRep assigned here (for a total of $1000 for 500 dReps...yes, the math doesn't add up).  Is the suggestion that the dReps are incentivized for their participation?  Or is this an administrative cost relating to surveying the dReps?  Another question this line item begs, is whether 500 dReps is realistic.  It sounds like a lot to be sourced from a single effort (I would be surprised if there are more than 500dReps total  in the entire first cohort, but, again, there is much we don't know about the parameters of the program).  For an onboarding program like this, I would have liked to have seen more about the logistics of convening the cohort, as well as details around how their participation would be facilitated, the education required to draft the document, whether it would have Japanese-->English (or any other language) support, or even be opensource, etc.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "To the degree that this proposal is worth undertaking, it seems like it might be difficult to track progress over the first two months, when the draft is being developed.  My suggestion would be to create a GitHub repository for the draft, and allow it to be modulated by the entire Catalyst community (which may have been the plan, but it isn't indicated clearly in the proposal), with any translations forked from the original.  The tracking of the iterative surveys in specific communities will be much easier to do, whether in an opensource repository or not (but even easier if it is), so less concern about tracking progress there.  The proposer has included a twitter account to follow any updates.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 4, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5802, "q0": "As a CA and vCA and also interested in becoming a DRep, based on the approach and goal of the proposal it is not clear that it is aligned with the Challenge objectives, therefore its impact towards the Challenge goals cannot be assessed. \nEven though the author states that the proposal indirectly impacts the number of CAs and vCAs, as it considers the DRep a sort of advisor, I think this angle is at least controversial.\nI would advise to present this proposal during F9, as the DRep role will be more clear and could be even in place, as I do consider the aim of it of outmost importance to the Catalyst and Cardano ecosystem, and specially with its aim to the Japanese community where many voters reside and with the clear intention to support the DReps roles and opportunity to mobilize all those votes thru this new way.
