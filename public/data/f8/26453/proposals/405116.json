Under the current system, learning how to do CA work right entailed a level of initiative and exploring on my part, and I was fine for it, but this also might make Catalyst feel disorganized and unreliable to a newcomer who is considering contributing for the first time. \n\nAn official basic certification system could resolve that, and thus serve as an effective if very basic reputation standard while also helping newcomers understand what this work is all about more efficiently. Though personally I would like to see more accreditation based on successful work performed as a CA, since that is the ultimate meaningful metric.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Given that this is a promising idea, it is disappointing that no information on the team members was presented. Some legwork here, before the proposal is put forward, would be necessary before I could consider successful implementation of this proposal likely. One or two team members assigned to the technical aspect should at least be on board and their credentials/experience noted clearly in the proposal. It's possible the lead proposer could even qualify for this, if they provided a bit more detail about their history and achievements on the technical side. A LinkedIn page, a github, anything...\n\nThat being said, the budget and plan contains sufficient information.

The idea to create a web-based class that CAs can take (I am assuming this is a voluntary proposition), which sounds like it will be asynchronous, is currently already being implemented by Catalyst School (which also has live presentations of the material, as well as 1 to 1 meetings).  I found it unclear whether the role here for veteran CAs was to be available as mentors to new CAs through the academy, or were to be assets consulted for the creation of the educational resources.  If a mentorship program, that would be an interesting twist, and with the intention of this program to award a credential for completing the course, the mentorship could act as a \"verification protocol.\"  On that note, the suggestion of a credential in the proposal is intriguing, yet not described in any detail, or with any intent as to what the standards of credentialing would be.  We don't even know if it is for \"passing\" the class or just participating.  Overall the impact described here doesn't seem to add to what is already happening in the ecosystem, and at best is only an increase in existing bandwidth, a service perhaps better offered in collaboration with other resources, perhaps as an add-on app to the Catalyst School.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The general idea is laid out well enough, but I felt that critical components of the architecture are missing.  For example, the credential claim is perhaps the most interesting, yet the protocols for issuing and holding it are not described.  Is this going to be something provable like a DID?  An entry in a ledger to be cross-referenced by verifiers?  What is the wider role of the credential in the ecosystem, where would it have value?  (And it should be understood that its ability to hold value speaks to how that value was validated in the first place...that it is useful somewhere is the proof that the program suggested here has any impact).  The attention in both the timeline and budget is heavy to development work, and here is where I would have liked to have seen a much better list of team members, including their names and bios.  With no clarifications about the tech stack for the web platform, it is a complete unknown whether this team will be able to successfully implement this.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability of this project really clarifies what is needed from the proposal, but which isn't present.  It purports to count the number of CAs enrolled...is this ones who participate but don't go on to become CAs, or is it only the certified ones?  It mentions the satisfaction of proposer's with the CAs who review them...  which is an anonymous process, so how exactly do the app protocols integrate to that, and, whether anonymous or not, how is that data to be collected or even understood?  The delivery of a learning app that provides existing educational content, or reformats it for an online class is certainly a deliverable, but what this project purports to do (onboard new CAs, raise CA quality) is not measurable within that context.  A project like this needs to have much better defined protocols in order to validate any claims to quality from its offerings, and a good way for the proposer to think about that is to consider the KPIs that they have suggested themselves under the \"Success\" description and really think about what the protocols would look like that can deliver those things in a provable way.  They are worthwhile goals to shoot for, and a learning app could definitely be a path to reach them, so I would recommend refining and improving this idea, collaborating with existing resources, and watching the space for the arrival of DIDs and VC compatibility.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 7, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal is aligned with the challenge in that it aims to support CAs' work and create CA resources, and will also have some impact on CA reputation. However,the proposal does not address the question of how this training dovetails with existing training for CAs, e.g. Catalyst School's videos and guides. If the different training materials are not aligned in some way, then the proposal could have the unintended effect of making the CA process and CA reputation *more* unclear, complex and frustrating, rather than less, if it means we end up with multiple standards. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The UX design and developers have been appropriately costed, but several other elements are under-resourced. First, project management: the proposal team clearly have the relevant skills and experience to manage the building of the platform, but it\u2019s unclear whether the budget element of $500 for \u201ccoordinators incentive\u201d refers to project-managing the developers and the build process, or to facilitating and coordinating the sessions with community members to brainstorm ideas, or both. If it\u2019s only one of those, then the other should be added as a separate cost; and if it is meant to cover both, the money allocated to it is too low - the proposer has specifically recognised that a key risk of the project is co-ordinating the input of several people on content creation, so as a minimum attempt to mitigate that, there should be enough money to pay a skilled person for facilitating and coordinating that process. The content creation is also very under-resourced, at only $500. This is the core of the proposal - after all, without well-structured and effective learning content, the proposal will be useless no matter how beautiful the learning platform is - but as the proposer himself says, the balance of resources and time is all weighted towards the developers. This seems to be the wrong way round. Possibly, the reason for the low budget here is that the proposers intend to repurpose existing content, e.g. from Catalyst School - but if so, it feels like an oversight that they are not explicitly including existing CA guidance in their planning, and also that they're not including School as part of their plan. $1,500 is budgeted as an incentive for \"experienced community members\" to give their input, but the proposal doesn\u2019t specify how many community members this will cover, or how much time they will be asked to give, so it is difficult to assess if it\u2019s too low. There is no budget allocated for marketing and promotion of the certification, which feels like a major omission; there is also nothing for the time needed to evaluate and assess it to check that it is having the desired effects, even though the \u201cauditability section recognises the need to audit this. There is also no recognition of the need to revise or fine-tune the course in the future - there are always changes to the CA process each fund, so the course will almost certainly need some updating by fund 10, so this proposal should probably have included some time and resources to enable the team to submit a continuation proposal to update it (and ideally, such a process should aim to liaise with the CA community and the CA sub-circle around any new changes to the process). My final question on feasibility is that the proposal is not clear whether this course is intended as a compulsory thing in order for someone to become a CA.  I am assuming not, because the proposal says nothing about how this would be managed and certificated, and how we could ensure that someone didn\u2019t (for example) pretend to be certified when they are not; but if it is simply a voluntary thing that only some CAs will do, then this makes it all the more important that it is marketed and promoted well in order for people to know about it and value it. Overall, I see too many questions - particularly on budget - to feel sure that the project is feasible. No doubt something could be created - but would it serve the purpose when it is so under-resourced?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The project is auditable; it includes basic but sensible metrics, and it is particularly nice that the proposer has suggested auditing actual outcomes in terms of improved quality of CA assesments, rather than simply looking at numbers of people enrolled.

This is exactly the problem that this proposal seek to solve. \nTheir solution to this problem is to be able  develop very simple and user-friendly web-based e-learning platform that consists of educational material for guiding individuals who want to serve Catalyst as community advisors. They also indicated in this proposal that the education material will be community driven. That will include a way that will involve experienced VCAs and Project Catalyst community members.\n\nWith this, I agree that it will help of create a very unique learning platform, onboarding new Community Advisors will be much easier as they are only required to go through a set of steps ensuring they have completed each content that is prepared by the community.
