The proposers are advocating for and planning to implement new tools, such as a CA reputation system using digital identity. A reputation system is not only critical for the challenge setting, but it is also incredibly important for the future of cardano catalyst. As a community advisor, I have seen some of the negative effects of scaling as listed by the proposers, so I do agree that this proposal will provide a huge benefit to the entire CA/vCA community as well as the overall cardano ecosystem. While an identity system is not currently fully developed and ready for deployment, the proposers plan to work with the ProofSpace team to hopefully implement their HyperLedger Identity capabilities once it is brought to Atala PRISM. Additionally, the proposers will look into quadratic voting as a potential method for scoring proposals. This idea is another way to address the challenge setting, and, at the same time, can provide an important service to the community by bringing more depth to the proposal assessment stage of catalyst. Thus, voters would have a better understanding of what the scores mean since there would be a larger variance of scores/interpretations. Overall, this proposal addresses the challenge setting in multiple ways. (score given: 5)", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the information provided in the proposal, I believe that it will be successfully implemented. The proposers have the necessary experience in the specific fields that will be helpful in making this proposal happen. For example, Kenric Nelson has been an innovative leader in the research and development of complex decision-making systems, and Allison Fromm has experience with strategic planning. Since this proposal directly involves complex decision-making systems, I think that Nelson and Fromm will be great leaders for this project. Both also have experience from the perspective of CAs and past catalyst circle representatives. With regards to the timeline, the proposers have supplied a very thorough roadmap that is broken down by months (with a total project time of 4 months). It is very easy to see what tasks will be completed in which month. For example, the new CA reputation system will be defined in the first month, coordination with ProofSpace on the DID capability will happen in the second month, and so on. There are multiple tasks that will be completed each month, which is pretty ambitious, but I think that the proposers can achieve all of their tasks if they do not hit any unforeseen roadblocks along the way. With regards to the budget, the proposers have listed out their requested funds in a broken-down manner, which makes it very easy for me to see what the funds will be put towards. Although I do not have experience with this kind of development, given the scope of the project and the length of the project, I think that this budget is sufficient for the proposal. (score given: 5)", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Given the information provided, I think that this proposal will be auditable. The proposers listed three main components that would make this proposal successful if completed. First, a successfully created reputation system that uses DIDs reviewed by IOQ and the catalyst circle. Secondly, mentoring a vCA towards making their improvement idea ready for formal review. Thirdly, providing a report on the pros and cons of quadratic voting. All three of these main goals can be tracked by the cardano community to see if the proposal is successful. In addition, the proposers also listed out some good numerical KPIs regarding the number of dropbox ideas moved from draft to later stages of completion, number of reputation experiments completed, and the number of individuals collaborating with the proposers on developing the reputation system, just to name a few. One question I do have for the proposers is what format or platform will be used to share this auditing information with the cardano community? Will the proposers take time during a town hall to update the community? Will they use a gitbook page? As it is, I personally wouldn\u2019t have time to go through each page that the proposers publish and check every little detail and cross reference it to see if it matches with their goals, so providing a summary of the completed items and KPIs at the end of the project would be very helpful. If the proposers could answer this question, it would strengthen the auditability of the proposal and make it more clear for me and voters to know how people can follow this proposal\u2019s success.

And a Github repository, already used for other Catalyst projects, will be utilized.  Thanks for the suggestion to specify this in the proposal."}, {"id": 449, "q0": "Strongly addresses the challenge, particularly the issue of CA reputation, which is highlighted in the challenge setting. In its focus on CA integrity, it recognises that the CA process is part of Catalyst's governance, as the challenge setting describes. It also represents an instance of a team of CAs coming together to propose a solution (the proposal team's idescale profiles show that both have been CAs, and one of them has represented CAs at Catalyst Circle), which is an approach favoured in the challenge setting. It is also aligned with the challenge in that it aims to reserch the costs and benefits of quadratic voting; an evaluative approach to new models is supported by the challenge setting.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is broadly feasible but I have some questions around risk. The plus side - the proposal is well planned. The deliverables are clear; each element of the proposed solution identifies a clear KPI; and although the exact dates are tentative, the overall structure is clear and sensible. The budget is similarly clear, and is broken down sufficiently (although a little more detail in some areas would not be a bad thing, e.g. the division of the payment to Photrek between project maangement and development). The risks that are identified are well mitigated. The explanation of the background to the proposal, as well as the background and skills of the proposal team, makes it clear that they have the in-depth understanding of the ecosystem that would be needed to realise this proposal; and particularly, the level of connectedness to the CA community (for example, the incorporation of ideas from the Iterative Dropbox) is positive in terms of community engagement. However, given that the CA community is very engaged and informed, I feel there is a risk involved in only consulting with them so late in the project. If they identify issues with the proposed solution, it will then be too late to resolve these, which could ultimately lead to project failure. Also, since reputation and integrity are emotive issues on which people have strong views, I feel that the proposal should outline more clearly some elements of what it will entail - for example, the \"leader of a promising CA initiative regarding integrity\" is not identified, and the proposal doesn't elucidate what this initiative is and what it entails. This means not only that it is hard to assess the proposal's feasibility fully, but also there is a risk of the project being derailed midway if people (either the CA community or the voters) discover that it is doing something unexpected which they don't like or agree with. (Also, as an aside, it's confusing why the \"leader of a promising CA initiative\", who is clearly part of the proposal and part of Catalyst, is not a member of the proposal team.) Also, I feel that the project tries to pack in too many very  significant but essentially unrelated developments. Integrating CA reputation and DID is a huge and important change; and although this proposal is only a first step, it is signifiant. Quadratic voting is similarly a really important idea. In terms of winning community support, engagement and understanding of both ideas, I think it could be a mistake to cobble them together as this project does. It creates a lack of clarity around the overall feasibility of the project - what effect will it have on one element if the other element does not go to plan? Overall, I agree the project is feasible, but with these caveats.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditability is good, with transparent and measurable quantitative indicators - although for a proposal on a topic that elicits such strong opinions, and affects CAs so significantly, I would like to have seen some attempt to audit qualitatively how CAs feel. (Not necessarily about the proposed solution itself, which is in a sense incidental to auditing a proposal to develop it - but about the process, and how engaged, involved and heard they have felt, how the process has gone.) The same is true of qualitative audit of the engagement process with IOG, another key stakeholder. Also, the audit metrics identified don't seem to reference how we will audit the integration of DIDs. I suppose we will just say \"well, it's been done, DIDs are part of the proposed solution\" or \"it's not been done, and they're not\" but it would be interesting to be able to have and record more audit information - how easy was it, how scalable is it, what pitfalls were there and how were they overcome, etc. Overall the proposal is sufficiently auditable, but I think there is room for improvement.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1157", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 6, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "The \"leader of a promising CA initiative regarding integrity\" is purposely left unidentified. During the voting stage Nelson will be monitoring progress on CA initiatives.  The first month of the project, the leader of an important initiative currently lacking funding, will be invited to join the project team. Thanks for the suggestion on auditing the communities input; while engagement with the community is implied and important, specifying this more clearly is a helpful suggestion."}, {"id": 685, "q0": "As a nascent approach to DIDs and a reputation system for CAs, I am all in.  There are really 3 aspects to this proposal, not necessarily connected to or playing off of eachother, but fitting under the larger umbrella of the initiative, which is almost like an ad-hoc CA process auditing body.  Under the name iiCAP, they are ogranizing parallel threads, the first being a framework for auditing and oversight for a DID/reputation protocol also seeking funding in Fund8.  This oversight includes the design phase of the reputation system, so these two projects are closely intertwined.  I also assume that this oversight would capture and likely partner with or co-develop any other reputation initiatives that are sprouting in the CA space at the same time.  The second component is delivery of a detailed analysis of how to incorporate quadratic voting into the proposal assessment process in order to achieve more informative final scoring, particularly in the rankings represented by the \"star system\".  The final component appears to be mentoring and training a CA who will be leading an initiative, selected from the community, to iterate a process from start to finish to fix some integrity related issue for the CA ecosystem.  Presumably this training will include being onboarded to the DID protocol, though that isn't specified here.  The end result (my phrasing here) will be an \"integrity improvement\" protocol, which will be presented as a report alongside a description of a reputation system, rooted in DIDs for security, that is able to express the results of the discovered protocols.  I have my concerns about the need for this type of governance to be a discovery and not an imposition, but I also  think this will be a good example of the kind of experimentation that can lead to that discovery.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I think this team in conjunction with its did:prism partner Proofspace is ideally suited for this research.  They have excellent communication and connections with the community, they have already delivered research on some of the ideas in this proposal, and they are and have been engaged in the work and processes of CAs so they understand all the various subtle dimensions that come into play.  Their timeline is realistic and I like that they have broken the budget up both by roles serviced and by funding tranche.  The way they have described their roadmap makes clear, month by month, how the project will iterate, when it will onboard its CA/trainee, when research moves from one topic to the next.  The DID discussion is light, as this is more about capturing the process as it happens, and the actual process is described more in the team's other proposal.  The main risks to this proposal revolve around its integration into other ideas currently underway in this ecosystem, and in another nod to the qualifications of the team, they are partnered or advising across most of those integrations.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They have laid out eminently achievable milestones here, with the main blockers being slow uptake on the DIDs.  Even with that possibility, it shouldn't hamper too much the design of the reputation system.  There is some disconnect between the relevant KPIs here and the deliverables...almost all measurables really fall under the adoption of iiCAP protocols, which will be under constant evolution through the scope of this project.  The deliverables, on the other hand, are a reputation sytem for consideration, a trained CA under an iiCAP protocol, and an analysis of quadratic voting for proposal comparative ranking (the star system overhauled).  Rather than KPIs, the teams funding tranches will probably be released upon having some kind of percentage complete metric on these deliverables, to IOG and the community, perhaps as \"draft, in-progress, finalization\" (an interesting reflection of existing protocols in the iterative dropbox they reference).  However, I have no doubt this team can report something to keep this project funded and on course, and completion, by delivery of the aforementioned items, is an easy to gauge metric of success.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 7, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 972, "q0": "The \"problem statement\" given is a bit to vague and unspecific.

The proposer correctly lists a number of different \"problems\" that have been highlighted by the community, but it would have been better if the proposer had been more specific on which problems he intends to tackle, as tackling all these problems is not feasible for a 4 months project. Which of the problems listed  would the the creation of a CA digital identity program tackle ?\n\nMost (if not all) the problems regarding the (v)CA process are summarized in some way in the many proposals put forward by the community via Iterative Drop box, and its great that someone will finally make use of these to improve the CA process.

The community is constantly adding to the Iterative Dropbox, and the objective of this proposal is to move existing proposal from draft status (which is correctly identified as one of the measures).\n\nThe Success criteria described are just a repetition of the plan described in the feasibility section i.e. i) creating a reputation model, ii) integrating a vCA into the team and iii) output of the evaluation of the QV method.
