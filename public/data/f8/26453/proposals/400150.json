The tool's popularity & widespread use indicates that CAs must be finding it useful to \"improve their work\"; and the fact that the proposal team are active CAs themselves means that the proposal is an instance of co-design, and of CAs forming teams to address CA needs.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Clearly feasible. The tool is already in use and updates have been managed over several funds already, so the team evidently have the skills and experience to deliver this proposal. The timeline is organised and feasible, and includes awareness of the possible risks involved in updating to Vue.js version 3. The budget's new approach, with clear awareness of and inclusion of the costs of management and admin, demonstrates the team's understanding and experience of what will actually be involved in delivering the proposal; and the move to a \"treasury\" approach with a budget element included for the ongoing development of AIM's longterm sustainability is a very positive change. The only element I feel is slightly missing is an outline of how user feedback on the tool (how easy it is to use, what needs changing, etc) is collected. The wording of the propoosal suggests it's mainly collected via GitHub; but since many CAs are likely to not be GitHub users, it seems probable that at least some of the feedback is collected anecdotally, by the team noting comments and discussion on Catalyst social media (e.g. Discord and Telegram). If this is the case, then the time it takes to do this (and to therefore make the tool responsive to the needs of the whole the CA community, not just those technically-skilled enough to have a GitHub account) should be costed; and if it's not what happens, then it should, in order to ensure a wide range of user opinion is included in planning updates.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The approach to auditing is transparent and clear, and the project's achievements are easily auditable through a combination of well-defined timings and milestones, simple audit metrics, and anonymous tracking of users. This should be more than sufficient to audit whether the proposal has delivered on its intention. It's also a positive that audit has not been made unsustainably complex, but is in line with the small scale of the proposal.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1157", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 4, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This is one of those continuing expenses under the hood that everyone takes for granted until its gone.  The CA-Tool is an improvement to the CA process that allows CAs to work outside the outdated and restrictive confines of Ideascale platform.  It allows us (I am using it right now!) to distribute our assessments more evenly and to where they are needed most, by showing us how many assessments proposals have.  It also gathers in one place a lot of the resources CAs need to do their job properly, such as links to the guidelines and handy lists of considerations for CAs to check off as they assess a proposal.  Additionally it allows CAs to work more efficiently by making browsing proposals faster and easier, helping us keep track of what we have done and submitted, and giving us larger fields into which to compose our assessments, instead of the cramped windows on ideascale.  For most CAs the tool is indisposable.  But it needs updated every fund, and it needs tested and maintained.  Additionally, as Catalyst evolves, the tools need to evolve too, so a skeleton crew maintaining it as a hobby isn't going to cut it.  With this funding proposal carrying it all the way through Fund 10, you won't find a better deal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has proven reliable and committed and it has grown to add even more developers who can assist.  They have effectively communicated the build requirements and what the nature of the updates required and schedule will be, as well as provided a budget list for each of the rollouts.  They have also included an experimental \"Guild Fee\" which will go towards trying to implement a treasury that can add sustainable bridging between funds, and possibly even develop into something more sustainable.  There really aren't any risks tied to this project:  they are doing what they have done from the start, and none of their planned updates look like risks to crash the platform. Their insistence on community feedback and testing protocols indicates that CAs will have a tool that works for them and be able to trust that the improvements are successful.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This is an Opensource code (though, sadly, not yet forked...we need a dark-mode designer to grab this and get instant market share, lol) so there will be no trouble keeping up with commits and issues in their Github.  Additionally, you see the AIM toolmakers everyday in the Catalyst ecosystem, so keeping in touch with the developers is a non-issue, whether on their own dedicated channels, or any of the many community channels they frequent.  The funding isn't an auditing issue for them, as it will be paid out quickly, but they already have a protocol in place for dealing with the 6 month reporting cycle and delivery of the final report.  In the meantime they will have all of the improvements and updates in the timeline to report on, so I have no doubt they will be able to bring the funding to an agreeable closure.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 6, "ng": 12, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "As a (v)CA i've used the CA-tool over the past two funds for both the assessment and review stages and it has significantly increased my productivity, and i believe this to be he case for the majority of (v)CAs who have chose to use this tool. It gives us the ability to filter proposal  and assessments by tags, challenge, length and provides and update on the number of assessments/reviews per proposal/assessment which helps the CA community focus the work where it is needed. Providing a more permanent funding will provide an extra incentive for the AIM team to further develop an improve this tool.\n\nIOG still maintains a significant oversight over the whole Project Catalyst project, and as a community we often find difficult to push through with improvements and/or innovations. This tool is fully designed by the community and for the community and it is my hope that it will gain more and more prominence in Project Catalyst and for this reason i give this proposal the maximum rating for Impact.\n\nThe proposal aligns perfectly with the challenge brief specifically to the \"Number of maintenance proposals and groups created\" KPI, but also on the \"Number of new tools developed\" KPI as the proposers plan to introduce new features", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This tool has already been in operation for quite a few funds now and it's been successful in term of community reception so it's clear that this is a feasible proposal.

Victor, Lucio and Phill are very active members of the community, not just in terms of the maintenance of the tool, but on every aspect of Project Catalyst. They are engaged in most discussions, have worked as CA's and vCA carrying out assessments and reviews, participated in a number of different proposal in different challenges, being elected for Catalyst circle, etc. This to say that they are fully aware of the community \"wants and needs\"\n\nThe proposal presents a plan with what tasks will be carried out at each stage, including the description of the technical improvements (e.g. updating to Vue.js 3). The proposal mentions that new features will be developed in both funds. A bit more detail on what these features will do or cover would have strengthen this proposal and allowed the community to assess the success/usefulness of these.\n\nThe main risk for this project is that Victor, Lucio and/or Phill become to busy by other projects that they don't dedicate enough time to maintain and improve the CA-tool.
