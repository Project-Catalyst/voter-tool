Lack of structure is a main issue", "f6_no_assessments": 16, "f6_rating": 2.7708333333333335, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 447, "q0": "The general idea (a tool to help CAs write assessments that cover all the things they should cover) would address the challenge; however, this proposal is vague, and doesn't specify what form this tool would take (is it simply a guiding document, an interactive online tool, or something else?) and how it would work; so it is hard to assess specifically whether *this* proposed tool would address the challenge aim of improving CAs' work. And, from the limited information given in the proposal, there are elements of this proposal which clearly do *not* align well with the challenge-setting. For instance, the challenge-setting places a high value on co-designed tools and tools designed by teams of CAs; but this proposal doesn't address that, and seems to be looking to codify one proposer's personal approach to assessing proposals. Assessment methodology is very personal, and every competent CA has their own very personal take on it; so it's an area which, perhaps more than any other, should probably align with the challenge setting on co-design and bringing together ideas from across the CA community.  Also, the challenge setting specifically invites proposals that \"Evaluate different models of proposal assessment\" - this does the opposite, by choosing and elevating just one method. On the information we are given, the answer here is either \"inconclusive\" or \"no\"; but I've given the proposer the benefit of the doubt with a score of 3.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The timeline is vague, and doesn't at any point explain what form the tool would take, and what exactly will need to be built or what technology is going to be used. The tasks need to be broken down far more, so we can assess whether the proposer understands what work needs to be done, and has planned approporiately. The \"proposal team\" field is supposed to list the \"team members required to complete the project\" - but instead, it lists a group of people most of whose skills don't align very closely with the proposal, and then says that a separate developer will be engaged to actually do the work. Engaging staff after funding is fine - but to assess project feasibility, we need to know what skills and experience the proposer will look for in the person they're going to engage, so that we can assess whether the proposer has accurately assessed what skills are needed. The budget is also vague and general - it should be tied a bit more closely to defined tasks or specific costs, and be broken down a bit more, so we can see whether the proposer has costed things fairly, and so we can assess whether any elements are missing that would damage the feasibility of the project. Overall, a proposer who gives so little detail where detail is required is unfortunately something of a red flag in terms of feasibility, since this demonstrates  that they are not keen to pay attention to practicalities or to detail, and have not fully thought the proposal through. So on balance, I would have to say that this proposal as it currently stands is not likely to be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "To audit the progress of the tool build, and then the integration, no information is given on what will actually be measured and how \"progress\" will be defined; without any audit metrics, the proposal unfortunately is not auditable. On \"integration\", reports from the original builder of the voter tool are expected - has this been agreed with them? The existing voter tool is open source, so anyone is of course free to build on it; but without some kind of prior agreement, developers can't expect the original builder to engage in reporting on integration for them. There is no information given on how marketing will be audited, beyond saying it will be done by a \"professional team\" - no metrics are suggested for what will be tracked. Given all this, the proposal as it stands is not auditable. Additionally, the \"what would success look like\" description reveals a questionable approach to auditing success - the proposer refers to trying to control things that he cannot control rather than seeking to understand and hear what the community genuinely thinks (for example, \"...educate VCAs that this tool is useful and must be valued and given high scores\"; \"Have proposers demand that CAs and VCAs take the tool seriously...\") The usefulness or otherwise of a tool is something the community must decide, not something that the maker of that tool can demand. Particularly, it would be borderline unethical to suggest, as this proposer appears to be doing here, that VCAs should be \"educated\" to believe that CAs who use this tool (or any particular tool) to write their assessments \"must\" be given high scores.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1157", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 7, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 662, "q0": "The search for ways to increase the quality of CAs marches on and this proposal has added itself to the line.  The suggestion is a tool which functions like a questionnaire to help CAs identify what are the most likely points about a proposal that need to be covered and detailed.  Leaving aside the fact that in the existing CA tool already has a checklist of questions derived from the requirements outlined in both the proposer and CA guidelines (should we assume this questionnaire has different questions?  How are we to validate their relevance?), let us consider for a moment the role of a CA:  is the job of a CA to offer unique insight into a proposal to both encourage and help improve the proposal and to inform the voter, or is it to grade the completeness of a proposal, by checking its contents against a list and deeming it valuable or not, which means it is actually the list which determines that value?  I say the latter is so far beyond the pale as to be utterly offensive.  I will never subscribe to the idea that unique humans creating unique proposals deserve anything less than unique perspectives from readers, assessors, critics or supporters.  Templates and questionnaires can, AT BEST, structure an approach, can provide support as an assessor comes to grasp and express the integrated totality of THEIR understanding of a proposal.  But these tools cannot be a substitute for that integration, whether someone is rewarded for that behavior or not.  CAs should strive to provide insight to proposers and voters (which results in an inner commandment for the CA to desire to expand their knowledge), and a tool that stresses templates or rigid lists of questions does more harm than good to this directive, unfortunately.  CAs have plenty of existing guidelines and questionnaires that can prompt them as they develop their skills, I do not see any value presented here to justify adding more.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The biggest issue here for me is the that the nature of this questionnaire means everything to this proposal, yet it is taken for granted in the description.  The only clue to its value is the claim by the proposer that they used a version of it to get good grades on their assessments.  What we really need is a way to parse and validate that claim, such as including actual rates of Excellent/Good/filtered outs obtained with the tool (this can be expressed as percentages of a rounded off number to avoid violating the anonymity of the proposer's CA number), and even better to have those rates expressed as a rate of improvement between funds where it was not used and then used.  If this were being built out as a research project (and a much lower budget that reflects the uncertainty of the value added) I would have a completely different opinion of the effort, but as is, we need to see some proof that there is value to this questionnaire beyond what the community already has available.  In addition, to the degree that this needs to be built out as a tool, I would have liked to see a plan for the development, especially for the team member or sourcing responsible for that, as none of the ones listed have experience in that area.  Without that information, I don't see why the development and integration factors are priced where they are, especially the integration, as the existing CA tool from AIM is opensource and could be forked and have their development module added with a few clicks.  If they have a different architecture in mind, that would be good to have seen here.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditing elements included in the proposal commit an error I believe is repeated throughout:  there is no evidence that the proposer considers the value of this to be anything less than certain, and that a failure to realize that (say through a provable metric) is not the fault of the project, but rather a failure of others to see its value.  The inclusion of KPIs to measure the value of a project are important because that is ultimately how we measure the impact that the project had, and thus the expected value of maybe voting for it.  What is included here is closer to milestones (including collaborating with the AIM team, though as I noted above that isn't necessary) and they just assume it was successful.  There might be a suggestion here that the idea is to onboard a cohort and collect data on how it helps them, however that isn't explicit or clear, and adds the problem of needing to present protocols for the preservation of anonymity, which hasn't been calculated here.  As a software deliverable, it would have been nice to see them list any repos or tracking software that could be used for reporting purposes, and of course, it would be nice to know if the result was to be opensource.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 12, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1862, "q0": "This proposal identifies a problem that is well aligned with the challenge.

However, there is no mention on who in the team will work for how long on what position.

Please consider reading some highly assessed proposals here https://cardanocataly.st/voter-tool/#/  and  implement the milestones and metrics in your next proposal. Also please consider, that the voter does not know enough to imagine all the things that you know and in order to present your solution comprehensively there is a great need of explicit and detailed explanation of the process that will deliver the solution you envision. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1417", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 289, "q0": "When we talk about results, we know that when solving problems and achieving great results, it is crucial to standardize processes to guarantee stable and predictable results.

Furthermore, this tool will support the proposer during their preparation for future funding helping him/her what are the gaps of the proposal.\nAs a critic, since risks are something that has a potential impact and probability to happen in different projects, I suggest the proposer include some mitigation actions for the mapped risk.

Not the whole thing, obviously, but for a request of $10,000+, for something that has an existing form and, according to the proposer, a track record of success, we should be able to see what he means to some degree.

I believe the budget would have been feasible if Specific processes and their associated cost allocation were identified to give the investors a clear angle to what exactly they are investing into rather than broadly categorizing cost.\nIn terms of the relevancy of skills and experience for the work, I do not foresee how their stated skills will help in the development of questionnaires, as the individuals\u2019 skills were mostly focused on their language translation expertise.

Using the community advisor assessment guide, CAs can have a comprehensive vision of what is expected from their work, the criteria to be used, and also the many shades and nuances that can influence their score decision rating.\nMy experience as a VCa in Fund 7 is that questionnaire-based reviews were more difficult to read, and I needed to read the whole proposal to assess the review. Voters reading this should remind that proposal assessments are made for voters, to avoid them reading the whole proposal. If a questionnaire-based tool is used, it may lower the quality of assessments by forcing ideas to fit into predetermined boxes.\nWhile I agree that the proposal would make the CA work easier, I disagree that it would improve Community Advisor work.
