Before long, the same issue is brought back up again and the cycle repeats.  While the CA community has organized several initiatives to structure this type of problem solving and solution seeking, including communications, education, productivity and governance working groups, what we don't have is a means to incentivize these initiatives, nor to reward bounties for work done in compiling CA/vCA data or visuals.  The role of the Treasury proposal is to secure a 6 month funding cycle, however it is not required to disburse the funds over that 6 months, it is just not allowed to ask for more until that funding cycle is over.  The inclusion of the Treasury Framework document is helpful, as it explains the objective terms and rules for the management of the treasury, which is key for the transparency of the experiment going forward.  In particular it describes all the roles and how they are governed, including the Treasurer who manages the funds, and the Claimants, who make claims against the fund.  It also describes all the processes that these roles may engage in within the scope of the Treasury governance.  Finally it includes a TIPs protocol, Treasury Improvement Proposals, which will allow it to evolve with the needs of the community.  This treasury should ensure an engaged and enthusiatic CA community drawn to positive growth for the ecosystem.  As an engaged CA, I give it the highest marks.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer is the Catalyst Circle Rep for the Community Advisors and as such she serves at the pleasure of the community.  And a pleasure it has been!  She has helped organize and provide the space for many new initiatives within the CA space regarding self-governance, and this proposal figures to enable more of the same.  Sustainability of any effort is critical to the maintenance of the processes and roles that emerge from a networked community like the CAs, and the proposal points out 6 major areas of effort and maintenace that are typical of engaged community members.  It is worth noting that these are the same categories outlined in the larger Catalyst governance scheme, as outlined in the IOG paper \"A Treasury System for Cryptocurrencies:\nEnabling Better Collaborative Intelligence\" and in fact, many of the governance protocols for the governing framework of the treasury have been mirrored from this seed document.  The explanations in the Treasury document are straightfoward, if a little plain, but that is good for a community oversight document like this.  The risks facing an experiment such as this will fall in the areas of credibility and trust.  I feel the first is mitigated by the proposer's current role in the community in that she answers directly to the community and is under the immediate oversight of IOG.  The second is mitigated, in my opinion by the solid foundation of the governance framework and its ability to evolve from community feedback.  \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer here has included useful KPIs that measure both the disbursement of funds and the impact those funds are generating.  While it would be nice to already have the Qualitative Audit Standards being designed by the QA-DAO community (see their proposal in F8: Improve and Grow Auditability), we are left to ask ourselves how we measure the impact of a healthier Quality Assessment community in Catalyst.  In looking at what the proposer has suggested, I can distill these ideas even further:  we will see more Self-Organization (shared opportunity), more Promotion of Emergence (learning our way forward), Embracing Change (developing resilient communities) and more cultivating of Dynamic Tensions (finding synthesis and growth in disagreement).  With the governance protocol requiring audit reports with every Treasury action, and with strictly defined processes that are allowed, it should be easy for the proposal to meet reporting requirements to achieve full release of funds.  For anyone worried that the $25K would be at risk in the community, it is worth noting that the auditing protocol means this initial iteration of the Treasury protocol will have to use its auditing reports to release the full funding amount from Catalyst.  This means the community will always be in control.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 10, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 115, "q0": "This is a seemingly obvious need to help build a stronger CA and VCA community, having a small amount of funding would enable creative solutions to onboard and direct new CAs and VCAs and I think this could have a huge impact on the QA stage of each funding round", "q0r": 5, "q1": "You have clearly thought a lot about all of the mechanisms required to implement this solution successfully.

It presents an inventive approach to engaging CAs with solving their own issues, by seeking to resource this properly and avoiding undue reliance on volunteerism; and it responds to the need for flexibility and rapid responsiveness to issues as they arise (i.e. the \"constant challenges\" faced by CAs that are mentioned in the Challenge setting).", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I like the proposal's clear grasp of the main risks that could potentially damage feasibility (i.e. fast growth of Catalyst, and the treasury being overwhelmed; and the issue of transparency of results) and the effective mitigation of this (a well thought out governance protocol). The funding cycle of 6 months is good for feasibility - I don't think the project could be delivered in 3. The funding categories identified are comprehensive, which shows thoughtful planning; and the proposer and team clearly have the skills and contacts to be able to realise the project well. But there are some questions. On the funding categories - I would really like to see the \"marketing\" category include in its scope the sharing/promotion of this Treasury protocol itself, given that the proposal hopes to see it used and adapted by others within Catalyst. On budget - it is completely reasonable that the budget is flexible, and that it is not yet determined exactly what will be spent on each category; but to assess feasibility, I feel I'd like to see some kind of indicative estimate of the proportions that are expected to be allocated to each category, just to get a sense that the balance is reasonable. I also feel that the admin costs of $500 are too low - this equates to just $17 a month per Admin Team member, which seems low for all the work they will need to do, especially in the initial setup stage. I'd also like to see clarity on the creation of  the 5-person Admin team - who will select the members? And is this intended as a permanent role (assuming that this proposal is resubmitted in a future round, and the Treasury becomes an ongoing thing beyond its first 6 months)? These types of issues often generate debate in Catalyst, so if it's unclear, or hasn't been worked through with the CA community, this could slow down the project or make it less feasible. Also, on the issue of future funding rounds - I'd like to see some money specifically earmarked for the time needed to work on a continuation proposal for fund 10, since for true feasibility, this treasury needs to be sustainable; it can't be just a six-month-long \"one-off\". In many areas of Catalyst there are issues with resourcing the submission of ongoing funding proposals, so it feels important to resource this specifically, rather than just include it under (for example) the Treasury admin heading.  But overall, with those minor reservations, the proposal is clearly feasible.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal identifies good and effective audit metrics, which will be readily measurable and transparent; and I particularly like the inclusion of a metric on \"Number of other participants who adopt similar Treasury protocols\", as it will be interesting to know whether this approach to managing a Treasury is useful elsewhere in Catalyst. But I would like to see the inclusion of some more qualitative measures around the effectiveness of what the Treasury has funded. The metric \"Amount of specific recurring Community events\" begins to address this - but I feel it would be of value to record and audit more than just the number of events. Who did they reach; how many people attended; and crucially, what did they think? Some kind of simple qualitative assessment from attendees would be a really good addition here. Similarly in other areas: if the ultimate aim of the whole process, and the definition of success, is to improve the capacity to provide high-quality CA work, then it would be great to consider ways to audit whether or not this is happening. Of course, it's not easy to prove a direct causal link on things like this - but finding ways to audit impact and demonstrate value feels very important in a primarily project-based funding mechanism such as Catalyst, because it enables the community to see the point of a treasury, and to understand the need for some funding in the system that is not allocated to a project, but to a team. Having said that, though, this proposal is clearly very auditable; the above points are more general reflections, for the long-term and for all of us in Catalyst.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1157", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 7, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 932, "q0": "The problem statement of the proposal is poorly worded and already attempts explaining the solution.

Establishing incentives for fulfilling services we all take for granted is a strong, and perhaps the only, way to really address these gaps. The proposers have laid out a plan that is fairly comprehensive. The only flaw I would note is that the proposal doesn't really detail which elements of this plan serve as maintenance of services that are functional (community management) and where this proposal would provide services that are basically new (the auditing report would appear to fall under this).

The need for payment of these services is easy to spot, in the current situation this work has been done in a volunteer manner and this leads to burning out of the active members and this leads to loss off talent and experienced people from the CA ranks.\nThe problem is very well aligned with the challenge objectives, because it addresses the ongoing need for maintenance of the support structure for CA/vCA active community. Maintenance proposals are key metric for this challenge. \nTreasury for rapid funding of the needs of the CA/vCA community is an elegant way of solving the problem. In one hand it allocates a specific sum for the active CA/vCA members to deploy on whatever is urgently needed but on the other hand there is a transparency on where and for what the funds have been spent. This brings a way for the greater community to oversee if the funds are properly allocated. \nThe impact of this proposal will not be immediately seen, but it will bring a strong base for the CA/vCA to step on and therefore improve the performance of this cohort and as a consequence the performance of the whole Project Catalyst.\nI strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It is clearly outlined what categories of needs will be funded by the treasury with a significant reasoning why are they important and should be funded. Honestly, the budget of the treasury looks quite insufficient for all these categories and all the work that needs to be done in the CA/vCA support structure. However this Challenge does not have a lot of funds to distribute and I suspect this is the reason the proposer limited the proposal with less funds for the first round. This could also be a positive thing, since this will be the pilot for the treasury and it will be wise to experiment with lower stakes.\nThe proposal has a roadmap which is mainly derived from the governance framework of the treasury as this is the main document that governs the function of the treasury. Link to the document is provided for everyone to see. The governance framework is a well written document that is still under construction. Clearly the document is a collaboration effort of a group of people which are active and recognizable community members. The document not being completed prior to the submission of the proposal is a little bit worrisome. However given the crazy speed with which the Project Catalyst is moving it is not at all unexpected.\nThe roadmap provides clear actionable points for the creation of the treasury structure and on the mechanism for fund release by the treasury.\nUnfortunately in the roadmap we don\u2019t see any timeline to go parallel with the roadmap. \nThe budget breakdown is well described and very simple. All funds will be distributed in the 7 outlined categories when needed, except $500 that will be used to fund the treasury admin team 5 people $100 each for their service in the 6 months following the funding of the proposal.\nThe team is poorly presented. The leading figure is the CA Circle Representative but there is no CV or link to a place where we could learn more.

The auditor should discretionarily decide if the progress of the project is sufficient or not, if an imaginary milestone is reached or not. \nTo avoid discretionary decision making from the auditor, it is very important that a proposal has clearly defined milestones with numbers attached to them. \nThe community needs to know what to expect from the proposer up front.\nI disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1417", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 3, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2165, "q0": "This is a very interesting proposal.
