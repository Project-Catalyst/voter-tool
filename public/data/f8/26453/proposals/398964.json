It identifies accurately that one of the biggest barriers to an effective CA process is the confusion of so many different sources of information; and instead of trying to select just one source, it takes the Catalyst-friendly, decentralising approach of doing a kind of \"literature review\", and mapping, collating, and categorising them so CAs can easily access all of them. By engaging the CA community in this process, the proposal also ticks the box of active co-design. The only thing I would have liked to see is for the proposal team to include someone with some experience of being CAs themselves, to fulfil the challenge-setting's success-definition of \"Community Advisors (CAs) submitting proposals as a Team\". (The team do not mention if they've been CAs, but none of their Ideascale profiles show any activity under \"assess\", so this indicates they have not.)", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal has some good elements on feasibility, but there is an overall lack of clarity. The suggested duration of 26 weeks (amount of time the project managers are engaged for) is good, and not rushed, indicating that the proposer understands that proper community engagement is not a quick task. However, the detailed timeplan is therefore confusing, as it appears only to cover part of the 26 weeks of the project. I like the fact that the proposal addresses the need to \"keep information updated in the context of the current catalyst program\" - but I can't see this accounted for in the timeplan or resourced in the budget, so I don't feel confident it would be realised. The team does seem to have relevant skills, although it would be good to see some links to their previous work; but it's not clear whether one of the team will be the \"content provider\" who will be contracted, or if this will be one of the \"further experts\" who will be engaged. As this content-creation role represents the bulk of the work and the budget, it would be good if this was explained; and, if the content provider is yet to be recruited, some detail should be given about what specific skills will be sought, so we can assess if these are appropriate and sufficient for the task. The budget is also a little thin on detail, and the costings seem off - just over $400 a month ($2,500 for 6 months) for a \"senior consultant\" to manage the project looks very low, so I would value some information on how much work is expected for this. On risk - the risks are not defined well; and the mitigation suggested for the one risk that has been identified is odd (the proposers suggest they will mitigate the risk of difficulty engaging the CA community by enlisting the help of IOG and Cardano - but they haven't elucidated how that would work, nor have they explained why they would not take the more obvious approach of approaching the CA community either directly via its many channels, or via Catalyst Circle). On balance, I regret that I can't feel confident that this proposal will be successfully implemented.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Auditability information is a little thin. The Agile/Scrum approach *can* be validly used for audit as well as project management - but in order for us to assess the auditability, the proposal needs to define its metrics: i.e. what will the team actually measure, count or assess to determine whether the project is succeeding? What kind of desired outcomes would be in the user stories for this project? etc. It would also be good if the proposal mentioned how the information from sprint reviews will be recorded, and if it will be shared with the community (and ideally, I'd like to see the team use an open-source tool such as GitHub for this, in line with Catalyst's open-source ideals, rather than e.g. a proprietary Kanban tool). And in the \"what does succeess look like\" section, the proposer mentions their ideal of an \"Above 9/10 review score\", but there is no information about this review process so that we can assess how validly it audits the project. For example, will only users be asked, or will there be any attempt to include the perspectives of those who chose not to use the tool? What will be asked - will it be just a blunt-instrument \"how satisfied are you\"? or will any attempt to be made to elicit reasons? And will the review be done only at the end of the project, or will there be any mid-term evaluation while there is time to make adjustments in response? (As an aside, I'd also like to have seen the the review process, and how it is to be resourced, explicitly included in both the timeline and the budget.) But overall - based on the information given here, i can't fully agree or fully disagree that this proposal is auditable by the community.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1157", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 6, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 659, "q0": "Perhaps the most common complaint of recently onboarded Community Advisors is the massive amount of information that is available and how difficult it is to get it all into a frame of reference that they have access to.  There have been lists, spreadsheets, living documents...all suffer the same fate:  they lack protocols and enthusiasm to keep up with the constant change that defines the Catalyst process, and they eventually become outdated...and then abandoned.  What the proposer suggests here has perhaps the dynamism to survive this process:  a visual map of the Catalyst ecosystem as it relates to CAs and their work.  They hope to address the need for the map to take on a life of its own by building out the contribution protocols so that new knowledge can easily migrate into the visualization, and also renumerating CA participation in building it out.  It is unclear if the renumeration is meant to extend into a maintenance stipend or how they intend to keep the enthusiasm rolling...the expectation is that it will be effective enough, and easy enough to keep updated, that the community energy around using it provides the incentive to make sure that new knowledge and resources are captured there.  They intend to collaborate closely with the CA community to build it out, which is good.  Often when good lists have gone bad in the past, it has been because they have sprawled and become random repositories of vast reaches of irrelevant, outdated or unrelated knowledge, so keeping this resource map tightly tied to the CA community (with community consensus for changes) may provide the guard rails needed to help prevent this attempt from ending up like many of the others.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has provided minimal information to backup their qualifications, however the qualifications they have listed seem adequate to the needs of the project, which mostly involve collecting and organizing information, and conducting outreach and onboarding for delivering and maintaining the visualization map/tool.  They indicate that there are tools they can use to this end, but the specific tools are not listed here.  The budget is also quite general, not listing specific tools or if they have annual costs.  There does not seem to be any concern that there would be an ongoing budget issue to maintain the tool, and they state clearly that all resources created in the delivery of the project, including the final map, will be handed over in their entirety to the community.  For time, they see the project being delivered in 5-7 months, with a very broad 3-phase set of milestones.  There are no specific development sprints or expected commits for the process, and there is an indication that they will be choosing how to implement the CA Universe based on feedback from the community, so it may be possible that no real timetable for sprints and commits is possible until a particular mode has been chosen.  They correctly identify that community engagement is a key to both creating and maintaining the map, and their solution for the first is to compensate engagement, though they have not included those terms.  As to the second issue, they seem to be relying on the effectiveness of the map to be the source of its own engagement, simply the best place to put new knowledge so that it gets seen, which creates the follow-on problem of everyone treating it like a billboard and overwhelming it.  Only clear protocols will save it at that point, so hopefully they are up to the task of lining that out early.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is a clear and simple path laid out for this project, starting with community outreach and collection of info and ending when the map is delivered.  In between are milestones for onboarding users/maintainers and collecting user reviews.  From this process they intend to deliver on a handful of KPIs, one of which is actually not a target they should be aiming for.  The KPIs for number of CAs engaged and updating it, and the positive ratings earned from users are good and will be useful information, but the total number of resources mapped is a two-edged sword:  if the map starts to sprawl, it will fall into disuse because it will be too hard to keep it all within a frame of reference.  It is very important that the team both establish a standard for comprehensiveness, but also standards for inclusion and non-inclusion.  Perhaps a good approach is layers or filters that allow a user to sort the map by classification of the information they seek, for example by \"Beginner: onboarding\" or \"recently submitted\" or \"most referenced\".  The number of quality layers designed is both a source of scalability and a possible metric to track progress.

Unfortunately, it is not at all clear how the proposers would achieve this apart from presenting a \"birds eye view\", and the solution does not state whether AI will be used,  if this is open source, improves visualization or simplifies or standardizes anything  - I am completely left in the dark how my experience as a user is going to improve. No attachments or media are provided to give even a glimpse of a prototype or describe the direction of improvement aimed for.
