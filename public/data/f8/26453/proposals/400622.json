The proposer indicates that the key will be engaging material that is fun and exciting.  I don't disagree, but would suggest that just as important is having a philosophy about the approach that incentivizes these new Catalyst CAs to work on doing really great work, perhaps by creating a Fractal Fuzion cohort that reports back their results from the work to reward cNFT prizes or something like that for highest scores or whatever (among that cohort, not in competition with veteran CAs).  Marketing is not my thing, but this proposer seems ideally suited to this kind of outreach.  Something like this makes the community engagement more sticky, as they wait for vCA results, maybe an event aroud their first \"payday\" when the rewards are paid out, that kind of thing.  My point here is that a well implemented marketing blitz such as the proposer is suggesting has a lot of potential, not just for bringing on board more CAs, but for bringing them and their efforts into alignment with Catalyst values and principles, like Radical Inclusion, deep engagement and connection.  As an active CA, this proposer has the ability to bring the right perspective.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Looking through this proposer's material I think he has the one thing this proposal really needs:  enthusiasm, and not just for spreading the word about Catalyst, but about the value of the CA work and of the community that arises from interesting people doing interesting and innovative things.  At root, CAs are helpers:  they help proposers, they help voters, and their activity in Catalyst channels means they are often helping anyone who just wants to know a little bit more about the Cardano ecosystem and Catalyst in particular.  The roadmap describes the landscape well enough, but is a bit sparse on details, especially surrounding the development of the marketing campaign itself.  What is clear is that the proposer has done this before in other areas, and is relying on a (very active) community network they have already established to get them the live feedback and material they will need to bring it home.  The delivery of a retrospective is a nice add and could lend itself to possibly scaling the outreach.  As an aside, the original researchers for the Catalyst protocol, in the paper they released on it, described 6 main areas of funding for a treasury like Catalyst. Number one, and by a large margin, was \"Marketing\"...but that hasn't been the way Cardano and Catalyst have traditionally moved (development, education have been the two biggies for Catalyst).  As the Voltaire era is picking up, that is just something to think about while you are looking at this proposal with its emminently reasonable budget...", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Initial acquisition of material needs to be carefully managed, as the reporting protocol may end up blocking this project.  The issue is the initial funding release and how quickly they get to the point of paying artists and contributors, as without specific things to measure, or specific progress to report, they may run into difficulty reporting for that month.  My advice is to use the inital month to get as much material with that budget as possible, and to lock in the partnerships and whatever participation is necessary at that point for cNFTs and drops and faucet development.  The ability to report those partnerships and expected deliverables from them (or whatever equivalent the proposer has in mind) should release that 2nd tranche that will likely pay for the actual development and probably most of the art.  Once they have that, the auditing should be on autopilot,  and the included engagement metrics should suffice.  To bring it home it would be nice if there were some way of grabbing performance metrics from the new CA cohort from this camapign.  Not exactly sure how to do this, but if it can't be figured out with cNFTs, I'll eat my hat.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 9, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 455, "q0": "The proposal will encourage more people to become CAs. Although this is not something specifically identified in the challenge setting (the focus of this challenge is not finding new CAs, but improving the CA process) I agree it is definitely needed if the CA process is to be sustainable; so to that extent, the proposal addresses the challenge. However, the proposal *says* that it addresses the challenge by \"develop[ing] tools for the Cardano community advisors program\" - but I cannot see any reference in the proposal to any tool for CAs being created; the proposal is simply a marketing plan. It also says it addresses the challenge by \"delivering massive improvements to community advisors understanding of how the program operates\" - but I cannot see how this proposal would achieve that. The main target audience is clearly identified as people who are not yet even aware that the CA process exists -  it is very unlikely that material targeted at them will deliver any new information to people who are already practising CAs. So while I agree that the proposal does address the challenge to some extent, it doesn't do so in the ways that it says it will, and it does seem to be exaggerating a little how relevant it is to the challenge setting. Overall, I can't fully agree or disagee that it addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Yes, the proposal does seem feasible. The timeplan is clear and realistic, and I like how it is linked to the onset of fund 9. The budget is clear, and appropriately broken down. I feel that the work is a little underpaid, but this could be a localisation issue - the proposer does not mention where they are based, but what looks like low wages might be normal in their country. The proposer evidently has the skills and contacts to be able to carry out the work (a quick Google let me find and verify the proposer and their projects on Twitter and Insta) - although it would have been nice to see these links included in the proposal itself, not least because including them would have demonstrated good marketing! My only real issue on feasibility is the poor risk assessment. The proposer has only identified one risk (i.e. the risk that content will be boring and not fun). I can see several other really obvious risks (e.g. what if the content doesn't actually lead to anyone deciding to sign up to be a CA for whatever reason - it hasn't reached the right audience, it didn't give a strong enough call to action, etc? What if the CAs it onboards don't really understand the CA process, because the fun content didn't explain it well and didn't signpost them into the CA community or towards CA learning resources, so they don't do good reviews, don't get paid, and end up disappointed?) I think the proposer could probably think through and address risk a bit better; but apart from that, the proposal is feasible.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The audit metrics are clearly defined and readily measurable, and there's a nice focus on audit transparency. The only thing missing, is that the suggested metrics do not address the actual purpose of the project - to onboard new CAs.

You will need a roadmap with dates and clear milestones, these milestones should be filled with concrete numbers. The project is well structured in phases, put a value on these phases. How much money do you need to accomplish phase1, and then what will constitute a completed phase one? Maybe 3 videos, 5 banners, 1 logo etc. and where are they going to be presented.

Phase 1 will last one month and set-up the campaign infrastructure (design materials, banners etc.). Phase 2 will strive to on-board community advisors, but it is not very clear for what purposes.

Phase 3 is also rather unclear for me, which will definitely include documentation of the entire campaign, but also - and this is the unclear part - launching of a CNFT distributed as a record of the campaign. \n\nThe overall budget is charged at a rate of 25 USD/hour, with 160 hours in phase 1, 80 hours in phase 2 and 40 hours in phase 3.
