It correctly identifies that one of the biggest and most demanding elements of (V)CAs' work is the ongoing process of discussion and revision of the process itself, and that there is an issue with having so many locations where discussions take place. A tool that helps organise and document these discussions, while also keeping them decentralised and inclusive/participatory, would significantly improve both (V)CAs' work and (V)CA resources.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "On the positive side, the prototype of the Consenz tool is already in use and working well, so it seems likely it could be implemented for this use; also, the proposal demonstrates a good understanding of how the Catalyst community works, which is crucial for making something like this feasible. In particular, the risk assessment accurately identifies one of the key potential problems in getting new tools adopted in Catalyst, i.e. what could be called \"platform fatigue\" and potential low participation. The idea of mitigating this with co-design sessions is basically sound; but the problem is that this co-design process is quite undercosted, which suggests to me, as a community engagement worker myself, that the work involved in doing this effectively has been underestimated or not fully understood. Promoting the co-design sessions across the community so as to engage more than the \"usual voices\", skilled facilitation of the sessions, documenting the sessions and making sure that comments and ideas are accurately and transparently recorded, and giving some kind of feedback after the sessions with information about the outcomes/results or explaining how you have responded to the issues raised so that people know they were heard, should cost considerably more than $160 per session. In other words, the time and work needed for an effective co-design session is considerably more then just the 2 hours of the session itself; and the fact that this is not planned for, described, or budgeted for is a concern. The rest of the budget seems ok (only 3 webinars to onboard such a big community as CAs is maybe a little ambitious, but this is probably mitigated by having an ongoing \"tech support\" call centre to give support outside of the webinars) but the co-design sessions feel so crucial to the feasibility of the proposal that, since they don't feel solid, I can't feel sure the proposal would be implemented in a meaningful way. I feel there's a danger that levels of community engagement and co-design would be cursory and un-inclusive, and that this would mean that the solution wouldn't be widely understood or adopted by CAs. Whilst this would not prevent the proposal being \"implemented\" in the sense that Consenz could be offered as a tool for CAs to use, the core of what would make this proposal work seems to be the question of co-design to promote actual engagement. Since this co-design process is fundamentally under-resourced, then I feel that feasibility is questionable.  I'd also like to see some information on what kind of \"reset\" or adjustments would be done if the mid-term (3 month) milestones are not reached, for example if uptake or user satisfaction is low after 3 months.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Audit metrics are clear and appropriate, and it's good that they include targets, and that they address not only the uptake (i.e. numbers registered to use Consenz) but also satisfaction levels, and actual usage (numbers of documents created).

While some improvement projects (these are projects meant to bring positive change to the \"plumbing\" of Catalyst QA process) for CAs end up deep in the weeds of analysis and introspection, many, many more than that develop quickly on documents, or arise from teamwork that has a need to \"get it on paper\"....where the efforts often fizzle out.  Among the things the process is missing is a method to achieve consensus around proposed changes and solutions, and often this consensus is all that stands between a proposed solution and the \"finalization\" required to push it out to those who would execute it.  This tool, which is a funded development of Fund7, seeks to combine some of the more insightful paradigms for achieving productive consensus (liquid democracy, etc) with a document editing and finalizing protocol to move projects to completion via mini consensus around elements of the documents.  Add in the ability to further refine the tool to capture communication channels like telegram and discord, and two of the critical roadblocks to CA improvement work will be solved.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The tool is already well under way in development, and the team has smartly forked a development branch of it to fully embrace input from the CA/vCA community.  Within a 3 month or so window they expect to roll out an MVP version of the tool for the CAs, where they can receive feedback on the UI/UX and ways to align it perfectly with the work that CAs are trying to do.  It is likely that the more input they get, the better and faster the tool will iterate.  Their budget is a steal in the sub-$10k range, and it is distributed well across management and onboarding, with a healthy 50%+ for the development side.  Because the tool itself is being funded from previous proposals, this budget represents just the CA specific build out and use case.  The teams experience across Catalyst, and especially as CAs themselves means they already have critical insight into what is a requirement, as well as the minimum MVP needed to work for CAs.  After that, the rest should just be frosting.  In fact, looking at their targeted \"satisfaction\" rate of 70%...that looks like rookie numbers.  100%.

A good amount of time is dedicated to the final stage, which is onboarding, and I expect that much of that is actually going to be taken out of their hands by engaged CAs who want to onboard collaborators to their initiatives, so there is a high likelihood that this project screams through its phases to completion.  The audit points in that scenario are less relevant, but there are plenty of milestones to report when the progress reports come due, with the main ones being CA engagement early, and onboarded CAs to the tool late.  And as far as the community keeping track of the proposal...?  Yeah, there will be a lot of beady little CA eyes tracking this one through the Catalyst jungle.
