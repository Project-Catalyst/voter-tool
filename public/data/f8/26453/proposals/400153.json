Their timeline is clear and thought-through, and takes account of possible issues with updating to Vue.js 3 this fund. The proposal budget is modest, but it takes a \"full cost-recovery\" approach and includes all the more hidden/background costs of admin, reporting, meetings etc, demonstrating the team's experience in delivering. The approach of including development costs for AIM itself demonstrates an understanding of the need to make the work more sustainable, which increases its feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Very auditable; the proposal uses simple and clear metrics tracked on GitHub and therefore very transparent and open.

There are proposals for reputation, proposals for improving integrity, but have they thought about the last mile of delivering some of the solutions?  If vCA participation has requirements, for inputting fields or adding grades, where does the actual activity end up?  Of course, not everyone uses the vCA tool, but a case could be made that the only excuse not to is to game the system by working directly in the .csv where everything is a cramped mess of a hundred clicks to get anything done (except random grading, of course...that is easiest in the .csv, where the only limit is the speed of your clicking finger, and almost impossibe in the vCA tool).  Without any changes at all the vCA tool is the best way for a vCA to approach the grading in a thoughtful, qualitative way, and as the vCA process benefits from automation and future improvements to the quality of the assessments and the quality of the vCAs, it is going to be that irreplaceable qualitative aspect of the grading that will take precedence, and this is the tool to serve that future.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The AIM team is accessible, and they have provided a clear proposal with a budget and timeline that looks adequate to deliver 2 funds worth of iterative improvements.

For instance, in Fund8 it was added the ability to use negative filters, not only positive ones.

This tool has been incredibly helpful for vCAs to do their work in an effective manner. Adding the negative search features will allow for more in-depth analysis by vCAs because it allows for a more narrowed search of proposals. When there are thousands and thousands of CA reviews, it can be overwhelming for vCAs to navigate these proposals in an effective manner. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to have tools that make the lives of vCAs easier since, after all, this is a volunteer position, and the vCAs are giving up some of their time to contribute towards improving the cardano ecosystem.

The proposing team themselves are all very active members of the cardano catalyst community and have contributed much to the vCA tool already. They have the necessary skills to make this proposal happen, such as the technical background, experience with vCA pain points, and experience with different cardano groups like Swarm. Thus, I believe that the proposers will work tirelessly to make the necessary improvements to the vCA tool and be able to do so. With regards to the timeline, the proposers have listed out a crystal clear roadmap that includes weeks and tasks to be completed. It is very easy for me to see what tasks they intend to complete and by when. I also appreciate that the proposers acknowledged that some tasks (like the update to Vue.js 3) may not be completed on time and could be postponed to the next fund. Being able to acknowledge when things might not be completed fully on time is not only incredibly honest, but it gives me confidence that the proposers are not overpromising to the community \u2013 they are being realistic with their expectations for themselves. With regards to the budget, the proposers have laid out a breakdown of the requested funds that is very easy to follow. They have thought of all the costs, such as development, management, administration, and testing/QA.

Additionally, the major metric of success will, of course, be the delivery of two major updates to the vCA tool in funds 9 and 10. The entire cardano community will be able to see the vCA tool in action, which will allow for great auditability. If I had to give any feedback, I would recommend that the proposers also consider including the proportion of vCAs who use this tool as a KPI. If this data is gathered in the survey when vCAs turn in their work (a simple yes/no question), it could be a good metric to see if more and more vCAs are using the tool fund over fund, which would be an indicator of success.

I don't need any credentials besides being a CA/vCA to state my complete agreement that this proposal indeed falls within this Challenge. The vCA tool has helped making a big-volume activity much easier to tackle. And the provision of filters allows a vCA to approach his/her assessment in so many different ways. It allows a vCA to adjust as the work is on-going, react to requests from Catalyst to focus on certain aspects, and personally, permits me to assess CAs in a more objective manner, which eventually is a good thing in activities where subjectivity can quite easily creep in, even unintentionally.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The bona fides of the team has been proven time and again, although for voters who aren't as familiar, the proposal provides names and experiences of all involved.
