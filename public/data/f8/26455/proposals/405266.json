As a result of the pandemic, the vast majority of governments worldwide, but especially governments of developing and emerging economies, were able to demonstrate all the shortcomings of their health systems. If we want Cardano \"Making The World Work Better For All\" this is a perfect example of how to do it. When evaluating this challenge with the strategic goals for the next fund I see an alignment with the pre-population of people to make contributions to the system, it would be interesting that for next funds the teams will modify the wording to include more than one strategic goal in the challenge setting. My score is 5. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "After analyzing the challenge setting and according to my experience in the last 4 funds I have seen several proposals associated with health in past funds, some associated with heatlh records, mental health, wellbeing and supply chain in the healthcare market. I also recall a DAO with a focus on health records that was indeed selected for funding, all of these are data that justify the allocation of funds to a challenge of these characteristics. However, I should also add that I see potential overlap with other challenges, for example all the examples of data for Decentralized Identity could also be in that challenge. The consequence of this would be a possible dispersion of community efforts and thus inefficient allocation of funds. So based on my analysis above, I have decided to assign a score of 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The description of the success criteria seems to me to be appropriate and fulfills its purpose of giving direction to potential proposers who wish to submit proposals in upcoming funds. However, when analyzing the success metrics suggested, although I consider them to be well defined and relatively easy to measure, from my experience they have a focus on the evaluation of the performance of the challenge itself, instead of presenting metrics that serve as a model or guide for both proposers and the community in general to know if there is progress in addressing this challenge, which is why my score is 4.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 0, "ng": 9, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4678, "q0": "This is a great proposition. The Big pharma do dictate terms especially in pricing sector. This is justifiable to some extent there should be an alternative in the direction of decentralization of such essential power. The Martin Shkreli fiasco can be taken as a great example to demonstrate the need for this type of initiative.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The community may for now act as a source or database of information on medicines and their different alternatives at different prices or various philanthropy projects which may help the needy in different parts of the world. Decentralization of manufacturing may be achieved even with patent violations in desperate times, e.g., Indian pharmacies violated US patents when it was essential to save the lives of its citizens, now emerged as a pharma/raw material to the world. Thus a platform may serve to be of great help. The future may see collaborations with labs to fund, develop and own right to medications and provide them at lower prices. The funds required may be large, the increased size of Cardano community and network may hopefully address the issue in the future.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Number of proposals would be the appropriate measure of the success in all three categories. However the blockchain is only popular among youth and IT professionals. There may be need to market the platform and reach the upcoming/aspiring professionals of the pharma community before we see asses the success of the challenge.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1748", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5700, "q0": "Cardano could be benefited from the proposal, but it will be too high of a level to have effective use and create value.
