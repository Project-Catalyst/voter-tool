I must admit that the team managed to make a very good argument that one could not disagree with. Does it align with Cardano's mission? Yes, if we look at it with a long-term perspective. I must say, however, that when comparing this with the strategic goals of the next fund, it is hard to find a direct alignment between the two. My score is 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "According to a review of the proposals submitted in the previous fund, there is no evidence that proposals will be submitted that address this issue. However, considering the capabilities needed to address it I would agree. However, I have two concerns. Firstly the amount of budget requested, for a type of challenge like this, where it is necessary to test the community's ability to address this challenge I would recommend to the team to reduce the budget requested, this way we give ourselves the opportunity to experiment, but at the same time control the level of risk of consuming treasury funds inefficiently. And second is the presence of a challenge with very similar characteristics, in case both are selected we could expose ourselves to the risk of dispersion of the community's capacity to address both challenges. My score is 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In this aspect I found a definition of the success criteria quite accurate, concrete and easy to interpret. Nevertheless, when analyzing the metrics, I find that most of them focus on measuring the performance of the challenge itself, instead of presenting metrics that serve as a guide or model for potential proposers. On this point, I recommend that you separate the metrics focused on the challenge (because I believe there is a great deal of value there too) and on the other hand the metrics focused on the proposals so as to better measure the progress made in approaching the challenge.

There are numerous boundaries and obstacles in knowledge sharing by conventional media. The available media are either not structured or not affordable or not commercially viable. Another aspect of this challenge would be the ill-placed(not exactly, but can be avoided) education material in challenge settings like, Grow (Region)-Grow Cardano, Film and Media. The content may be educative to all audiences instead it is placed alongside the media which is aimed at helping investors and on-boarding videos, and the film videos which are mainly comprised of documentaries.
