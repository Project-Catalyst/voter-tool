We cannot expect people to read more than a thousand proposals to make decisions, as it is not a realistic expectation and the delegation of votes through dReps is a possible solution to increase the participation of votes in Catalyst, the risks of centralization that can arise were mentioned as well and the proposals that are eventually created in this challenge would have to take into account the downsides observed in the challenge brief to propose solutions, which is something positive.\n\nThe issue of voting delegation has been dealt with through CIP-15 and CIP-36 and can be checked at this link: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/200\n\nI believe that this challenge is important to increase decentralization in community decision-making and this comes as an improvement for Voltaire, but also that it is not something crucial at the moment, as it is public knowledge that vote delegation is an objective for more a year, but so far IOG has not decided to prioritize the issue.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I'm not sure the community has the capacity to address this challenge, as until now this has been an issue addressed by few people in Cardano's groups.\n\nThe issue of voting delegation has been dealt with through CIP-15 and CIP-36 and can be checked at this link: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/200\n\nApparently the issue of vote delegation is still under discussion as it can be seen in the repositories above and because of this and depending on IOG it is not clear that the community can speed up the process.\n\nPerhaps this situation will evolve from here to Fund 9, but there is no clarity.
