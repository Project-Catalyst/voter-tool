In addition, the author provides 12 examples of potential proposal types to incentivize proposers all along with relevant KPIs for each category (number of attendees, number of projects, number of views, etc). In my view, the suggested metrics are sufficient to track some progress, especially on the proposal level. At the same time, they are insufficient to track the impact of the challenge on the Cardano ecosystem. For example, after reviewing this challenge proposal, I cannot answer the following question: How the return on intention can be estimated for the challenge itself? This is needed to be able to compare the effectiveness of funds use in comparison with other challenges and adjust the future budgets.

The challenge team is not set at the point of the assessment stage so it would be an on constructive assessment to suggest that no support structures would be in place for this challenge and that is would be a risk.

To achieve this goal, Cardano must allocate specific resources to individuals and organizations that are passionate about engaging people outside the ecosystem both in the short and long run. I believe that the exponential reach will be much greater if resources are allocated to teams focused on solving this problem using a variety of approaches, since anyone who speaks to them does so in their own language and on their own cultural terms. This challenge category aims at bringing together a series of previous challenges, each seeking a specific objective, but which unfortunately often overlapped. One aspect that I think is very important in the proposal is the advice to the proponents that they should think of how they can contribute to the ecosystem not just with the solution but also by embracing diversity and inclusion.
