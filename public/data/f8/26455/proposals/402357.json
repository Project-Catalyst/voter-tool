So the relationship between the objective of this challenge and Cardano's mission is clear. The challenge team intends to maintain this challenge that we have had in the last funds to continue to offer this space to all the teams that are passionate about this topic, so I agree and I assign a score of 5. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "When analyzing the results of this challenge in the last funds we found that: In the previous fund there were two challenges associated with decentralized identity 1) \"Accelerate Decentralized Identity\" with 56 competing proposals, of which 37 were approved and only 20 were selected for funding allocation. Additionally, 10875 votes were cast, positioning this challenge on average versus the rest of the challenges. When analyzing Fund 8, we have two associated challenges \"Self-Sovereign Identity\" with 28 proposals and \"Accelerate Decentralized Identity\" with 40, which reflects an increase of 20% (approx) vs. the rest of the challenges. On the other hand, analyzing the universe of challenges competing to be selected I was able to identify four with many similarities. I believe that the community should address this type of situation as there is another risk here and that is the overlapping and therefore a dispersion of the community's capabilities. I recommend this and the rest of the challenge teams to work together to find synergies and present a single challenge that is much more comprehensive, than the budget of course and that allows all these proposals to coexist in the same space, since here synergies and union of ideas may happen and when contrasted become much more robust proposals with greater value for the community. This is why my score is 4.  ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The challenge tram poses an appropriate success criterion, however, I believe that there are opportunities for improvement in the definition of the success metrics. I say this because mainly here they were approached only with the focus of measuring the performance of the challenge itself, instead of being metrics that potential proposers can take as references when defining their own metrics in each proposal. Additionally, I consider it pertinent to invite the team to try to present metrics that can be quantified with relative ease, this reduces uncertainty with the proponents and also facilitates the community at the time of performing some kind of post allocation audit. Based on this, I give it a score of 3.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 1, "ng": 9, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6174, "q0": "This challenge does a good job distinguishing the nuanced differences between the decentralized identity challenge and itself while explaining the requirement for this challenge. It could have a stronger emphasis on open source to align with all of the Fund 9 strategic goals however overall this challenge aligns with Cardano's mission.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The challenge only has 28 proposals for the $400K budget in Fund 8, which is on the low side for that budget. The budget has not been increased this round though. Normally, I would give this four stars however it is borderline 5 stars and as per the CA assessment guide \"Bonus if there's an established challenge team.\" The challenge includes an established challenge team which is highlighted in the proposal therefore I will round up in this case.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Success is identified mainly as participating and partnering with other stakeholders which doesn't necessarily imply leadership as stated in the challenge question although \"receiving high quality projects\" could potentially relate to leadership. Overall the metrics and success criteria seem to reflect more of an also-ran feel than the bold challenge question.

It also does not constitute a particularly strong acceleration of the developer ecosystem more than any other challenge would. Of course, identity may become an integral part of digital life, but at this stage, the main value comes from its ability to connect the dApp world. \n\nIn regards to the guiding questions, this is not a challenge that will make voters overly enthusiastic even though identity may be one of the most essential pillars of greater Cardano adoption in the real world. One of the key advantages of Cardano based identity is its unique selling point of being open sourced, constantly self-improving but also tied to products and services that can be accessed by users of our identity systems. \n\nBalancing the weakness of alignment with fund9 goals and the challenge guiding questions, my judgement as a CA/vCA from the past two funds is that this challenge is an essential piece of the overall infrastructure and hence warrants 5 stars. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Looking at the current two challenges relating to decentralised identifiers and SSI, we see that a total of $900k has been allocated to this end. The budget request/budget available ratio was in the middle third for one of them, and bottom third for the other, suggesting that a total budget of $500k, as set in this challenge, is appropriate. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The challenge sets out 3 metrics. They are measurable to some extent but have some weaknesses. The first one asks for the number of proposals that \u201caddress SSI in a quantifiable manner\u201d, which may be difficult to use because there is a wide range of things that can be quantified \u2013 the question is how well is it quantified and exactly what metric should be used. In this case the challenge team is, in my view, the ones who should be doing this legwork and suggest what these metrics are. Community and interest can be gauged in various ways, such as social media following, but it should also be spelled out so that we have a way of measuring this. For example, \u201cnumber of users of SSI solutions funded by this challenge\u201d or \u201cnumber of social media followers of projects funded by this challenge\u201d. Another good objective measure would be \u201cnumber of github repos using tools from this challenge\u201d.
