Is the lack of focus hindering Cardano Growth?", "f6_no_assessments": 7, "f6_rating": 4.095238095238096, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 15, "q0": "The author of this challenge envisions it as a consolidation of all growth- and community-outreach-focused challenges. Naturally, marketing and community-outreach activities are necessary to grow the Cardano ecosystem, and, thus, are perfectly aligned with the Fund9 Challenge Setting objectives. The author asks for $4M budget for this challenge and cites IOG's paper \"A Treasury System for Cryptocurrencies: Enabling Better Collaborative Intelligence\". Overall, the arguments that marketing activities are important for the growth of Cardano's ecosystem are persuasive. The only thing that seemed confusing is that the author was saying that \"Catalyst has several diverse challenges to develop Cardano but lacks a Marketing Challenge\". However, both Fund 6 and Fund 7 do have Marketing challenges in the form of \"Grow Region X, Grow Cardano\" challenges, which cumulatively received a substantial amount of funding. Another opportunity for improvement is that the proposal could have more clearly differentiated between activities focused on promoting the Cardano ecosystem overall and promoting specific projects (solution to certain use cases) on the other hand. In my humble opinion, as a person who've spent more than a decade building and promoting digital products, promoting specific digital products is better to budget on the project level. That's because project promotion is often much more relevant and efficient if done by the project team itself. So, focusing this challenge on promoting the Cardano ecosystem overall would bring a higher return on intention, in my opinion.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Catalyst has had many growth and community-outreach challenges in the past funds. So, there is no doubt that the community has all the necessary skills and is well positioned to address the challenge. My only point of concern is that this proposal is by a single author and no further discussion of the challenge team is provided. Since the budget for this challenge is $4M - it can be one of the biggest challenges in the fund, thus attracting many proposers. In such case, not having a strong challenge team to support them can be detriment to realize the full potential of the challenge.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The author mentiones a number of KPIs, and, in my opinon, the growth of ADA wallets and ADA market price are especially relevant for a challenge focused on growing the ecosystem overall.\nMoreover, the author provides additional KPIs, such as press mentions, and \"Staked ADA\" helping potential projects better imaging more relevant KPIs.\nIt would be great, however, if the proposal spent some time discussing one of the biggest problems of measuring the impact of any marketing project - the problem of the incremental impact.\nThe problem of measuring the incremental impact concerns itself with proving that the observed growth in let's say \"number of ADA wallets\" was driven primarly by marketing activities in this challenge, and not due to the natural growth or investments in product development. In my opinion, without a discussion of this topic, the impact of this challenge can only be partially verified.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1011", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 5, "ng": 11, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1186, "q0": "Prior to coming across this proposal, I had already read the paper upon which this proposal was based. A hypothesis is presented in which it is argued that in order to ensure that Treasury funds are allocated efficiently and reduce the risk of not allocating funds in vital areas, it proposes creating categories and allocating a certain amount of funds to each. And yes, one of those categories recommended in Marketing. Having said that, I respectfully disagree with the assertion that Catalyst does not address the matter of Marketing. There have been challenges in Catalyst that have had the marketing component as the central objective. For example, Proposer Outreach, Catalyst Value Onboarding, regional initiatives, such as Grow Africa, Grow Cardano and all its variations around the world, Community Events, among others. Personally, I believe that all of these initiatives have an associated Marketing component, and it is necessary to add that while this paper represents a valuable contribution to the community and should be taken into account, I do not believe that everything mentioned in it should be taken literally. Upon reviewing the challenge setting, it is evident that there has been a great effort in presenting the justification for the need for this challenge. However, important aspects, such as the possible directions that may be expected from potential proposers, were not addressed. Finally, in comparing this challenge to the strategic goals we have for the next challenge, I will say that there is only an indirect alignment with the first goal that refers to preparing people to make contributions to the organization. My score in terms of alignment with Cardano's mission is 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "According to the analysis provided in the previous section, I believe that Catalyst has been responding implicitly to the need for \"Marketing\" since day one. We have at the moment several challenges that are competing amongst themselves to be selected from our universe of competing challenges and are interested in building community, holding events for new members, attracting new members, and attracting talent from outside the blockchain sector. Personally, I believe all of them have some marketing elements. So in terms of the capability of the community of addressing the challenge I totally agree. Here I would like to express my concern about the amount of overlap existing between this challenge and many of the other ones that are competing to be selected. If this occurs, it may result in a significant dispersion of community responsiveness, resulting in an inefficient allocation of resources from Catalyst Treasury. So from a feasibility standpoint, I cannot say whether I agree or disagree.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I would like to congratulate the team on the good job they did in terms of\u00a0Verifiability; most of the metrics are relevant to the objective of this challenge and are good guidelines to be taken into account by the proposers as they prepare their proposals for submission. In order to make a recommendation, I suggest that future challenges be divided into those that seek to measure the performance of the challenge itself, and those that seek to serve as a reference for proposal writers.

The challenge set as KPIs the number of wallets, Total Value Locked (TVL), and other metrics. These metrics make complete sense, especially the Total Value Locked as it is often used by cryptocurrency investors to judge the activity of blockchains, and the growth in TVL was one of the reasons for the recent rebound in ADA price. Thus, this challenge that consolidates the budget to focus it on the initiatives that drive direct impact for the Cardano ecosystem is perfectly aligned with Fund9 Challenge Setting objectives.

", "q0r": 4, "q1": "At the time of this assessment the total budget for Fund 9 is unknown but supposedly approximately the same as Fund 8 which was $12.8 million for challenges (the $16 million quoted in the challenge includes overhead costs like (v)CA and voter rewards).

DApps started shipping a few months ago, so I see marketing as important but not a priority in the Cardano mission right now.\n\nThe Community Development part of the challenge was not properly described, which creates an imbalance in the challenge.

If we don't start to do this then we may see cardano lose out on adoption and market share.
