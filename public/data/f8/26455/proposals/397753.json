This may improve the cost-efficiency of the treasury as it means proposers can first get smaller grants before they graduate and apply for larger grants, upon showing some tangible results. The alignment score is set based on two sets of metrics that define whether a given challenge is critical to achieving Cardano\u2019s mission: the fund9 strategic goals and the guiding questions for challenge setting.\nStrategic goals. This challenge is likely to lower the barrier to entry to Catalyst and hence I rate this relatively highly. As a CA from the past 2 funds, I have seen the need for projects to first develop the idea more before applying rather than asking for large sums up front and then failing to deliver or not getting funded at all, pushing the proposers away from the ecosystem. The second strategic goal regarding open sourcing Cardano is indirectly addressed as the findings of the research funded by Catalyst in this challenge would presumably be published for the community to see. Lastly, it would not directly accelerate the growth of the developer and app ecosystem, but may increase the quality of projects funded by Catalyst over time (though this is not a strategic focus for fund 9).\nGuiding questions. With a feasibility research challenge, more people may feel that they are welcome to apply for grants for research they want to do, before gather a team and submitting full proposals. Hence voter engagement could potentially be high here. It is unlikely that this will constitute a springboard for wider Cardano adoption, though academic onboarding may be something that could come out of this. \nOverall, this challenge does not address some of the key goals and priorities of the Cardano ecosystem at this stage but it has a lot of value in terms of increasing efficiency.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The community have the skills to address this challenge. The Cardano community has shown before that they have a strong appeal to academically inclined blockchain enthusiasts. There are also many examples of proposals that seek funding for further research, to then later resubmit in later funds. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The challenge mentions three KPIs. They ask for demonstratable results. However, this is not very well-defined and something like \u201cnumber of whitepapers written by projects funded in the challenge\u201d would be an improvement. The use of terms such as \u201csolid projects\u201d or \u201cinnovative results\u201d in the key metrics lacks precision and is therefore difficult to measure progress against. Instead, I suggest that metrics such as \u201cprojects submitting project proposals in later funds getting funded\u201d and \u201cCA score of projects funded through this challenge in later funds\u201d.

After reading the whole proposal, I\u2019m confused about what future proposals the writer is discussing because the Catalyst project is created for the community to self-determine the growth of on-chain governance to the Cardano by attracting \u2013 evaluating \u2013 voting - funding potential proposals every six weeks. The feasibility of a proposal is one of the three major criteria (together with impact & auditability) that decides the quality of each proposal. Therefore, why do we need a separate challenge to fund research about the feasibility of proposals? \nI think it\u2019s unnecessary to open this challenge because Catalyst community is doing very well to measure the feasibility of the proposals. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The Catalyst project has a very huge fund for each round and they usually have the capacity to address challenges that are essential/ necessary/ evolutionary for the growth of the community. However this proposal is not critical to better Cardano/ Catalyst\u2019s mission, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s highly likely to be implemented. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "As this proposal doesn\u2019t align with the community\u2019s mission, we might not need to discuss the verifiability of it. Nevertheless, I still want to give some advice for the proposer so that if he proposes new challenges, it could be better. Hope that they help. \n(1) Setting clear key metrics to success is a must for a new challenge setting. For me, it\u2019s also the most important part of a challenge setting because it gives directions for proposers to write their proposals and also CA/ vCA to assess the projects. Back to this proposal, in three of the metrics written, only the third one is qualified. The other two are about managing to complete the investigation and to contribute solid projects are the default responsibility of the proposers in every challenge. \n(2) \u201cWhat does success look like\u201d is also an important part. The challenge team should give suggestions for the proposers about the quantity & quality of each metric above. In another word, each key metric should be filled with estimated numbers/ results. It couldn\u2019t be general as \u201cit will be great the presentation, approval of research proposals\u201d. \n(3) Just an additional part, language manner in writing a challenge could be warm/ encouraging but also remain formal and professional.
