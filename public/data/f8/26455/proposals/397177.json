The alignment score is set based on two sets of metrics that define whether a given challenge is critical to achieving Cardano\u2019s mission: the fund9 strategic goals and the guiding questions for challenge setting.\n\nAs a well-written challenge brief with links to existing decentralised storage protocols, this will prepare groups of people to contribute to the ecosystem. It is not directly addressing the open-sourcing goal nor that of accelerating the dapp and developer ecosystem. Though decentralised storage are crucial for apps, it is unclear why additional ones will help accelerate the ecosystem. This challenge is also weak with respect to voter engagement. Even if addressed, the decentralised storage environment is a competitive one and it is unclear why dApps (outside Cardano) would choose the one that is based on Cardano over the other ones. Even if this were to be successful, it would take very long before such project could reach the market. \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "This is a relatively niche challenge that focuses in on just one of many potential use-cases of DLT. It asks for $750k for this specific project. Given the complexity of such a project, only a highly skilled team with extensive experience could likely propose here. A few teams outside of IOHK that come to mind are dcSpark or MLabs. However, given Cardano\u2019s academic appeal and its institutional adoption (in terms of very large transactions, ADA use has risen sharply since January 2022), it may be possible that highly competent teams outside the ecosystem will see this equity-free grant as an opportunity. This is of course speculative but still not outside the realm of possibility. Hence I rate this as a 4. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "They list a number of KPIs, including number of applications and volume of data stored. These serve both as KPIs of the proposals but also the challenge overall. These are all easily measurable and allow us to track the progres in the longer term. However, given the long time horizons of decentralised storage side-chains (as the most likely case), it may be wise to include shorter measures of success such as the number of companies that have received seed funding or the mount of money raised through catalyst funded proposals from this challenge. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_582", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10896, "q0": "Data storage has been an increasing problem in the current technology landscape and there is a particular \"dilemma\" of this problem when you include blockchain in this context.\n\nToday the data storage market is dominated by centralized companies. The cost and business model today favors storage on large and centralized servers, but this centralizes storage in a few companies, which can bring problems in terms of privacy and sovereignty of user data. The ethos of blockchain is decentralization, but the cost of storing data on blockchain is extremely high, so blockchain alone cannot solve this challenge, it needs integration with projects like IPFS, which promotes decentralization of storage between peers. By associating the concept of peer storage promoted by platforms such as IPFS with record of ownership on an immutable blockchain, we have a promising combination that would allow, in theory, to create a model with adequate financial incentives to stimulate the distribution of distributed from storage, this would bring the sovereignty in storing the data back to the users and could improve the privacy of that data as well.\n\nCharles Hoskinson recently commented in a video about the possibility of using different incentive mechanisms complementary to Proof of stake, where not only would there be incentives for minting of blocks, but also for data storage (proof of storage), proof of work and proof of reputation. So there is a potential path for Cardano to follow a path where actors in different areas can be rewarded through the issuance of tokens (ADA) from the projected inflation of the protocol.\n\nIn addition, the existence of a large network of SPOs ends up being a promising structure to create a network of peers dedicated to data storage. SPOs could specialize in offering storage services.\n\nAlthough the points above indicate a potential for the challenge, this challenge is not directly aligned with the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals, although some solutions that are eventually created in the decentralized storage space may have an impact on the number of dapps and developer ecosystem. , the challenge theme is complex and must involve long-term solutions (as mentioned in the challenge description). So I don't see the topic as a priority in Cardano's mission.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "A big challenge that Cardano faces in relation to the proposed challenge is that there are projects like Filecoin that were created exactly to encourage storage. How to compete with blockchain that offer direct financial incentives to storage providers?\n\nThe fact that there is no protocol-level incentive for data storage providers on Cardano would likely make short-term solutions unfeasible. There would be a need to create new projects with new financial models that would encourage distributed storage with their own tokens, or even create studies or propose solutions for the Cardano protocol's financial incentive algorithm to start rewarding storage providers, which is very unlikely to happen in the short term.\n\nThis challenge has already been proposed more than once in previous funds and I still haven't managed to be approved + funded, so it's a challenge that hasn't been tested yet, we don't know what the demand is for this theme on Catalyst and start a new challenge, with a new theme and with an amount of $750,000 brings great uncertainty about the ability of the community to create enough proposals to fill this budget in order to maintain an acceptable standard in the quality of the proposals presented.\n\nFor a challenge that has not yet been funded, I would recommend proposing a lower budget so that we can check community demand and adjust the budget accordingly in subsequent funds.\n\nThere is a great demand for projects related to NFTs at Cardano and this can help in the demand of this challenge as in many cases the NFTs stay in the IPFS, so I imagine there is a potential for some of the interest in NFTs to be directed to this challenge, however, it would be important that the challenger could show examples of projects interested in creating solutions in this niche.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The key metrics defined for this challenge are excellent, they would help to identify the performance of the challenge in different perspectives.

In addition, the challenge is very specific about how it envisions potential solutions (it specifically states it wants token-incentivized solutions), which would limit potential innovativity of solutions.
