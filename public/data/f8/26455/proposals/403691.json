To me, it's that simple. So I agree that it aligns with and is critical to Cardano's mission. Considering that should this challenge be selected for Fund 9 it would be the third cycle in a row I would have liked to see an update on the challenge setting in terms of directions to follow for proposers and major signs of impact that the proposals that have already been funded are having. In evaluating this challenge versus the strategic goals for the next fund it is clear that one of the goals has been met, so I recommend to the team that for future funds they have made efforts to improve the wording of the challenge settings in order to align with at least one more goal. My score is 5. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The challenge team is requesting a 67% increase in the allocated budget, despite the fact that last challenge we only had 18 proposals of which 7 were selected for funding, which initially seemed to be a poor response from the community and would not justify the budget increase. However, for Fund 8 we see an increase not only in the number of proposals with a total of 24 competing proposals (34%) but also a considerable increase in the amount of budget requested with a total of $849,127 which represents an increase of 300% versus the amount requested in the previous fund, of course the amounts still need to be validated by the community in the QA phase but we notice a greater interest not only in the capacity but in the interest of the community to address this challenge. Based on my analysis above, I have decided to assign a score of 4. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The challenge team does a great job articulating the success criteria, I liked the new approach given to the description in the previous background. Now, considering the characteristics of this challenge and after analyzing the set of five suggested metrics I find that most of them are very difficult to measure as it is a multifactorial and subjective topic. So I would recommend to the team that based on the lessons learned in the last two funds, these metrics could be updated as it seems to be very difficult to prove that the progress of these metrics is due precisely to the success of a proposal funded through Catalyst. Therefore, based on the justification previously stated, I give a score of 3.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 1, "ng": 11, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6539, "q0": "One of the major obstacles that delay the adoption of cryptocurrencies by more people is the existence of harmful regulation by several governments and jurisdictions. In several countries there are laws aimed at suppressing or prohibiting the use of cryptocurrencies. Recently China banned Bitcoin miners from the country and this caused a huge migration of miners to other countries. We are living in a time of regulatory crackdown, where governments are creating increasingly restrictive laws and this ends up suppressing the potential for using cryptocurrencies in general. This challenge proposes to make room for solutions that press for favorable legislation, so I see it as essential for Cardano's mission.\n\nThis challenge is also in line with the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals, more precisely item 3 (Accelerate the growth and evolution of developer & app ecosystem), as favorable regulation would allow greater access and ease of use of cryptocurrencies.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Creating favorable legislation is not an easy task, as it involves political interests that in many cases involve political and financial conflicts of interest, which can hamper the feasibility or efficiency of the proposals developed in this challenge.\n\nThis challenge doesn't bring technical relevant technical challenges, the difficulty in this case is in negotiating and educating government representatives on the importance of favorable legislation, therefore it depends directly on the expertise of the proposers in areas such as law, policy and legislation.

But since this is a recurring challenge setting where we are able to see how the community addresses this challenge I have confidence in the challenge settings. However, I believe the 300.000 in ADA we have right now is more than enough for a challenge like this.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Looking at the success and key metrics I see they haven't changed with the current challenge which are still the correct metrics to measure the progress. My only uneasiness with these metrics is how will they be measured by the community. How sure can we be a law is changed because of a proposal that is funded. Legislation is a hard topic which makes the key metrics even harder.
