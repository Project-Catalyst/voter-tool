This would also increase the ability for Cardano to not just make headway on its mission, but also position Cardano favourably as a blockchain of choice for decentralized communities requiring robust governance systems which also allows for effective collaboration. \n\n\n\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Decentralized solutions have increasingly been working toward means by which value can be increased and added through collaboration and more comprehensive offers to support communities and more effective engagement, governance and outcomes. We need only look at the Fund 8 proposals to see this.  \n\nFor this reason,  this challenge is likely to see a large number of proposals in support of the challenge, but also the mission. While it is unlikely that the 'end result' if such a thing is possible given the scope of this challenge, can be seen in 6 months, this timeline provides sufficient opportunity for proof of concept of models of collaboration and governance, as well as community ecosystems.\n\nThe challenge team is established, and appears to be both knowledgeable and passionate about this area of development, being 'an informal group of professionals collaborating together through common interests spanning emergent technology, new potentials for democracy, and new forms of decentralised organisational structure' and thus capable on managing the activity of this challenge\n\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The metrics are also outcomes in this challenge and are clearly outlined in terms of challenges within the challenge, specifically around integration and community onboarding. There are also stretch goals included which gives additional scope for verification of the ways in which proposals can be aligned with the challenge. \n\nThere isn't however, specific quantifiable metrics, and perhaps a baseline is required in order for this to be possible.

Alignment is evaluated based on two set of metrics that define whether a given challenge is critical to achieving Cardano\u2019s mission: the fund9 strategic goals and the guiding questions for challenge setting. \n\nIn terms of alignment with the former, this proposal does indeed encourage groups of people to work to improve the ecosystem. It does not directly make Cardano open sourced even though many democracy projects will embrace the ideals of open-sourcing as that fundamentally constitutes equality of access to information for all (e.g. Wikipedia and Wikileaks). Lastly, it is not partially aligned with accelerating the growth of the developer and dapp ecosystem. The challenge heavily emphasises onboarding of existing projects and tools rather than the creation of new ones and so it seems like it is not directly going to address this third aspect of strategic. \n\nIn terms of alignment with the guiding questions, this proposal does relatively well. Democracy and inclusive governance is important and voters are likely to recognise this. If successful, Cardano may become the leading protocol for DAO/community governance, which is crucial for achieving Cardano\u2019s mission of becoming the dominant layer one protocol. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The Cardano community has the capacity to address this challenge. It specifically seeks to keep costs low by stating a maximum of $37k and by explicitly saying that we should not create new products from scratch but instead seek to incorporate existing ones. \n\nThe group behind the proposal call themselves Panacea, a group of professionals seeking to use emergent technology to reinvigorate democracy. They are motivated by the observation that the current socioeconomic system is failing to deliver on its promise on delivering for the broader masses but that it has itself led to the benefitting of the few who exert power. As a challenge team, they will likely be able to facilitate high quality proposals. They showcase this by outlining very specific requirements for proposals submitted to this challenge, for example that there should be at least 2 distinct organisations in the proposal that are test participants, along with stretch goals such as having partner organisations from multiple continents. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They propose five measurable metrics. These include the number of initiatives, partners, users, transactions and diversity of nationalities/cultures of groups involved. All of which are clear and objectively measurable either directly or through some form of survey.

Blockchain has always been foretold as the current ultimate solution to achieve a better governance in humanity. This challenge idea also aligns perfectly with what Cardano trying to evolve into during upcoming Voltaire era.  I can sense proposals in these ideas benefiting general public and propelling the heart values of Cardano and its adoption. This challenge could serve as a decent protype and a harbinger into the next evolution of human democracy by utilizing the advantages of blockchain as an emerging ubiquitous technology.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The solutions we want to implement with proposals from this challenge are decently defined with mentions of applicative technologies. The standards are quite high but befitting for such noble aspirations. The proposed fund is also though well and in kind consideration to be really selective and efficient. Too bad they have not been able to mention some names to initiate the challenge team yet. However, I strongly believe this can be tackled quickly considering Catalyst itself as a seed for the aspired governance model mentioned in this proposed challenge. I believe we have a very vast and deep talent pool and multi-resources to manage the formation and start addressing the challenge.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The success projected in the brief is pure and exact. It will surely bring tons of values towards Cardano and the better reality we are trying to serve.
