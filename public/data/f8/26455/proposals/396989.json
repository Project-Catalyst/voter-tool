In order to make the challenge setting more convincing, I recommend the team to improve the wording based on data to justify the separation from other challenges we regularly have in Catalyst. A good example would be to present to the community in the challenge setting the current values of the metrics based on the first results of the past funds. I did a quick search at the time of this evaluation and we have Cardano's TVL is at $419.95m with an increase of +183% in the last month, this data as presented by https://defillama.com/. Despite the fact that this indicator is not enough to determine the current state of the DeFi ecosystem in a blockchain, it is clear what market share we could potentially gain with this indicator. My score is 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In Fund 7 we had two similar challenges, \"Boosting Cardano's DeFi\" was composed by a total of 43 proposals competing for a budget of $500,000 and finally 10 were allocated funds. While in the challenge \"Seeding Cardano's Grassroots DeFi\" there were a total of 16 proposals competing for a budget of $200,000, where finally only 7 were the winners. As a result of the performance shown in the past with the amount required for the fund 9, I am confident that the technical and financial resources available will be sufficient to meet this challenge. My score is 5.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team presents a set of 4 success metrics suggested for potential proposers, of which only two were defined correctly; \"Total Value Locked in Catalyst-funded projects\" and \"Market share of Cardano in total DeFi universe\", although in the second one the scope should be reduced to the market share gained by Catalyst-funded projects. The remaining metrics, such as \"Total number of smart contracts and dApps\" and \"Amount of ADA voted in favor of funded proposals\" focus on the actual performance of the challenge, rather than being suggestions to be taken into account by the proposers. My recommendation for future funding is to separate the metrics that focus on the challenge and the metrics that will be suggested to proposers, thus reducing the risk of confusion for both proposers and the community when conducting post-funding audits.

DeFi as the niche market with the highest volume and liquidity in blockchains. Today DeFi protocols have tens of billions of dollars (in crypto) allocated in smart contracts from different blockchains, so there is a huge demand in this niche.\n\nDeFi on Cardano has been growing gradually with the delivery of smart contracts months ago and DApps like Muesliswap, Sundaeswap and Minswap already add up to hundreds of millions of dollars in TVL. Several DApps should be delivered to the mainnet in the coming months and this is a promising time to encourage this type of application.\n\nThis challenge is within the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals defined in the Community Advisor Assessment Guide, more precisely item 3(Accelerate the growth and evolution of developer & app ecosystem).", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There are several DeFi-related projects under development on Cardano. Checking sites like CardanoCube, it's posible to see dozens of projects in development, many funded by Catalyst itself in previous funds, others by VCs, launchpads or ISPOs. This broad funding possibility is both a positive and a negative point for assessing the feasibility of this challenge. Why? \n\nNegative, as it is a fact that several DeFi-related projects such as Minswap, Ardana, Meld, Maladex, AnetaBTC have held ISPOs and this has proven to be an efficient alternative for funding these projects, which may prevent DeFi projects from submitting proposals to Catalyst. Not to mention projects like Occam, which have private investment.\n\nThe positive point is that Catalyst is an interesting additional alternative for initial projects that intend a similar route to Liqwid, where there was no token sale or ISPO, but funding very focused on Catalyst and fair launch. The absence of large allocations to private investors ends up enabling greater distribution of supply and greater distribution of governance.\n\nThis challenge setting set a relatively high budget and considering the above points (alternative funding models existing today) there is uncertainty about the ability of dedicated DeFi projects on Cardano to fulfill this budget offer, so I am deducting a point on feasibility.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Four key metrics relevant to the performance evaluation of the proposals that could eventually be funded in this challenge were defined, however I would recommend adding more metrics for a more detailede evaluation. Considering the passage described in the proposal itself \"Plutus smart contracts are less likely to be hacked than those on Ethereum. This could become our ecosystem's strongest point\" I believe it would be interesting to add metrics that could indicate the security performance of the DApps created for future proposals of this challenge. e.g. number of audits, number of bugs identified, amount of losses due to vulnerabilities in contracts, etc...", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_43", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This is a challenge dedicated to DeFi projects building on Cardano. The alignment score is set based on two sets of metrics that define whether a given challenge is critical to achieving Cardano\u2019s mission: the fund9 strategic goals and the guiding questions for challenge setting.\nIn regards to the first strategic goal of preparing groups of contributors to the ecosystem, this challenge does well. However, it does not reference any open-sourcing and so it does not directly address the second strategic goal of making Cardano an open sourced ecosystem. As DeFi is the core pillar of the 3rd generation crypto, and the existing users are drawn to those aspects of crypto, this challenge is likely to accelerate the growth of apps and hence satisfies the third goal.\nThis challenge does well in terms of alignment with challenge setting questions too. Not only is it likely to create enthusiasm amongst voters, but it could also accelerate Cardano adoption generally. However, there are already several high-quality DeFi protocols released and in the pipeline and so the value-added of further protocols is not as obvious (DEXes etc). Having DeFi is not a USP for Cardano and so this is unlikely to be in itself a way to onboard more users. \nThe question is whether this challenge is crucial to achieve Cardano\u2019s mission and despite the importance of DeFi, it is not a neglected area and an area where Cardano is missing protocols. However, there is still some opportunity here when it comes to financing innovative ideas such as NFT DeFi and migration of major protocols to Cardano. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The feasibility aspect can be rated as both the capacity of the community and the funds allocated to the challenge. A sum as large as $1.2M would imply that Catalyst community would need to have many projects with good ideas for these to match. Ideally the ratio should be at least 4:1 in terms of budget requests to funds available, in order to make the environment competitive and avoid money-grab proposals, as could more easily slip through with lower ratios (which I know as a CA/vCA from the past 2 funds). \n\nGiven that DeFi already is proliferate on Cardano, and the number of ideascale proposals in the current dApps and integrations are in the range of 10-20, I am not confident that the community will be able to raise to this challenge. Currently only 10 proposals use the DeFi tag on Ideascale. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The four metrics relate to TVL, smart contracts and market share of Cardano in the total DeFi universe as well as voter support of the funded proposals. These are all well-defined in terms of outcomes. One point of improvement would be to specifically tie these Key Metrics to projects funded by the challenge itself, just so that it is more clear to the actors involved what the ROI of the Challenge is. That allows us to evaluate the added-value of the challenge as opposed to just measuring general DeFi trends.
