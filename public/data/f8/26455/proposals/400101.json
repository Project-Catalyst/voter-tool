Therefore, I believe that if Cardano wishes to achieve its mission, we must address this field of \"real world business\". Furthermore, based on the description of the setting of this challenge and in comparison to our fund 9 strategic goals, I believe the team could have made a more thorough effort in terms of alignment. Unfortunately, the inadequate description of why this challenge is important, as well as the lack of clear guidance on the types of proposals appropriate for this challenge, can create confusion and overlap with other challenges in Catalyst. The voters should know that, although I believe it is important to focus on real business needs, these can be included in other challenges like \"Products & Integrations,\" etc. My score for this section is 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In Fund 7 we had the first time we had this challenge in Catalyst, and in Fund 8 it was the third most popular challenge with the most proposals, although we will still need to determine how the community is responding in terms of quality of proposals in QA and number of votes in the voting phase. Clearly, the community is in a position to respond effectively to this challenge, and I am confident that this level of response and interest can be maintained and even improved in the next fund, since due to the experience gained in this fund, new gaps have been identified that will be addressed by new proposers. As a result of the amount of support from the community, they are asking for a budget increase from $1,000,000 to $1,500,000. This seems reasonable to me. I have assigned a score of 5 for this section.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal's success criteria will need to be reviewed for future funding, and I believe that for this challenge to be effective and deliver the expected value to the community, it needs to be able to articulate success metrics that can be measured and traced with relative ease. There is no doubt that the types of metrics for a particular solution can vary greatly based on the type of industry and the stage at which it is in, however, I believe that a minimum outline of model metrics should have been presented not only for future proposers, but also for the community to take into consideration when performing audits.

It is a follow-up on the business solutions challenge from fund8 and though the present challenge is brief, the previous challenge. I evaluate alignment based on three metrics: fund9 strategic goals, challenge setting guiding questions and the underlying ethos of the protocol.\n\nThe key goal of onboarding contributors is satisfied as it naturally lends itself to companies interested in distributed ledger technology adoption. It is, however, not very much aligned with the open-sourcing insofar as the default in many existing businesses (that I believe this challenge is aimed at) would not be open sourcing their code. It may be a springboard for mass-adoption as existing businesses with their customers is likely the easiest way to gain large user-bases.

The current fund8 version of the same proposal contains the following metrics and so it might perhaps be possible to use these once more.\n- # of Cardano dApps supporting business solutions\n- # of existing companies proposing Cardano-based solutions\n- # of partnerships / joint ventures created between companies\n- $ additional funding from other sources for the funded proposals\n- $ projected cost savings\n- $ projected revenue increase\n- % growth in mainnet / testnet activity due to business solutions\n It is difficult to say what to do in this situation meaning that I will rate this as a 3. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_582", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Developing business solution to real life business is certainly critical for Cardano to achieve its mission and become more and more globally present.
