The challenge indirectly brings into question Cardano's notoriety, and directly aims to increase the amount of users and people aware of Cardano, through the use of social media. It is no secret that many businesses and individuals can use social media to promote themselves in a positive manner; and when successful it brings a flood of individuals curious about the new popular business/item/product.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Very little to, no information is given on the methods that will be employed within this proposal. Social media and local influencers are mentioned but, no specific steps are, such as who will run the social media accounts, does the proposer have a team or will they run everything by themselves? If the proposer has a team who is part of it? What local (proximity or regional?) social media influencers will represent Cardano? What social media will the proposer use? (Twitter, Instagram, Meta etc...?) How will the proposer (and their team if applicable) engage with their audience? (forums, videos, meetings, live streams etc...?) Unfortunately this proposal does not have much substantial information.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "More info is needed for the metrics of success. \"First timers to the Blockchain space openning their first wallet in Cardano.\" The proposer offers an insight for what they believe success looks like to them but, does not reveal any steps towards how they will accurately obtain this information. For example, (in a hypothetical situation in which this proposal has been approved) many people are joining and using Cardano today, who's to say that this is because of the influence of this specific proposals efforts? How will the proposal measure the amount of people who came over through the influence of this proposal? While the key metrics of this proposal are valid \"Number of local influencers talking about Cardano and/or Blockchain\nNumber of newbies to the space\nNumber of new wallets created as a direct influence of social media marketing.\" The lack of mention, of feasible methods towards measuring the accuracy of this proposal's efforts, is not enticing.

Item 3 may be questionable, as it would increase the user base in the dapp ecosystem, but considering that before users we will need functional dapps, it would make more sense to prioritize challenges that are closer to the bottom of the pyramid, such as developing developer ecosystems and dapps before mass adoption.\n\nCardano has an academic approach, based on first principles, research and this naturally made the development take longer. Meanwhile, blockchains that prioritized marketing, more centralized and less secure solutions gained more \"popularity\". Considering that Cardano is still in a massive development phase, with several scalability-related deliverables during the year, I think prioritizing user base expansion over challenges that seek to build solid foundations is not in line with Cardano's mission.\n\nI see marketing and social media for user base growth as a necessary tool, but not a priority right now.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "it is difficult to make a proper assessment of feasibility and say whether the community is in a position to create proposals for this challenge as the description of the challenge itself is too brief and there are not enough elements to bring clarity to potential directions. It seems to me that this challente setting is still a draft and needs more details so that the community can understand what kind of solutions can be created. What has been described only refers to increasing the user base through social media, which is a very broad concept and would bring confusion to proponents of this challenge.\n\nThere is no mention of a challenge team defined for this challenge.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The three key metrics defined are not good indicators for evaluating the performance of proposals as they are very subjective.\n\n\"Number of local influencers talking about Cardano and/or Blockchain\" Non-constructive metric that would encourage spam and poor content\n\"Number of newbies to the space\" This metric does not bring professionalism to this challenge, I would recommend removing it.\n\n\"Number of new wallets created as a direct influence of social media marketing\" How to measure the number of wallets resulting from this challenge? How to prevent this metric from being gamified by creating fake wallets?\n\nIf the idea is to increase the user base, it is important to choose metrics that can capture this and that are not easily distorted/gamified.\n\nThe definition of success is also subjective and would have little chance of indicating whether the proposals are being positive.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_43", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7047, "q0": "The challenge is critical to achieve Cardano mission because Cardano has a bottom up approach, differently from some other platforms like Binance Smart chain which is more centralized and has a top to bottom approach.

Content creation to make people familiarize with the concept of blockchain and channelling them directly to Cardano without spending energy and resources in explaining the whole crypto world will be the second major pain point. \nThe Cardano community has already proven to be multi disciplinary and surely there will be plenty of content creators and social media managers / marketers to create the most appropriate content.

A new wallet can also be created by an old user who needs to split his/her own ADA. \nMoreover, the most precious engagement that I see is with young people, who do not have necessairly money to invest, but they can learn how to code and contribute to the Plutus pioneer program. \nNumber of access to schools for introductory lessons, number of influencers with 1+M followers participating to Cardano campaigns, number of TV spots, would justify the half million USD budget for this challenge, which is aligned with a big size company marketing budget (P&G spent 4.5 billion in 1 year).
