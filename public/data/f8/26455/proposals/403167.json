On the other hand, it can be considered, from my perspective, as a kind of \"problem sensing\" challenge since, while there is a wide variety of challenges that are critical for Cardano to succeed, I also recognize that we may have blind spots in this area. Additionally, this same characteristic leaves the door open for all proposals with passion to deliver value and fulfill one of the strategic goals of fund 9. However, I believe the challenge team could have made a better effort in defining the challenge configuration, for example, considerations for future proposers to have open-source features from the conception of the project or at least consider open-source features minimally in the strategic plan of the proposal. My score for this section is 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It is worth noting that in Fund 7, there were 68 proposals competing, of which 32 were approved by the community and finally 17 were chosen as winners, while in Fund 8, there are 89 proposals seeking funding, which represents an increase of approximately 30% and is the third challenge with the highest number of proposals. The data presented here indicates a clear capacity, and above all the need, for the community to continue to take on this challenge. Considering that there was a 30% increase in the number of proposals and in Fund 7 there were 15 proposals that were approved by the community but were not allocated funds, I would have recommended increasing the budget for Fund 9 to a minimum of $800,000.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Due to the characteristics of this challenge, it can be understood that the definition of success metrics cannot be simple due to the anticipated variability of proposals, however, considering that this challenge has already been conducted in the past, I would have preferred to see an update in the challenge settings based on what has been learned.

S/he suggests that the challenge setting should have required proposals to be open source - while this might make a good challenge, it would be a different challenge from this one. It's not valid to assess a challenge setting on the basis that it does not match your own idea for a challenge setting. In VERIFIABILITY, the CA does the same thing, saying \"I would have preferred to see an update in the challenge settings based on what has been learned\".  This is personal opinion based on pure guesswork on their part as to what *has* been learned - in fact, what was learned from fund 7 was that the challenge metrics were appropriate and effective, which is why we did not significantly \"update\" them. So the CA's rating is based on a mistaken rationale."}, {"id": 5783, "q0": "This challenge creates space for new ideas and projects that can't find place in any current challenge.

This challenge is feasible as it proved to be in Fund7, and in current fund, the demand is high.

By providing a miscellaneous challenge you're making sure that proposers are not bound to a specific subject. This has a positive effect and the proposals being posted because if you don't have challenge settings where anything is welcome you either force a proposer to adjust his proposal to fit within a challenge setting or you make them not submit it. This challenge addresses the strategic goals perfectly. It provides more contribution, thinking outside the box which in turn boost the growth and evolution of Catalyst.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding Feasibility, this challenge gives plenty of room for the community to address this challenge. Since its a miscellaneous challenge it has no special requirements for a challenge to fall within.

It has proven from it's first iteration to pinpoint a need of a certain Challenge, through data. Although I am not in the loop of things, I am quite sure we can gauge the community's interest of a specific topic if it came out in numbers in the Miscl. Challenge. With that said, this proposal is absolute critical for it functions as a sensory array system also. But at the same, it also provides funding for the ideas that we might have overlooked and not think of. This proposal to an extent, accentuates the most beloved story in history, the story of how one individual can make a huge impact. A great Challenge idea from the proposer, whoever that individual is.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Since this proposal very much can encompass anything and everything, it becomes a yes or no answer. For perhaps there is a specific proposal where no one from the community can address correctly and specifically.

Keeping success criteria and metrics as is or as simple as possible, is fitting. It does not push towards this Challenge being a certain box. It allows for the creative mind to go wild.
