Cardano is in a moment where several DApps are under development and there is a great lack of manpower, mainly Plutus developers, therefore increasing the number of devs is essential. This challenge is related to the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals\n, more precisely items 1 (Prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem) and 3 (Accelerate the growth and evolution of developer & app ecosystem).", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The community has full capacity to develop proposals in this challenge, since Fund2 challenges related to improvements in the developer ecosystem have been recurring, with gradually increasing budgets and increasing demand. The difference here would be the focus on content in LATAM languages, Spanish and Portuguese, so it would only require people with the ability to translate content, which has low complexity.\n\nThe requested budget is relatively low, so the demand for responses here shouldn't be a problem, probably the opposite if we base on the demand of the last challenge dedicated to LATAM, \"Grown Latin America, Grown Cardano\".\n\nThere is no mention of a challenge team defined for this challenge setting.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The key metrics defined for this challenge setting are good indicators for evaluating the number of developers, SPOs and projects related to the developer ecosystem in LATAM. I would like to see more metrics related to the quality of courses, documentation and developers that will be created by proposals in this challenge.\n\nThe definition of success is objective, but it could be more tangible in its goal.

As a side note, we would like to address the simplification of the task to be made. Generating more developers is not about translation of contents, is about generating the proper ecosystem where people can learn, grow, collaborate and finally impact our Ecosystem. It is about people and inspiration, it is about showing others the great potential and opportunities Cardano lays ahead and most important lowering the barriers for people in LATAM to be able to reach them. Translation is just a small, but important part, but it is not just about that. Thanks so much to point that out, and let us explain a little bit more."}, {"id": 7504, "q0": "This challenge is about onboarding latin American developers to Cardano-based technologies and ecosystem. Alignment is evaluated based on two set of metrics that define whether a given challenge is critical to achieving Cardano\u2019s mission: the fund9 strategic goals and the guiding questions for challenge setting. \n\nIn terms of the strategic goals, this challenge effectively prepares groups of people to contribute to the ecosystem. It does not directly contribute to making Cardano open-sourced. But it does accelerate the developer ecosystem and the proliferation of dapps. \nIn terms of the guiding questions, this proposal is likely to gain traction within the subset of voters from Latin America. This may prove valuable for broader Cardano adoption of course, which is the second guiding question. Lastly, if this challenge is addressed then we will have many more developers contributing who are not just based in the Global north but also in other parts of the world. To become the financial backbone of the world, this is critical.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As someone who is part of the Latin American discord, I can attest to the fact that this is indeed a passionate and very active community. I have also been in touch with some of the proposers from previous challenges and thanks to having a strong Latin American diaspora, I do believe that there is in fact a strong skill pool to draw from in terms of adoption here. Hence, the community is likely able to achieve the goals stated. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They propose 6 distinct key measures of progress. They span from number of technical people involved, to enrolled Atala prism and Plutus pioneers and projects and developers. The challenge could be more explicit about how to go about measuring the number of Plutus developers from LATAM, by for example measuring that in terms of Plutus pioneer certificates. It is also a bit vague by saying \u201cincreased participation of LATAM technical people\u201d, as this is not clearly defined nor easy to capture.

They are the ones that generate the most visible projects for new members, that generate the first approach and most tangible form of onboarding for new emerging-economy members. Having said that, Latin America has the characteristics of a high inequality region, with many informal workers and approximately half of the population going unbanked. This is a region ripe for disruption via the cryptoeconomy, specially given the high inflation rates in many countries, and the use of Cardano-led projects will ensure a predominant market position for Cardano from an early stage, the engagement of highly skilled IT workers as Cardano devs, the spread of SPOs, maximization of transaction volume and consequent onboarding of new members.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The high engagement within the Fund7 Grow LatAM, Grow Cardano Challenge (with 84 proposals, third in amount of proposals received after Dapps and Integration and the Miscellaneous challenge), of which the proposers are also present in this new Challenge iteration more specifically focused on developers, show the enormous potential for projects and onboarding within the Latin American community. The team is highly experienced and motivated, with a verifiable track record within the Community, and have done a very thorough exercise of community management and engagement, both on the physical and virtual level, with Latin American TownHalls already held weekly, plus Telegram, Twitter and Discord channels for the Latam community already in place with significant and growing engagement.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The key metrics identified (number of participants in the LATAM SPO Communities, number of Plutus developers from LATAM, number of Latin people on the Atala Prism Pioneer and Plutus Pioneer programs, participation of LATAM technical people in the Cardano ecosystems, number of LATAM based projects on Cardano\u00b4s ecosystem) are consistent with measuring the progress of the LATAM developer community as set forth within the Challenge. It would be interesting to also incorporate as KPIs the transaction volume increase and augmentation of SPO activity in LatAM.
