UBI is a popular topic and may attract certain niche groups to the ecosystem for this reason. It is not aligned with the goal of making Cardano open-sourced. It is also only vaguely related to accelerating cardano\u2019s developer and dapp ecosystem. Proposals can of course be related to dApps but the KPIs are not biased towards such acceleration. \n\nIn terms of the latter, this challenge is very likely to create enthusiasm amongst the voters. It is something that some care deeply about. The challenge is also explicitly aimed at onboarding more people to the ecosystem through the proposals and hence it is well aligned with that goal. However, it is essentially \u201cgive people money so they join Cardano\u201d. This is not the way the Cardano ecosystem seeks to gain wider adoption.
