However, I must say that after doing a quick and non-exhaustive search of the proposals that are choosing to be challenges for fund 9, I found 9 with characteristics similar to this one (specific challenges for development and growth in an area of \u200b\u200bthe world) I personally believe that as a community we should find a common site where the proposals that seek the development and growth of emerging economies compete under the same challenge, since although they are aimed at a specific area they have much more in common from my point of view. .

Regarding the metrics, there is a combination of metrics that give an indication of the performance of the challenge itself, and others aimed at being a reference model for future proposals to be contained within this challenge and I am satisfied with this. However, I must add that considering that this challenge has already had several funds as part of the resident challenges at Catalyst, it would be interesting if the team that prepared the proposal presented data that validates that we are on the right path and identifies GAPs that must be addressed.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The grow Africa, grow Cardano is a good initiative for creating awareness and educating the youth, business personnel and developers on the benefits and technical know-how of the blockchain technology and the project catalyst.

The rest of the Fund 9 strategic goals are fully met in the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The community has submitted a significant number of proposals in every funding round that this challenge has been funded relative to the size of the fund.

A quick look at the graph provided revealed that African funding was approximately 10% of the total which is indeed much less than the western societies.

When we look at the track record of this proposal we can see that it has already been present in Catalyst in F5 and F6, In F7 it was not approved for funding. What this tells me is that there was not enough traction on the proposal to get voted for. This brings me to the point that the proposer did his best this round to turn things around and change the briefing and focus from previous rounds. \nHowever, I still feel the proposal is not hitting the nail on the head with the briefing. Looking at the briefing it makes me feel that the proposers are looking outward towards a global economy and comparing Africa with the rest of the world instead the proposal should be about what has Africa to offer to the rest of the world and give it uniqueness to it. This is why I'm giving alignment a 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I have no doubt that the proposal can be addressed by the community.

Having said that, Africa has the characteristics of a high inequality region, with a very large population, high percentage of unbanked people and high engagement with new technologies.
