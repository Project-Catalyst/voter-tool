The authors of the proposal does a good job of explaining why CA's and vCA's play a key role in the Project Catalyst ecosystem. \n\nThe 'Community Advisor Improvements' challenge setting is currently present in Fund 8 and this proposal is requesting for it to be present in the upcoming Fund 9 as well. The slight addition is an increased budget by 50% (150k vs 100k). \nIncreasing the budget for this necessary challenge setting seems like a natural transition since the community has had time to develop ideas. Also, proposals from Fund 8 that did not succeed to receive funding can review their ideas and proposals from the feedback received in Fund 8 and apply again. Additionally, this leaves room for successful projects to remain maintained (with help of funding) as well as funding new and exciting proposals.\n\nWith the above mentioned arguments, it is safe to say that this proposal aligns with Cardano's mission and the Fund 9 strategic goals.

I am certain we have been infiltrated by individuals that have observed us, try to exploit are \"kindness\" or \"decentralized\" nature. And I feel there is a coordination between these individuals, where one becomes the ring leader and takes the most risk while one plays the role of manipulation. I believe also people are creating fakes persona's, but their method of writing gives them away. I also believe people are falsifying their relations with their so-called team members.
