While I can understand that for Cardano to achieve its mission of being, which is the social and financial operating system that will allow building alternatives to traditional financial services, it is necessary to have all the characteristics mentioned here, when evaluating this particular challenge it seems to me very broad without a clear focus and therefore in many points it is mixed with other challenges that we have had in past funds and that today continue to opt to be selected for the next cycle of Catalyst, so according to my previous analysis, my score is 3. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Based on what was explained in the alignment section, there are several characteristics in this challenge setting that I am concerned about when evaluating in terms of feasibility, firstly the broad and very vague scope proposed, this can cause the potential proposals to go through very different paths and the effect that is produced is the opposite of the desired one, that is, instead of being more agile we are slower. Secondly, the lack of content in the challenge brief section and especially the lack of possible use cases or directions that potential proposers could take contributes to possible confusion for the proposer when deciding whether to opt for this challenge. As a consequence of the above, my score is 3.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The success criteria presented I consider equally very vague, it basically describes what Project Catalyst, it does not provide additional value to what the community already has today and the shortcomings already identified in past funds which are already being addressed.

Alignment is evaluated based on two broad metrics that together define whether it is critical to achieve Cardano\u2019s mission: the fund9 strategic goals and the guiding questions for challenge setting.\nIn terms of the former, this challenge does provide a pathway for people to work together in groups to contribute to the ecosystem. However, it is relatively weak in this aspect since proposals in this challenge may very well be one-person projects seeking to do research on some topic or develop some novel method for problem sensing. It is not necessarily directly addressing the strategic goal of making Cardano an open-sourced project even though open-sourcing may be a part of such adaptive solution capability that this challenge seeks to focus on. Lastly, its alignment with the goal of accelerating developer and dapp ecosystem is relatively weak as the metrics and proposals that would fall into this challenge are more of the structural types. \nIn terms of the guiding questions, there is also not great alignment. As a CA from the past two funds, my impression is that this challenge is unlikely to make voters particularly enthusiastic due to its \u201cmeta\u201d focus. However, it is quite unique and could therefore constitute a competitive advantage versus other protocols and hence be considered critical to achieving Cardano\u2019s mission (of becoming the dominant layer 1 protocol) nevertheless.

There are a lot of academics in the community that could write research papers on the topic of DAO transformation and evolution (one of the key metrics suggested).

This seems to me to be a community driven process that need not massive funding to achieve. Indeed it is something that is already happening! This of course means that I cannot do anything but give this five stars. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The verifiability is very high in this case. The suggested metrics are all easily measurable. For example the number of methods we have to solve problems, number of problems to reach strategic goals and number of research papers on this topic. One point of improvement would be to also include a metric that relate to the extent there is a perception of acceptance and consensus regarding the strategic goals. \n\nThe reason why this is interesting and important is because strategic goal setting is not hard per se. The hard part is about reaching some form of agreement and acceptance that whatever strategic goal is indeed important. Another more explicit and measurable KPI could be to ask for number of metrics and tools that can be used by the community to track progress and goal alignment. A last metric that could be introduced would be the number of tools and channels that help the community sense problems before they arise (and  hence address these through challenge settings in project catalyst). \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_582", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10797, "q0": "Challenge brief intends to\"\nMake cardano ecosystem \n\n- smart and distributed, \n- able to focus on the right problems to \n- use it resources effectively and yet flexible and \n- friendly enough to any new idea which could bring more addoption (sic), more growth.\n\nSounds good enough.
