The author argues that improving user experiences will draw new users into the Cardano ecosystem, which does make sense. Out of my personal experiences in product management of digital products, bad user experience can severely undermine the adoptions of technologically complex projects, which most of the blockchain products are. It's reasonable to assume that this challenge will be mostly relevant to existing digital products since to identify user experience issues some version of a digital product should already exist. This, in my opinion, can somewhat limit that potential audience for this challenge and thus partially undermine the Fund9 Challenge Setting objective indicated in the \"What challenges will engage the highest number of voters?\" question. In addition, I believe that explicitly providing some examples of bad user experiences in Cardano or example categories of potential projects could stronger help \"inspire impactful and original proposal\".", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Since this challenge is about improving digital products, and the history of Catalyst previously successfully funding many new digital tools and products, it's obvious that the Catalyst community has all the necessary skills and resources to address this challenge. Moreover, this proposal comes from two authors, which suggests that at least a moderate level of support for proposers in this challenge can be provided, which is important given the high budget of $2M. To be fully confident in the feasibility of this challenge, I'd like to see a description of the skills and experiences of the challenge team members. That will help confidently reason on their ability to support and guide the proposers.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal defines the \"new user base\" as the primary success criteria for the challenge. In addition, the authors suggest a number of project-level KPIs grouped into three categories: Usability, Engagement, and Conversion. In my opinion, the suggested project-level metrics are comprehensive and helpful to track the progress of individual projects. However, they are insufficient to \"measure progress in addressing the challenge\" on the Cardano-ecosystem level, which is a primary check of verifiability according to the CA guidelines for Challenge Setting proposals. I believe that the proposal would be stronger if it considered some ecosystem-level metrics to track its progress and impact on the Cardano ecosystem: - for user growth: the number of new wallets brought by the initiatives in this challenge. - for user engagement: the increase in active wallets (with at least one transaction per month) associated with the projects created in this challenge. - for long-term user satisfaction: the user churn (% of new wallets that keep being active after 1-month, 3-months, 6-months, etc.)", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1011", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 8, "ng": 9, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1195, "q0": "The team that proposed this challenge argues that, to build the future of blockchain, the best way to accomplish this is to create experiences that users are interested in and want to take part in. Personally, I think the concept has been greatly reduced. Certainly, user experience is a factor that ultimately plays a role in adoption, but there are many other factors that are not accounted for by this logic. I would like to add that I believe that usability concepts should be incorporated in all projects that are being developed in a way that allows teams to think about it from the beginning. Having reviewed the challenge setting, I noticed that the team did a great job in defining the different metrics required, but I missed a section which provided a description of possible directions which potential proposers could follow. This is why I gave the challenge a score of 3.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "As part of the feasibility assessment process, I conducted a quick search among the proposals included in the pass fund, and I found only one proposal focused on improving the experience of the proposers post-funding. Unfortunately, I did not find another proposal that would address the subject of user experience issues. I am concerned when I look at the requested budget, since it is $2,000,000, and I believeve that this amount is excessive when compared for example with challenges like \"Products & Integrations\" where the scope is far more substantial and undeniably broader. So based on my previous analysis I respectfully disagree from a feasibility point of view.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "In terms of verifiability, I would like to congratulate the team, since it's obvious how much experience they have in this field. A large number of metrics are presented that can be used to measure progress in addressing the challenge most accurately. In addition to their focus on the potential proposers, some of these measures can also be used to measure the performance of the challenge as a whole.

Blockchain technology is relatively new (it not yet so widely used) and many people may feel afraid when they hear about it. Making it easier for them to use Cardano based applications maye help to overcome these barries. It is also aligned with Cardano goals in technology, as it intends to be more inclusive and improve interactions and transactions in the world. Moreover, it is also aligned with strategic goal of F9 of \"Turn Cardano into an open source project\" and \"Prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem\", as it make the Cardano world more accessible and erasy to navigate through.\nThe only 2 things that I thing that could be improved in challenge description is providing some \"Potential directions\", with general examples and maybe restrict the scope a little bit, as the way it is written is really broad (what to really focus on? )", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Cardano community is totally able to develop projects with improved UX. There are many people in the community with such background and this is easily verifiable in many proposals, in the team sections, where the qualifications are shown.

Although UX is an essential item in the development of applications on Cardano, I'm not sure if it makes sense to treat UX as a separate element of software development and the development of projects on the blockchain itself.\n\ne.g. Could a proposal that intends to create a dapp be submitted in this challenge? Or just part of the proposal that involves the development of UX solutions?\n\nIt is unclear how a proposal that intends to create a dapp/software would fit this challenge, would likely cause confusion and would cause division of proposals to fit this challenge. By narrowing the scope of the challenge to UX improvements, the challenge ends up creating gray areas and barriers that tend to cause confusion.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I believe that there is demand in the Cardano community to create solutions that seek UX improvements in the Cardano ecosystem in general. It is not clear how proposals that seek to develop dapps and software can fit in here, as I understand that the scope of this challenge is UX improvement, so some proposals would probably end up being divided into different challenges to make sense, which can cause confusion. My main concern with the feasibility of this proposal is the relatively high budget, $2M USD, which is one of the highest budget proposals in the challenge setting. I don't think a relatively high budget per se is an issue, but this is the first time this challenge is being proposed in Catalyst and there is no previous reference that we can orient ourselves to understand if there is such a high demand in the community. A practice that has been used by the Catalyst community since Fund2 is to gradually increase the budget of challenges so that we can check demand and adjust accordingly. Setting a relatively high budget at the first appearance of this challenge setting brings uncertainty about the community's ability to develop proposals and create necessary demand, which compromises the feasibility assessment. Also, there is no mention of an established challenge team.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Several metrics were defined to evaluate the performance of the proposals that eventually could be created in this challenge, the key metrics defined are reasonable and allowed a good perception of performance.\n\nThe definition of success could be more objective because I don't see how to quantify the definition inserted in the challenge setting\"...new user base that takes advantage of the underlying technology, while providing value in their lives\"", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_43", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9915, "q0": "While I agree that user experience is a key factor for adoption of a new service, I disagree that it is critical for Cardano\u2019s mission.

It\u2019s not about preparing a group of willingful people, not about turning Cardanos into an open source project.
