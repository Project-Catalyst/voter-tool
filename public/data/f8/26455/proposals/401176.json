Based on my analysis, I must state I am opposed to having this challenge for the next fund. Here is why. In a few words I can tell the voters that this challenge has a broad scope and in case it is selected it may be contained by proposals that do not necessarily point to the same direction. Essentially, the team that drafted this proposal proposes to revamp Catalyst's governance mechanisms, however, from reading the Challenge Setup, I can infer that the root causes of the problems it argues for have different roots. Furthermore, when it talks about attracting high quality proposers and increasing participation from ADA holders, to me this is a matter of outreach. The issue of outreach deserves separate treatment, and for that reason we have faced obstacles in the past, as well as two competing challenges today. The third problem he mentions is the problem we have had associated with fraudulent CAs and vCAs, this has a very different root than the previous one, in fact we have a challenge today (community advisors improvement) that seeks among other things to address this. In addition to collaborations that are occurring between the CA community and IOG to improve the systematic, and thus reduce the risk of participation of fraudulent agents or increase the probability of detection of them. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "In light of my analysis of the impact section, where I contend that the two issues raised by the challenge team are outreach topics and issues associated with the roles of CA and vCAs, I can affirm that the community can respond essentially because we have been responding with a variety of proposals and challenges in previous funds. Do we still have a long way to go? Certainly! However, I consider this part of the experiment. In the event that this challenge is chosen, we would have high levels of overlap between challenges, which could lead to a dispersion of community capabilities, and as a result an ineffective allocation of funds. Therefore, I give this section a score of 3. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The challenge team decided to approach the description of suggested success metrics in the form of questions, and I have no objection to this as long as these questions provide prospective proposers with feasible suggested metrics that they can measure against. However, I find a large number of these questions and very difficult to measure, which adds a layer of confusion for prospective proposers and one of difficulty for the community to evaluate, vote on, and audit proposals.

He mentioned that there is a challenge \u201cCommunity advisors improvement\u201d that our proposal can be modified to fit in. It is not the case. When you have a house, and the foundation has some problems, what the CA\u2019s advise is to repair the column, the roof. It not a correct thinking once the cause of the problem is identified. What we proposed is to repair the foundation or rebuild the house. That is renovating."}, {"id": 6528, "q0": "This challenge aims to improve Catalyst for all stakeholders participating in the project, attracting more qualified proposers, increasing voter participation in general and improving the quality of the service provided by CAs/vCAs. This is an important theme for Cardano's mission because since the beginning of Catalyst the community has increasingly assumed the role of protocol development, creation and governance.

If quality were associated with the score of funded/approved proposals, this would be a more conclusive definition.\n\nCommunity participation by voting can increase for n reasons, how to associate?

Namely:\r\nIf Community participation by voting can increase for n reasons, then through 7 funds, it would be much higher than just 12% in Fund 7. If renovating government is applied and the Ada volume to participate in the voting increases more than, say 12/7 = 1.7 %, then it would be considered the effect of the new government. The founder team expect a much higher percentage.\r\nIn the proposed government, two key players are emphasized, namely proposer and voter.

This is a potential challenge because it an undeniable fact that currently the quality of proposals and CA comments still have much room for improvement. Especially the fact the total volume of Ada participating in voting for project selection is incredibly low (Fund 7 only ~12% of Ada participated in voting). There must be something in the governance that should be changed or improved because if we want to change the outcome, we should try to change the method to do it.

But on a positive note, this is a good way to get Catalyst members to pay more attention to this problem and come up with good ideas to improve it. \nA really good point of this challenge proposal is that they explain very well the need to have this challenge, so that it is easy for Catalyst member to understand the challenge and participate in.
