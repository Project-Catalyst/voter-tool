I have noticed in past funds challenges that overlap or perhaps are too specific to the detriment of healthy competition and possibly address partialized needs. The goal of the category is to close the existing gap within the ecosystem in terms of the Quality and Security of the resources available to developers and SPOs. Cardano's mission and this challenge category are closely aligned in terms of criticality. In fact, it is the core of our third strategic goal, and indirectly addresses our first and second goals as well. As far as the first one is concerned, it is fulfilled indirectly, since if the ecosystem tools for developers and SPOs are multiplied and improved, it will improve users' experiences and therefore make it easier for those to contribute to the ecosystem. The second is fulfilled a little more directly, since in the section titled \"Considerations for proposers,\" proponents are encouraged to support open source and this should be considered by community advisors during QA phase and ADA holders in the voting.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In prior funds, we have seen how the community has responded to what is being sought in this challenge. Therefore, from that perspective I am confident that the community will respond. As new tools, standards, and research are developed by the community, the community naturally gains experience and identifies gaps that need to be addressed, which perpetuates a virtuous cycle. As this is a new approach, I think a challenge team has not yet been formed, however, this is not a concern to me because the PACE team supports these categories and they manage to keep the community involved from the definition of topics to be addressed, the content of the setting to the selection of the percentage of budget to be allocated, so I am confident that a proper challenge team will be formed if selected.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "To prepare this proposal, the team had to present metrics for a number of different projects that could not be measured uniformly. In order to address this, the challenge team decided to dedicate a section to presenting examples of metrics corresponding to the type of project to be undertaken. My only comment to improve the challenge setting would be that, although the metrics seem accurate, they aim to measure the final result (what we call lagging KPIs) once the project has been implemented and regularly in terms of auditability it is necessary to have progress or impact indicators on a phased basis. Consequently, I believe the challenge setting could be improved if this comment is included as a consideration for proponents to include within their proposals.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 3, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6493, "q0": "The theme chosen in this challenge is essential to Cardano's mission and would be for the development of any public blockchain that aspires to decentralization and a promising development and research ecosystem. I see this challenge as an alternative to the Developer Ecosystem challenge, which has been present since Fund 2 and was left out only in Fund 7, being one of the most important and most demanded challenges in Catalyst, as Cardano is in a continuous process of decentralization, where development is gradually being taken over by the community in an open source manner. But it is not just an alternative, as it has a broader scope and allows the creation of proposals dedicated to improvements for SPOs (stake pool operators), which is also extremely important to ensure more resources, tools and access to SPOs, which moves towards a more decentralized and secure blockchain. It also allows research and projects dedicated to the development of scalability solutions, which fits well with Cardano's current moment due to the implementation of Hydra.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Cardano community has the capacity to create promising proposals in this challenge, as it has been doing so for many months, since the beginning of Catalyst. The requested budget is large, but if we consider the gradual increase in funds destined for projects dedicated to the developer ecosystem since Fund 2, the great demand for proposals in these challenges during the last funds, taking into account that in Fund 7 there were two dedicated challenges to developer development, whose combined budget was $2.2 million and the fact that this challenge (Development & NodeOperation) has a broader scope I believe the stated value is appropriate. In addition, this challenge has already already, community and scrutiny with the theme, budget, discussed and voted on various community members before this challenge was posted on Catalyst, indicating that there is a reasonable consensus. It is important to note that in Fund 8 there are 3 major Challenge Setting that have themes focused on the development ecosystem. The \"Development & Node Operation\" challenge has a broader theme, as it also allows for proposals aimed at better scalability and proposals aimed at improving the SPO ecosystem. It has a budget of $2.3 million dollars.\n\nThe \"OSDE: Open Source Dev Ecosystem\" challenge is focused on the open source development ecosystem and has a budget of $1.5 million.\n\nThe \"Developer Ecosystem\" challenge is focused on the devolopment ecosystem as a whole and has a budget of $1 million USD.\n\n There is a large area of \u200b\u200boverlap in these 3 challenges. I believe that all are well-structured challenges and would be important, but the budget for Fund 9 is not yet defined and if these 3 challenges were approved they would have a combined budget of $4.8 million, which would be 30% of the total budget , if the amount of the Fund9 remains worth $16M. I think 30% of the total budget would be an excessive amount of budget earmarked for similar challenges, but it is up to voters to decide which of these challenges is most appropriate, as despite having overlapping themes, there are slight differences in the breadth of scope for each of them.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Considering that the scope of this proposed challenge is an expansion of the challenges aimed at the developer ecosystem, establishing success metrics becomes more difficult, as the range of proposal increases, the criteria need to be thought in order to support the new concepts of the challenge.\n\n\nThe PACE team established between two and three metrics for verification of success for each theme, metrics that I consider acceptable, but somewhat subjective and insufficient for an appropriate and objective verification of success.\n\ne.g.\"Increasing the number or quality of tools, libraries & SDKs that help improve areas around running nodes for SPOs, Plutus & IELE development or native asset development.\" Increasing the number or quality is subjective, any proposal that aims to create tools will naturally increase the number of tools by at least 1, so I believe the metrics presented lack specificity and precision.\n\nI like the concept brought by PACE, where there is a pre-discussion and filtering of challenges, because as was well observed by the creators of this concept, Catalyst began to have many challenges with overlapping themes and budgets with poorly reflected rationales, which increases the confusion and complexity in the decision-making of the community, but when considering broader themes, greater clarity and number of metrics are needed to verify success, otherwise the proposals created in the new challenge may be disoriented in relation to deliverables and harm another current pain point of Catalyst, which is auditability.\n\nFor the reasons mentioned above, I would recommend that the team include more metrics dedicated to each theme defined under the scope of this challenge.

Broad categorisation cannot offer the same level of specificity for metrics as otherwise it becomes a massive list due to the types of proposals included or becomes restricted in the types of proposal that be included based upon the metrics they must adhere to. Instead it makes sense to have this metric specificity at the proposal level where proposers can determine what are effective metrics for what they are trying to achieve and can consider the examples given in this challenge. The challenge then can focus on what are the high level objectives which due to the broadness will be less verifiable. The community could make specific high level metrics for types of proposals to strive for outside of the funding categorisation part of funding as that leads to the issues around specific funding categorisation which is detailed here - https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-funding-categories/analysis/funding-categorisation-specificity"}, {"id": 6812, "q0": "This is one of the seven proposals PACE has filed in the challenge settings.
