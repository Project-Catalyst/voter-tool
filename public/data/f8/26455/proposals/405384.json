The possible challenge idea of peer to peer payment in a network down scenario, even for people without smart devices would be highly useful to achieving Cardano's mission if feasible. The Challenge does not preclude open source DApps however it does nothing to specifically promote Cardano as an open source project but it does meet the rest of the Fund 9 Strategic goals.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The types of solutions to address the overall challenge are easily within the Cardano communities capabilities, although some of the example DApp solutions could be extremely challenging for the community to address. Specifically the Financial, Network and Supply-chain examples seem difficult for the community to address depending upon interpretation. The challenge could be improved upon by making it clearer why solutions should be grouped under this challenge as opposed to the pre-existing challenges which covers all of these solutions.

Bitcoin emerged as a response to the 2008 financial crisis and a chance to opt out of the traditional financial system, through Bitcoin, which in this context means an account system with a rigid, predictable and distributed financial policy, which results in a that allows the financial sovereignty of the individual and the individual's independence from the state. In the developed world cryptocurrencies (I won't go into the merits of which cryptos) can be seen as an investment or insurance, but in unstable countries/jurisdictions where there are political conflicts, wars, repression or financial instability, cryptos become a practical tool, as we can see in countries where there is hyperinflation or exchange controls. Bitcoin today allows people to carry out transactions without internet, through SMS or satellites and this flexibility ends up making Bitcoin and its users more resilient.\n\nIf we think of Cardano's context, we can see this type of work being done by projects such as World Mobile, which seeks to create an alternative internet access network (which is an auxiliary service to increase redundancy in internet access) or Cardano Mixer , which allows the creation of transaction privacy (which allows individuals persecuted by authoritarian governments to protect themselves from transaction tracking). Much of the work being done on blockchains ends up creating solutions that can help individuals in situations of humanitarian crises indirectly, but having a challenge aimed at this can make projects focus on direct solutions and not just projects that have positive secondary effects. .", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I believe that solutions that can help populations in need of humanitarian aid need more ingenuity and creativity than technical complexity. I have already seen several proposals on Catalyst that would contribute to this challenge, such as proposals aimed at creating cards or physical devices that would allow for offline transactions, proposals aimed at digital identity in blockchain and proposals aimed at ending Cardano's dependence on communication via the internet. , proposing the use of satellites or the RINA protocol, proposals aimed at transaction privacy.

The alignment score is set based on two sets of metrics that define whether a given challenge is critical to achieving Cardano\u2019s mission: the fund9 strategic goals and the guiding questions for challenge setting.\n\nThis challenge sets the stage for passionate groups of people to contribute in a multitude of ways. However, even though the cause and use-cases are noble, it doesn\u2019t accelerate the open-sourcing of Cardano nor does it stand out in its ability to accelerate the growth of the developer or dApp ecosystem. \n\nAs a CA/vCA from the past two rounds, I have learned from reading proposals that many of the technologies and use-cases has the potential of becoming particularly valuable at times of crises. This challenge, however, stands out in its focus on developing blockchain-based products that can work when all else fails, and is accessible for all people, regardless of age, technology and experience. The recent war in Europe has made people particularly alert about the need for systems that can keep working even when all else collapses. \n\nThis means this aligns very well with the challenge guiding questions of creating voter enthusiasm and therefore growth of the Cardano mission, even though it is unclear to what extent we will get massive onboarding to the ecosystem as a result of these capabilities. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The challenge is well within the Cardano community\u2019s grasp. They have shown time and time again that humanitarianism is important value. For example the Littercoin project and as evidenced by the Mission Driven Pools alliance just to mention two. The challenge is quite general in its scope, allowing for both dApps, identity solutions and physical products \u2013 they are unified only with the focus on the end-use which is that of helping those who are suffering. This makes it quite flexible. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The challenge lists four metrics. These are well formulated. However, they could be rephrased so as to lend themselves to evaluation of the key problem that the challenge seeks to address: to help in times of crises using blockchain technology. As a CA/vCA from the past two rounds, my view is that these KPIs should be set to measure the added-value of proposals that stem from this particular challenge. Hence, it may be worth mentioning the relative merit of proposals, for example \u201cMeasuring how much easier it is for Babushka (grandma) to use the blockchain technologies compared to existing alternatives?\u201d. One unique and useful KPI is the one of portability: can the solution be reused in many contexts.
