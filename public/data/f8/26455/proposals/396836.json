Before attracting users in a massive way, we need to have a reasonable core structure and today Cardano is in a phase of constant technical updates regarding the Alonzo, Goguen and Voltaire phases. \n\nThat said, I see challenges that seek to make blockchain foundations (development ecosystem and dapps) a priority over challenge that seek to grow adoption at this point and I don't see Cardano adoption by seniors as critical for Fund9.\n\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Many of the potential directions of this challenge are solutions that are continuously being developed in the crypto space and are mostly of low technical complexity. E.g: Improvements in the user experience are an important aspect and always sought after by the various projects under development in blockchain. Through DApps and more user-friendly sites, the barrier to access for seniors tends to decrease. So, in relation to the technical capacity and people able to develop proposals in this challenge, I believe that the challenge is viable. The only point that leaves me in doubt is about setting a relatively high initial budget, $500,000 USD, for a topic with a relatively narrow scope, which should limit the number of potential proposals for this challenge.\n\nThe challenge has a relatively narrow scope, as it intends to focus on a relatively small subset of the population, which restricts the", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The key metrics for evaluating proposals that are eventually created in this challenge are relevant and could help to check the performance of the proposals in the challenge.\n\nThe definition of success in this challenge setting could be more objective. \"Mom or Dad -worldwide - safely investing and being involved in the Cardano ecosystem with understanding and confidence.\" This definition does not bring enough clarity and ease to evaluate the output of the proposals created\n\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_43", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10109, "q0": "The challenge is about encouraging Senior, which are 60 years old as the team's definition, join Cardano ecosystem.
