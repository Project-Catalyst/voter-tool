Ethereum dominates the market in rough numbers, with many successful use cases that would be extremely valuable if they were ported to Cardado. Although, you must also consider the shortcomings and problems that Ethereum is experiencing today as it strives to move from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake. Thus, my question to the challenge team is, why only focus on Ethereum? There are a lot of teams in many other ecosystems with brilliant innovations that also deserve Catalyst's attention, from this point of view it seems to me that perhaps the challenge fell short in scope. In terms of the challenge and its alignment with Cardano's mission, there is a clear relationship, and in terms of strategic goals, bringing EVM based projects to Cardano would contribute to the growth of the ecosystem. The assigned score is 4. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This is the first time we have undertaken this challenge, and for now we can only analyze the number of proposals submitted by the community. The challenge has a budget of $500,000. We only have 22 proposals competing for the allocation of funds, which, compared to other challenges of this fund, position us as one of the challenges with less proposals. This is a fact that should be analyzed by the challenge team, who decided to maintain the budget for the next fund. With the current number of proposals, this seems to be a very good decision. On the positive side, I believe that all the improvements in throughput that IOG is implementing with those planned for Q2 will improve the conditions of the chain considerably and as a consequence will be a much more attractive proposal for these EVM based projects. The assigned score is 4. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding the success criteria defined I think it seems appropriate, now regarding the suggested success metrics I think there could be an improvement versus the current challenge setting, I say this because of the two presented one of them (Number of projects that migrate) focuses on measuring the performance of the challenge itself, instead of focusing on being a suggestion for potential proposers. I think that challenge metrics are also necessary, but to avoid possible confusion with proposers a better wording of the setting could have occurred. The other metric seems to me correct and relatively easy to measure. The score assigned is 4.

No doubt about it. This race we are having with Ethereum, for them to deploy 2.0 for us to deploy Hydra (and deploy it soundly without major hiccups) is what will make Cardano the leading blockchain. Will Cardano become or even need to become the labelled Ethereum killer? Not at all, for eventually when the technology is similar, that is when branding has a play. And Cardano must strive to become \"The Blockchain For Good.\" Until that day comes, we must strive to onboard as many as possible Ethereum dApps. I believe that is the lowest hanging fruit in terms of massive adoption. We can try to create legions of Cardano specific developers, but that will take time. Rater than focusing only on grooming developers, we should put emphasis on accelerating the creation of bridges and etc. I would even suggest the budget to be bumped up to $1 million in ADA, in fact anything that deals with the acceleration of the number of developers that master or have deep understanding of Plutus and Haskell should have the minimum budget of $1 million in ADA.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Speak no further we have dcSpark and MLabs. Unfortunately that is all we have right now. We do have the future currently brewing, in the form of EBU's Hackathon, but that is a \"production line\" that still needs funding to be constantly producing developers. Other than that, I see no credible or sustainable source of Cardano developers. Viet Nam has the potential to become a power house of Cardano based developers, but again that all takes time. If the majority of the dream budget, where to go to dcSpark and MLabs themselves (due to lack of equally capable entities), to be honest I would have no issue. My emphasis is clear and repetitive, we need more developers. We need more dcSparks, we need more MLabs.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Although I am not tech savvy, the success criteria is concise and simple. The potential proposer instantly understands what needs to be done. Regarding the metrics, even though there are only 2 (two), it does cover what we need the most to be achieved; Ethereum projects that migrate and the number of smart contract users. That is and should be the general goals of the overall general community. Though perhaps it could've used a bit more of fleshing out.
