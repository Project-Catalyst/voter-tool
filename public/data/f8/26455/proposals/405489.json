Proposer are invited to prove their skills and motivation to get voted on. \n\nThis challenge setting proposal is pioneering, but it is far from what is expected in Fund9 Challenge setting. Even if one strategic goal is to \u201cprepare a group of people willing and able to make contribution to the ecosystem\u201d, the principle of Catalyst in Ideascale is to call for \u201cideas\u201d.\n\nA challenge setting proposal must define a challenge, a theme, for which here proposers will offer projects or ideas that will be funded. The \u201cgroup of people\u201d is supposed to be prepared through the proposals that will be developed, not directly hired.

These could be people who coordinate collaboration between different teams, but also mentors, documentors and other supportive roles. A person submits a proposal. Each one who is accepted would be paid a fixed $2000 per month over 6 months. The alignment score is set based on two sets of metrics that define whether a given challenge is critical to achieving Cardano\u2019s mission: the fund9 strategic goals and the guiding questions for challenge setting.\n\nIn terms of strategic goals, this challenge meets two: to prepare a group to contribute to the ecosystem and open sourcing. Open-source grassroots organisations have failed in the past due to a lack of basic personnel infrastructure. Hence this also aligns with the open sourcing strategic goal. In terms of voter enthusiasm, this has some potential of achieving this as this would be a very unique opportunity wherein a decentralised global community has hiring decisions to make. It would not be a springboard for greater adoption, however but is very much something that is crucial for the longer vision of Cardano as it is a key pillar of a functioning ecosystem. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Does the community have the capacity to address this? Without doubt. There is currently a team of more than 10 people working through QA-DAO and the Catalyst Circle Admin team with many many more contributing as volunteers.

One that is \u201cIncreased sense of community, more collaboration and idea sharing outside of Ideascale.\u201d, which is not easily measurable but could be so through the use of forms and surveying. Collaboration could be quantified if we assume that the funded people keep track on how many connections they are facilitating. I suggest proposers make this a separate KPI and explicitly make this a demand. The second strand of metrics is \u201cContinued engagement and collaboration among the cohort members\u201d. This can also be measured in terms of surveying and close tracking of the number of collaborations that the funded proposers have facilitated (as opposed to generally). It is important that we measure the value-added of this challenge in particular, and not just general trends.

But I do not find enough evidence or justification within the challenge settings that demonstrates that this is a major shortcoming within Catalyst today in order to justify the need to allocate a specific Treasury fund for solving this type of problem. In spite of that, I believe the proposal presented by the proposers still merits consideration as part of this governance experiment known as Catalyst. In terms of aligning with strategic goals, it prepares a group of people to contribute to the system. There is, however, no indication of alignment with the other two. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Indeed, I believe we have enough talent within the Catalyst community and the Cardano community in general to meet this challenge. Actually, I believe that today, in one way or another, there are already individuals who contribute to the community and can easily meet the challenge's requirements. My only concern is that there are at least 2 other challenges competing for selection that are similar to the approach sought here, so my recommendation and as a first model of \"collaboration\" is that synergies can be found between the various challenge teams with similar focus and present a challenge that includes all perspectives. I bring this up because I consider that there is a possibility of the community's response capacity being diluted across different challenges with similar focuses, which may result in an inefficient allocation of Treasury resources.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "From the perspective of verifiability, I would consider the definition of the success criteria and the suggested set of metrics to be very generic and vague, which renders them difficult to measure. A recommendation would be to include considerations for proposers in terms of reporting structure, expected deliverables, and so forth, in the challenge settings. However, due to the nature of the challenge, I believe that the community has the necessary resources to audit the potential proposers who are selected to receive funds.

While I agree with this, I would argue that we are constantly doing this already and we have been doing it more and more every fund. We have the Catalyst Circle which spends most of its time deliberating on how to improve Project Catalyst and then we have small workgroups (like CA\u2019s and vCA\u2019s) who constantly come up with ideas on how to improve the process (we\u2019ve seen dozens of ideas, listed in documents, every fund). So, in my opinion, there\u2019s no shortage of ideas for improvement. The bottleneck is in implementing them and this (mostly) still resides in IOG\u2019s court. To put this bluntly, personally I\u2019m concerned that proposals in this challenge would only be people coming up with ideas to get the promised money (more on that below), while not actually caring if they are good or if they get implemented at all.\nAlso, the proposer states that the current system is not really suited to funding facilitators, connectors, mentors etc, but I disagree: we have the Catalyst Swarm and this group is doing exactly that: it\u2019s providing Catalyst funding to members so that they will hold community events, facilitate innovation, maintain the Discord server, create documentation etc.\nTo finish off my analysis here, I also think that the key metrics to measure are very, very general. For example, \u201cIncreased sense of community, more collaboration and idea sharing outside of Ideascale\u201d. I\u2019m sorry, but without concrete numbers, this will be impossible to measure, not to mention that sense of community is something quite vague. I\u2019m not trying to put down this idea, I\u2019m just pointing out that it needs to be more rigorous if it is to gain traction.\nTo sum up, I do not agree that this particular challenge is critical to achieving Cardano\u2019s mission of mass adoption (mainly because what it intends to do is already happening!). Score: 2.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "As in the section above, I have serious doubts here as well. The proposer\u2019s idea is to have this challenge be a place where so called System Innovators would be able to place their proposals (for a set amount of 12000 USD, meaning 2000 USD per month for 6 months), with the ultimate goal of having 25 of them funded, so that they would do community service activities for 8 hours per week.\nNow my main issue with this approach is that this will be a honey pot for people who want to make some easy money. The way Catalyst works is that funded proposers send a report monthly to IOG and they get their funds. We do not have a way (and it would be absurd) to track if people actually put in the 8 hours of work per week, or if they just write 2 pages of documentation on some subject and then get their 2000 USD for the month, after they send their report that \u201cthey did their job\u201d. Furthermore, people would be incentivized to come up with ideas which are not practical, but just sound good, just so they can \u201cdeliberate\u201d on them (which might just mean talking with other people on Telegram for example) and then again, receive money as \u201cSystem Innovators\u201d who tried to think about better ways to do things.\nAgain, I do not want this to sound harsh, but I have close to 8 years of experience working in IT and I\u2019m painfully aware of the fact that there are people always looking to attach themselves as leeches to profitable endeavors, fooling the management with buzzwords and convincing them they will innovate their culture, while all they do is talk and host the occasional meeting where they offer generic self-help nonsense. Unfortunately, snake oil salesmen are everywhere and they would instantly jump on an opportunity like the one presented here.\nAs I stated before, the community is already doing everything this proposal wants to incentivize them to do and I actually think having this challenge would only bring more noise and confusion to Project Catalyst. Score: 2.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "In regards to verifiability, I\u2019m afraid this part suffers from being too general as well. First of all, the description for what it means to be an innovator could apply to almost anyone participating in the ecosystem and having a discussion: \u201cSeeks to coordinate and connect\u201d, \u201cworks across boundaries\u201d, \u201cEmbraces complexity\u201d etc. Second, the description of what proposals should focus on is again extremely vague: \u201cmotivation\u201d, \u201carea of focus\u201d, \u201cconnections with other proposers\u201d etc. These are simply much too broad concepts to be enforced in any way. I could add anything positive to my proposal and argue that I fulfill the criteria for motivation. To conclude, I cannot find any concrete measure here for how what comes out of this challenge will bring higher value than other projects which aim to actually build tech, or community hubs, or anything that is quantifiable.
