Importantly, the lack of a detailed challenge brief with suggestions on directions to take, framing of the problem and guidance means that it does not prepare a group willing and able to make contributions. It is a stretch to argue that it accelerates growth of the app ecosystem.\n\nOn its positive note, projects that seek to help children is something that a lot of people are passionate about.
