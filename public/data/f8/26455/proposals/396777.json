It can also be viewed as the next step on the road to Voltaire, a model of governance that has not been seen before. The team who prepared this proposal identified a gap which I believe to be a critical one. Hence, in order for Cardano to achieve its mission, there must be a place for the myriad of contributors that are either delivering value to the community voluntarily or they are in search for a place within the community where they can add value and be rewarded for it. In my opinion, there is a large group of people who have the desire, the passion, and above all, the experience and knowledge that will be able to provide their service to the development of the ecosystem. Regarding the strategic goals, this challenge is directly aligned with the preparation of a group of people to make contributions to the ecosystem, and I believe that indirectly helps the acceleration and growth of the ecosystem. My score is 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is no question that the community has proven to be capable of responding to the types of proposals you'd expect in this challenge in the past. As evidence of this, we have an ever-growing number of communication channels, dashboards, tools, and so on that deliver invaluable value to the community today. In my experience and as a member of the CA community, I can attest to the perfect blend of passion and knowledge that exists here. In the CA community, the status quo is challenged and at the same time, new alternatives are developed to improve this experiment that we call Project Catalyst. Therefore, I am confident that we can meet this challenge, thus giving this section a score of 5.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For this type of challenge category, I am of the opinion that it is not possible to define a very specific metric since the type of contributions can be highly variable, so what is proposed by the team as github commits, projects, improvements in documentation, etc. seems appropriate. I believe that what is brought in terms of auditability within the proposal are all the features in regards to the type of role that can be employed, what considerations should be taken for the definition of a good budget, what is expected of these roles, and how they are to report to the community. I find it very important because it is a new challenge within Catalyst. The more information available to potential contributors and the community, the better.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 3, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6134, "q0": "At the time of assessment the Fund 8 threshold link was broke and manually finding the section revealed that the thresholds were all TBC. No rating penalty applied but these should be fixed prior to voting. The case for broader challenge categories is well detailed, as is this specific Contributor challenge. The challenge proposal could be improved by detailing how Contributors are intended to interact with Catalyst Circle and DReps. Is the intent to replace, complement or be completely separate from those roles and organizational structures?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The Fund 8 budget ranges listed in the github document for contributors at time of assessment was $25K-$55k for 6 months which based upon the total budget requested would be 22-49 contributors. That is a sizable Catalyst Community workforce, especially if Catalyst Circle and the proposed DReps are added to the count. \n\nAlthough specific Fund 8 proposals may envision funding community members for their contributions, none of the funded challenges were designed around this objective therefore this challenge will basically take approximately 10% out of the total idea challenge budget to be used for contributor salaries. All of this is quite feasible although based upon the current budget voting methodology phasing in the broader categories using smaller budget numbers might have been more effective.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The variety of required metrics and the specifics will need to evolve as the proposal states, \"Part of tracking success for contributors will include improving the reporting and understanding of what a given contributor has worked on to support the ecosystem whilst they have been funded.\" The provided  metrics are very loose and borderline however I rounded up to 4 stars since the proposal acknowledged the issue in the above quote.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_344", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6813, "q0": "The proposal is about how we can make sure that more people get involved in Catalyst and reward them for their efforts to grow Catalyst.  Because of the problems that exist in the current format of Catalyst,  PACE researched for a way that could be more effective than the current one. This Category would house proposals of people who are willing to commit their time to Catalyst. \nTo put it in simple terms, a \"Challenge settings\" where contributors can put their resume. And so the whole community can vote who would be best suited for the job he is applying for within Catalyst. This is a new and refreshing idea that falls within the strategic goals of Catalyst.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "By creating a challenge setting that focuses on attracting contributors to work full time for Catalyst you would create a new stream of people from the community that help grow Catalyst. I am sure there are a lot of community members that are willing to work full time for Catalyst. Just look at the increasing numbers of Community Advisors(CA) we have each round. But this is not only for CA's, but this would also include Plutus engineers, Analysts, Marketing developers, etc. anything that contributes to the project is welcome. \nPACE even provides templates for contributors to submit in this new category if this would get funded. They thought of everything. \nI do have one consideration for PACE towards the budget ranges, they stated that these are provided as guidance but a candidate is not allowed to go about the maximum of 55k for 6 months. Now if you have a well-experienced developer they might want to ask for more. The average maximum for a developer is indeed around 60 hourly rate and this correlates with 55k but if they want to ask more you are limiting a good developer. I will not deduct points for this because it is just a pointer towards PACE.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As stated above the proposal focuses on a category where community members can place job applications for a specific job within Catalyst. PACE made sure to have all the necessary information available for the community to make it easier for them to file an application and create a uniform guideline. \nThe success of this all is followed by looking at the number of contributions to support Catalyst. the success criteria is in line with the problem the proposers aim to solve with this proposal, being bringing more full-time community members into Catalyst. PACE provides certain roles which people can choose from in the GitBook and are even taking into consideration future roles. \nIt's clear to the community by these roles in which part the applicant intends to help out. My only concern here is the actual job there are supposed to do. It's not well described what actual job they will be doing. Are they supposed to fill this in the candidate proposal or will this be decided for them? This is a crucial point that needs more clarification.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_471", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7478, "q0": "This challenge is set to fund full-time contributors to the Catalyst ecosystem, including roles such as Coordination (e.g. SWARM), Analysis (e.g. Victor Corcino and others) or QA/audition (e.g. QA-DAO). It is part of a bigger holistic set of proposals put forth by the PACE team who have worked in a co-creative process with the community members during town halls and through Telegram groups, gathering feedback and from as many as possible. This has resulted in 7 challenges that seek to be non-overlapping and that cover all types of proposals that one can imagine. The idea is that this will remove strategic elements of where to submit a proposal and it also avoid stifling of competition due to challenges only be reserved for a very narrow set of proposals.\nThe alignment score is set based on two sets of metrics that define whether a given challenge is critical to achieving Cardano\u2019s mission: the fund9 strategic goals and the guiding questions for challenge setting.\n\nStrategic goals. This is something that will solidify the professionalism of Catalyst but will not necessarily lead to the open sourcing of the ecosystem. However, it still highlights a great advantage that Cardano/Catalyst has over existing open source style initiatives like Wikipedia, Linux or Wikileaks, namely that we have a treasury to fund people to work full time in a very different manner (not requiring donations/rich sponsors). The contributors will be a key pillar of the open-source infrastructure. The last strategic goal relates to growth of the dapp and developer ecosystem. This is addressed to some extent given that people can apply to become contributors as developers and to work on product and design. \n\nGuiding questions. When it comes to the guiding questions, this may attract people from outside the main Catalyst community, for example the CNFT or stakepool operators, as they now have an opportunity to get funding to turn their hobby into a profession. As a general spring board for adoption, this challenge is not really as strong as it primarily relates to building the infrastructure needed to make Catalyst to become the first truly decentralised VC fund. \n\nAs a CA/vCA from the past two funds, I have seen the need for greater professionalism and predictability for contributors who do work for the ecosystem. This challenge is crucial to enable that.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Many community members have already been able to transition to make Cardano/catalyst their job. We have the SWARM team, QA-DAO as well as Catalyst Circle Admin teams being some early examples of this on top of the many developers who are now working on Catalyst funded proposals full-time, leaving their old jobs. This is a development we want to lean into, but with a model that more explicitly ties funding to the person, rather than the projects, which eliminates some uncertainty and gives these individuals more freedom to contribute in all types of ways. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As this challenge is of a different type that other challenges, the metrics are also different. Scope and type of job one can do differ a lot but the challenge specifies that there should be weekly progress reports on what they have been working on in the community as well as KPIs similar to normal proposals. \n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the PACE team has drafted a guide for how Catalyst contributor candidate proposals should be assessed as well as other detailed concerns such as what information should be included in a proposal, what minimum number of contributors they seek for each role and guidance on salary requests. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_582", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "importance": "Catalyst needs more community members working full time in the ecosystem so it can reach its potential", "success": "Catalyst community members solving important problems are funded so they can continue providing high impact"}
