Education about blockchain (specifically Cardano) is mission critical as it could ensure a steady influx of users (and community members) over a prolonged period of time. By keeping the challenge setting broad and not focussing on a specific region in the world, accessibility increases for everyone. Especially with the intent of incorporating this into the traditional educational system. To be able to use something, you first need to et to know that it exists and how it works and if Cardano can put its name under that, that would be a huge PR-boost. Last, I\u2019d like to add something that Aristotle once said and is applicable to this challenge setting proposal, but in a good way: \u201cEducation is the political tool with which the lawmaker can ensure that future citizens will share the same political values.\u201d. Think about it. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers are mostly a group of known and experienced entities in Project Catalyst (WADA, SWARM, Catalyst School and LATAM) and that holds some weight. Unfortunately, it is not communicated in the challenge setting proposal if these entities would send a representative to seat in the challenge team. So part of that weight goes lost due to that. The nature of this challenge setting proposal does not allow to produce results in just 6 months, but the strategy to play this game on the long run will surely pay off once the students that are ubject to approved proposals become independent adults in need to take charge of their own finances. By helping to shape education on a global level, the potential to find a variety of solutions in many parts of the world is vast. This is why many of our community members onboarded. To make a change for the future and make the world a better, more advanced place. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Because of the nature of the challenge setting proposal and enabling operations for a prolonged period of time (years ), there will also be a need to find a way how to track and audit the produced funded proposals over a prolonged period of time. And quite intensely to make sure that funding destined for these projects actually gets used for their intent. What I was looking for, but haven\u2019t found is some sort of plan how the challenge team could ensure such permanence and oversight. So I feel that a neutral stance on this aspect of the challenge setting is appropriate.

Consequently, I fully support the alignment of the objective of this challenge with the mission of Cardano. If you look at this challenge in relation to the strategic goals for fund 9, it fits well with the goal of preparing a group of people to contribute to the ecosystem, and I would also say that indirectly it will help accelerate the growth and evolution of the ecosystem of development and application. This challenge setting could be improved by including within the considerations for proposers the requirement for projects to be open source or at the very least included within the strategic plan of each proposal. My score for this section is 5.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As I analyze the challenge setting, and based on my experience in the Catalyst community over the past 4 funds, I would be able to say that we have seen many initiatives that have attempted to improve education, and have done so in different ways, some global, some focused on a specific area, so I am confident about our ability to address the challenge. At the same time, I also believe that by the nature of this challenge's very configuration, it is possible that there could be overlaps with other challenges, since I believe that at this stage, education is a cross-cutting theme within the Catalyst community. As a result, my score for this section is 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As far as the metrics of success proposed by the challenge team are concerned, they seem appropriate to me. They aim to increase the participation of developing areas, increase diversity, increase the diversity of language among developers, and to increase the scale of initiatives aimed at closing educational GAPs. My understanding is that these can be easily measured and can serve as a guide for potential proposers in defining their own respective metrics. These metrics will also help the community when it comes to evaluating, voting and auditing. As such, I agree from a verifiability standpoint.
