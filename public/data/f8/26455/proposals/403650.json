Based on the brief section, you can understand the focus that the author is trying to convey with this challenge. From that perspective, I agree with it and find it aligned with the goals of Cardano. In terms of compliance with the strategic goals for the next challenge I find indirect compliance in the sense that if it seeks to improve collaboration for a better distribution of focus and resources helps the growth and strengthening of the ecosystem, however, I would recommend the author to review the challenge setting so that they can make a direct association with the strategy, if possible with more than one goal. Based on my previous analysis, I assign a score of 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Although the community generally puts a lot of effort into trying to improve the gaps that are associated with Catalyst governance, from the perspective of feasibility, I am concerned that there are several challenges that could overlap with this challenge, and this could result in a community's capacity being spread across a number of challenges and as a consequence fail to respond at the level that is expected. This dispersion in community capacity may also result in treasury resources not being allocated in the most efficient way possible.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The success criteria for the challenge are clearly defined with the right focus, and they fulfill their function of providing guidance to potential applicants seeking funding through this challenge.

Nowadats, many proceses are manual, done in excel spreadsheet or with no stadanrd template and having the right set of tools can help to optimze community time.\nI also see that the intention of this challenge is to create tool for communities outside Cardano. This is also great because will spread the knowledge of Cardano and its take its full potential in improving peoples life to the world.\n\nChallenge is also aligned with F9 strategic goals of \"Accelerate the growth and evolution of developer & app ecosystem\" and \"Turn Cardano into an open source project\".\n\nIt is also good that examples of problems to be resolved are provided here.\nI'd also here, in the examples, some tools that were already developed by community and that are being widely used by Catalyst and other communities. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As I mentioned in the impact, plenty of tools and services were already developed by community so there's no doubt that new and better ones could be proposed and implemented. \nAs its not mentioned any established proposal  team, I will consider it doesnt exist yet and score the feasibility as 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There are clear and measureble metrics for the challenge.

Coordinating work, ideas and initiatives among so many people can be chaos without frameworks, tools and auxiliary services. Without tools, the very work that community advisors (the people who are writing these assessments) do would be less productive, something that today could harm the entire project Catalyst voting model, so the use of tools is something complementary but of great importance for Catalyst and Voltaire being able to advance.\n\nAlthough this challenge does not have such a strong connection with the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals, there is a relevant relationship with the three items, since the creation/use of tools usually ends up having an open source approach, it also involves people to work in a close to the development of Catalyst and with potential to contribute with dapps and the development ecosystem", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The development of tools and services has been going on since Catalyst's inception and dozens of people are or have contributed to it.

However, it is not obviously making Cardano an open-sourced ecosystem. Moreover, it is only accelerating the developer and dapp ecosystem insofar as it significantly improves the proposer experience. \n\nAs a proposer who has gotten funded in f6, f7 and is proposing in fund8, and CA/vCA since fund6, I don\u2019t see that there is such a great gap between what tooling could exist and what currently exists.

This has been shown by the catalyst school amongst other community initiatives. With that said, however, it is unlikely that the community will have enough ideas so as to fill up at $500k budget. Moreover, many of the problems with the process have been solved effectively through grassroots community efforts in collaboration with the IOHK teams responsible for the Catalyst process. Changes to the ideascale UI has been made and challenge teams are also paid to improve the process. It is therefore highly feasibile in the sense that it is already being done to a very large extent!
