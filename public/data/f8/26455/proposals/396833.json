While there are and have been geographical Challenges aimed at this, including Cardano\u00b4s traditional focus on Africa, the matter of the fact is that the other side of this focus must be raising social awareness and aiding social entrepreneurs who employ Cardano to help them reach their goals. In this sense, social enterprises that can make the world a better place at the same time as help onboard projects and members throughout the world deserve the support of the Cardano Community.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have a history of engagement with the Community and multiple proposals already submitted, always centered on social engagement as an area ripe for Cardano development, as well as with stakepool operation.

I rate alignment based on two sets of metrics: the fund9 strategic goals and the guiding questions for challenge setting.\n\nThis challenge prepares groups of people to contribute to the ecosystem but only not indirectly addresses the other two strategic goals (albeit to some extent app development). To some extent it may help open sourcing, but only insofar as business choose that route. It is however,  something that could be a springboard for broader adoption if it succeeds. Existing businesses will onboard their users to Cardano and hence gain wider adoption. It is also something that is likely to gain voter\u2019s engagement because social missions motivate people. Hence this challenge receives the full 5 stars.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The funding request is moderate in size, $500k, and given the popularity of Business solutions and the many mission-driven proposals I have seen as a CA from the past two funds, I believe there is capacity in the community to meet this challenge. Numerous examples in the community including littercoin, Waya, World Mobile and Empowa illustrate this power of the Cardano community - which is sure to spill over and attract projects and teams across the world with similar ambitions. The proposing team include both a single stake pool operator with research background and an active CA community contributor Tomi Astikainen who has extensive experience in strategic management consulting. I am fuly confident that they would constitute an excellent challenge team sheparding teams in this challenge! ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They offer 5 key metrics.

Moreover, they also include recommendations for proposers in a very detailed manner, e.g. \u201cIt is recommended that the proposers include a \"triple bottom line\", measuring impact on People, Planet and Profits.\u201d and that measurement should be done over time: now, short term, long term.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_582", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "I have been fascinated by the subject of social enterprises for a long time. I believe that the key to human survival is promoting the growth of businesses that seek to contribute to society with a balanced approach to the welfare of individuals, societies, and the planet. Given that Cardano aims to be a social and financial operating system that will enable the construction of alternatives to traditional financial services, it is evident that the two are aligned. I would recommend that the team improve the description of the challenge question, as it appeared that it would only be relevant to the Catalyst ecosystem when Cardano as an ecosystem in general has the potential for impact sought. In fact, the question asked in the challenge brief would be more appropriate as the first question. A second element that would enhance this challenge would be the inclusion of potential directions that potential proposers can pursue, since this is a new challenge and it would be appropriate to give a more specific direction. As for the alignment with the strategic goals, I can see a distinct alignment with regard to the metric that seeks to prepare people to contribute to the ecosystem, as well as with regard to the evolution of the development ecosystem. Having said that, regarding the rationale given by the challenge team in regards to the open source topic, I believe that a more significant effort could have been made in the description of the challenge settings, so that there is a more explicit alignment regarding the requirements of potential challenge proposers.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is a lot of experience in the Catalyst and Cardano community in general. Actually, I believe that we already have several use cases within the community that fit the requirements of this challenge, so in terms of our capacity to address it, I don't anticipate any difficulties. A further positive aspect is that there are already two people as part of the challenge team in case the challenge is selected. Concerning the budget requested to be allocated to the challenge, I must admit that I would have allocated a little less in order to test the responsiveness of the community, while at the same time having a moderate budget to limit the risk of inefficient allocation of resources. However, I generally agree from the standpoint of feasibility. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The definition of success criteria seems appropriate to me, however, the set of success metrics could have been specified more clearly since many of them are not measurable.
