We realized that many games that aim to use the NFT concept end up putting the business side of the game ahead of other aspects that should come first such as the game's story, mechanics and gameplay. The project in question does not encounter this problem, as the main idea is to directly use the concept of NFT to build items with different rarities and complexities.\n\nAnd as the result of this method can impact several other projects, as raw material for other creations is being built here, there is a possibility of creating a considerable impact on the visibility of the use of Cardano. Given the innovative and even somewhat abstract concept, we can certainly see that there is an inherent risk associated with executing the project. But the amount requested is not that high: $9,999. We will then analyze whether this risk can be mitigated with the proposal execution strategy.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "One of the great advantages that we see in relation to information about the feasibility of the project is that the professionals involved understand how the idea is different and how collaboration with different parties is necessary to bring the project to life. In this context, a positive point is the understanding of the need for the participation of artists, developers and people responsible for marketing in the project. The existence of a community engaged around the proposal would be perhaps the most important point of the proposal, because it would be useless to execute the project very well, that is, the creation of several marketable items, if people did not know these items and if they there was no target audience.\n\nWe see that the team understands this well and organized the budget accordingly. Looking at the breakdown of the budget, we realize that the largest capital allocation, $4999, goes directly to marketing, about 50% of total capital. And that makes a lot of sense in this project. Another very relevant factor of the proposal is that the goals to be achieved in the short, medium and long term were defined. These goals start with simpler goals and move on to more complex concepts. Perhaps the most interesting goal is found in the mid-term proposals, when the team aims to create a collaboration with other gaming projects that use blockchain. In fact, a game that adopts this proposal may end up adding more value to its gameplay, as the items sold were generated by other people, which is much more interesting than products simply inherent to the original game.\n\nThe professionals involved in the proposal seem to have the necessary technical requirements to start the evolution of this project, but it would be interesting if curricula had been made available so that the cited experiences could be verified.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There are several positive points around the project as mentioned above, mainly given its innovative character. We realize, however, that the ways to measure the evolution of Metahagane are not very well defined. We see that the central focus to measure the engagement around the game is the observation of the initiative of people in coming to contribute to the project during the fund 8. However, this seems to be a very loose way to define if the project is being successful or not; even this initial analysis may not necessarily mean that the primary engagement pattern will be maintained in the future.\n\nThus, it would be more interesting to point out some indications to measure the evolution of the project in the future, such as the number of items being created weekly, the interest of other games in joining the project or a number of followers to be reached on social networks. .", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 3, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1610, "q0": "The proposal presents an idea to build a game where players will have the power to create in-game assets. The developer only provides the tools through packages sold in the game, and players will create content and assets through the combination of the components included in this package. I rate it as positive when players unleash their creativity, not being confined within a framework. Detailed gameplay mechanics, enough elements to attract players. However, the proposal has not carefully assessed the level of risk challenges. The challenge is not only from the player's acceptance, it is also whether you can create more tools for players to create more in the future, or the risk of the hardware system.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "A sketchy development roadmap, not really clearly stating what needs to be done in the near future, when it will be done. The spending budget is not reasonable, not including the cost to maintain the server, not including the budget to encourage the player community. In addition, the information about each member of your team is not clear and transparent, there is no link to the individual profile of each member.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Success measured by the number of players participating in the game is not enough.

We\u2019ve been provided with a fairly sufficient description of features and interactive activities that in theory should guarantee some quality gaming time. Aside from the fact that this game utilizes ADAs, a property of the Cardano blockchain, I really dig the aspect of players being able to forge and name their own weapons and crafts and further access other formulas for an even more impressive inventory, celebrating the creativity and integrity of each. There\u2019s also the factor of limiting the supply of raw NFT materials that players could make use of, ensuring balance for all enjoyers.\nThe metrics listed in the proposal have been thoroughly and carefully illustrated, and I find them to be relevant and close to the aspiration that this challenge sets out. However, I find myself quite muddled at the section of possible challenges to the problem, mainly because the one that the proposer brings up is also the ultimate goal of this challenge, given that the aforementioned content has been convincing to me. That being said, the proposal does enclose a viable solution to eliminate, or at least mitigate, the problem, albeit rather dependent on the approval of the funding.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "From what I\u2019ve seen in this regard, the proposal consists of the desired milestones that the project wishes to achieve at 3 different time marks with a shared ambition of growing a community where different sections of participants may be entertained from a wide array of features. Even though I would prefer a detailed road map containing details of stages of the development process as that should give the community a better outlook on the project, I would argue that these provided milestones are just as effective. Hence, the requested budget should justify itself abundantly. The existing team members are enclosed with respective duties and appropriate expertise to the project, though I would prefer the inclusion of something else to verify them more elaborately, such as dedicated website links.  Nonetheless, I imagine that for an ambitious project such as this one, It should take more than 2 members to bring about the fancied outcome.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "According to my comprehension of this matter, I believe that while the proposal has listed relevant evaluation criterions, It would benefit greatly from the addition of tracking tools such as ClickUp, as they allow the community and investors to follow closely on the project, ensuring clarity and integrity of the project. As for the envisioned success, I feel as if the part where the Cardano ecosystem considerably reaps benefits from this project has been left out. So even though Metahagane \u201coriginates\u201d from Cardano, as stated in previous sections, I strongly advise that the proposal emphasizes the great benefit that the benefit should expect to return to the mother blockchain.

From here, readers can grasp the basic operating mechanism of the game. Based on the given KPIs, we can see that the proposal is quite suitable for the challenge.\nHowever, the KPIs should have been quantified. The risk section is sketchy and there are no in-depth solutions to the problem. The writer can go deeper into the risk section as well as analyze and give specific measures. Case studies and examples can be reviewed to further clarify these measures.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In general, the roadmap of the proposal is shown with specific timelines until December 2023. \nHowever, the results at each point in time are quite brief and do not have quantitative as well as detailed information on how to implement these results. \nMarketing fee in the budget section is quite high compared with other, I think it would be better if the author added details of the sections and arranged them accordingly to the above roadmap. So that the reader can figure out the detail on those sections. \nBesides, with the information about the members, I think I have not been able to understand them and how their experience is related to this field. If possible, the author should add detailed information related to the members' experience (Profile, featured products, work experience) and attach some proof documents.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Unfortunately, the auditability section is described quite abstractly without specific quantitative KPIs with timelines.\nThis makes it very difficult for the community to track the progress of the project when it is funded.\nThe writer needs to add the quantitative indicators that the project will achieve at a fixed time so that the community can follow and understand the way the writer measure the project. For example: Total of number of CNFTs made specifically for gaming in each month. In addition, the time to report the results as well as the search method should also be added to this section.\nIn addition, the description of the success of the project is still general, there are no criteria for the community to determine whether this project has been successful or not.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1674", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4272, "q0": "The proposer has revealed much detailed information of the project which is Metahagane \u2013 a NFT trading card game, so that readers can know exactly about what they are going to make in this project.

I personally think they have done pretty well in the part of describing how their proposed solution would address the challenge, because they have given out some outcome which aligned with the challenge\u2019s key metrics such as: total users of gaming based applications building/built on Cardano, number of gaming based applications building/built on Cardano, amount of value made by gamers in play-to-earn applications, etc. About the risks in the future, the team has foreseen them and as I can see from the proposal, they have already thought about possible solutions for the problem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal has provided pretty detailed plan and timeline for the project, readers will find it easy to know what tasks they are going to do to complete the project.

Throughout the proposal, all of the project's characteristics and points are well covered. By reading and picturing, I can clearly sense the project's attraction, and as a result, this game will play a significant role in encouraging game players to join the Cardano ecosystem and use ADA. The indicators for trading and collecting NFT are quite clear and appealing ((Each packet includes 7 NFTs that are each sold for 7 ADA, implying that the minimum value of each NFT is 1 ADA. Within the first season of the game, there are 8 consumable NFT cards and 19 constructed NFT cards, for a total of 27 NFTs in the collection.) This is not only a game, but it can also be used to boost people's revenue. Playing to make money is appealing enough. To discuss the difficulties and solutions, we would want to have more description about technical concerns. For example, how will you deal with design or code issues? How do you cope with risks like as publication or hacking? To sum up, your concept guarantees a decent game that can typically align the challenge setting.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "it is excellent that the team has established the short-term, mid-team, and long-term goals. We will, however, require you to be more specific about the work that has to be accomplished in each step of the project. You must also detail the technical features of the project, such as the programming language, marketing and promotional plans for the game, software used in the project, and so on. Furthermore, the budget plan is still not sufficiently clear and phased. You must have precise elements on the amount of money to be spent on each task. Also, as you suggested using Cardano YouTube Influencers in your promotional campaign, what advertising channels would you utilize? What KPIs or software do you use to manage the campaign's effectiveness? Existing team member information has been provided and is fairly adequate for the duties you wish to complete, but we will need further proof about these people to validate them. You can add additional Linkedin profiles, projects, or products completed by them. Furthermore, you should have an exact number and intention for the employees you want to hire, as well as a strategy for having a successful recruitment plan while meeting the project's requirements.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "i recommend that the team be more precise about the techniques that will be used to assess the efficacy of the proposal. Likewise, clear data on the project's completion, such as the actual finish time compared to the plan, the number of gamers joining, and the response to the advertising campaigns, must be mentioned properly. Furthermore, the amount of project success derived from gaming experiences must be improved and linked with particular metrics of ecosystem participants, level of public awareness about Cardano and ADA usage.
