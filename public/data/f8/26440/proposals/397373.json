Miverse concept and game design looks attractive and promissing to retain players with the game. I agree with proposers that many NFT games are not having good art and graphic design and just mimic traditional game idea. I have a strong belief the team can create nice NFT games in their multimerve design that have considerable contribution to growth of Cardano ecosystem. To make the game more attractive and entertaining to players, I would suggest the team to  add the regular daily, weekly missions with rewards to players, allow players to form their team to fight with others.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "According to provided link to project team profile, they have successfully developed many game projects with millions of users.

The solution is to make higher quality and fun games to really enjoy and entertain, not only for only earning. I think this is an interesting idea and has the potential to attract a large number of users to the Cardano ecosystem.\nThe presentation of the problem of the proposal team is very clear and detailed. This gives the viewers a clear overview of the issues covered in the proposal. The explanation of the project's concept also allows the viewers to visualize the project's image. The proposers have identified the main components of the project. The object that the project aims to be concretized is Play-to-entertain gamers. The plans are also to attract these audiences. The Solution section of the project is divided into small sections and presented very easily. The way the project works is also described in great detail, showing the impact of the project on potential audiences.\nThe project promises to produce results in phases. The proposed stages are presented in detail for each goal. The project's and the proposal's KPIs are also in sync with the key metrics of the challenge and also explain this matching.\nOverall, the project team identified 5 main challenges. Each challenge has provided a solution. With this proposal alone, the team also plans for the risks that may be faced in the near future with well-prepared solutions.

The proposed budget is quite reasonable with the general plan. The spending plan is presented in tabular form. Items to be invested are listed specifically with appropriate spending levels.\nThis project is jointly implemented by 3 companies in 3 important areas contributing to the project construction.

If i am permitted , i will suggest that the team can apply for funding for each phase which will lower the requested amount drastically and gives this proposal a much better chance of being funded considering other proposals in this challenge.\nI will be giving 5 star as the proposal satisfied every request for this section according to the CA guidelines.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As stated earlier , due to the amount of information packed in this proposal  it makes assessing it look lazy because this proposal provided every information with links to more materials to successfully audit this proposal to completion.\nI really hope this project gets funded as one can see the hard-work put into just this proposal.\nI am giving 5 star.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_331", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8090, "q0": "The \"Metaverse of Play-to-Entertain Gamer\" proposal addresses the Gamers on-chained well by focusing on Play-to-Entertain gamer.

The team prefers not to sell NFT assets in early phases of game development. The links the team provided for their Miverse concept and future work don't work properly.

More than that, the detailed content of this proposal is enough to provide the current and future plans that they want to know, including the goals, the concept of the whole business that we provided at the beginning of this proposal, components in our project in the solution section... so I think that the assessor didn't read it carefully. \nFEASIBILITY \nWe calculate our workload mostly on the man-hour, man-month and taking the salary of $3.000 at the average rate for a senior developer. This is the way any professional game house will do to assess the workload to their client. More than that, not just summarize the budget in the limited space of this proposal, we also attached a detailed file to show them in detail, and also show the relationship between our proposals. All of them are transparent that even the community can use other professional game studios to assess it. But the assessor judged that it was not enough. So I think the assessor just assesses without any reasonable evidence but just feeling. \nMoreover, the assessor should show more info to tell voters how much feasibility our proposal is with other components. But he just focused on our budget only, with unreasonable comments. \nAUDITABILITY \nThe last thing for me to suggest filtering out this assessment is that they didn't read carefully our content. We attached the link to tools to help the community track and trace our progress that I believe many other assessors saw - also the content point to the link clearly is \"in the link here.\" But the assessor didn't care about it in his comment. That link can help him know that our provided link in the proposal is wrong and fixed in it. \n\nOverall, I believe that this assessor is not reading the content carefully enough to assess our proposal. And also provide some nonsense comments to help assess our proposal to help voters make accurate decisions.
