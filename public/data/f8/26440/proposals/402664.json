The project is described in great detail, but this results in a flood of information that demands the utmost attention. A compression of the contents would be very helpful for the reader. The actual idea of the game has a very high social demand related to gender equality, social diversity and tolerance. If the game were to find a high level of acceptance among the player community, this would certainly create a noticeable added value for the Cardano ecosystem. However, Cardano is not mentioned enough in terms of the amount of information. CNFT's application and ADA payment options serve as a bridge here. Some of the roadmap elements in this chapter are more likely to be found in the feasibility chapter.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This section lists very briefly what the timetable should look like. However, I do not see any concrete information about a time frame. There are references to Github and Jira for highlighting important milestones, but without active links; this information seems to be reserved for the team.

The proposer has describe the game amazingly detailed. The game catches up with NFT trend, its contents and features are closely related to Cardano so I can confidently say that it strongly aligns with this challenge and has a lot of potential. Through this proposal, I can tell that the team has very deep knowledge about Cardano system and know how to use it as an advantage in this project. The proposer has also addressed clearly its target and its impact on the chosen audience with their reasonable example. And all the audience that the game is aiming to is totally appropriate for the game to achieve its goals and benefit Cardano. Not only does the team has a game idea but also they have a very thorough plan with human resources, marketing strategies, contests and community building to build a solid foundation for the development of the game in the long run. The foreseeable challenge and risks are addressed realistically and very comprehensively. However I don\u2019t find that the team has a direction to solve the problem and in case, those problems actually raise, it\u2019ll effect the project big time. I would suggest the team to discuss it more", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In term of  feasibility, the plan is outlined with clear milestones and those milestones seem to follow closely with the plan. All team members have some certain relevant solid skills and experiences and it will definitely contribute a lot to the success of this project. However I would suggest the team to work on an est. time to achieve these milestones, that way will be easier to follow up with the whole plan. The budget breakdown is built on working hours and it\u2019s a fair point. I find that those expenses are reasonable, but to make it better, it should be align with your working timeline. It\u2019s better to help the community have a justification of the requested amount", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team has a very completed introductions of the measurement tools and the community can use it as a reliable source to find if it can be audited fairly. It\u2019s a huge plus point here. However, I don\u2019t find a lot of KPIs to audit this project? Every project needs to have its clear KPIs with time-related target for the auditor and the team themselves to have a regular check-up. I don\u2019t think this part is done properly here. If the team can come up with a clear KPI goals, it\u2019ll be more effective in helping the auditor to decide if it\u2019s a success.

Their plan and timeline was also clearly and fully displayed in the proposal.

Thanks to that, they will focus on building brands on Google, Facebook, and a few other social platforms such as Twitter, .\nPart four will run regular contexts to expand the userbase and will reward good and meaningful ideas that help grow the community.\nFinally, the important part for them is community building. They want the community to be built on a solid foundation, safety, and mutual respect.

The proposal has included a roadmap that is interesting: lending of assets, auto matchmaking, currency integration, etc. But while the team members have impressive backgrounds, it is a little concerning to see no one specialising in game development.
