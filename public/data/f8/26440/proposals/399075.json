Simply, the proposer wants to disrupt the traditional education system. \nWith the impact of this proposal, Konma wants to break education boredom by the introduction of new technologies across education, trading, etc. for every individual to upskill while playing; educating community members while they get rewards in various ways across eCommerce stores, jobs, etc; a gamified learning management system. \nIn addressing the challenge, Konma Upskill addresses educationin general with regard to educating users across the globe and increasing awareness of the importance of getting upskill through a gamified learning management system. \nThe stated risks are in development(small terms), user retention, incentivizing, and credibility. The proposer provided a solution to these challenges such as building a platform for users to grow relationships among themselves for better collaboration, seeking continuous advice from Cardano community, and opportunities to users, among others. In my opinion, the challenge is effectively addressed.

The overall budget total amount is USD 35,00 which is quite reasonable.\nThe team is made up of 3 people with their LinkedIn profiles attached for quick reference. These 3 people are Rakesh Raveendra  (Head of Konma Upskill), Sargeet Muralidhar (CTO of Konma Labz), Sathya Vijayan (Head of Konma Flair).

This proposal, however, plans to mix them both by picking the exciting essences from them. Involving the users through hackathons, quizzes, games and binding them attractive incentives like tokens will surely draw a lot of \"nerd\" gamers onboard and also help Cardano's gamer community a lot more diverse and powerful.

The team with their brief introduction has the necessary experience and expertise to make this proposal a reality. The community is provided with an elaborate monthly plan and the proposal being only the phase-1 of their journey shows the team's intent to come back in the next rounds with evidence to raise more funds. The milestones set by the team have been carefully crafted and are not overemphasized like a few other proposals in this challenge. Although the funds requested looks very practical, there is no detailed description of the breakdown of the same, and considering the immense amount of work involved in the project, I feel the team might need a few more hands to help them out apart from the 3 members introduced in the proposal.

However, the team makes no mention of valid KPIs to assist the community in the audit process. There is no evident way to make sure that the progress is well within the expectations of the challenge. A few metrics upfront that the auditors could look forward to would have done a great deal for the proposal. However, the success metrics and the final goals the team intends to achieve look promising and impactful. The one-stop platform of all kinds of learning and cross-chain attribute is surely something to look forward to.
