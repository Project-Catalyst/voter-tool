In addition, most gamers have no experience in blockchain technology and lack basic knowledge (creating wallet, storing private key, trading assets). \n\nThe proposal is addressing this problem by providing a fun-to-play AR MMORPG that does not require a crypto wallet to start playing. From what I have seen so far this is also one of the first Cardano games that will utilize AR to create an even more immersive gaming experience. This could attract many AR enthusiasts and mobile gamers. The items bought and sold within the game ecosystem can be obtained by playing and progressing in the game. Thus, gamers don\u2019t need to invest in expensive game items if they don\u2019t want to. By doing so, the team is avoiding being perceived as \u201cjust another cash grab\u201d. Nevertheless, obtaining rewards is still possible. \n\nMoreover, since the game was released previously (this will be a re-release), fans of the initial game might be still interesting in playing. Consequently, a fan base might exist. The strategy and idea provided in this proposal sounds reasonable and could in fact lower the entry barrier into the Cardano ecosystem as anyone can start playing the game without prior knowledge of crypto, NFTs or blockchain. The team assumes that interest in crypto and NFTs (e.g. selling your earned in-game NFTs) will grow organically while people progress in the game. If the team puts enough effort into nurturing this growth and interest, then I am certain that it could keep many gamers on the Cardano blockchain. \nOverall, this proposal aligns very well to this challenge and could help onboarding new gamers to the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The indicated timeline is reasonable given game improvements and blockchain integration will be carried out. Although the timeline is complete, it would have helped to provide more detailed information on some of the individual points, as for instance \u201cAdd gathering\u201d is vague to me. \n\nA budget breakdown is provided, but estimated working hours are missing. The designated funds for the respective work packages make sense but I believe more money needs to be allocated to marketing. Although the budget breakdown is reasonable, the total budget requested is a bit high (94k USD) for this round and challenge (500k USD). The team should consider reducing their budget to increase their chances of being funded. \n\nNo detailed information is provided on the individual team members. While the proposal states a combined experience of 20+ years in different fields, it would have been helpful to indicate the strengths and capabilities of each team member. A good indicator for the feasibility to implement could be that the teams has already published the game previously (showing they are capable in doing so) and are now \u201conly\u201d focusing on improving and integrating blockchain features. The team has several open positions they are looking to fill. As these positions seem quite important (smart contract developer, UX developer), the successful implementation will depend on them as well as the founding team.\n\nOverall, given the reasonable and generous timeline, it is possible that the proposal will be implemented successfully, if experienced developers can be hired and all open positions be filled in time.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Reaching the milestones (as outlined in section 2) will be used to audit the progress. Unfortunately, it is not clear how the development of each of those points will be reported. A weekly or bi-weekly progress update would be useful. A Github repository is provided (at the top of the proposal) but the proposal does not emphasize on it and does not state whether code developments can be tracked there. The team should have given more information on code commits and technical developmental updates. Since no clear reporting system is described and no communication channels are indicated, auditing the progress seems challenging. \n\nAchieving the above-mentioned milestones will be one of the metrics to assess the success. Importantly, the proposal gives concrete numbers about active users before and after the launch. This is an important KPI to determine the interest in the game and the success of it. For the future, the teams want to measure success based on the growth of the player base and the treasury system. Unfortunately, no specific numbers were stated. \n\nAltogether, the team has some good attempts on how the progress and success of the proposal can be assessed. However, a good reporting system or communication channels are missing, making the audit possible but challenging.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1939", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 389, "q0": "The game represented by the proposal in question has several positive characteristics that increase its chances of success. Among these, we realize that it is a previously completed project, so it was not created purely for commercial purposes, a path that many NFT games end up following and not achieving success. In addition, it has an interesting premise of making the player move around the world in search of treasures and new items and seems to have a plot that captivates players to remain in the game; from what has been explained, it is also possible to play it with or without the purchase of NFT's.\n\nWe can thus see that this proposal is in line with the goals of the challenge, to bring more players to the Cardano ecosystem, and has the chance to positively impact the ecosystem, since it is expected that a portion of the players will create wallets for in-game purchases. One factor that leaves some doubt in the air here is about the requested budget. According to the statement, the game is ready and the goal would be to integrate blockchain features. In this way, the $94,000 budget seems pretty high.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The premise of the game seems quite interesting, the possibility for the player to buy areas and progressively gather materials to build maps and search for treasures make us believe in the potential of the project and in its viable success. But as mentioned before, and according to the budget breakdown, it seems that a very significant amount will still need to be spent. It was also said at the beginning of the proposal that the game was launched and withdrawn from the market so that the blockchain features could be inserted, but as it was also stated that the main objective of the game is not to generate transactions, there is a doubt as to why the project has not been time in the air for it to be previously validated?\n\nThe main professional involved in the project, Andreas, has a very rich curriculum in the computational area, and in the stackoverflow it is possible to find the projects in which he has been involved over the last few years, a very positive factor for the project's viability. But another aspect that doesn't generate so much confidence is that we can't easily see who are the other professionals involved in the project or their resumes. Most of the other positions are still open and it is known that one of the most defining factors for a game to be successful is its own personality, which facilitates the existence of an engaged community around it over time. With many positions on the team that still need to be filled, we are in doubt if the game will be able to find people who bring this trait to the game.\n\nRegarding the allocations of the total amount being requested, we have as a positive point the amount of capital being allocated to marketing, one of the most important investments today for the success of a game. However, the total spend on UI/UX + Graphics/Media (totaling $30,000) seems a bit high for a game that has already been released. But we noticed a good organization of the actions to be followed in the feasibility plan, we see that they are clearly arranged and organized into quarters, also taking into account the testing of alpha and beta versions before the game's launch.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As for the auditability of the project, we see that this seems to be the most complete section of the proposal, as great indicators to understand the success of the game were chosen. These parameters include good quantitative metrics such as the expected number of players not only in the final version, but also in the beta version. In addition, to understand the engagement of the game, the number of followers on social networks is also monitored.\n\nAn also relevant point for the visibility of a game is whether or not it appears in the main specialized media on the subject, and this factor is also being taken into account here. The team has even been concerned about balancing the game as it becomes more popular.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3579, "q0": "After having read thoroughly, I must say I am genuinely impressed with this proposal, as it is very well-written, the intention is clear and straightforward, and the methodology proves to be efficient. And even though Mobile AR games are not uncommon nowadays, the game genre, gameplay mechanism, open world setting, players\u2019 capabilities and interactive activities inside the game are highly fascinating and stimulating. I really dig the fact that other than exploring and enjoying the content of a new virtual world, players are advised to pick the most valuable zones to mark as their territories and generate a profitable plan to extract other players\u2019 income, requiring them to tap into their creative thinking skills, and that this is a full game where players don\u2019t have to make further in-game purchases in exchange for a complete experience. Speaking from my experience as a gamer, the part that I love the most is that this game is ad-free, since any game can really be ruined by ads. \n\nNow with the suggested integration of a Cardano wallet, NFTs and token functionality to the game, I believe this proposal belongs in the challenge setting of adopting more gamers to the Cardano ecosystem. The proposal also succeeds in addressing its main challenges, along with the enclosure of plausible solutions. The proposer also presents his wish to continue developing the game even further, which goes to show his dedication and commitment to the project.\n\nThe only thing that I would add is perhaps the inclusion of key metrics in figures. For instance, there should be an approximated number of players hopping back into the game after the public launch, some real-life readings of how much players were able to earn before by playing the game and how those numbers would transition to the new version of the game or how many NFTs will be made especially for the game.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Kudos to the team for managing to deliver such a specific plan and timeline for the development of the game, in which I am surprisingly pleased to see the appearance of Stage 0 and a possible shortening of the timeline in the proposer\u2019s comments, which means the proposer must have put a lot of consideration and calculations when they were devising.\nThe requested budget looks to be reasonable, and all stages of the budget breakdown consist of adjoining expenses. And I commend the proposer for listing down the companies they work with, what duties they hold and website links to demonstrate their legitimacy, while also not dropping off the fact that they\u2019re hiring personnel. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I agree that the project does possess some form of clarity, as illustrated with the use of a road map and social metrics to evaluate progress. And the KPI metrics and idealized success laid out are clear  futureproof and also look to benefit the Cardano ecosystem as a whole.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1664", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3756, "q0": "The Impact part is well written.

This will reduce the barriers to entry for gamers.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From the description of the project, I think the project can meet the outline. The project has a detailed plan lasting from the first quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2023, including 6 phases. These stages are described quite easy to understand. The team members section is also described quite fully including existing positions, intended positions, profiles, information of outsourced service providers, reference websites.\nThe budget section is currently divided into 7 sections, but it is still quite brief. It would be better if the author could describe more specifically what the cost items include (Labor, hours performed, unit price, assets,...)", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The success of the project is presented in an easy-to-understand manner, the criteria to determine the completion of the project's goals are shown clearly and quantitatively (reached 10 000+ active users and at least half to be mainstream gamers).\nThe way measure project progress include 6 phases and with specific targets, however, there is still a lack of quantitative KPIs for these indicators and ways in which the community can follow project tracking.

More often than not, players play multiple scavenger games at once to make up for one trip. So getting new players and competition are not big issues.\n2. The project is developed on a published game. This is a good start and less risky compared to those who start from scratch.\n3. The idea of giving players the option to play as a regular game or play to earn. This makes the game looks more inviting to a well established community hence more players. And if they see the earning potential, players can switch to play to earn anytime.\n\nI think the proposer could elaborate more about ways in which players can materialize their in-game properties since there are a lot of them such as artifacts, zones, loots .... Will there be market place? What token will be used? etc \u2026", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provided portfolio of the company showing previous projects. While there are relevant projects such as Crypt Cards, most of them are not creditable due to broken links. There is no way to verify whether they work or even exist.\nThe team makes it clear that this is a 6-stage project. Each plan has a brief description about what action will be taken. The proposer mentioned that a significant part of fund will be spent on marketing and promotion. Assuming graphics/media is a part of marketing, $35000 could be reasonable as the team stated. Despite its importance, only one action point of the entire project dedicated for marketing which is \u201ccreate awareness of the project\u201d .. in stage 0. I highly suggest the team provide more insight to this section or even better, make a separate plan for marketing with its own KPIs.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "there are steps in each stage for the team to assess the project themself. I feel that more could be elaborated in terms of communication with the community. For instance, providing details on how community members and voters can keep track of development progress.

That way, the game can attract a wider range of gamers to come to Cardano. The idea is described in details and it explains a lot why it\u2019s a suitable project to run on Cardano and how it uses Cardano resources at its best. The team promises the game is free and no adds with a bunch of functions that I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll give gamers a good feelings trying it at the early stage. The one problem I found here is it\u2019s only built on Android, it might be a little disadvantage but you have time to work on it and find a solution to expand it on other system as well. One other thing I would like the team to discuss more is the marketing campaign idea to solve the problem that they have addressed \u201cmake sure we relay the message that this is not a cash grab game since this is often the main concern for mainstream gamers when they hear about a crypto/NFT game\u201d. Because if the team plans to spend a significant part of the fund on marketing and promotion, they should at least have some suggested directions/channels to make the amount request more reasonable.

What I mean here, maybe giving each task a deadline, then it can be easier to follow up each phase. However, the overall timeline is aligned with the project and every task seems to be covered well. One thing that I find it\u2019s missing here is still a marketing related tasks.

I liked the general concept, the project proposal, and the overall stated activities and milestones sounded like a reasonable notion to me, not only for the desired investment value but also for the overall project proposal. The game does a fantastic job of meeting the challenge's requirements. The goal is to make an NFT, which is a game in which players can explore a never-ending, randomly generated virtual layer of our world that is both persistent and ever-changing. I thought it was fascinating because this game is aimed at everyone, including youngsters. If the project works, it will serve as a good introduction to the Cardano ecosystem for new users, and perhaps even the parents of children who play the game will be interested in learning more about our blockchain.

And, of course, they've worked on similar projects before; one of the team members already has a website up and running with a variety of content. They provide a roadmap, divided into six stages, on which we can track what happens over time as we work toward our final goal. The authors perfectly described what would be done, the key phases of the project, and the tiny acts that would result in such phases, as well as how long (in months) each phase would run and the aim that would be achieved during it. This, in my opinion, is an excellent example of how to present the practical portion of a proposal, because I frequently notice that authors are more concerned with revealing the phases that make up the entire project, rather than outlining them and explaining what would happen in each.
