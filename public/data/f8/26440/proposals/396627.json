Cardano aims to promote not only a technological leap, but also to establish positive impacts in several areas for the planet, such as the environment. In this sense, the game intends to work with the protection of clean water, which would be very much in line with this principle of our blockchain. As we are told, in addition to water protection, the game would also aim to protect species and plants and animals, thus intensifying its environmental value. I believe that the proposal also aligns with the specific objectives of the challenge, which are, in general, to create games that can be engaging and make use of Cardano ecosystem technologies, in order to popularize our blockchain. It is said that players would possess a \u201cpiece of nature\u201d in the form of NFT (which logically would be coined in Cardano, thus achieving the specific objectives of the challenge). We also know that some data, such as water purity, would be measured live and networked, so that everyone could have access to such information (and in a non-corruptible way too), which once again meets what the challenge seeks. The main objective of the game, as I understand it, would be survival, through escaping from traps and hunting for supplies. Through these tokens, you would own a piece of nature, benefiting it, and you would also learn more about the ecosystem as a whole: what happens and why. It's a good idea. But one thing that came to my mind about the impact here is why the currency in circulation in the game couldn't be Ada instead of Omimimo. Our blockchain is expanding, and in my view it is important to measure efforts to increase the adoption and circulation of our own currency, rather than creating or financing the use of new types of crypto. The part of the team organizing a physical camp, where players could move around and have the real experience of all this seemed a little disconnected from the rest of the proposal. Where would that be, exactly? The players would cover all the costs of this trip, right? And where would the money go? What activities would be developed in this camp? What would be the impact of this part of the project for Cardano? This part seems to have been included to add value to the proposal (another interesting thing), but it needs a better detail so that we can understand how this would happen and with what objectives. In the proposal, we see this topic addressed in the following excerpt: \u201cQ3-22 real-life visits to Nordic Wild camp. As a holder, you will be able to visit the water it owns, see the real world heritage and spend some time in real nature...\u201d. However, it is a very short explanation and it was not enough to understand exactly how this part of the project would take place. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team starts this part by explaining which phases would make up the game's development, which is necessary to understand how the project creation process would be. I found it very positive that in the first stage, the creation of visual material would be carried out so that the public understands how the game works, in my view this is a great strategy to draw attention and encourage people to play. It would be interesting to understand a little more about this part: where would these materials be released? I would like to see how that would turn out. Furthermore, the phases are divided into blocks of time, where each one of these divisions is composed by the listing in topics of which tasks would be developed. I feel like we can get a solid view of what will happen from the data provided. Another note regarding this division of phases: in phase Q3 22, the team claims that it will be possible to visit the physical camp. Again I touch on this point: where will this be, exactly? We know it's Nordic, but in which city, will this be accessible to the wider audience or is it something more geared towards those who live nearby? Finally, about these phases: they are the best part of the feasibility topic because they allow us to understand exactly what would happen and in what order and what the team's ambitions are for this project. However, when it comes to staff and funding, unfortunately, the same richness of detail is not found. For example, in the explanation of the requested money. The team claims that 12k is required for coding the game, I agree that this work is complex and requires a high investment, the problem is that it is not detailed how this work would be done. It's five weeks into this development, we don't know exactly what would happen in the first, second and so on. It is important to understand who would be doing this, what their work routine is and the small tasks that would result from the whole, the coding of the game. The same is found in the other parts of the budget, the conceptual design for example. How would it be developed? Why would that last 3 weeks? And finally, about the team, I think the proposal lacked detail about who is who, what they do, their resumes, etc. For example, Maria is the creator of the game and advocates for greater inclusion of women in Cardano. But what role would she play here, exactly? What do we know about her curriculum, projects developed previously? We have the \u201cK\u201d, who would provide technical support and be a consultant. First, what is this person's name? What is your professional training? How does he or she relate to Cardano? What kind of consultancy would he/she provide? How can we get proof of your CV? It would be necessary for team members to include more information about themselves, their full names, linkedin profiles (if any), their detailed roles in this project, etc. In this way, more confidence in the team's ability to successfully carry out the project would be conveyed. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team provide us with good data that serve as ways to audit the proposal. Starting with the fact that, in the previous topic, we have divided project phases, with respective tasks about what would happen in each stage. In this way, we are given information about what would happen and when, so it is very possible to monitor whether the activities that were promised were actually being carried out, at the appropriate time and in the right way. And in relation to the final results themselves, here the metrics of success in the short, medium and long term are established. I think it's very positive how the team believes in the project (it has to be that way), setting horizons of success for a very long period, for example, beyond two years, when the game would theoretically be self-sustainable. The objectives are divided with the notion of time according to the months, in which several goals to be achieved are listed, allowing the community to monitor whether what was intended was achieved. For a very complex and expensive project, there needs to be a very accurate and close monitoring, this could be done from a team of professionals who understand both games and our blockchain and its technologies. Ideally, these people could establish direct and periodic contact with those who develop the project, in order to trace an accurate follow-up that can be shared with the rest of the community. It would also be interesting if some representatives of the game were present at Town Hall and presented progressive results, as is already the case with some projects. In general, in my opinion, everything is in line here, the team establishes very well what we need to monitor and what specific goals to achieve (which also includes the wide adoption of Cardano and popularization of the blockchain, fully meeting what is requested in the challenge). \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 338, "q0": "Given the characteristics described by the proposal, we note the existence of several important points for the project to be successful and together lead to greater visibility for the entire Cardano ecosystem. Looking at the uses of blockchain technology for creating NFTs and storing data about nature, we realized that the game has a particular idea.\n\nUnlike other games that also use blockchain technologies in their development, the great distinguishing feature of this game would be the appeal to environmental issues. Therefore, the fact that the items sold in the game have this awareness characteristic makes their eventual success of great importance to the entire Cardano ecosystem.\n\nIt would be possible to see in the future, even, future partnerships with environmental movements that sponsor the game as a source of exposure of the initiative. The budget consists of a considerable amount of capital, but for the success of a game it is necessary to focus not only on development, but also on all its marketing structuring and on maintaining an active and relevant community, which is constantly engaged in debating about the game.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From the description of the professionals involved in the proposal, we realized that some important points for the execution of the project are fulfilled. Describing these, it is possible to note that there is development experience in the technology area by the team, including the name of the developed application being mentioned.\n\nHowever, we were able to notice the fulfillment of not only technological requirements by the team, we also found experience with entrepreneurship and philosophy. Finally, there is still a base of knowledge and interaction of more than two years on the functioning of Cardano and the technologies necessary for the game.\n\nThe stages of development are clearly explained, with funding for each one indicated. The value of each step seems to be consistent with what must be accomplished. An example of this would be that the investment in marketing will take place from Q2 onwards, which seems like a good choice because at that moment there is already a structuring of the front-end and it is easier to advertise a game more visible.\n\nWe also have that capital has been allocated accordingly, with a good part of the funds ($12000 in Q2 and $5000 in Q4) being allocated to game coding, but there is also a considerable allocation to game development ($12000 in Q3) and for other aspects such as the conceptual design and animations of NFT's.\n\nThere is also a suggestion of an organization of project expenditures to possibly aim at a slightly higher allocation for marketing. It is known that today the promotion of a game can end up being as important as its development.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As the game has ambitious goals and a dense development process, it is crucial to follow the delivery of each of the stages described by the creators of the project, especially regarding the demo of the game, which is an essential part of the process so that future stages of the project can draw more attention.\n\nIt is quite expected then that there will be a playable and testable demo. Such gameplay tests can be targeted not only to members of the Cardano community but also to gamers not necessarily familiar with blockchain technology, so that acceptance can be analyzed.\n\nIn addition, it is also important that project professionals who have a greater affinity with the technical part of the technology behind the game periodically demonstrate the expectation of acceptance of NFT's and how much is actually being sold. It would thus be crucial to follow the evolution of the game both in its aspects of a traditional game (how playable and fun the game is) but also in how Cardano's blockchain is making the game more unique.\n\nIn the ideas conveyed by the team in this section, we can find that good milestones are being defined to audit the development, showing that it is well understood where the game intends to go. But it would also be interesting if some quantitative parameters were established. For example, it was mentioned that organic growth of the community is expected, but what would be the number of players to be reached in this initial phase? Regarding the demo, a survey could also be carried out to seek a certain level of average satisfaction from those who tested the game.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 6, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1589, "q0": "A really thoughtful game that can both entertain and educate players, improving life skills.

Also in the proposal, this is a 3D survival money game, I have opened the attachments but can't see anything describing the economy in the game, how the money comes from where to pay the rewards for player?

I must add that I myself haven\u2019t come across a game that combines the genre of survival (also a genre that excites millions of players with current popular titles such as the Far Cry franchise, Dying Light 2, The Forest, etc.) with the urgent global mission of natural preservation and enhancement. So I have high hopes that this Cardano-based game will tempt a large number of gamers to join the ecosystem. \nHowever, there are a few things that I find unsettling.\n1. While the proposer does pose a main challenge for this project for the foreseeable future, I believe a viable and suitable solution hasn\u2019t been brought up yet. Perhaps a cooperation with the nature-preserving organizations or a small extraction of cryptocurrency to donate to said organizations would make more of a case.\n2. Despite the mention of this being a 3D survival game, other than the game mechanism, not a lot of details are laid out regarding the gameplay, game lore or open world setting (as to my knowledge, survival games usually take place in an open world in order for gamers to explore and interact) \n3. I would also suggest that the proposer add some figures of key metrics in order to make the proposal more viable and attention worthy. For example, an estimation of an user base at a time mark, how many Omimimo tokens crafted for the game or perhaps how much value players could potentially earn during gameplay.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "From the road map and timeline presented by the proposer, I have faith that the proof of concept will be able to deliver the visualized outcome, and the suggested fund seems quite well grounded also.

The team did put together a rather detailed representation of what is hoped to acquire in terms of success, with 3 phases ranging from short to long term, including what content of the game is ready for launch and what features that players can interact with. I especially compliment on the fact that all of this info will remain on blockchain permanently for the community to double check, and the project is capable of self-sustainability in 24 months. The visualized success for the project closely aligns to the objective of the challenge setting, which is the great immigration of users to Cardano, while aims to a more noble cause of protecting and preserving wild nature and pure water.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1664", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4071, "q0": "I strongly agree that this proposal aligns with the challenge.

The idea is creative and the team has shown a huge commitment to the project. This project has such a big vision and its will attract gamers to Cardano, not only because of the entertaining aspect but also the bigger impact on the world behind it. It can make the gaming a lot more meaningful for gamers and I think it\u2019s the selling points here. The project has its detailed plan, its aims and its targets.
