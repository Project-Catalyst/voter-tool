But in my opinion, you should focus more on the benefits that Cardano enthusiasts, who are the target users, will gain from playing this crafting-game which is considered as a great idea to improve the traction in Cardano adopters and gamers. Likewise, you had better explain the extent of rareness of the Beer-NFT's by providing a specific number of this. For example, you can state \u201cthis NFT is of great value because we will only supply 10,000,000 in total\u201d. Moreover, upon announcing that you are aiming to provide real utility with your NFT's (this key metric matches with that of the challenge), I advise you to specify this feature, as well as the amount of value that gamers can make in this play-to-earn app. I can\u2019t deny the quality tooling of your application since your team is capable of creating a full 3D-environment for gamers to walk around and manually initiate every step of the brewing process, which is viewed as an enjoyable technology to help users engage on. Concerning the obstacles, you had better identify clearly what problems about coding and deployment of smart contracts you can encounter in the future of project conducting.rather than giving a general announcement like:\u201cRisks more or less depend on our ability to keep up with the latest developments\u201d. If you want to deliver this project successfully, find a practicable solution to them, such as investing more money into the servers to get rid of bugs, etc instead of claiming that you already have two software developers to be in charge of.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The central point in this section is a detailed work plan with enough timeline for delivering the proposed solution. However, it can be seen obviously that you aren\u2019t able to hand in an explicit milestones and timeframe to achieve them. For instance, you have to estimate as precisely as possible when the Plutus pioneer program will be launched, when smart contracts, technical features, ingredients and beer types will be developed, in which month or in which quarter of the year. These data are a prerequisite for the voters and community to follow the active progress of your project. Similarly, this proposal also provided no detailed cost breakdown. I understand your team has to pay a salary for members and operating fees to other deliverables, but the case is how much it is. If you can\u2019t at least allot necessary fees to each activity, how could the voters mark your proposal as good, right? Another crucial point is the detail of team members. I\u2019m sorry to say the following, but your proposal is one of the worst ones when taking this section into account. Your team has six workers in total, so you have to show the voters who they are (of course including their names), how many years they have dedicate to the relevant field, what they obtained during their career, and even better, you could show the links of their LinkedIn profiles so that the voters can capture enough information of your team and assess their potential.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "With regards to this auditability section, it is readily apparent that no certain measurement tools are provided in this proposal. Technically, how to keep track of the operability of the smart contracts and the 3D-environment? Please find a straightforward answer to this question clearly with a view to helping the community supervise the progression of your deliverables. In the same way, you state that your project goal is full operationality for players, which is also your way of defining success. Yet, you still don\u2019t shed light on this content, for example, I can\u2019t figure out what items this full operationality will contain and how useful they will be for players. For that reason, I strongly believe that this proposal would be better assessed if you can supplement extra information to improve its shortcomings that I suggested.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1675", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3569, "q0": "My initial reaction to this project is excitement, since I\u2019ve literally never stumbled on the idea of owning a 3D brewery inside a cryptocurrency blockchain. So this could both offer players a first time being a brewer and owning a business as well, and from the looks of it, the game tries to resemble every single step of the way. The proposal also includes a possible problem, which seems to be keeping up to date with technology nowadays, and fortunately there comes a viable resolution for that. However, even though the proposal delivers plenty of the functions and features of the game, there seems to be no mention of a main target audience. One could speculate that this aims towards the gaming community, still I\u2019d like a confirmation on the proposer\u2019s part. Another flaw to this proposal that I notice is the missing of core metrics used to approximately measure the initial success of the project.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "This section, in my opinion, is not carefully delivered. For now, it would seem like there is no plan or milestones just yet, only an estimation of a time period, there is neither an exact number for the requested budget nor its breakdown (though we do know what it\u2019s for) and a very brief listings of current team members as there is information regarding background or expertise whatsoever.

Furthermore, there is no utilization of tools that enable the team and the community to monitor more conveniently, such as GitHub, ClickUp or Trello.

The proposal does not really address how new gamers will be onboarded onto the blockchain but rather explains the game functionalities. Current challenges are that traditional gamers are unfamiliar with blockchain technology and often perceive NFT games as scam. In addition, the entry barrier for these games can be quite high as players need to invest in sometimes expensive NFTs. The proposal does not indicate how these problems would be addressed and seems to be rather geared for blockchain familiar gamers. \n\nOverall, the game proposed here is very niche-oriented (beer enthusiasts) and does not provide a particular solution of how new gamers could be attracted to the Cardano ecosystem.

The requested funds will be used to pay these developers, but a detailed budget breakdown is missing.

This is a game that, for me, would attract only the most enthusiasts beer fans, I don\u2019t think it is so appealing to have a huge base of players, specially recurrent since after some time it would become a bit repetitive, even with different recipes. Therefore, I don\u2019t see it as having a huge impact in the ecosystem.
