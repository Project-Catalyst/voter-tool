React is a popular frontend framework and building any tooling to make connecting wallets easier will add value to the Cardano gaming space. I am not giving 5 starts because very little information is provided on how the component library that is proposed will actually connect to wallets. For example, will they build it so that browser based or application based wallets can connect? I would recommend the proposer share any successes they may have already had in regards with wallet to application connections. Perhaps communicate to the voter how their is a lack of tooling in this regard, and how your build will fill a much needed void. Remember you voter will not know everything about Cardano and application development, so provide as much convincing information as you can. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Cannot assess this category highly. Very little detail is provided in regards to the qualifications and experience of the team members, their roles, how many there are, how the funds will be used, or a timeline for development. I would suggest the proposer add additional and organized breakdowns about the team and their experiences, how the money will be used to bring the product to market,  and the roadmap. Additionally, I recommend the proposer communicate what insight they have for how likely the success of the project will be based on their previous builds. For example, I assume based on the development they claim to have completed, that they have had some successes in building out wallet connected gaming apps? I would suggest they share some of the code written, links to any games or 3D apps they have built, etc. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proposer does not indicate how they will provide progress updates if funded. In this section voters want to see how the proposer, if funded, will communicate progress and judicial use of awarded funds. It is important for awarded proposers to be held accountable for their end of the bargain. In this case it is to bring Cardano gaming tools to the community to encourage more gaming builds on Cardano.  I would recommend the proposer spend some time laying out an approach to providing updates. Many past proposers have done it in the following ways, YouTube video updates, websites with product demos and code snippets, Github Commits, Project Catalyst weekly presentations, etc. In this section we want to see a clear roadmap with clear ways in which the team will communicate the status of the roadmap as time moves on to completion of project. The more detailed the better. For example, you might explain that end of Q1 post funding, you will have workable code that will be posted to GitHub, and that you will release a video giving votes and the community an update on progress.

Specifically, this one chooses to benefit the game developers rather than the usual crowd of gamers, which could prove fruitful since this group of target audience hasn\u2019t exactly been receiving as much attention. The ultimate goal of the project is the gained benefits of Cardano by offering more functionality and operability, which is expected to bring in more users into the ecosystem. Another welcoming feature is the utilization of open source when the project is met with success, which shall enable the community to better observe the process of project formation. The proposal also poses a potential challenge in the foreseeable future as well, and addresses a viable resolution, though the specifics are yet to be seen.\nNonetheless, I certainly feel that the proposal could hint at more details of the project, since I find what is offered on the table lacking the necessary to fascinate readers. \nTo be specific, for better captivation of the target audience, I advise that the proposer add the information regarding how this tool functions, how it should ease the process of developing 3D content and what edges it has over the competition\u2019s platforms (given that there are any to mention).

How is it going to bring Cardano forward as a whole, giving it more functionality and operability, attracting new players and therefore more users? Such questions are not having any answers here. If the proposer already has some work in progress, it should be good to provide some information of it as well. That way, we can have a better idea of this project.
