Therefore, we have an innovative proposal within what is proposed. The budget requested by the project is relatively high, which leads us to the need for a good professional base behind it; and this doesn't seem to be a problem, as the people involved in the project point to having a high degree of experience in the specific segment of game development, including citing gaming industry giants such as Blizzard.\n\nAdditionally, we also have that the developers involved point to having experience in metaverse development of games like SecondLife, which may even be the great precursor of every 'metaverse style' movement that we see today.\n\nThus, it is possible to see a basis for potential success for this project, contributing to the growth of Cardano's ecosystem, and given all the characteristics involved so far, the amount of capital required seems high, but justifiable.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Continuing what was mentioned above, the people involved demonstrate a lot of ability to develop and bring the project to life. As they have previous experience in the technology market and especially in the area of \u200b\u200bgames, we also realize that there must be a good know-how regarding the practices and measures that must be adopted to maintain a live ecosystem in the game, fundamental for the success of the game. same. In addition, experience in relation to the operation of Cardano and knowledge of blockchain technology is pointed out, essential for the tradable articles of this card game to achieve success.\n\nOne way to confirm the information mentioned in the project is to access the site juegostudio.com, which seems to be one of the most interesting points of the proposal. There we can find a rich portfolio with examples of the company's areas of activity, and even other game projects that were previously executed by the company. In the 'about us' section in 'overview' we can find the people who work in the company in 'meet the team'. Among the people listed we can find Cartic P, one of the professionals involved in the Shadowrealms proposal.\n\nThe proposal presents a detailed structuring of the steps that must be fulfilled for the development of the game, also indicating what must be invested in marketing, which is one of the most important aspects for the success of a game. It is also important to mention that this investment in marketing will be made from Q2 onwards, when there is already a front-end development of the game, which greatly facilitates its dissemination.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that it is not clear whether the people who will work on the development of the game will also be responsible for its dissemination. It is possible that this happens given their previous experience, but it seems interesting that a marketing team could be dedicated to this function.\n\nThe idea of \u200b\u200bthe players themselves not only being the owners but also having the possibility to build and market their own NFT's is a good differential of the project. Additionally, the gameplay characteristics of a card game seem very compatible with the commercialization of NFT's; a rarer card or a pet of a less common species would therefore have a higher demand and value.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "To measure the adoption of such a game, it is essential that a demo is made available, containing some of the main gameplay features that will be present in the final stage. One of the best ways to follow the progress of the project, in these circumstances, would be to make available to the Cardano community, and also to players in general, a demo of the game. And through this gathering feedback and opinions on which points should be adjusted.\n\nIn addition, direct Cardano contributors could oversee the development steps outlined to verify that a balance is really being struck between using Cardano's tools and building a lively and fun game.\n\nWe noticed that the construction of a demo and the development of different fronts of the game were very detailed in the structuring stages. It is also clear that stages Q1 and Q2 must be audited with special importance, given that these are essential for the game to be successful in its entirety, this is because in these stages the backbone of the game will be built, with the establishment of the gameplay mechanics and game design.\n\nIn addition, it seems crucial that with the development of the game, check that it is not becoming too complex, as there have been other card games in a similar style that had potential, but were forgotten because they became too complex for be played by most people.\n\nIn general, the ideals conveyed here about auditability make sense, it's just the observation that it would be interesting to include some more specific numerical goals, for example, the expected number of players in the initial phase of the game.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 8, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 7290, "q0": "The proposal theoretically fits the challenge, but I encountered some problems here. Starting with the game description: it is confusing, we know that it will be a card game, that players will own NFT and at some point will create them in the metaverse, that there would be battles and it would be a game that you can profit from. This is interesting because it would combine two very common interests of the gamer community, the love for games and the possibility of generating income doing what they like. We also know that it would be a poster game, where people would collect cards from creatures, monsters, pets, and so on. But it's a little confusing how these battles would play out, would it be one player against another, or would they be through teams? How long on average would each battle last? The explanation of what we would do in the game, how its phases would be, how the player would evolve, how they would profit and etc is confusing, I couldn't understand exactly how a match would be, for example. The proponent explains that the game is free to start playing but at a certain point you would have to pay to continue evolving, it would be interesting to understand at what point this would happen and where the money paid by players would go. It is also unclear how this game would contribute to the Cardano ecosystem. Would all the NFTs here be minted on our blockchain? To receive the profits generated during the game, would people link their digital wallets? Would the winnings be entirely in game tokens or would there be any payout in Ada? How would players learn about Cardano's technologies, their differentials and advantages? In general, my opinion is that the game can be a good idea, it can fit with what we are looking for in the challenge (funding game projects that are beneficial to the Cardano ecosystem, either through the popularization of our currency, transactions in the our blockchain, NFTs coining in Cardano, player involvement in the ecosystem and etc); however, there was a lack of clarity to understand 1) how the day-to-day of the game would be, we do have a lot of information that says about the characteristics of the game, for example that it is a play-to-win modality, the players would be the owners of all the NFTs and etc, but it is not clear what a game would be like, the evolution of each one in the game and etc 2) to what extent this game would be built based on our blockchain and would benefit Cardano. Therefore, I think the proponent could review these issues and convey their ideas more clearly. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "This part of the proposal was also confusing, unfortunately. The proponent explains twice about the script and the use of the budget, I didn't understand if the first explanation would be a more general overview and the second a more detailed one, but anyway, let's evaluate it in parts. In the first explanation of the roadmap, we are told what tasks would happen in the 2022 quarters (the second, third and fourth). It worries me that from what I understand this would not be the total development time of the game as it requires a very high funding of 100k dollars. But going back to the analysis of the script: it is positive how the proponent divides the total time in part and inserts tasks to be performed in them, but the explanation of each one of them is still superficial. He could better detail each of these activities so that we could have a deeper understanding of the whole process. It would also be important to clarify how long each of these tasks would take. Some quarters are better detailed than others, I don't know if because they would be more \u201chectic\u201d in the development of the project or if the proponent really provides more information about some than about others. Example of what an ideal roadmap would look like for me, in this proposal: in the first quarter, the proposer informs us of 3 tasks. I would like each of them to have a small text detailing how it would be made and how long it would last. For example, in three months we have 3 tasks, would each one last 1 month? When would the minting of the posters begin and when would it be completed? In Q4, the activities are better detailed, with only the notion of time being absent. As far as the budget is concerned, it is explained very superficially, for example 72k would go to design. Would all that work and money go to just one person? With such a high budget, a more detailed explanation would be needed. Why is 72k dollars needed? The design creation process would be divided into which steps? How could we better understand the use of this money in parts? As with the design, the other parts should also have been better explained. Right after the first explanation of the roadmap and budget, the bidder includes a second explanation that talks more about each quarter, the activities performed and the parts of the funding used per hour. This somewhat improves the understanding of the script and budget, but it is still confusing because these things are divided into two parts, I would like everything to be put together in a single explanation, clearer, longer and more detailed. And finally, about the team, only 2 professionals are presented. The game would need a complete team to be made properly, with professionals from various areas such as design, programming, marketing, narration, etc. I would like to know who the other team members would be, or if, in this case, the two permanent professionals would still hire the other people involved (this is not clear). A detailed explanation of the two professionals present is also not attached, I would like to know more about their CVs and how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem. In general, the script and budget explanation is a bit confusing, split, and lacked more detail in some parts, while the staff's explanation leaves a lot to be desired. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability of the proposal is average. At certain points, I also found it confusing. The proponent included Covid awareness in the middle of the success metrics, I didn't understand the direct relationship of this to the game. It sets out what medium- and long-term success would look like, emphasizing that the clearest success scenario would be when players were able to enjoy themselves and generate income from the game. I agree that this would be the ultimate goal, it also informs other things we could look into to see if the game is developing as expected, and the information provided is mostly qualitative. I would like two more things to be done here: for the proponent to include some numerical data, by which we could verify the success of his project more objectively, using statistics in our favor; that there were also clearer ways to measure the consequences of the game for the Cardano ecosystem, such as whether there was an increase in digital wallets, purchase of Ada, investments in pools, NFTs minted on the blockchain, active participation of players in the ecosystem, either by through Catalyst or other ways. In general I do not agree that the bidder provides sufficient and satisfactory information for us to accurately measure whether the game has had considerable positive consequences for Cardano. I suggest that he clarify these issues, taking into account my suggestions and those of other CAs. I also think it would be necessary for the community to track the progress of the game's development, not just the results. This can be done either if the proponent, in communion with his team, gives us feedback on the partial results of the game's development, through reports, for example; or if some members of the Cardano community, preferably who understand and are interested in the gaming universe, would follow the stages and their tasks and bring updates for the rest of us. In general, the auditability exists and it is not bad, but it can still improve a lot. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 10500, "q0": "The proposal fits very well with the objectives of the challenge, by creating a pay to earn game, using one of the game genres that generates a large cash flow, and where the sense of value for rarity has been widespread for a long time, as in the game of pokemon cards, that it had an explosion of new users during this pandemic, which ended up increasing the already high prices of rare cards, and that's because the game nowadays is not even played but used for collecting purposes. cards. This shows that the monetization model presented in the proposal works very well, but it also depends a lot on the value that each player will give to each card, and this will mainly be the result of a quality marketing campaign, and it will also depend on factors such as how the game will be fun, what are the differences between a common and a rare card that allow at the same time to show that the player has something special, but that it is also fair to play against, in a way that does not harm the experience of other players who still do not have this luxury, and this can be done through cosmetic changes, be they in design or animations or both, as is already done in games of the most different styles, but as it will be a pay to earn game, I imagine it will be tremendously difficult to be able to balance it, even because players who spent more money to get a rare card are not only expecting visual changes, but also a way to facilitate their gains in the game. But it is undeniable that the proposal may not only bring many new users to the Cardano ecosystem, as it enters a new market that has been growing very quickly in recent years, and because it is something new and the first games are very simple and focused in large majority in monetary gain, once a new game appears, if there are more opportunities people will drop them because it doesn't have enough depth in its content to attract a group of people really interested in the game and not only in its pay feature to earn, the market still lacks genuinely fun and interesting pay to earn games, synchronizing in-game earnings with adas in cardano's wallet. The SHDR token also grants good freedom to members of the gaming community to establish more democratic and independent governance.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Unfortunately, the details of the members are lacking.

In terms of expenses, although USD 100k is a relatively small amount for the production of a game in general, the amount still consists of 20% of the total destined to the challenge, but I believe that the cost is well justified if the objectives of the proposal are met. .

Speaking from my experience as a gamer myself, a majority of players would be more interested in exploring those said aspects of a game. Of course, the rewards are just as equally important. That being said, some are in it for a good and fun time rather than the rewards.\nSome mention of figures for the key metrics. For example, if the game guarantees to lure in people from all over the world, what can be the estimated total number? Or given that there are various kinds of income-earning, how much may a player potentially make?

I do not think this proposal addresses the challenge however I understand what the team is trying to accomplish as a whole.  This game will be impactful as it will give players ownership of the game components. This will be made possible through NFTS and a token specifically made by the game.  This game has the ultimate goal of providing a \"basic income\" for its players. If this could be done, it would be addressing a portion of the challenge. The game is planned to be a card dueling game and it should be noted that some of the game NFTs have already been minted. This kind of game to me lacks an originality and this lessens its impact.  If this game could sustainably and continuously provide a basic income to its players as intended the impact will increase. This is however an extremely challenging feat to achieve", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Given the experience and plan presented I disagree that the proposal will be implemented successfully. The biggest concern for me in regards to this proposals feasibility is in its ability to achieve a true play to earn  economy which gives a return on investment to its players on a sustainable and continuous basis. One project that comes to mind is crypto blades, the problem is everyone wants to earn,  not as many want to pay. In order for a game to truly be -play to earn, there needs to be capital inflows from a source other then the players.  A true play to earn game would be able to provide returns for all who play it and not the standard early investors getting money from people who joined up later.  I am not too sure about ways around this possibly: royalties?. sponsors/advertisements?, stake pools?, I could not find any mention of this or any tokenomics for their coin in their game white paper .

It also mentions that the SHDR token will be used for governance and DAO creation, but it doesn\u2019t explain how.

It says that it would be a free to play game, and players would have an income from just playing the game, but it doesn\u2019t really explain anything about the tokenomics and how this would be achievable.

For example, here it says that the gameplay will be under development after 12 months, but in the roadmap it says that there\u2019s a beta release in November 22. So, this should be in the mid-term success metrics, not in long term.

Anyhow, if the game is successful in its proposition, it could help anyways with other matters.
