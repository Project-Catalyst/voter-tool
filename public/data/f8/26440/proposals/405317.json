All of this information is logically presented in the proposal, keywords are underlined, helping the community focus on important information. They also provide key KPIs to track and measure the progress and effectiveness of the project. These KPIs are directly linked with the objectives of the project. They also do a SWOT analysis, which helps them clearly identify their targeted groups and thereby focus their efforts on the right subject. The expected outcomes of the project are believed to achieve the key metrics of the challenge and ultimately positively affect the growth of the Cardano network.  \nThe main challenges and risks are well forecasted.

Viewing this cost breakdown, the community can easily track and assess the effectiveness of their spending.\nThe team is well portrayed with members\u2019 positions, experience, and LinkedIn accounts.

The issues stated here stem from the marketing without budget is very slow. As a result, it would be advantageous to find a new marketing\u00a0way to promote AdaQuest and bring Cardano closer to the masses in ways that are completely consistent with the challenge setting. AdaQuest's successful marketing raises Catalyst's brand awareness among the entrepreneur gaming community. By supplying these good metrics, the proposer ensures the proposal's credibility to the community. The risks and challenges that are anticipated\u00a0also be addressed by the proposer\u00a0in order to minimize the consequences. A variety of tools are employed to carefully reduce the risk. The proposer also specified which tool is being used for which purpose.I believe that with the team's experience in game marketing over the previous two decades, the little risks will be mitigated and the others can be managed in a controllable environment. The proposer did an excellent job in requesting a budget for marketing AdaQuest.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The marketing strategy is well-timed. The tasks assigned to each timeline are distinct. However, given that the goal of this proposal is marketing, the proposer may be able to provide greater detail on the marketing plan.

Their qualifications and expertise are ideal for the marketing campaign: Strategic Advisor, Lore & Finance, Art Direction", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Despite the fact that the proposer had offered tools for measuring the proposal's performance, I expect data and milestones to be submitted. Perhaps the proposer should add a link to their social websites (Instagram, Twitter, Discord, Telegram, Reddit) and provide the interaction rate between followers and postings so that we can evaluate the progress more closely. Nevertheless, the team will document and discuss every week, and the community will be updated on the progress on a weekly basis.

It is in reality very important to create awareness for this project, if they want to achieve their long term goals and make a huge impact on the Cardano ecosystem. The plan to do this is good, since it includes two teasers and a trailer, influencers,youtubers, podcasters, advertisement campaigns and more. If it very well aligned with the challenge, since the game has been covered by a previous proposal and the marketing campaign would multiply the adoption created by these other developments. Also, since they seem to know very well their public, they can created a very focused marketing strategy. Although, this proposal is not so aligned with the other AdaQuest proposals submitted in this challenge. Their, the team says that they are going to focus mainly in organic growth, and don\u2019t want to pay for influencers and youtubers to market the game, which is the opposite to what they are proposing here. I don\u2019t see it as a problem, necessarily, but it would be good to say, for example, that organic growth is plan B, if plan A, which seems to be this proposal, doesn\u2019t get funded.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The roadmap and milestones of this proposal are well described and well aligned with what was proposed to be done. The budget is not so detailed, since they are lumped for each 2 months of work, but they provide a fair understanding of how the budget is distributed for the different tasks. Although, it would be better to understand how much of the budget is going to pay personnel, and how much would go to advertising, influencers and etc. The team is very capable to develop the game, and Michael is specially suited to help on this part of the work since he has marketing background. In my opinion, the feasibility of this proposal is very high.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They have a good description of how they will handle the project management internally. Also, they mentioned that community auditing will be done through tracking all pieces of media they release and spread, besides the KPIs, which is good to keep track of their development and results. Regarding success metrics, it would be ideal to have some numeric goals, like number of social media interactions, number of people who have joined their Discord through this marketing campaign, number of new sales and money gained due to the campaign, and other similar metrics.

We need to see what AdaQuest is by clicking into the link https://ada-quest.com/ to see the first mode ARENA, to understand how cool it is (playing free without any paywall, being easy and user-friendly, involving the community into the development). Besides, I found this: after successful implementation of the project ARENA since Fund5, this round of Fund, the AdaQuest authors propose 8 proposals (6 proposals for ARENA mode and 2 proposals for Phase 2 of AdaQuest). I think we should read all of them to understand the AdaQuest project as a whole. They are:\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/405317 (marketing strategy - this is the current proposal we are assessing)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/403708 (polishing, balancing & testing the game)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/405445 (enhancing the graphics of the game: re-design, create and enhance characters)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404315 (delivering adventures within the game  for PVE players)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404938 (hiring the sound designer for AdaQuest and creating a free sound library for Cardano game projects)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404893 (creating a module for socializing and housing in the world of the game)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404544 (creating the concept for Phase 2)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/405375 (developing a prototype for Phase 2)\nIn this proposal, the authors give us a list of target groups, which allows us to understand what kinds of audience the proposal wants to aim. In my opinion, the proposal not only fits the challenge \u201cGamers On - Chained\u201d but also add value to the Cardano ecosystem because if it is successful, the project will help attracting more people get experience of playing AdaQuest, so that it helps increasing: number of users of gaming based applications built on Cardano, number of CNFTs made specifically for gaming, number of fungible tokens made specifically for gaming, which are in the success metrics of the challenge. Additionally, the challenge \u201cGamers On - Chained\u201d was initiated by the team, so that they are well-known about which proposals will address the challenge, therefore the impact of this proposal should not be a problem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The authors provide information in details for us to assess the proposal\u2019s feasibility, consist of team\u2019s information, detailed plan, target groups, budget breakdown and challenges/risks related to the project\u2019s success.

The plan with milestones allows us to see what need to be done in a chronological order in term of 6 months. Regarding to the financial amount, we can see it is split into 3 parts of cost based on milestones in the roadmap. Besides, the team foresees challenges/risks that they may face when conducting the project, and they also gives solutions/ mitigation, helps us understand more about the project and raise the trust from readers that the proposal will be implemented successfully.\nHowever, I think it would be more beneficial if the proposers give more information to explain in details about each of activities in the roadmap. I also recommend the financial amount should be split smaller the \u201coverall spend\u201d in each of (two) months. For example, how much will we spend on hiring motion designer, how does creating video content cost?, ect. That will help the budget is more reasonable.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This part of proposal is provided information enough for auditability assessment, consist of KPIs, roadmap, milestone, and time horizon, help us easy to understand what will be measured or monitered.
