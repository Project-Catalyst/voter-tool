Not only is the Esports community big in the traditional gaming space, but has begun to emerge in the blockchain space, on other blockchains like ethereum. If the Cardano community can create an Esports gaming space, that is designed well, it could bring lots of users and value to the space. It would be interesting however, for the proposer to compare and contrast the existing blockchain based Esports platforms/games, and identify how Cardano is uniquely suited to provide a better user experience. Also when comparing to traditional centralized Esports gaming platforms, it would be worth explaining how decentralization and DIDs better suite the Esports space? You must remember the voter will need this clearly explained, just as traditional Esports competitors will need to be sold on moving their reputations, data, and communities to the blockchain. The proposer does bullet list several points that cast a wide net, but do not specifically make the case for blockchain, and specifically Cardano based Esports.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Based on the information presented in the proposal, it is unlikely the project would succeed as laid out. The proposer offers no evidence to the their personal skills and experiences as relates project management or application development, nor do they offer a clearly defined and coherent strategy for seeking, finding, and employing a team of competent developers to bring the project to a minimally viable product. This is a large project to build out and would require careful building and design, as it incorporates personal information, DIDs, and a tokenized earning aspect. I would recommend phasing out the project into smaller segments over several funds. Start small with a plan to build out the basic UI/UX, and build the community up with stakeholders and other interested parties. Build a team of developers, and work out how the funding for the project will specifically be applied to a simple roadmap. Voters want to feel assured that the funds are being used judiciously, but the plan presented is too vague. I believe it is achievable, under better planning. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Unfortunately the proposal does not offer anything substantial in regards to how the project will be tracked, reported on, and audited. The proposer should consider the tone of this section as it reads with a lackadaisical attitude. There is too much generalization, and not enough specificity. I would recommend the proposer provide clear and concise reporting KPIs, and how they will be communicated back to the broader Cardano community. Many proposers find success in this area by providing public GitHub repos, frequent YouTube updates, or even by spinning up websites for reporting and communicating. It is important for the community to be informed that the project is moving along,  to confirm the funds are put to a good purpose. This also has the benefit for the proposer, as it allows he/she to share struggles and shortcomings with the project. If it turns out that you  need to come back for another round of funding it will be understood why.

Once its team is established the likelihood of the proposal being implemented would greatly increase.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I disagree that this proposal provided sufficient information to equitably audit the progress.

By focusing on the Play-to-earn space, and the second-order social-network aspect connected to that space, I find that the amount of addressing the challenge is not very strong.  If there was a 3.5 rating, that would be the value I'd use here. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Blake's passion for getting into active, compensated contribution in the Cardano community is evident (kudos!).  However, without a more experienced team, it seems unlikely that the project will be completed successfully. Also due to the lack of specificity on the scope, features, and near-term objectives, it bears signs (based on my own deep experience in technical projects) of being high-concept, high-scope ... and a huge attention sink.\n\nIt MIGHT be that the proposer has more specificity and that those specific details would be more actionable, but such details aren't presented here.  Proposing a clear plan is hard, and I would encourage more in the way of planning short-term, achievable milestones on 3-6 month timelines rather than the longer-term periods mentioned here.\n\nThe risks mentioned in this proposal make pretty good sense to me, but I categorize them all in the way of being risks in the product-market space.  Meanwhile, the main purpose of risk identification is to help proposers recognize where their PLAN can go wrong - and to describe how their plan has been adjusted to cope with those possible problems.  \n\nTo improve on this proposal, I'd recommend adding specificity around project-level details, identifying more specific project-level tasks & milestones and technical problems on the delivery track to nearer-term, valuable deliverables.  Also, add at least one somebody to your team that shows more direct technical and/or management experience bearing on the solution you're proposing.  ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Checking for progress and success, and showing auditable transparency would be enabled by describing measurable activity that the project will be able to show about its real-world RESULT.  Those kinds of metrics are typically specific, measurable, and where possible, objective.  Unfortunately, this proposal doesn't address these considerations of transparency and impact as far as I'm able to assess.\n\nThe Product brief paragram \"A community owned and run DID-powered profile platform that allows players...\" in the proposal actually is a pretty good start on a problem statement / summary.  It reads like an early part of a newspaper article about the project.  To improve the proposal's clarity and specificity and find more in the way of impact-measures and transparency/auditability touchpoints, Blake could expand, such as an informative newspaper article would, saying more about the HOW & WHAT, perhaps identifying some specific technologies to be pulled from the shelf.  It could point to near-term achievable milestones and clear statements of the real-world impacts enabled at such milestones.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful for your project-planning & execution success (and maybe for the proposing process as well)!  All good things be to you, Blake.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1139", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 4, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal aims to create a new social network model to connect gamers and promote the e-sport scenario, making use of the DID. With this, we see that a possible success of the project would help bring more recognition to Cardano in the gamer universe, so the proposal fits the metrics of the challenge. In addition, the difficulty for an amateur player to become a professional is notorious, so a project that facilitates this procedure will be solving a real pain. In addition, as the gamer market is now one of the largest in the world, it is possible to establish numerous partnerships with the Aegis platform that would bring more visibility to Cardano's ecosystem. However, we note that the budget being requested of $50,000 is very high given the initial state of the project and the team at the moment, which ended up hampering the execution of this proposal and its possible impact. We will further analyze these factors below.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "In fact, as stated earlier, there is a good idea here. However, it seems that more well-defined concepts have not yet been structured, so the considerable funding being requested is not justifiable. The fact that the platform uses concepts such as DID to promote greater security for player data and is self-governing are differentials, but in my opinion there are still not many incentives that can actually attract players to participate in the community, especially those who do not know blockchain technology. The incentive with native token for players to form connections is interesting, but it does not seem that this will be an initial driver in the question of building a differentiated platform in the interaction aspect. The role the NFT will play is also unclear. These indications show us that although the idea is promising, it is still a little primitive. It remains as a suggestion, then, to define some more concrete ways to promote an initial capture of players, which are the basis of the entire project. Even in the breakdown of the budget, we can see an allocation that seems relatively small for advertising (less than 20% of the budget), given that it is essential to create a large user base for the product. Also, about the team behind the project, we realized that only one professional composes it at the moment. It is a very positive factor that this professional is linked to both the software area and e-sports, two of the strongest characteristics of the project. But it would be interesting if the other professionals being sought were already reasonably located. In addition, it would be a positive factor if the $40,000 amount earmarked for development could be further detailed. The languages \u200b\u200bthat the developers will use could be indicated, how many hours they will work weekly or the value of the hour worked.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Regarding the ways to follow the progress of the project, we noticed that not many details were given so that we could have a clearer view of the progress of the results. The indication of the milestones that will be used to capture success does not often indicate results, which is important in a project with considerable complexity like this. In this context, it would be interesting to indicate the use of a tracking tool such as Jira. Another possibility would be the presentation of a public board where the objectives that have been achieved are posted with a certain frequency. Conducting periodic sprints seems to be another promising idea.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 4, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal sees a good opportunity in the Esports industry and solves a problem, all while addressing the Challenge objectives. DID Profiles seem like a great way of displaying a players history and achievements, while giving the player ownership of their data. Combined that with social networking and the platform could be a great gaming hub for Communities and players. With all the benefits Cardano has to offer.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer seems qualified to build the product, but a LinkedIn or CV would be great. The proposal would benefit for a clear explanation of how the budget will be spent. Development costs are 40.000 USD but its not clear how it will be spent. An approximate of Salaries and expected costs breakdown would greatly improve the proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "KPI\u00b4s are not completely clear : \"an MVP and clear roadmap to mainnet launch, as well as communities and content being made documenting\"  Having communities its not a clear indicator on progress.

For example, regarding the platform description, the proposer wants to offer NFT \"creation/fractionalization for tracking progress, and creation of communities\". How does the proposer want to build these features? Does he plan to do some collaborations? The development of such platform can be very technical depending on the different features the proposer wants to integrate into it and it would be interesting to have a better idea on how the proposer plans to build them.\n\nAlso, the proposer is alone for the development of this platform and does not have yet the capabilities to fully develop it. He will need several collaborators but for now, it is hard to really know if the project is highly likely to be implemented successfully. I suggest to find other team members with different knowledge/profiles for the development of this platform.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The \"auditability\" part is a copy/paste from the \"Feasibility\" part.

This is a good idea, but I do not see how DID helps here, just because it is difficult to be an impostor coach without being discovered by the team trying to compete. So the platform would likely be driven by the excellence of its community, but it is not clear what it would offer over other established communities, or Steam or Discord.\nAlso, esports, while popular, is also fairly niche in the wide world of video gaming: the number of adopters to the platform could be increased by \nmaking casual gamers and regular achievement hunters a target as well.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The project aims for DID integration in the next 6 months, and to (from previous section) \"allow competitive players to create a space to upload content and posts, display verifiable statistics, and authenticate history.\"\nHowever, it is not mentioned how statistics or history with games would be verified. \nThe funds call for \"$~40000 for development and content creation work among the team working on it.\"\nIs \"content creation\" referring to the ability of competitive players to make posts and upload images/stats?
