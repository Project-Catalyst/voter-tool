In this way, the project fits the goals of the challenge in which it finds itself. In addition, if this new approach to NFT usage is successful, the game could help attract more attention to Cardano's ecosystem and the use of its game development tools.\n\nWe see that the requested budget of $55,000 is considerable, but given the game's ambitions and planned stages, it seems like a decent amount. A great feature of the game is also the constant attention paid to making it fun. We noticed that many games using NFT's make the mistake of focusing more on this than on the gameplay itself. But, luckily, that doesn't seem to be the case here, we can say that especially thanks to the information that was made available in the topic \u201cquick overview of Flooftopia's gameplay & mechanics\u201d. There, it was possible to find a good description of the gameplay, and it was evident, throughout the construction of the scenario, that an atmosphere is being formed to capture and entertain players, in such a way that the sale of NFT's is a complementary action.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project team seems to be super competent, with several professionals having worked in amazing game development companies, which brings a lot of credibility to this proposal. In addition, the CVs of all these professionals were made available in the description of feasibility. This is certainly one of the great strengths of the project. Additionally, we note that the technical capabilities of the professionals involved are very complementary, given the scope of the project. Such attributes are not limited to development only, we were also able to find experiences with illustration and marketing.\n\nRegarding the budget, its detailing seems to be well structured and we noticed that capital was allocated to various aspects of the project's production, that is, it was not aimed only at the codification stage itself; marketing, game design and the legal part were also covered. But as the game coding is a central part, it is also normal that a large portion of the amount, $18,000, is directed towards it. Another considerable allocation is earmarked for 3D modeling and animations ($9375), and clearly this is one of the game's central points given all its features. Regarding the details of the action plan, we see well-defined stages distributed over the quarters of the year. The progression of these steps over time also makes sense, as simpler actions are initially established and then become more complex. For example, the first quarter aims to continue some developments already underway, in the second quarter the completion of the site is planned (which is very good to help with publicity) and only in the last quarter is the launch of a beta planned.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As for the ways to measure game performance, we see that the choices made are consistent with the ideas described by the team in the proposal. The idea of using the goals defined on the website to monitor progress is quite plausible, as the milestones defined there contemplate in a plural way the different aspects of the project, such as game design and sales of NFT's.\n\nIn addition, other established metrics help to measure engagement around the project, such as checking the number of wallets created to be used in game integration. But it would also be interesting to make a public board available so that the community could monitor the steps being carried out more closely.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 1, "ng": 9, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1616, "q0": "The proposal presents the idea of \u200b\u200bbuilding a game combined with NFT on the Cardano blockchain. The game will revolve around players leveling up skills through in-game activities such as fishing, logging, and building in-game communities among players. Gameplay in general is not too new in the MMO genre. I have read the proposal carefully, but I still don't understand how you guys limit the pay to win model, is there an in-game marketplace space for players to exchange NFTs with each other? Besides is this a game developed on mobile or PC?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal has not mentioned the issue of challenges and risks. The developer is doing a rudimentary evaluation in this regard. Challenges and risks also come from how you build the community in the game, what mechanisms to encourage players to contribute to your game, risks and challenges about the market, age player. \n\nIn terms of the project's roadmap, I completely agree with the plans proposed by the proposer.

To overcome this challenge, it's offering NFT sales which can be used in-game but, Where and How will these NFTs be marketed within the Cardano space? First a project must build a community and strong social presence to capture an audience willing and able to purchase said NFTs. Having a podcast that can start or continue promoting the project is a great way to get things moving in the right direction. Though podcasts are a dime and dozen and Cardano can be a hard sell at the current stage of development (even 5yrs in, we're still early). Upon doing a little more research into the team, it looks like they're social networks are organically growing slowly, but the lack of interest or promotion of the project is still early stages. Within this proposal I'm not seeing much else on this topic which could help, ie: a better discord presence (member count is just over 100 members) and a better engagement on Twitter. These areas seem to be the highest rate of return in terms of building audiences and loyal NFT buyers who might actually play the game. In this proposal it would have been nice to get more details on this particular subject. Otherwise, it seems like the challenges beyond that can and will be implemented through the team's expertise provided. Having strong backend development already in place is a plus in any project moving forward. Moving forward, a solid marketing strategy must be achieved.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal clearly states a reasonable timeline and presents achievable goals within. Each members LinkedIn pages and short backgrounds on previous accomplishments and current endeavors are present. The things that would be more helpful to see are links to those achievements and how successful they were/are now (number of podcast subscribers, more info on prior game user history/experience, what they working on now besides Flooftopia?) and ways to improve upon them in future developments. The technical aspects could also be more well defined other than the experience of members. There lacks some points of interest in what has already been developed and what exactly is in progress. Is there already game development being worked on? As for the Attachments, the art and world views of Flooftopia look compelling, but is this an Unreal Engine view of what's being created, or snapshots of what *could be*? The proposed budget sets aside a large percentage towards \"Coding\"- ($18,000) and another for \"3D Modeling/Animation\" - ($9375). Have these areas not yet been started or is this amount needed towards completion? It's clear the team may be capable of building a game and producing an NFT project on the Cardano Blockchain. Without more information and details on current progress, one must assume the progress is still just beginning. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "As far as clarity, the points mentioned above all combine into this. The milestones of the proposer should be more well defined. From what is mentioned, those milestones have yet to be achieved other than it's website development and small community presence via twitter and discord (Instagram is tough these days). But the biggest Challenge is back to the Cardano ecosystem and how well the gamers of Cardano/Crypto entity will benefit from the game/NFT sales implemented into the game mechanics. Yes, releasing an NFT mint-able on Cardano is a great success when there is demand. Besides cute art, I'm not seeing too much demand as of now. This is where Marketing the product, developing something people can see and explore, creating a loyal following through social media, as well as showing that audience where in lies the project's process today, will be crucial for future growth, be that Flooftopia as a game and/or in the NFT sales due to launch in May 2022. All these factors are vital for success. If those criteria are met, I see no reason for failure.

I would like to have a research on why should we join this game instead of other similar games? Any improvement or special promotion that make this game stand out?

I think this game is meeting the requirements very well, for several reasons. Starting with the fact that it is not a game aimed at an audience that is already used to the cryptographic world. It is noted that it is a kind of virtual pet, a type of game that could attract the most diverse audiences, including children, since, as the proponents themselves say, it would not be a game with difficult gameplay (this would vary - you can start playing without having many skills but could evolve a lot). This is very important when it comes to ensuring that a large audience would be compatible to start playing. It also facilitates the fact that no one would need to pay or already have NFT to start here, which would be a free entry point for those who still don't understand blockchain, don't know what NFT is and etc. As the authors put it, it would be possible to \u201cconvert players (who are already digital natives) to blockchain natives as well\u201d. And with that, more and more people would get to know Cardano and the goals of the challenge would be achieved. Another positive thing is that this game has actually already been financed in the previous fund, it is already being developed and one of the proponents claims to have invested a lot of his own money in the project, that is, this is something that is already well underway, it is not leaving from scratch, which, in my opinion, increases the chances of the project being successful and that the impact that is being speculated to actually materialize. With that, I think there are several indications that the project will work, I think the ideas are promising (both in terms of being focused on an audience that can vary from children, which we agree, we know that it is quite profitable, and for a adult audience; and also for being easy to play), and I also think that the proposal is perfectly aligned with the objectives of the challenge. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Starting with the fact that the proponents claim that they are working with the same studio that develops the game AdaQuest, one of the biggest and most famous of our blockchain. This already gives me some peace of mind, because it means that people who are well experienced in the field would be on board, and as the proponents themselves say, pitfalls could be avoided. Now moving on to an individual analysis of each part, starting with the script. We have a very clear roadmap of what will happen according to the quarters, we know which activities would be developed and in which order. This information is provided in a very illuminating way and we have already managed to have a very strong view of the process, but I think it could be even better if the activities were separated by month, instead of by quarter. It's good as it is, but it could be even better. Regarding the budget, the asking value is high but it makes sense with the complexity and size of the project, I think it is well divided and explained but some parts are better detailed than others. For example, we even know the hourly rate ($35/hr) of who would work on the game design, but it is not justified because the concept art would cost approximately 5k USD. This is a very high value to be directed only to a part of the project, as it happens in the marketing (which costs 10% of the budget alone) and legal parts. Such individual parts, which would already cost a good chunk of money, could be better explained, arguing the need for such an investment in each of them. And about the team, I think this part is perfect, knowing in detail who the team members are: their names, areas of activity, functions, a small resume and their linkedin profiles are also available where we can verify all the information said. about them. We also have a Cardano expert on the team (Conward), which makes sure we have someone very knowledgeable who will guide the rest of the participants on issues relevant to our ecosystem. So my only suggestions here are to improve the detailing of the dates in the script and also to better explain some parts of the budget. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Proponents claim that measurement of progress would be done primarily by tracking activities against the timeline. As I mentioned in terms of feasibility, it would be even better if the division of activities was done on a monthly basis, because as it is, we do not know, for example, what is planned to be delivered at the end of the first and second month, only the third. However, we can already have a good idea of \u200b\u200bwhat should be done with the information that is provided. I suggest that there is a bridge between the community and the game's development team, some members who had an affinity with the blockchain games universe could more closely monitor the development of activities, perhaps establishing monthly meetings with the team, from which summaries of partial progress could be generated, which could be forwarded directly to the rest of the community. Regarding the results, the main goal is to wedge 10k NFTs (Floofs) and to sell cosmetic products related to the game (as I understand it). The number of new wallets created would also be measured, because to take advantage of blockchain integration, players would need to create them. This to me would also be a direct indicator of how the players would be gradually getting to know and using the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem. That is, we have several variables to be measured to define the possible success of the game. I also think that a more comprehensive way of seeing this happening would be the proportion that the game would gradually acquire, I really believe that it has the potential to grow and become important, and as it expands, so would the knowledge about Cardano.
