There have been many games which simulate the atmosphere and functions of a casino, but they mostly utilize their own in-game tokens which cannot be traded into any real-world currencies. Therefore, an idea should be attractive enough to call in the attention of players, which, if successful, shall align comfortably with the objective of this challenge. The proposer also offers a brief but efficient description of how the NFTs in the game would function, and lists out a number of possible issues to the project, followed by a rather vague resolution. \nWhat I find as shortcomings in this section, however, are those followed:\nThe proposer hasn\u2019t specified exactly whether the Cardano-based casino will operate the same as those in real life or will it have any different operating features?\nThe proposal doesn\u2019t include some key metrics to measure what initial success to this project will look like.

The author can add more illustrative parts and add more detailed features of the game.\nCurrently, the proposal is quite lacking in risk analysis and solutions, but only mentions the status of the project.

There is no doubt that gambling always has its own attraction and the team is making it more enjoyable, convenient and player friendly by all of the connection plans for players. I am especially into the translating function that helps the players to make friends. The using of NFTs and FTs can help increasing the demand and be a part of aligning the challenge setting. The team also have good plan to attract new players by giving available free room. In order to further encouraging word-of-mouth spread, I suggest the team to have rewards or promotions for old players that introduce new ones to join the community, or put some affiliate marketing strategies with the influencers, whose contacts are already earned by the team members. Another suggest is running tournaments and having them lived stream, audiences can use NFTs or FTs to access and watch it, and they can also donate for their favorite players too. For all the reasons above, this proposal has the potential to meet the KPI of the challenge. However, I would like the team to give more metrics to measure the possibilities of the project or how this proposal will align with the challenge exactly. It is good to know that the project is completed partially and already has FTs minted to the value of 50 million, means that the team is facing real risks and having experiences on solving those.

Moreover, we will need the developers information included with some projects that they have experienced (Linked In profiles or names with tittles and companies that the developers worked at will be necessary). It is very thoughtful of the proposal owner that we can keep a lower risk by paying himself/herself for servers, promotion, NFT distribution, further developer payments, etc. But as far I am concerned, how about the other departments?
