One of the main differentials and positive points of the project is having a database and work already carried out to support what is intended to be done here.\n\nThe central idea of \u200b\u200bgamifying the use of the database by creating a new mechanism to provide information on pollution and, at the same time, rewarding users for this with their own currency, confirms the innovative nature of the proposal. The impacts brought about by this proposal would be more effective in the long term, with indications of locations running environmental risks becoming more abundant; also in this context, we have the use of Cardano technology, in the universe of games, to increase its influence.\n\nHowever, all these positive points are considerably impacted by a lack of greater specificity about how this gamification of existing data will occur. We use the term \u2018considerably impacted\u2019 here because the requested budget, $50,000, is a very considerable amount, which makes us also seek a greater level of specificity of the steps to reach the objective.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Regarding the detailing of the budget to carry out the gamification of the project, we were able to find some inconsistencies. As we seek to bring greater attention to the cause by applying gamification to the database, we believe that the development of the story behind this game should be one of the main destinations for capital allocation.\n\nHowever, we can see that only $5,000 is being earmarked for the development of the game's story, or 10% of the total budget. In addition, a clear proposal on how this gamification would be carried out was not presented. It would be interesting if some paths were traced and already indicated that would make the action of exploring data more 'playable'. Some possibilities for this would be the creation of a main character for the game (which could also be used to publicize the project) or indication of what other possibilities for exploration within the game would be, such as making friends with \"cleaners of the world\". Since the core of the idea is to increase people's interest in environmental issues through gamification, the 'game body' should be better constructed in advance. This even makes the amount of $25,000 going to LitterWeek a little inconsistent; why dedicate 50% of the contribution to the promotion of the product before it is more polished?\n\nRegarding the professionals involved in the proposal, they all seem qualified and able to carry out the work, a positive point is also the previous success in raising funds for the project in previous phases, which increases the credibility of the professionals currently involved.\n\nEven with these caveats, it is important to cite excellent ideas that were brought up during the proposals that have a great possibility of increasing engagement around the project. The idea of \u200b\u200busers acquiring LitterNFTs as a reward for accumulating a certain amount of experience in the game and for participating in scientific discoveries are sensational ideas that bring great notoriety to the game and the cause around it. We noticed the presence of several concepts and ideas that, if better polished, will help the project to reach exactly the proposed goal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Regarding the ways to measure the success of the project, given the breadth that it wants to achieve, it is essential that plural ways to confirm the completeness and success are established. But what we see here does not match these expectations, and on the contrary, there is a lack of greater specificity about the only stated way of registering the scope of the proposal.\n\nThe spreadsheet to account for transactions and expenses involving ada and euro is important, since one of the central ideas of the proposal is to obtain the platform's own cryptocurrency as a reward for the environmental work performed. But several steps can take place before such a transaction actually materializes, and keeping a record of these steps seems fundamental to understand the initial steps of the project, and if the players are really engaged and bringing back the cause.\n\nIn this context, auxiliary tools to measure engagement around the game would be essential, such as looking for the number of daily references being made to the project on social networks (possibly using the hashtag search). Another good initiative would be the establishment of communities for the game on the main platforms that gamers use to interact, such as discord; this initiative is especially important because the evolution of a game is often linked to the engagement of its players' communities. As a positive point we can mention that the initial idea is to test the pilot project in Ireland, to later expand and reach other locations, which makes a lot of sense given all the variables existing in the project.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 6, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3571, "q0": "From my basic understanding of the proposal, it would seem that the aims of the proposal include achieving mass adoption of users to the Cardano ecosystem through the game OpenLitterMap and the platform LitterWeek, aligning with the challenge setting. Nevertheless, I do notice that apparently only nature is reaping benefits from this project, so I suggest the proposer add more information regarding the benefits that Cardano may receive as well. \nThere are two features of interest to me mentioned in the proposal. Firstly, one of the target audiences that the project has in sight is school. Now I\u2019m given to understand that \u201cschool\u201d here means \u201cschoolchildren\u201d. If that\u2019s the case, I believe that they have an increasing potential to become long-term users of Cardano, for children are likely to be motivated to act if rewards are to be granted to them, thus, they should participate in the project fondly. And even though they might be too young to understand the definition of a cryptocurrency blockchain, we could still have hopes that they would stick with the project long enough to get intrigued and gradually turn themselves to Cardano. Secondly, I\u2019m in favor of the idea that Littercoin is a non-tradable token on any exchange market, except for zero waste stores. As the author mentioned in the proposal, Littercoin may sound fascinating and rife with potential to climate economics while mitigating the doubt of crypto hurting the environment. Furthermore, given that Littercoin is Cardano-based, climate economics might turn into a potential target audience as well. I also like the rewards that participants may acquire if they complete their specific given tasks.\nThe proposer also addresses a challenge that the project is facing, followed by a solution, regardless that the solution depends on the approval status of the funding. A small adjustment that I would make is adding some content of the gamification process, such as what exact tasks will participants have to carry out in the LitterWeek event or how much LitterCoin could someone potentially earn?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "From the timeline and milestones provided in the proposal, I believe that the project holds some prospects for great success, in a positively short amount of time, that is.

From a quick search on google, I see that they do have actual support from environmental-concious community and attracted quite a lot of attention. So I think the LitterWeek challenge will be a great success in terms of participants. However, in my opinion, the users\u2019 experience with the token would be quite limited due to the the fact that only zero-waste stores will accept Littercoin.

For example, the estimated carbon footprint created by the power plants supplying such electricity is a source of concern for the environment. We can lower our carbon footprint by planting more trees and limiting the usage of power and motors that aren't essential. Can we get rewarded by doing that? Moreover this can also help to change perception that Crypto are harmful to the environment due to using lots of energy. However, the not-moving-fast-enough is not the only risk in this project.

The funding is divided into five major sections, the largest of which is for software and website development, story writing, and prizes, but there is no clear indication of how many people will work on it or how long it will take for them to accomplish the job on time.

The proposed \"non Trade-able Tokens (NTT?)\" (non trade-able being in relation to trade-able on secondary markets, like exchanges) could be a gaming game changer and offer something truly exclusive to the Cardano (gaming) ecosystem. The Github repositories are operating under open source (GNU-General Public) license, from the community for the community.\n\nThe value added to Cardano (gaming space) is maybe not immediately apparent, but becomes clear if one acknowledges that the gamification of Littercoin will be successfully implemented and played with. It would mean large scale exposure of Cardano in ecological conscious communities and (purpose) corporations; purpose companies will become the default legal structure in the years to come. \n\nAs I understood Littercoin has no on ramp, but can only be spent in Climate neutral (zero waste) stores, making ADA the default off ramp currency for all those businesses.\nWhich leads to the next important impact factor.\nEven if the Littercoin implementation  will somehow not be successful in itself, the mechanics and proof of concept for a \"Non Trade-able Token (NTT?)\" might prove highly valuable for others looking to integrate easy to stabilise fungible tokens within their gaming ecosystem.\n\nCreating a fungible asset that can't be bought on an exchange (decentralised or centralised) - essentially a \"Limited Fungible Token\" - seems challenging and if done right will be a great addition to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nTurning gaming achievements into NFTs is a nifty idea and most likely will be picked up by other gaming projects as well. Most likely there are other proposers working on this as well, it would've been amazing to see or hear about any possible collaborations around this. \n\nThe goal of creating a gaming experience that both has positive environmental impact and is bringing exposure to the Cardano (gaming) ecosystem (by gamifying citizen science) is well aligned with the Challenge setting and Cardanos' greater mission as well. \nIt would increase users of Cardano based gaming apps by ten or even hundreds of thousands (if 50 (of the mentioned 100) schools sign up each with 2000 (low estimate) students). The mechanism proposed is essentially a play to earn mechanism, but rewarding positive behaviour in the real world - genius! The number of fungible tokens (Littercoins) would increase the total # of FT's and also create a new sub-type of fungible token (Non Trade-able or Limited Fungible Token - as in non trade-able on secondary markets, only in climate neutral shops, maybe the wording could be more positive).\n\nThe proposal doesn't mention how it will scale or become sustainable. Other open questions: how will code maintenance be covered? Who's doing \"Prosumer\" support, how will this be remunerated? How or who will cover costs for future development?

On the other hand the team, especially Sean has shown great commitment and has built trust within the Cardano (4 Climate) community.\nThat's why the assessment score will be higher in comparison to a proposal with the same level of feasibility but a different, not so well known team.\n\nIt remains unclear where additional funding will come from in case development takes longer or needs post production bug fixing et al. Here again I feel that, since this is a passion project that Sean has been diligently working on since Fund4 (also with missing funding from Fund7), these costs will be covered out of his pocket; which I have to subtract some points still as this is not sustainable in the long run, but doesn't impact feasibility too much.\n\nEvidence of relevant skills are presented through github. Project Planning skills however are completely missing from the team, which lowers the score only a bit, for the before mentioned reasons.\n\nThe necessary resources and potential future \"prosumers\" (schools and purpose driven companies) are already at hand - except for the new graphic designer that shouldn't be too difficult to find.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A very rough roadmap with milestones and a 12 month timeline is presented.

Some more thought into how success will be precisely measured (using leading and lagging KPIs, e.g. x amount of schools and companies: have been contacted; signedup; x schools or companies actively engaged, engaged schools rising x% over time) would help the assessment score tremendously. However this might be done during the course of the coordinator or on-boarding meeting.\n\nIt is mentioned how the basic spending of funds is being tracked, but not the project itself or what the funds are specifically spent on.\nThe fact that 50k will pay for 1 full stack and 2 front-end developers for about 12 months reduces the relevance of the sub optimal project tracking situation.

On top of this, by including the element of a circular economy, this application introduces Cardano to anyone with a phone & gamers plus zero waste store merchants who may in turn accept ADA. The educational & competition components bring in generations of new consumers. \"Littercoin is being engineered so that it can be spent in zero waste stores only, making it a climate currency that not only stimulates climate economics but addresses crypto environmental skepticism.\" As an environmentalist seeking a shift away from capitalism based on the few getting \"wealthy\" from the printed paper we are led to believe has some sort of value, Littercoin adds an underappreciated value that is gaining traction amongst forward thinking companies recognizing the importance of impacting climate change and the real eco-nomy: the well-being of the whole.\n\n3. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align with the outlined challenge settings: \"There are 2.5 billion gamers out there.

I also know that projects based on passion & purpose like Open Litter Map will be successful with or without Catalyst funding. I am not one to promote FOMO. However, I feel very strongly that this project is a gamechanger and that we as a Catalyst community & we as ADA holders can allocate the requested funds with a high level of confidence the work will be done & through this project, the Cardano blockchain will gain recognition & adoption from a wider audience than if this project is once again overlooked and funding is by-passed.
