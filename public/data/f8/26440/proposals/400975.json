Creating a marketplace for gamers to choose games that most suit their interests, without having to be in 100 different Discord servers and YouTube channels would be ideal. This would allow an open onboarding experience for gamers that are not privy to blockchain gaming, or Cardano specifically. Conversely, those who are blockchain enthusiasts but casual gamers, will find it refreshing to be able to be presented with a concise selection set of gaming options.\n\nWith that said, the proposer could do a better job of describing the mechanics of the market place. Please describe how the token will be distributed, it's total supply, and how developers and gamers will be rewarded for the work. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Plan given is too vague, as it does not clearly identify the deliverables at each stage in the road map. There is no mock up of the project and it is assumed that the team would be starting from scratch. The timeline given is not realistic. A project such as this would require a much larger team to accomplish the roadmap's plan of launch by September.\n\nThe amounts given for developer salaries seem low, but perhaps it is a result of the location of the proposer and their respective local economies. In addition no details are provided on what platforms or development stacks will be utilized for the project. \n\nNo references, resumes, Linked In accounts, or prior experiences specified for the team. The proposer doesn't provide specifics examples of how their skills relate to the challenge of the proposal. Creating a blockchain based market of games, along with a tokenized game theory will require an amazing amount of study, design, and engineering, especially if it is to scale. In order to be successful it will need to scale as developers will not be interested in building on a platform with little to no usage. \n\n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The points outlined for auditability, although great aspirations, do not directly relate to the project itself. In this section it would be desirable to see what metrics the proposers will be collecting data on, what goals they plan to hit, and how they will communicate that progress back to the Cardano community. I want to believe that creating a gaming market place will eradicate poverty, but the proposer is lacking a demonstration on how their product will achieve that goal. Additionally, eradicating poverty is not a goal or metric of the challenge setting.

In many cases the developers may be focused or interested in writing the gaming part of the game, parts / functions such interaction with the tokenomics ecosystem of the app could be done by others and this grouped arrangement of developers could play well. The idea of the gamers and developers getting a share of the generated revenues is good / appropriate and lends well to solution of the problem statement.\nThis is proposal is aiming high but seems to not have supporting documentation or writeup (or if have not shared as part of proposal) with more details on plan that might be expected of such a project endeavour, including such would have greatly increased its attractiveness for funding.\nI very much like the app idea, the metaverse is certainly in its infancy but has great potential.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The Team members identified seem to be a good mix, the proposal would be greatly enhanced if members developing the code and their experience in working with the Cardano ecosystem were included, without such confidence in success is not as high as it could be.\nThe proposal would greatly benefit from more detailing of each deliverable and how and by who it will be achieved, currently only the key milestones are listed without detail, identifying who was working at each stage with further breakdown of the key components would greatly enhance the proposal and chance of success.\nThe project would also benefit if some example NFT\u2019s were included or a link to a video of them was included.\nThe Airdrop to attract gamers is a plus to the project and more details on this would have been positive.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A good set of Key Metrix are established but no drill down of auditability of them is included. \nExample of auditing against key Metrix of the project might be via bi weekly presentation or call advising status of progress/completion, another might be a specific owner that community could reach out to get status or a webpage publishing the updates.\nAdding such road map or drill down for auditability would greatly improve the proposal thus with current level of input on auditability confidence in success is not high.

Creating a marketplace will require ongoing active maintenance, in-house game development is a huge task, there is no tokenomics structure but mention of a token.

Gamers would earn native tokens by playing the games, and game devs would earn a small part of it. This way, the proposal mentions that both gamers and game devs would have incomes. Although, the proposer doesn\u2019t mention the utilities of the token. How is it going to be used? Fees to pay games? Governance? Based on the information provided, for me it looks like the tokenomics model is not sustainable. The tokens would soon be worth nothing. They also mention NFTs to be used as avatars, which is actually a plus and possibly create revenue for designers as well, but as before, I don\u2019t see the model as sustainable. The proposal, nonetheless, is aligned with the challenge, and the mentioned risk, which is to attract the initial developers, would be solved through an affiliate program. I don\u2019t believe this would be enough to attract people if a solid tokenomics plan is not presented. Overall, I think the idea is good but tokenomics should be worked out better so all the other parts could work.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal has a timeline and milestones to be delivered starting on September 2022. The timing is good and might give the team enough time to build and launch the marketplace, but it would be good to include in the proposal when the development would start, how long it would take and specify when the devs are going to be working, specifically. The budget for each role is well explained, but the background of the team was not provided. They just say the there are people there and that they have already developed some projects in blockchain in the past, but there are no ways to verify it nor their background. Also, it looks like they will need to more game devs that they don\u2019t mention if they are onboarded already or not. To increase the feasibility of this proposal, it should include more details in the roadmap and also more background about the proposing team.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team doesn\u2019t add any way to check the progress of the proposal and audit it, so the community could know how the progress is being done. Some KPIs are provided to measure the success of the game, but there are not any numbers set as goals, and the only number indicated there is to have 10k people earning a full time wage through their platform, which I think is very optimist.
