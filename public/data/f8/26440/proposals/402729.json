These characteristics make it have a well-defined personality, which is essential to form an engaged community around it. In this context, this engaged community can attract greater visibility to the project and consequently to Cardano's ecosystem. We see then that the proposal fits the goals of the challenge in which it finds itself. But we also need to note that this is a very ambitious project because in the description of the proposal it was written that the game could provide gains that change a player's life. This statement seems to be a little contradictory to the idea that the team conveyed, about development, to focus on fun first. Perhaps this ends up bringing additional pressure to the project that is not very beneficial. Regarding the amount being asked of $46,315, we see that it seems reasonable considering the team involved and what they want to accomplish. Let's analyze this further below.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The game market today presents numerous options for a player, many of them even free. Thus, one of the defining factors for the success of a game is its visibility. And looking at the breakdown of the budget, we can see that it is generally aimed at marketing the game. We see that this is a strategy that involves a certain risk, but with it it will be possible to measure if there is an interest behind the game idea and if an engaged community is formed. The adoption of this strategy is also facilitated because the team has the concept of the game and its universe very well defined.\n\nAnd in relation to the team, we can see that it is composed of professionals in general very experienced, and with experience in several areas such as the gaming market itself, but also in the business area. In fact, one of the members, Dimitri Fernando, is already part of the Cardano ecosystem. Looking at the existing materials about the game, we noticed a good construction of concepts, such as the battlefield, the defined bug races and also the idea of \u200b\u200bgenes. The stages of the viability plan are organized into quarters, and we see that the initial quarters are geared towards structuring and forming partnerships, which is quite consistent with the idea of \u200b\u200bputting all the resources into promoting the game. The team also pointed out that some future stages of development cannot yet be defined and depend on past events. This is quite coherent, reminding us that it is a very ambitious project and that without the necessary engagement being achieved, the continuity of the project will certainly be at risk.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "We noticed that the ways chosen to define the success of the game are well defined, because the team understands well where it wants to go in terms of attracting players and exposing the game. We understand this because they were mentioned:\n\n* The expected number of community participants about the game\n\n* The number of players in the closed alpha version\n\n* The time that the closed alpha version will last until it reaches the open alpha and the number of players in this new version.\n\nAnother positive factor for monitoring the proposal is that a possible 'open' development of the game was mentioned, with a streaming demonstrating its production to generate greater proximity to the community and also to obtain feedback from it. The ideas of practicable actions in the future, such as the creation of a metaverse and expansions, demonstrate that the team must also keep a constant monitoring of the project.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 1, "ng": 11, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3311, "q0": "This proposal properly covers the impact aspect of the challenge as it considers a game which provides opportunities such as earning a life-changing income while having fun with your favorite game, or starting your own business-like entity to help others in need of a job.\n\n.   This proposal shows clearly how it will add value to the Cardano System by offering a complex yet fun, interactive and immersive game into the Cardano Game Ecosystem. Also it has partnered with a Beekeeping project to boost rural empowerment and revenue generation, as well as protect the environment and food supply by boosting the bee population and thereby increasing pollination of food crops which reduces due to colony collapse. Therefore I have given this a five star ranking as I am highly confident in its impact", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\nThe scope of work is reasonable and achievable by the team. They have experience of game design, programming, world building, all graphical requirements, business management, and marketing strategy.  Budget is also reasonable and achievable. They have identified contingencies and found ways to mitigate or plan for them.  They have provided evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to complete the project. The budget is required for marketing as they have already invested and are in progress of design of the game.

The proposal also encloses some possible risks for the projects and some viable solutions accompanied.\nHowever, that seems to be where the merits end, since I notice a number of baffling things in this proposal. I believe in order to fascinate players (the main target audience) and investors to pour their resources into this project, the proposer should include these following content in their proposal:\nInformation regarding how the game functions. To be specific, the gameplay mechanism, game lore, game settings, interactive features, game modes, quests, and so on. So far, this section of the proposal looks to be inadequate.\nSome figures of core metrics measurement or estimation. If the funding were to be approved, what achievements would the project initially gain? Namely, what would be the number of a user base, what actions need to be done for the integration of Cardano or how much value can the players earn and how much profit would be gained for Cardano?\n\nAnd I suppose there is a more formal way of expression rather than \u201cCardano Goes to Crap\u201d.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I do agree that the proposer has managed to lay out a detailed plan for this project, with a timeline and milestones for each phase of the project. What\u2019s interesting to me is the proposer\u2019s willingness to leave out the year 2023 in their foreseeable future, even though they do acknowledge that they will alter the project and road map depending on how the situation looks at the end of 2022. Nevertheless, the requested money for the execution of the project appears to be justifiable, providing that the information related to the team members\u2019 background and expertise is plentiful and detailed (I highly commend the inclusion of each member\u2019s LinkedIn profile).\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In regards to project clarity, the team has delivered a transparent and specific description of the 4 phases, each with particular tasks and success criteria. I absolutely welcome the idea of progressing the project \u201cin public\u201d, as it offers the chance for the audience, investors and those appealed to observe the entire process as it happens, even giving the community the decisions to be part of the process as well.

You don\u2019t focus on the main functions of ZiberBugs, how it works and most importantly, there is no mention of the target audience here. With this poor content, I believe that investors can\u2019t capture enough knowledge of your game. Besides, the proposer is capable of acknowledging five biggest challenges that his/her team could encounter in the process and their possible solutions. However, he/she should put forward these solutions corresponding to each hurdle instead of putting all of them into one separate section so that readers can figure out which solution can be applied to resolve marketing failure, legal issues, or technical errors.One more problem, to some extent, the key metrics that he/she introduced doesn\u2019t seem to match with those of the challenge.

Who are they? When you listed some of the core members in your teams like CEO, developer, graphic designer with detailed background, you shouldn\u2019t ignore introducing other people. The first reason is that this neglect may cause them to feel disrespected in an organization, and the second and most vital one is that fundraisers couldn\u2019t capture enough information of these remaining people. They should know their working experiences and highlight achievements to consider whether they are competent to this project or not. The budget allocation list is acceptable but if you would like to convince investors, I suggest adding more information to this part, such as how much you will pay your team, what will be included in service and agency fee. Similarly, your timeline for the development of the project should be detailed in every quarter of the year.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The request in this section is to describe how you will measure the progress and the development of the project. So the main content that you need to concentrate on here is the measurement for people to keep track of your project. Particularly, you only give a general introduction of phases or required tasks of the whole process without specific tools to measure. Taking your answer to the definition of success into account, it can be seen clearly that you succeeded in building and maintaining a 10000-people community of initial members interested in playing your game.

The proposal has delivered the idea very thoroughly. They have brought up all the questions that can be asked about this proposal and its aspect and given out some very reasonable answers. The project has a clear developing plan, aims and targets. Moreover, it also shows its potential to benefit Cardano with a NFT gaming space building by actual game designers. The team is also having their feet on the ground. I\u2019m with them when it comes to all the foreseeable challenges that they have addressed. Especially, they don\u2019t underestimate the marketing tasks because it\u2019ll genuinely be make-or-break of literally every game launching. It\u2019s going to be well expensive, but if it\u2019s done well, it\u2019ll be a huge paid off. There are also of course a lot of other difficulties but fortunately, the proposer has already had some solutions planned for that and I think for now, all of those solutions make senses. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In term of feasibility, it\u2019s a multiphase project and i can see that the team has it all planned out.

The timeline of this project is built following closely to the idea, Every task is outlined clearly with descriptions of exactly what to do, what to expect. There are milestones stated clearly. With a decent team that has all relevant skills and experiences, I believe that the project proof of concept can succeed as outlined. For the budget breakdown, in my opinion, i think it should be a little bit more details and follow the roadmap a bit more closely, so that we can justify the requested amount better. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer has provided a very clear phases map for the community to follow and audit the project in the future.

The reason is very simple. It is because the author of this one has actively posed questions and answers aligning with key factors that Cardano\u2019s stakeholders may want to know before deciding to fund this. I am not saying that those kinds of information do not appear in other proposals, however, instead of writing a whole passage describing the idea as a whole, the author chose to provide it in the Q&A format, which eventually results in a well-organized, easy-to-read proposal. As far as I understand, the proposed solution here is to create Ziber Bugs - an NFT Autobattler game making it possible for its players to earn life-changing income or engage in business-like entities for experience gaining while simultaneously enjoying their favourite games. Despite the fact that the form of expression is good, the content, on the contrary, does lack sufficient details about the most important part - the game itself. In the whole proposal appears no specific description explaining how the game works; what are its functionalities/features; which technology, architecture is required to build it; how it connects with the Cardano ecosystem;... Besides, the part where the author mentions the value that this project can provide to the Cardano ecosystem also needs to be clarified, as simply stating out \u201cThe gaming industry is currently bigger than both sports and movies combined\u201d is both vague and unreliable (no link to article/statistic attached). Those above certainly are fields for improvement, and I hope the team can do better in the next proposal. My rating for this is 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In regards to details of the given roadmap, I am confident to say that the team does provide us with a clear overview explaining the steps and phases in its plan. The roadmap is logical and understandable, split into 6 quarters (1.5 years) starting from Q3 2021 and culminating in Q4 2022 with specific tasks for the team to finish. It is also important to notice that the author does mention that the roadmap is not fixed with probable adjustments in details, later inclusion of entries and the scope that may expand further as the project moves along. Additionally, although the project has the potential to develop even further than the year 2022, instead of drawing some gorgeous outlook about its success in the future, the author, chose the truth saying that it is irresponsible to predict that far at this time. This indicates the experience and reliability of the team, and they are also really serious and enthusiastic about this project. Being not too detailed and not too general with an estimated total requested fund allocated towards different parts, the budget breakdown in this proposal would be good if Marketing is the only expense of a project. Although I know that the initial fund that goes to Marketing is a \u201cmake-or-break\u201d for the team, the solutions proposed by the team itself to help cope with foreseen problems and challenges, such as \u201cWork closely with jurisdiction experts to set us up in the best jurisdiction legally \u201d or \u201cEmploy senior developers from companies such as Google, Amazon Prime Video and King\u201d, will undoubtedly require a lot of money as well. And though the team already has 3 members with multi-year experience proven by their attached LinkedIn links, they will still need more people to support them in such a big project, and that is another source of expenditure.

More importantly, the stream chat will be the place where the game at early stages is released for trying out and the community\u2019s opinions towards certain decisions are received and concerned.

That the Zitterbugs platform has 1000 alfa testers  (but presumably not on any blockchain) as mentioned in its March 13 news article is positive.

Is there a company submitting this proposal or a person with a consultant  promising to raise funds from the Cardano Treasury (with no cost or risk)? Full disclosure would make the proposal seem more feasible.\n\nThe Bi-weekly Progress Update Report #1  published recently (Mar 13th) by the game developer (co-proposer) reveals that this 9 month development month (see goals) project can not go forward without significant additional funding.  \"We have now accumulated over $30k, which will get us started in a proper marketing initiative.\" https://medium.com/@ZiberBugs/bi-weekly-progress-update-report-1-a0db422e319e . More than half of the funds requested in this proposal are to finance \"influencer fees,\" \"PR Agency fees\" and 'Services fees.\" Requesting money to raise money implies very uncertain financing. The proposal would be stronger if the funding was being raised to develop the game itself. And not to pay \"influencers.\"\n\nTaken all together, though the game might be terrific, I strongly disagree that the proposal is feasible.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Rating = 1 star.\n\nThe co-proposer has been revealed as a consultant to the project, not a part of the actual developers.

We are delighted to inform you that we will be applying for funds this round. Our proposal is coming together well, and we have numerous town hall meetings scheduled where we\u2019re going to talk about our project.\"\n\nWith that information it would be important to understand the role of the consultant with respect to the budgeted funds requested. Is he the beneficiary of the $20,000 \"influencer fee\", or the beneficiary of the $10,000 \"services fee\", or the PR Agency fee $9,315 (an unusually exact number for a service not yet signed)? \n\nNot that there is something wrong with those roles, necessarily, but details of the efforts (just as a project plan would present) should be revealed to the assessors and the voters.\n\nThe March 13th Medium article only a few days ago reveals that no agencies have been engaged.
