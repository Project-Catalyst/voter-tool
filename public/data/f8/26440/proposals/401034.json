However, despite the lofty intention, this proposal does not do well in terms of clarifying its solution. The content is mostly about how it will use the money raised, assure transparency to the public or protect its privacy and data from hackers but barely gives a clear overview of the most important part - the game itself. There is scarcely information about its gameplay or method of raising funds and attracting public attention. The Website/Github repository attached with this proposal is also poorly made with almost nothing about the project except for an email address to contact the team in case somebody may want to send a message. This leaves the author room for further improvements, and I believe with some enhancements this proposal is able to provide the Cardano ecosystem with great value since it is already a great, potential idea being closely aligned with the challenge.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "First of all, it is fair to say that the team really did well in terms of separating the whole progress into smaller phases following a logical order being Fund - Prelaunch - Website launch - Stalking and Scaling. They also describe very carefully what needs to be done and the results or milestones to reach after each phase, which indicates an experienced and reliable team. However, I would only ask the team if they can put in some pieces of information about the time needed to complete each phase, hence this roadmap can gain more reliability. Secondly, the budget breakdown is another bright spot in this proposal since it does not only describe the allocation of funds toward different parts of the project but also describe what those parts look like and how they contribute to the whole project. I also love the creative idea of a \u201cRecycle System\u201d as an in-game feature, which offers players a chance to acquire more valuable NFTs by taking risks to upgrade. Last but not least, the information about the team provided in the proposal is detailed, the required skills and abilities for working in this project was clearly described showing that this team fully understand and are enthusiastic about what they are doing.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding auditability, the author does mention the clarity of the project will be ensured by putting shareable information and a detailed roadmap on Github as well as a progress bar on the information site so that community can easily keep track of the progress. The method is indeed amazing, however, there are no specific metrics or KPIs provided so that people and stakeholders can not only track the progress but can also evaluate the effectiveness of the team, thus assessing its future potential. Overall I think the traceability of the project might be a little troublesome unless the author can deliver some reliable and detailed numbers.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1716", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 400, "q0": "The purpose of the proposal is to use blockchain for the commercialization of NFT's within a game that has a social initiative to help children's working conditions. With that, we realized that the proposal fits the goals of the challenge in question. In addition, the possible success of the game could bring greater visibility to Cardano's technology in the long term and influence other projects with similar purposes to also use this technology.\n\nHowever, although the budget of $10,000 is not exorbitant for the realization of what was proposed, we realized that some fundamental points were not fulfilled so that the game had more chances of success. We were able to notice throughout the proposal that there is clearly a great objective to help children with the project's income. However, fundamentally, this revenue will come through the marketing of NFT's of the game and it would need to have some relevant differentials to attract a good amount of players. We know that the game is a combat between players, but beyond that we don't have much information about how things happen.\n\nThere are some doubts in the air such as: what is the story behind the game? How will players fight each other? What are the forms of interaction between players? How will the gameplay be? It seems that some steps in the elaboration of the idea were skipped and there was a lot of concern about how to market the game before making it more attractive.\n\nSo, it would be more interesting if the team could better structure the game's story and try to engage a community of future players before putting so much effort into the NFT concept.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Regarding the project team, we can mention as a positive point the recognition that some of the concepts to be used in the project are not very well understood by the team, and that, therefore, more specialized professionals are needed in these areas. However, a worrying factor is: one of the central points of the project is the marketing of NFT clothing and the team points out that it has never had a business in this area before.\n\nDuring the elaboration of the stages, we see a clear concern with the dissemination and marketing of the project, including one of the objectives is to establish a public relations team to promote the game. But the predominant characteristic of the ideas described in the feasibility of the project is still that a lot of efforts and planning are being directed to more advanced stages in terms of marketing game items.\n\nWe observed a plan regarding how many coins will be released, how they can be traded, what security holes there may be in the system, but it was not established what the lore of the game would be according to the team, as well as this role was not assigned to any professional specifically. On the project website we can find an email to contact about the project: nfclothing2021@gmail.com\n\nBut it is not possible to easily find the resumes of the professionals involved in the project. Regarding the budget breakdown, we have a plausible distribution of the amount that was requested, with the largest capital allocations going to design ($3,000) and development ($4,500). However, we couldn't see a cost being directed towards creating the game's story.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "As a way to measure the game's progress, the team has established that there are very detailed goals to be met, and that the results of these goals will be posted periodically on the project's website. This seems like a good plan in a game project, which really involves a lot of updates, which the community should be aware of.\n\nHowever, we noticed that some parameters were not established that could inform us if the game is really reaching certain achievements. For example, it was not established how many players are planned to reach at launch, the amount of clothes traded, how much these trades would move or what engagement generated by the game on social networks.\n\nIt seems interesting for the project that the game's lore is better modeled and that initially the greatest efforts are focused on this aspect of storytelling before properly entering the scope of NFT's.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3586, "q0": "This is by far one of the few projects that aims towards a noble and humane cause, which is improving the living conditions of the unfortunate children in Bangladesh, and the proposer claims that the total revenue generated will flow straight towards. And I\u2019m also quite surprised to find that this is the first project I\u2019ve seen where the game doesn\u2019t target a specific group or crowd in the gaming community, but rather focuses on an age group (a rather big one at that), which should boast availability and accessibility. The proposal is also able to put forward a possible obstacle to the success of the project, and encloses an associated solution, though I\u2019m not quite sure if that should address the problem entirely.\nThat seems to be where the merits end, as I spot the following shortcomings in this proposal:\n\nGiven that this project is categorized as a \u201cbattle game\u201d in the title, the proposal doesn\u2019t comprise any specific details regarding the gameplay, game lore and setting(s) or reward mechanism. In order to captivate the attention of gamers, I believe those sets of categories are necessary for a quick visualization of the game. \nI highly doubt if the target audience really fits into the main objective. For the most part, I find the adults and elderly tend to focus on more crucial aspects of life such as work, family or socializing rather than gaming. And as mentioned above, the proposal lacks heavily on the details, which will be difficult when it comes to attracting the remaining age group of gamers.\nWhile the aim of the project is honorable, this is still pitched to be Cardano-based. So it is pivotal that details of the benefits that Cardano can expect to acquire from this project are included and highlighted in the proposal, which is something I find missing. Plus, core metrics for the measurement of initial success of the project are also not present.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "From the content provided in this section, I must say that each stage of the plan consists of highly specific steps and tasks, all of which guarantee to deliver the desirable outcome. Still, I could always use the addition of a timeline and respective milestones. The budget breakdown includes 4 sections, all of which enclose relevant information that justifies their allocations of the budget, and the total number sounds alright. The team is divided into 3 groups, each with certain duties and tasks, though I feel the proposer should have been more generous with the details.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In terms of auditability, I believe the team has possessed a certain extent, as evidenced in the use of GitHub and their own website and the inclusion of the community in keeping track of the progress. And of course, the envisioned success includes the end results that the main objective of this project sets out and the adoption of an active community to Cardano, though the former tends to receive more focus and details than the latter, which is unfortunate since the likelihood of getting the budget approved requires them both to be equally concentrated.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1664", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3762, "q0": "I'm quite impressed with the idea that the game's motive is to support the children in Bangladesh have better working conditions.\nHowever, the features of the game have not been described specifically, how the game works has not been mentioned.

In addition, the team needs to show more metrics for us to have a better vision about the proposal\u2019s possibilities to align with the challenge. One more thing to be talked about is: the team didn\u2019t address all of the risks generally, only one risk of hacking are shown without a reasonable solution. There are lots of other risks that can happen during a game project such as: delays, cost overruns, coder and designer risks or changes in the game market, etc. More risks and solutions will need providing to make this proposal a higher score in Impact and also can help the gamers chained.
