It\u2019s going to be a dungeon crawler type of game, and there is very good explanation about the gameplay in the IdeaFest video attached to the proposal. This is a project that\u2019s been voted previously and is very known in the Catalyst community. The team focus on creating a good community, grow organically and to develop the game based on what is expected by the players, which creates a very good feedback loop. The KPIs stated are very well aligned with the challenge and are a good way to measure the success of the proposal. Besides, knowing very well they target audience really helps on creating the best marketing and growth strategy possible. The mentioned challenges and risks make sense based on the development proposed in the game, and the solutions to them are also appropriate to handle them.

They mentioned that these rates and time are based on previous experience, which gives more confidence that they are accurate. The presented experience of the team is great, and they are already delivering other parts of the project, so we know they are capable of doing this. They have also added a list of all freelancers that might work on this project, depending on their availability, and links to their profiles in LinkedIn. Overall, the information provided in the proposal makes me believe it\u2019s very likely that they will deliver what they are promising here.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposing team included an explanation about how they are going to handle the project management internally, based on JIRA, GitHub and Confluence. Although, some information about how this is going to be reported to the community is missing.

The success of the proposal is defined as the accomplishment of all defined milestones, what makes sense, and the metrics included in the impact section are a good way to measure the adoption of the game, although they are related to other proposals that also influence these KPIs.

We need to see what AdaQuest is by clicking into the link https://ada-quest.com/ to see the first mode ARENA, to understand how cool it is (playing free without any paywall, being easy and user-friendly, involving the community into the development). Besides, I found this: after successful implementation of the project ARENA since Fund5, this round of Fund, the AdaQuest authors propose 8 proposals (6 proposals for ARENA mode and 2 proposals for Phase 2 of AdaQuest). I think we should read all of them to understand the AdaQuest project as a whole.

This proposal not only fits the challenge \u201cGamers On - Chained\u201d but also add value to the Cardano ecosystem because if it is successful, the project will help to increase: number of users of gaming based applications built on Cardano, number of CNFTs made specifically for gaming, number of fungible tokens made specifically for gaming, which are in the success metrics of the challenge.

Especially they delivered the first mode ARENA successfully and truly great, I think that is the strongest evidence to prove the project is in expert hands. The clearly understandable plan allows us to see what need to be done and what are the goals of each month in a chronological order in term of 2 months. The target groups as well as the interesting marketing strategy are also explained reasonable.
