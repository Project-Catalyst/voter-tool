While this project would most definately benefit AdaQuest, which is great, the process of sharing a sound tech with other Fund 8 projects might cause more questions than it answers, invalidating the initial thesis behind the proposal. For example, how many other Fund 8 projects would this actually benefit and how would the final quality of the effects be determined? These challenges are mentioned but no solution to them is provided. Would suggest opening this up as a generic fantasy sound library with an open license that can be used for free by other Cardano projects and not just Fund 8 projects, and giving more explicit  details about the licensing terms.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal aims to collect feedback from other Fund 8 projects with similar sound needs and hiring a sound designer for a couple of months which seems pretty straightforward. While I assume that this covers the sound needs for AdaQuest, it is less clear how much time is allocated for other Fund 8 projects to request sound work and how this would be handled.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposals main metric for success is the creation of a sound effects library, however it is not very clearly described how it would measure it's usefulness to other game projects.  The AdaQuest team has received funding in other proposals in the past as well.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_142", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3593, "q0": "For starters, I agree with the proposer\u2019s narrations on the SFX situations in the modern day gaming scene, and it\u2019s true that sound effects have a big impact on the overall gameplay experience. You can have the most amazing gameplay mechanism, the most visually attractive graphics or even the most engaging game lore but if you fail to deliver equally phenomenal sound effects, then your game is going to crash down and burn sooner or later. But in order to have such sound effects, you\u2019re going to need a handful of talented sound designers. And this is where this project fits in.\nHowever, providing a suitable context, I believe, is not adequate for a proposal with effective persuasiveness. Therefore, I strongly suggest the proposer add to the proposal the following sets of information (some are posed as questions):\nHow exactly would this project go down? For example, given that the target audience is sound designers, where would be the target market segments to look for them? Or how exactly would the designers work, would they work together on a project or independently with provided equipment? Furthermore and more importantly, how would Cardano benefit well from this project?\nThe missing of key metrics to anticipate some form of success for this project, for example, an estimated number of sound designers joining the project or number of sound effects produced in a set period of time (even though this might be difficult to come up with).\nWhile the proposal lists a number of potential challenges and risks to the project, there is yet to be any satisfactory resolution(s) for them at all.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Given that this is not exactly an ambitious project, but more of a necessary side project, I would assume that the given plan, timeline and milestones are relevant. The information of the two active participants in this project is sufficient, including background checks, valid expertise and associated LinkedIn profiles to further verify everything. Combining those 2 well-done criteria together, plus the claim that calculations and considerations are based on past experience, I would argue that the project suffices in practicality to be granted the requested budget", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In terms of clarity, I would safely state that this proposal handles this standard moderately well, as illustrated via the utilization of tracking tools such as JIRA, GitHub and Confluence, and popular social media communication platforms such as Discord and Telegram, not only useful for tracking progress but also for public access. However, while this project sees its success serving its initial aim of providing a quality sound effect system, which makes sense, once again the proposer has left out the part that mentions the kinds of benefits and profits that Cardano is expected to reap from this project. Unfortunately, this makes it difficult for me to assign a good rating.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1664", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5350, "q0": "The team has experienced themselves that creating an enthralling game is not an easy task, especially when it comes to finding sounds and tunes that fit the mood of your game. With their proposal there are addressing this problem. The idea is to create a diverse sound library that will be made available to all Gamers On \u2013 Chained projects. Therefore, this proposal addresses the challenge, albeit indirectly by providing a sound framework based on which other game developers can create more immersive game environments. Thus, it is possible that with this sound library better games will be developed, and more gamers will be attracted to the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team proposes to deliver the sound library within a three months time frame. The requested budget is slightly higher than one would expect. However, the proposal has put emphasis on hiring an experienced sound designer who might be harder to get and thus more expensive. Although both team members have gained different experiences in game ecosystems, the feasibility of this proposal will strongly depend on the quality of the hired freelancer. Thus, the successful implementation is not guaranteed, albeit it seems possible and likely. \n\nAnother aspect that should be considered is that the team will include ideas from the community. This could in principle pose a minor hurdle in the development of the library. A too large diversity of sounds (as potentially requested by the community) could make it difficult to deliver the final sound library within the indicated time frame. \nOverall, I think the implementation (with the requested funds) will be possible if the team has a clear vision for the product and can hire a proficient and experienced developer.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In the proposal, the team states that they will use well-known tools (such as Github or Confluence) for progress tracking. Unfortunately, no links to the respective Github repositories are provided but potentially will be made public in the governance phase. A link to the webpage is available. \n\nMoreover, no clear milestones are set, and the \u201cinternal roadmap\u201d seems a bit vague to me. It would have been nice to see this roadmap or at least few milestones specified. It is stated that reports will be communicated with the community via social media channels, but as no milestones are set at the moment, I am not entirely sure how the progress can be audited. \nIn addition, there are no clear metrics that define the success of the progress except for the development of sound library itself. How can one measure the usefulness of the library? And how can one know whether it actually satisfies the needs of the game developer community? A potential idea could have been to directly test it with other game developers and obtain feedback from them. Alternatively, the proposal could have outlined several key metrics (e.g. number of sounds, number of variations, number of categories and so on). \n\nOverall, this section of the proposal was quite short and vague and important milestones or KPIs are missing.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1939", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6231, "q0": "This proposal goal is to create SFX library specifically for RPG fantasy game. Creating high quality SFX from scratch can be time consuming and costly, but it is a vital part in any gaming product to set the mood and enhance the experience of its players/users. In that regard,  the idea here is to create a library not only for ADAquest but also for all projects in gamers on-chained, which giving back great value for the community as a whole. This will not only help the independent devs to save time and money but also attract more people to develop their games on Cardano.  Moreover the openness of the proposer to collaborate with other game developer to produce the SFX library together makes it a commendable proposal. Therefore, this proposal addresses and are aligned with the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the background of the team members, experienced working with well known game studios and companies, they are very capable on executing the project. Moreover, the proposer knows the required manpower and resources needed to successfully implement the plan. Furthermore, the budget requested is reasonable for the value it would bring to the community. Its budget is well presented and clearly articulated. The plan on what and  how it will be executed is straight forward and feasible. The proposer also offers realistic timeframe to complete the work. In addition, the proposer already weighs in the risks and challenges of executing the plan, to create a library that not only fits AdaQuest but for all. With that being said, they should plan to react accordingly to cater the needs of other game devs as a whole without jeopardizing the main objectives of creating the library for AdaQuest.
