I think a part of the proposal that sums up the project well is the following: \u201cwe can collect user data only by completing daily tasks and challenges that are selected by healthcare professionals. The results of completing tasks are scored and added to the Crypt's health. The more the user engages with the game, the more he becomes aware of his state of health, as the Crypt is essentially a representation of himself from the tasks he has completed.\u201d However, I think the general explanation of how the game would work is still pretty sketchy. What would these phases look like? What tasks, for example, would the player have to complete from one stage to the next? What kind of information would be attached? Would this information be recorded on the Cardano blockchain, so would it be visible to everyone? This worries me a little bit, because if it was information about the players' health, they might not feel comfortable making it public. Another point I would like to comment on is that it is not clear how Cardano's technologies would be used here. Proponents claim that the game was all thought to have been architected on web3, however, it is not explained directly how Cardano's blokchain would be used, if the characters would be CNFTs, if there would be payments in Ada and etc. Of course, they provide a whitepaper, but there are 17 pages, it is a little unfeasible for us to read all the content present there. I've read a few things, but it would be far more appropriate for the proponents to make it very clear which Cardano technologies would be used and how they would be built into the game's dynamics. Therefore, my opinion is that the idea is good and innovative, deserving our attention, in fact this is one of the few proposals in the field of games that have to do with the universe of health; however, more detail is needed both on how it would be built, how its gameplay would be, how the phases would be, what the objectives would be and especially how all this would relate to our blockchain. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The script of this proposal is rather superficial. In three months, we know that prototyping will take place. However, how would this task be carried out? What exactly would happen in month 1, and 2, and 3? Which professionals would be involved here, doing what small tasks to make the prototyping process possible? What would your work routines be like? In the fifth month, the alpha test would take place. Who would test the game? How would feedback be received, and how would potential changes be implemented? Anyway, I think that the entire game development process is explained in a very superficial way, being necessary that the proponents explain in detail what would need to be done to compose each activity, and it would also be better if they determined monthly instead of a division of longer time. The budget is also explained very thinly, for example $10,000 is asked for Art Styling and Asset Creation. How much would go to Art Syling, and how much to asset creation? It's because? What would the working day of those involved in these tasks be like, for how many days a week would they be working on it, and for how many hours a day? Will the Cardano community have access to the drafts of these phases? How would the assets be created, who would need to do small tasks for this to happen, what justifies this price? 25 thousand dollars are requested for the development of game features, however, it would be necessary for the proponents to explain what this phase is exactly, which small tasks added together would result in this development, which features would be being developed, how long would it take on average for each if one were work and how much would be charged per resource... Anyway, the way the use of the financing is passed on, we cannot understand the need for such a high investment, it would be essential for the authors of the proposal to argue better why each part would cost each amount request. And finally, speaking of the team, it's about two people, I liked this part, I think the curriculum of each one was very well detailed and in which areas they work, but I would like linkedin or some kind of Marco's portfolio Valmora was provided. Through these pages, we can verify the information that was said. In summary, I think the only adequate part of the feasibility is the presentation of the duo, the script and budget being very superficial and in need of a lot of improvement. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposed ways of auditing progress are quite satisfactory, these are \u201cannouncements on a discord server and emails to subscribers\u201d and \u201cregular reports within the catalyst on the progress of the process\u201d. I think these reports should be provided to members of the Cardano community even if there is not the success that was expected, as it is only fair that, if the proposal is funded, we have constant updates on the tasks that were performed and the small goals that were achieved. , at least once a month. Regarding the final scenario, they say that success would be measured if the game prototype was running and being played. This worries me... would the 50 thousand dollars requested be just for building a prototype? So for the final version of the game, would more investment be needed? Talking now about the impact, directly, how can we see if the game was a means of popularizing our blockchain? Would proponents need to devise some way of proving whether Cardano has in fact benefited from this initiative, and if so, how, what changes are notable, how can we see them in practice? They need to do research and point out exactly the consequences of the game for our community, if new active members were added, if the number of transactions on our blockchain increased, if more Adas are being bought and delegated, if new CNFTs were created and traded. ... Anyway, unfortunately I think that about success, everything is still very abstract, it is necessary for the duo of authors to define exact ways in which we could perceive the real impacts of the project on Cardano's blockchain. Therefore, my opinion is that the auditability of the process is excellent, but the final results leave much to be desired, requiring a total reformulation of this specific part. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 5, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3056, "q0": "The problem addressed here is that people need to be made aware of their health status.

And since the game utilizes the Cardano-based blockchain system, it aims to attract blockchain users from the healthcare industry, matching the challenge setting, while making healthcare and wellness products more affordable and available worldwide, which is a noble cause. \nHowever, I believe there are some key elements missing from this proposal.\n1) While the proposal does state the validity of given tasks and what they represent in the game, there seems to be a lack of details regarding core features of the game like gameplay or reward mechanism. For example, what exactly would those tasks be or what sorts of rewards will be granted to players when their pets achieve a certain level of growth?\n2) Even though a considerable joining of users to Cardano is listed as part of the ultimate goal, yet there is no evidence, in the form of KPIs or metrics, to back up this statement. I suggest adding some, for instance, an estimation of an initial user base or what kinds of CNFTs will be utilized in the game.\n3) I notice that the proposal does list a potential challenge to the project, and while that sounds pressing, the proposal has not yet been provided with a suitable solution to eliminate or at least mitigate the problem.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Provided from the given road map, I would argue that this project is not teeming with useful information in terms of the development process.

In addition, the timeline seems to be quite vague, not specifying what year or quarters will the project expect to begin taking place.

I\u2019m also not sure whether or not the social impact which they talked about is eligible enough to address the challenge. About the possible risks, they have foreseen them.

This challenge helps Cardano's goal of boosting the number of gaming-based applications produced on Cardano and speeding the growth and expansion of the developer and app ecosystem. The proposal is well-written and planned, with such a clear aim and DOES that add value to the Carnado ecosystem that corresponds with the problem description. The proposer wishes to create a game that aggregates personal data in order to facilitate data collecting, user involvement, and adherence. They may acquire data from users simply by completing common activities and challenges designed by healthcare professionals using DIDs and Semantic database architecture. Games that make health tracking more enjoyable and straightforward. The measurements left something to be desired, despite the fact that they are in accordance with the challenge set, and several crucial metrics remain unfulfilled, although this is not a major issue.

As ideas, the team should provide some description of how the project will be done and the entire procedure that will be followed. This demonstrates to voters that you are taking this seriously. In terms of what will be done, for how long, and in what sequence, we have provided a breakdown into months and the primary activities that will be completed during those times, but because this is a very large and complicated project, it is critical that these phases be more comprehensive. For example, I consider how this project would be marketed; it is a really nice product with a lot of promise, but how would it come to the creators' attention? And how would the benefits of using it be presented? How will the prototyping process be carried out?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team does not define direct key performance indicators (KPIs) to track project achievement. What we have here is that subscribers will be informed of progress via announcements on a Discord server and emails. They will invite community testers to play the game and submit qualitative feedback. If the initiative is successful, there will be regular reporting on its development inside the catalyst. However, because we don't know what these occurrences are, there is no assurance that they will be tracked. For the most part, the primary measures are not quantitative, but the success criteria are appropriate. To improve the problem, clearly define how the success criteria address the difficulty and how metrics might track progress toward the success criterion.
