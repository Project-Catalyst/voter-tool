And I state this comment for a number of reasons. \nFirst and foremost, I would like to point out that to my knowledge of the gaming world, I haven\u2019t seen a lot of renowned titles that sport the Tower Defense genre, so this \u201cmarket segment\u201d could very well be worth the attention. And with the introduction of a play-to-earn cryptocurrency-based mechanism, the appeal should grow even stronger. \nThe second part that this proposal nails is the specification of the features and content of the game. Namely, the listings include, in presented order, the actions that players can make to generate passive revenue from the game by making use of their NFTs characters and land assets, the gameplay mechanism which recites various PvP-based game modes, main objectives and tasks, and a very reasonable reward system focusing on the native token of the game, $SPIZE, which can be used to deploy to other actions in the game. My personal favorite feature has to go the Create-To-Earn game mode, since not only is it uniquely native to the game, but it also requires players to tap into their creativity resource in order to customize their land assets into a challenging battlefield for other players.\nLast but not least, the team also lays down some fundamental problems that the challenge may face in the foreseeable future, followed by a very intricate description of how the team plans to solve those problems. My kudos.\nAnd I believe that this project shall align comfortably with the main objective of this challenge, further supported by the given figure of a core metric to measure, which is an estimated 50,000 people for a user base, though I suppose more figures as such would further solidify this proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From the road map provided, I can safely claim that the project should be expected to meet a resounding success, as approximately 50% of the project has been finished prior to this proposal, although I would suggest the proposer add some envisioned milestones for each stage of the process, or at least for the 2 phases. As for the requested budget, the amount of money required for each stage is very organized, however, I think it would be grasped more quickly if the proposer listed each part under specific numbers rather than percentages. Over at the team member section, the information given is quite sufficient, providing the background and expertise relevant to the project of each member, yet for further verification and reassurance I recommend adding a dedicated website link to respective profiles. Having considered everything, I am confident that the requested budget is fairly grounded.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In regard to this matter, even though there are criteria from which the team can measure progress and development, I believe that the for the sake of achieving full clarity in the eyes of the community, I\u2019m not sure if the Github link provided at the top of the proposal is also for the community to keep track of progress or only accessible by the team, so some specifics on that note would be appreciated. Other than that, according to the proposal, the Cardano blockchain is highly guaranteed by the desired success of the project, as demonstrated by the core metrics chosen by the team, all of which also share similarities to the ones in the challenge setting", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1664", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 3, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3825, "q0": "The proposer aims is to make a blockchain tower defense game. Some following points in the proposal that makes me believe they have good foundation for success:\n- tower defense is a classic game genre that can attract entry level gamers\n- combining with deck building element which will keep seasoned players insterested as well\n- PVP mode is a new mechanic in this genre that makes the game stands out from competiors\n- the ability to attract content creators and encourage input from players with create-to-earn system\nOn top of that, understanding the Oversupply of Gamefi projects in the market, the team also point out a clear emphasis on community building - an essential element often get overlooked by many proposers. \nFor those reasons, I think that this proposal has high potential.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team provided a clear plan with many action points completed in advance. This show the preparedness and commitment of the team. I see that there is a game trailer completed but can't find it on website. My suggestion is to include it in the proposal so we can have a view on how the game would look like.\nThere is a very detailed budget breakdown for phase 1 with $300k investment which I find reasonable. The proposer expects to spend $USD 1-2mil raised from selling NFT, Private Sales. This heavily depends on how well phase 1 and the market positivity at the time, so quite unpredictable I would add. Considering the enormous budget required, the team could elaborate more about the scope of 2nd phase and from that, justify the $1-2mil budget.\nThe team provided the qualifications and experience of each member whose backgrounds are very diverse and impresive. Although there were no profile link provided, I can verify via websearch which is legit", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team suggest a list of metrics for both for phase 1 and phase 2 separately. They all match the challenge success metrics quite well and reflect the preparedness of the team accordingly.

It intends to solve some of the recurrent issues that we see in the other games, like unsustainable economy and boring games. It aims at offering also governance mechanisms, career path for gamers, competitive and fun game and a create-to-earn mechanism. The latter would be a passive income for gamers who manage to create compelling enough maps so other players would pay a fee to make use of it. Also, they want to bring back a legacy kind of game, which is tower defense, and it will be very compelling specially for more veteran gamers (which has a large interception with crypto community). They mention a mini-game as well, but don\u2019t provide much details. The mechanics of the main game are well described and very similar to traditional Town Defense games, so the gaming experience will probably be very pleasant. They also describe the utilities of the token and mention that they would be enough to guarantee the economic sustainability of the game (I\u2019m not sure about that), and describe one of them, which is the mentioned create-to-earn mode, which is indeed well thought and quite interesting. They cover the main risks for the game: the development of Cardano itself, and the amount of games being developed, and the solutions proposed solutions are good: migrate temporarily to another blockchain (not ideal but understandable) and focus on delivering the game (since they mention a lot of games are currently more marketing than anything else).", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal presents a high level roadmap and milestones, which is not very detailed and might make it difficult for the community to keep track of the progress. Although, the steps listed there are good and aligned with what\u2019s proposed to be developed. They provide an estimate of a total of $300k to be spent on Phase 1 of the development, but they ask for $150k in the proposal and don\u2019t mention the reason behind this difference. There\u2019s a NFT sale planned, but that\u2019s just for after Phase 1. Also, some milestones of Phase 1 are already complete, and it\u2019s not clear if they are included in the $300k or not. The lead team seems to be very experienced and capable, although there aren\u2019t links to validate their background. Also, since this is the lead team, they are probably not going to do the \u2018hands-on\u2019 part of the work and they don\u2019t mention how the actual working team is, or if they are going to still look for people. This could be clarified.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposing team mentions that the audit of the proposal could be done through the delivery of the milestones mentioned in the proposal, what is fair.

Also, it was not clear previously that phase 2 in actually included in the proposal, since only phase 1 would required more than the requested budget of the entire proposal. The success criteria is the successful development of mini game and main game, as well as having a fair amount of players in the ecosystem. Some metrics for the next months would be good, because they mention 10k to 15k players but don\u2019t define a timeframe for that achievement. Also for phase 2 there\u2019s a similar problem, they describe some KPIs and goals but without timeframe, which doesn\u2019t make it possible to really use it to measure success properly.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_31", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6102, "q0": "This proposal is a strange one because i had to read it twice to understand what is happening.I will be giving this proposal a 3 for impact and below are my reasons:\n-This proposal is way too focused on how to extract money from the players at every turn.
