However, it is hard for a reader to understand what they really are trying to achieve. The term product is consistently used but unfortunately this brings more confusion than clarity. For a reader, it seems that there is only a vague connection between the proposal and gaming, therefore the term product is used instead. It is also not mentioned in the proposal what the \"Grow your own Adventure Play2Earn product\" really is. Is it a game, a CNFT collection platform, a general CNFT portfolio? The proposer should include more information and bring clarity to this distinction in order to receive a higher score in terms of impact. They succeed to address certain points within the challenge brief which raises the score given. All in all, a score of 3 stars is given.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers claims to be very experienced and have already developed a big part of their platform. From the available information the project seems feasible in terms of development and implementation. \nThe budget is not broken down in any form, which makes it harder for the proposers to back up their claims that it is a reasonable amount of compensation. \nA potential risk is mentioned about wallet integration, it is good that the proposers acknowledge this as a risk and also provide a plan to action on how to solve it. This brings a bit more uncertainty to the feasibility but no deduction is made in the score. Their acknowledgement and expertise is deemed enough to make up for this. \nThe feasibility is rated 4-stars, the budget should be more detailed as well as some kind of roadmap could be included to gain one more star.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of the proposal is quiet poor. The proposers claim that only the developer of the handheld application will receive KIP's, and this is in the future some time. It is easy to believe that no KPI's have been decided yet. More transparency and a set of real KPI's would be favorable to increase the score in terms of auditability. \nLastly, the success is defined as a launch on the Apple App store, this is a binary condition where no aspect in regards to quality or functionality have been accounted for. It is recommended to deliver more details in the auditability section overall. \nA score of 2-star is given since it is currently not possible to audit the proposal more than an app store launch.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_139", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7042, "q0": "The proposal addresses the challenge as it aims to deliver a freely downloadable handheld application. \nHowever, vague details on the value proposition, game principles are given.

I don't find any reference to the team members profiles.
