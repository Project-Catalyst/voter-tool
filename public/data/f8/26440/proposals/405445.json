The costs for the Visual enhancement team seem reasonable. The teams speak of a needed budget of around $500.000 for all displayed functions. With this proposal funded, only  24% of the goal is achieved.

We need to see what ARENA is by clicking into the link https://ada-quest.com/ to understand how great it is (playing free without any paywall, being easy and user-friendly, involving the community into the development). Besides, I found this: after successful implementation of the project ARENA since Fund5, this round of Fund, the AdaQuest authors propose 8 proposals (6 proposals for ARENA mode and 2 proposals for Phase 2 of AdaQuest). I think we should read all of them to understand the AdaQuest project as a whole. They are:\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/405445 (enhancing the graphics of the game: re-design, create and enhance characters - this is the current proposal we are assessing)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/403708 (polishing, balancing & testing the game)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/405317 (marketing strategy)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404315 (delivering adventures within the game  for PVE players)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404938 (hiring the sound designer for AdaQuest and creating a free sound library for Cardano game projects)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404893 (creating a module for socializing and housing in the world of the game)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404544 (creating the concept for Phase 2)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/405375 (developing a prototype for Phase 2).\nThis proposal not only fits the challenge \u201cGamers On - Chained\u201d but also add value to the Cardano ecosystem because if it is successful, the project will help to increase: number of users of gaming based applications built on Cardano, number of CNFTs made specifically for gaming, number of fungible tokens made specifically for gaming, which are in the success metrics of the challenge. Additionally, the challenge \u201cGamers On - Chained\u201d was initiated by the team, so that they are well-known about which proposals will address the challenge, therefore the impact of this proposal should not be a problem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The authors provide information in full details for us to assess the proposal\u2019s feasibility, consist of team\u2019s information, detailed plan, marketing strategy, KPIs, target groups, budget breakdown and challenges/risks related to the project\u2019s success. About the team who makes up the project and their partners (freelancers who are they working with), the information is provide very detailed, we have their names, their professional majors, number of experienced years, their roles in the project, their skills and experience related to the project conducting, we also see their social links to get more information about them. Especially they delivered the first mode ARENA successfully and truly great, I think that is the strongest evidence to prove the project is in expert hands. The clearly understandable plan allows us to see what need to be done in a chronological order in term of 2 months. The target groups as well as the interesting marketing strategy are also explained reasonable. Regarding to the financial amount, we can see it is broken down reasonably well into identifiable items: illustrators, animator and art director. Additionally, the team foresees challenges/risks that they may face when conducting the project, and they also gives solutions/ mitigation, helps us underrstand more about the project and raise the trust from readers that the proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This part of proposal is provided in a good level of information, consist of roadmap, milestone, time horizon and KPIs, help us easy to understand what will be measured or monitered.
