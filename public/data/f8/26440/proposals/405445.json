The costs for the Visual enhancement team seem reasonable. The teams speak of a needed budget of around $500.000 for all displayed functions. With this proposal funded, only  24% of the goal is achieved. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team uses a lot of different channels (e.g. twitter, YouTube, discord, etc.) to inform all followers about their in game progress.\u00a0 The proposal itself is about making a better visual experience (new animation, characters, effects, backgrounds, etc.) for this game.

All modern gaming products (especially blockchain games) push AAA graphics, fair pricing, F2P, no pay to win mechanics, and a lot of the gaming lingo used in this proposal. I SO appreciate the philosophy of focusing on the quality of the game and not having to be accountable to any big investors or publishers. However, the games that I have watched over the years that share a similar approach (such as Star Citizen) never amounted to anything. These are my two main concerns. There needs to be some element of separating from the big crowd of game developers in this space. I want to know exactly how a project is innovating the space and making a substantial impact on those that play the game (and highlight that uniqueness as a central feature in the marketing). Then, I want to see some kind of motivating factor that can add greater accountability and oversight. Other than that, this proposal is exactly the kind of thing I hope to see out of game developers. I think the creators are cool, relatable, experienced people that are passionate about what they do. That's a big selling point for me, and I want to see this project succeed. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "This proposal is actually not a very big risk. Sort of. My concerns in the impacts section still stand but the reality of this proposal is that it's an improvement project to develop upon an already working product and the money appears to be relatively well spent. After reading the budget, the requested $20k somehow seemed like not that much. The amounts to pay the digital artists are actually very reasonable for skilled work. It's relatively close to average salaries in the region. The experience of the team is nothing to be concerned about as they have plenty of credibility to prove that they can get this job done. I appreciate the LinkedIn profiles. The only reason I rank 4/5 is because of the concerns in the impacts section. I don't think there is enough unique innovation here to feel like I am impressed with the roadmap. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I'm a stickler on KPIs. I believe the auditibility section should have nothing to do with the completion of a product, in most cases. A completed product, no matter how good, that doesn't get any users is not making an impact. However, in the context of this proposal, I can't think of any quantifiable KPIs to demonstrate the progress of art-based upgrades. The best I've got is the team paying attention to how the upgraded visuals are impacting the number of participants. I want to see metrics on improved usage traffic as a result of these graphics upgrades.

We need to see what ARENA is by clicking into the link https://ada-quest.com/ to understand how great it is (playing free without any paywall, being easy and user-friendly, involving the community into the development). Besides, I found this: after successful implementation of the project ARENA since Fund5, this round of Fund, the AdaQuest authors propose 8 proposals (6 proposals for ARENA mode and 2 proposals for Phase 2 of AdaQuest). I think we should read all of them to understand the AdaQuest project as a whole.

The clearly understandable plan allows us to see what need to be done in a chronological order in term of 2 months. The target groups as well as the interesting marketing strategy are also explained reasonable.
