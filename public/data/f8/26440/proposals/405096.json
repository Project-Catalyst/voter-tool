The possible risks about not be funded of the main proposal and the possibility of being censored or shut it down are described in quite detail by the author and given specific measures.\nHowever the project results are quite general, it would be better if the author could mention more detail outcomes which communicated via Town Hall and the DAO-NET & A2T Marketing campaign.It will be easier to determine the impact of the project with challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is enough information to judge the feability of the project.\nProposal has a team with a lot of experience in related fields, the necessary positions, both available and not yet available, are also mentioned by the author.\nThe project's roadmap is quite reasonable and divided into 6 sub-sections lasting for 1 month, the workload of each item is also described quite fully. The budget is quite reasonable when dividing the average cost per month by each cost item (Plutus Developer, Game designer, Product Manager)\nHowever, I think the plan will be more detail if the author can write the roadmap for a longer period of time instead of 6 months like now.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The criteria to determine the success of the project are presented presented in an easy to understand manner.

You manage to predict many drawbacks that your team can get into while implementing the project in the near future, as well as come up with respective workable solutions to cope with. Most importantly, this project is described detailedly with adequate key features and how it operates, too. Yet, to my way of thinking, you should explain more about the positive impacts your platform can bring on the gamers, especially as a useful way to convince them to enter your platform and increase the Cardano adopters. However, one issue appears in this section, the way your solution will handle the challenge. Actually I can\u2019t see any key metrics of your project matching with the requirements of the challenge. You said: \u201cthe platform is a blockchain game that has the potential to achieve mass adoption if the prevalence of social media disputes are any indicator of the human desire to engage in information warfare\u201d but this statement is too general without any key metrics to measure. For this reason, I think you should fix this problem by putting information relevant to your missing part.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "From my standpoint, your project was able to lay out a work plan with proper milestones and timeframe. But as usual, for many roadmaps like this, I always suggest you add more information, or rather some typical activities, which serves as the key steps to achieve your goals. Considering your budget breakdown, I don\u2019t think your statistical list is detailed enough since it\u2019s kinda general. I advise you to supplement some extra figures which aim to authenticate the salary to three determined positions, for example, you could explain about their hourly pay rate in some detail. Besides, the full list of your team members really satisfies me because of its clarity, and on top of that, the striking experience of some key positions in their career. The product manager, Dwayne Collard and Lead Developer have seasoned experiences in their job Jude Ben, which are 20 years and 9 years, respectively.

Therefore, it can be a tool for spreading awareness and information directly or indirectly to the masses in an entertaining way. The content of using memes as a means to counter disinformation is a brilliant content as it can attract more users not only just to play the game but also as a spectator for its funny content.
