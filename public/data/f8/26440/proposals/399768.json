Blockchain-based play-to-earn games have enjoyed great success in recent years, but still have many limitations: high barriers to entry, difficulty in managing portfolio transitions, excessive expectations of retail investors and in many cases excessive superficiality that prevents long-term involvement.\nPlayermint solves these problems by creating a play-to-earn blockchain level that integrates with existing video games and rewards players based on their gaming performance (API calculated thanks to Overwolf).\nPlayermint is free (removal of entry barriers) and requires no payment from the user other than a redemption fee (removal of difficulty in managing transitions).\nBy aiming to integrate Fortnite, one of the most played games in the world, as the first game, Playermint could be able to chain a huge pool of players to the Cardan ecosystem.\nSince Playermint integrates a game that has already shown appreciation from the public it will be easier to gain long-term engagement. Initially the cNFTs traded on the marketplace will be user-generated content (UGC), with the launch of Cardano layer 2, Hydra, Playermint will introduce the SDK, which will allow game studios to use the ecosystem to mint and sell game assets maintaining the royalties (std.royality CIP-27).\nThe only suggestion I would like to say concerns the redemption of PMXs. I suggest the team consider that many players will be completely strangers to the cryptocurrency world, as a result they may not know how to buy ADA to redeem PMXs. On Fortnite, players can buy VBUCK using their credit card, a fairly simple operation when compared to opening an account on a centralized exchange, approving their identity, buying ada, then transferring them to a defi wallet. I think that offering the ability to purchase ADA and / or PMX directly from the marketplace via a payment gateway can facilitate access for many players, although it will be necessary to wait for the launch of hydra to have sufficient scalability.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The playermint team has already successfully participated in two rounds of project catalysts, fund 4 and fund8 and has years of experience in gaming and blockchain, the fronted, backend and server side of Playermint will be realized with the collaboration of MLabs, a team of professional developers.\nA total of $ 44,000 is required for the development, upgrade and maintenance of the frontend, backend and server side of Playermint, but the number of hours and developers required is not specified. The budget requested is however in line with the work to be carried out and with the funds requested for the same purpose by other projects previously. A total of $ 6,000 is required for marketing carried out mainly through the eSports organization Xen Fortnite, which has players with good results and excellent visibility especially in North America. I suggest the team to keep in mind that Fortnite has a very large audience in Europe, you could consider turning to some Fortnite eSports in Europe as well.\nThe delivery time for the first deliverable is set by the end of March and the last by the end of June. From the latest communications from the team it appears that the Frontend is ready and the backend almost complete, the first off-chain API tests have also started, however it is necessary to complete the CTL (cardano transiction library) before starting the on-chain tests and this should impigare about a week, thus falling within the deadlines.\nAmong the possible problems it could face, Playermint considered the possibility that a game studio with which it integrates does not appreciate the service and refuses to integrate with the game, which is why it has decided to work with a compatible crypto studio such as Epic Games, which has effectively given Overwolf permission to license the API to third parties as playermint.\nThe team presents a detailed and actionable implementation plan, through a gradual process of off-chain and on-chain testing and optimization prior to the founding launch, which will serve to refine the back-end and customer support prior to the main launch. Thanks to a targeted and gradual process, the team should be able to solve another common problem of play-to-earn games, (namely the development of sustainable tokenomics.

The gaming industry is expanding year by year (with revenues in the billions).

The team describes how new gamers will be onboarded. This process seems comparatively easy, consequently achieving a low entry barrier into the PlayerMint ecosystem. \nAfter having connected to the respective gaming platform, the user starts earning PMX tokens every epoch.

Offering play-to-earn rewards is the quickest and easiest way to attract a gamers attention. Not just play to earn, but the better you do, the more PMX you earn. As a ex-pro gamer I can't think of a more 'hit the nail on the head' solution to engaging with the gaming community.\n\nHowever, there are some issues with how effectively I think the proposal addresses the challenge. The 'claim' type way of paying out PMX means that, to the best of my understanding, any gamer who participates in PlayerMint would already need to own ADA. This seems to somewhat defeat the purpose of the statement set in the challenge \"These gamers are looking for their route into crypto in a fun and rewarding way\". If they already own ADA then PlayerMint doesn't seem to be the 'route' that gamers need but more of a entertaining way of earning crypto. Users of PlayerMint who already on ADA will already be members, to some extent, of the Cardano community. In the proposal video the phrase 'they [gamers] don't need to put any money down'. This doesn't seem to be quite true if ADA needs to be owned by the participant to claim their PMX and in all honesty could turn away gamers from joining the PlayerMint Marketplace.\n\nThere are other parts to the proposal that address the challenge well.

This isn't my area of expertise but the combined knowledge gained through years of experience has the team in good stead. \nOn the other hand the experience of the team in the gaming space seems quite small.\nThe size of the team is suitable for the size of the task at hand, especially considering that, based upon the allocation of the budget, a large amount of that work will be completed by a third party.\nThe budget has a major flaw, it seems to be a typo but leaves a large question mark on one of the most important parts of the proposal. The budget is split in to two parts, but the parts have been copy and pasted twice.\nMain Launch and Updates and Maintanance have exactly the same breakdown of costs. Without seeing how \u00a325k of the budget is going to be spent I can't, in all reasonableness, give this part of the assessment more than 3 stars.\nAnother worry is that I can't see evidence of whether or not the implementation has been risk assessed. The play test and Beta will go some way with ironing out issues that arise with interface and general bugs but I don't see a 'big picture' risk assessment. \nThe time frame is solid and I think that their plan has been scaled well, even if the full launch was delayed I think the community would be understanding given some of the circumstances the team faces.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I think the KPIs and goals set by the PlayerMint team are solid and could definitely be used to measure the progess and success of the proposal. I think some are more important than others (I wouldn't be too focused on the USD value of PMX) and from what I can see one KPI is missing that I think would help measure how much gaming entrepreneurs are engaging with the platform. I would like to see a 'how many CNFTs were added to the market place' metric. The backbone of a lot of success in the modern gaming space is how well an game/idea/platform is adopted by content creators and streamers. Seeing well known gaming personalities creating their own CNFTs would show healthy engagement with one of the most influential communities in gaming.

The last deliverable is supposed to happen in July 2022 which seems to be attainable according to team and Devs (MLabs). Even though the timeline dates are lacking the team spoke to being directly affected by the current world events and that being the reason why they are lacking dates. They also padded their timeline just in case to try and account for unforeseen setbacks. I feel that the budget is vague and needs a little bit more breakdown and explanation. The Main Launch budget and the Upgrades and Maintenance budget are the exact same. I would have liked to see some differentiation between the two. One of my favorite parts of this proposal is educating new users, but I don't  see any funds set aside for Education/Customer Service in budget.
