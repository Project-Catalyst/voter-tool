I am very impressed. This seems like a game that I would be willing to get into. The cost of $500,000 seems like a lot, even though I can only imagine how much work you guys are putting into this. I fully support this project, and think it would do the Cardano blockchain a lot of good to have an amazing multiplayer dungeon crawler available. I am actually going to be purchasing one of these just to be able to give it a try. I wish you guys the best!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The only note I could give on this one is maybe try advertising through as many channels as you possibly can, because even as involved as I am with Cardano this is the first time I am seeing or hearing about this game.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Having a more personal platform to broadcast your development and maybe some update videos could help with community engagement and brand awareness.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1548", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5980, "q0": "This proposal aims at expanding a previously funded proposal, and they describe in details all of the improvement and new mechanisms they will bring, like multi-playing, introduction of procedural created dungeons, seasonal playing and more. The project seems to be very community-based and focused on a good gaming experience above anything else, which is not so common in the blockchain ecosystem but it\u2019s great to see it. They are very descriptive in their commitment as well, and in relation to the team that\u2019s going to work on the project, so they are reliable and good professionals. The KPIs for impact are well described, also the target groups. Challenges and risks are very well described, and the risk management activities should be enough to mitigate them. I think this is a possibly very high impact project, and they have presented at least a couple times during Catalyst Town Halls to show their development. I fully support the proposal\u2019s impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap of this proposal is not very detailed, since it just adds the milestones of the second half of 2022 without any dates or months associated with them. This makes it more difficult to evaluate how they are going to develop and deliver the proposal, but I don\u2019t think it adds a considerably amount of risk to its execution. The budget seems to be ok and according to what\u2019s being proposed here. There are links provided to all team members and also freelancers, besides more detailed description about the lead team itself. They all seem very capable of delivering the project, and in fact have already started delivering based on previous proposals.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The internal management of the project is well described, and they mention that the achievement of each milestone is going to be reported through their social media. This is aligned with the roadmap presented, since there it\u2019s also not possible to know exactly when something is going to be delivered. But for auditability reasons, this should be ok. The suggested milestones for success are good and make sense according to the remaining of the proposal. It would be nice to have added also some metrics, like number of players, NFTs sold, amount transacted, etc. As mentioned before, they state that this is a continuation of another proposal, and they also add their not funded proposals, which is ideal for a clear auditability.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_31", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6409, "q0": "Their concept is very interesting and their proposal is well fitted to this challenge.

I like the way they mix the game with the NFT side of it. A very strong project in my perspective.

We need to see what AdaQuest is by clicking into the link https://ada-quest.com/ to see the first mode ARENA, to understand how cool it is (playing free without any paywall, being easy and user-friendly, involving the community into the development). Besides, I found this: after successful implementation of the project ARENA since Fund5, this round of Fund, the AdaQuest authors propose 8 proposals (6 proposals for ARENA mode and 2 proposals for Phase 2 of AdaQuest). I think we should read all of them to understand the AdaQuest project as a whole. They are:\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/405375 (this is the current proposal we are assessing)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404544 (creating the concept for Phase 2)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404315 (delivering adventures within the game  for PVE players)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/403708 (polishing, balancing & testing the game)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/405445 (enhancing the graphics of the game: re-design, create and enhance characters)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/405317 (marketing strategy)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404938 (hiring the sound designer for AdaQuest and creating a free sound library for Cardano game projects)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404893 (creating a module for socializing and housing in the world of the game)\nI find interesting with ten important questions and answers which help us to understand about the Phase 2 of the game in general, I can say it is so much more interesting t, so it will help attracting more users to the game, lead to the mass adoption of the Cardano Community. This proposal not only fits the challenge \u201cGamers On - Chained\u201d but also add value to the Cardano ecosystem because if it is successful, the project will help to increase: number of users of gaming based applications built on Cardano, number of CNFTs made specifically for gaming, number of fungible tokens made specifically for gaming, which are in the success metrics of the challenge. Additionally, the challenge \u201cGamers On - Chained\u201d was initiated by the team, so that they are well-known about which proposals will address the challenge, therefore the impact of this proposal should not be a problem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The authors provide information in details for us to assess the proposal\u2019s feasibility, consist of team\u2019s information, detailed plan, marketing strategy, KPIs, target groups, budget breakdown and challenges/risks related to the project\u2019s success. About the team who makes up the project and their partners (freelancers who are they working with), the information is provide very detailed, we have their names, their professional majors, number of experienced years, their roles in the project, their skills and experience related to the project conducting, we also see their social links to get more information about them. Especially they delivered the first mode ARENA successfully and truly great, I think that is the strongest evidence to prove the project is in expert hands. The plan allows us to see what need to be done and the target groups as well as the interesting marketing strategy are also explained reasonable. Regarding to the financial amount, we can see it is broken down reasonably well into identifiable items: coders, 3D artists, designers with details in how many people and how many hours for completing their work. Additionally, the team foresees challenges/risks that they may face when conducting the project, and they also gives solutions/ mitigation, helps us underrstand more about the project and raise the trust from readers that the proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposers provide us information for the auditability of the proposal, consist of roadmap, milestone and KPIs, help us easy to understand what will be measured or monitered.

The team also explains that the progress of the project will be upload on well-known tools like like JIRA, Github and Confluence, so it would be easy for tracking public.
