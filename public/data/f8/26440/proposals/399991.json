Ridiculous projects call themselves Metaverse", "f6_no_assessments": 5, "f6_rating": 3.9333333333333336, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"q0": "I believe that we have two key prepositions in the impact of this proposal. The first one is about what will actually be developed in this project: a greater clarification about what web3 and metaverse; according to the proponents, there are many honest and dedicated people who can make this technological revolution a reality and also long-term adoption. But there are also those who try to take advantage of the initial boom to profit quickly and easily from the uninformed; with this, the objective of this proposal would be precisely to provide an exact and safe definition of what these things are (web3 and metaverse), what are their daily applications and how we can advantageously relate to them. They claim they will answer questions like \u201cWhat is WEB 3.0? What is the Metaverse?\u201d, in order to more solidly clarify this new technological front that is now starting to be implemented. This proposal was launched in the gaming challenge because, according to the proponents, \u201cThe gaming industry will be the first to claim the implementation of WEB 3.0 and Metaverse approaches\u201d. I wish they had explained this vision better, because for people who aren't gamers or as tech-savvy, it's understandable at a basic level why the gaming business would adopt these technologies, but it's not so clearly understandable as a whole. Why the games industry? How would web3 relate to this? How can Cardano overlap, compared to other blockchains, in this emerging context? In general, I think the scope of the proposal is great, we know what will be done and why it will be done - the authors argue very well the need for this initiative. They also detail who they are, what the DLT360 group promotes, a kind of consultancy for companies or groups within our community on the advantages and characteristics of working with blockchain; from what I could understand, they are people who are well involved with the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem and who already work clarifying what blockchain is, so I think that if we have a qualified group to explain the concepts of web3 and metaverse, this is it. They have already demonstrated service through the projects already developed, as we can see from the website attached in the \u201cWebsite/GitHub repository (if relevant)\u201d part. So I'll give full marks for the impact. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Proponents divide the roadmap into two parts - the generic and the specific. This happens because they have several projects being developed at the same time, and some of them go through the same processes/steps, from what I understand. They then explain to us what these generic and specific processes would be. Starting from topic 6, they detail what would then be the tasks specifically geared towards this project, in \u201cparticipation in the 2-week meetings of the DLT360 Technology Team, active efforts to integrate other projects and cooperation partners form inside and outside Cardano, carry out a literature review and interviews with experts, analyze the results and summarize in a document\u201d and so on. We know that these activities will be worked on \u201call during the third quarter of 2022\u201d, but I would like the time division to be more specific. What happens in the first month of work, and the second, and the third? How long would each of these activities take to be developed, who would be responsible for this? Can some activities happen in parallel or one at a time? I believe that all these details could be included, so that our understanding would be even more solid about the development of the project. Talking now about the budget, an amount of 25 thousand dollars is asked, which is explained in great detail. We know how many parts the total amount would be divided into, which parts and also how many hours of work each of them would take, for example project management would cost 500 dollars, taking 10 hours to do, so we know the exact value of the hour of work ( $50) for that specific action. The same is reported for the other topics. Finally, analyzing the team, I think this part is good but the descriptions of each member should be a little longer. We know their professional names and roles, as well as their linkedin profiles, and good trust is passed from there. We also need to take into account that they have already presented other designs for DLT 360, so they have already demonstrated in service what they are capable of. If there was more detail about their careers, I think our level of knowledge would increase and that part would be even better supported. However, I think the feasibility of the project is great, even if it has suggested some details, based on what has been presented to us, it is possible to understand well what will be done, by whom and for how much investment. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPIs presented by the proponents are great ways to audit the proposal development process, as they are both quantitative (such as KPI 2 - Number of partners and projects/initiatives in interaction) and qualitative (such as KPI 1, Progress of activities as described above). My question is really about how this data will be verified by the Cardano community. I think there will be monthly meetings with the IOG coordinators, as is the standard, where the partial results will be presented. But will this information later be accessible to all members of the Cardano community? And if so, how? We have several communication platforms (eg telegram and discord) where these reports could be shared. As well as the goals achieved so far, I think it is important that we have an idea of \u200b\u200bwhat the work routines of the professionals involved were like. As I see it, these are the two fundamental parts of composing progress reports (tasks and goals). Turning now to the final results, the proponents claim that success would be seen through the total achievement of the aforementioned KPIs, or that it would be measured starting from a specific number (for example, it would already be considered a success if the \u201cnumber of great partners and interacting projects/initiatives\u201d was greater than 5). I think it's a very objective way of thinking about what we want to achieve, but again how will the Cardano community be aware of all this? It would be very interesting for proponents to participate in something synchronous, before or after Town Hall, so that they could fully present how the entire development process of this initiative was, if the initially desired results (the greater clarification of what web3 is and metaverse) have been reached; examples of formed partnerships; how it impacted Cardano's gaming sector and etc. In other words, the auditability is good, yes, but it could be even a little more in-depth, in my view. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "NOTE for VCAs and voters: This proposal is part of a wider project (DLT360) that has at least 13 proposals in this funding round. This proposal is judged partly through its individual merits, and partly through the way it fits into the wider DLT360 project. My assessment takes into account aspects common across all proposals (team specific like adequacy, competency, workload, or similar reporting mechanisms / budget logic). You shall therefore find common parts across these proposals (labeled as such) and parts specific to each proposal, which should offer a good balance of looking at each tree but not missing out the overall health of the forest. \n\nSpecific part: Behind the wider DLT360 umbrella lies another sub-project focused on the Metaverse, with 4 branches. This proposal focuses on the 2nd  branch - Investigating taxonomy and definitions.  \n\nI see striking similarities with the other 3 branches of the same sub-project and I highly encourage merging them in scope for future iterations. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "COMMON part: Great team. DLT360 is operated by an outstanding and growing team of regulatory experts, very active in the Cardano community. They also benefit from a scalable network of contributors from the Cardano community, academia, industry and EU institutions. In terms of team competence, skills and experience, they are well positioned.The multitude of projects funded under their umbrella showcases the great capacity to identify opportunities within the Cardano community and clearly articulate them into actionable projects. \n\nCOMMON part: Significant existing and future workload. DLT360 is a wider project initially funded in Fund6, and greatly supported by at least 5 proposals in Fund7, for a total funding so far of 85.000 USD (own calculations), many of them being still ongoing. During Fund8 the team is casting a very wide net with 13 additional proposals across several challenges, for a total funding of 295.000 USD. Onboarding so many projects so quickly can potentially lead to: too much workload, overlapping deadlines, increased risks of under-delivering, inability to distinguish added value of one project versus another, unnecessary stress and a lack of focus on and core scope and competencies. Future iterations that can bring comfort to these worries will of course be highly appreciated. \n\nCOMMON part: ALL of the 13 projects have overhead items included in the budget (project management, social media, back office, etc.) consuming an overall 30-40% of each budget (an educated guess let\u2019s call it). I think there was a missed opportunity there in terms of gathering all overheads under one roof and simplifying the budgets for all proposals by keeping them strict for core-activities.\n\nSpecific part: project would comprise a literature review,  expert interviews and most likely an academic paper together with University of Malta. For budget core-work rates are 50-75 USD/hour. Literature review and analysis take up 60% of the budget. \n\nAgain, striking similarity in scope to the other 3 branches and again, suggest merging them for future iterations. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "COMMON part: Existing track record. DLT360 projects are interlinked and since there are a number of running projects the team is definitely familiarized with the standard procedures and reporting process of the Catalyst team, so there are very low risks in terms of failing to communicate properly or inability to implement the necessary KPIs. \n\nCOMMON part: The website is a great opportunity for improvement. A concern is the fact that glancing at the DLT360 website, there is no reflection of recent live presentations that were perhaps delivered to the community in Q1 2022. I am aware that it is a work in progress tool, and a very nice-to-have feature would be for such live presentations / slides / supporting materials to be uploaded there as soon as possible and be accessible for the community as an intermediate deliverable until the projects are finalized. Also for the sake of transparency, a user-friendly list of funded (any why not unfunded) proposals would definitely be appreciated, at least by future CAs.   \n\nSpecific part: Basic KPIs are offered, a few of them a bit unclear, for instance it would be useful to explain a bit better what kind of ratings would be used and who would perform the academic quality check.

The exact topics to be covered by the research  are vague, and the actual outcomes of this research are unclear. There is a quick mention of academic paper, without them going into any detail. In addition, the proposer has many other proposals in Fund8 that are 90% copy paste of this fund, which puts me under the impression that they are using the Catalyst Fund to fund their startup rather than to contribute to the ecosystem. My impression is that the report they would generate would be mostly behind the paywall of the subscription service they are developing.\nMy feedback to the proposer would be, instead of trying to mass-produce fund applications, to show that they are indeed interested in a select number of topics, and write thoughtful, individual applications for each. Re-using content, such as company presentation, business model, etc... is normal, but the bulk of the proposal should not be copy-paste work. In addition, demonstrating that the outcome of the proposal will indeed be made available to people funding it would be a great addition to the proposal.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The breakdown of tasks, while sensible, is a copy paste from many other proposals the proposer has in fund8. While a series of generic tasks and budget breakdown is put forth (Participate in meetings, Basic research, integrate other projects and cooperation-partners), none of these are specific to the task at hand. This leads me to believe that very little thought has actually been put in an actual plan to deliver on this task. The fact that the proposer mentions that their plan is in MIRO but do not have any MIRO link doesn't help alleviate my worries either.\nAdditionally, despite having been funded since fund6, the team doesn't have any example of previous research it would have done in the past either, so it is hard to know if any results would be good.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Out of the multiple KPIs put forth by the proposer, the only one that could have any actual public auditability is passing of academic quality check, but it is worded in a very dubious way: Why is it \"Passing academic quality check \" and not \"Publish in a scientific journal\" or something along those lines. The other indicators are vaguely defined and very \"black-box\"", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_318", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal is about investigating and research on two topics that certainlyare are emerging fast but people still are not sure what they mean: Metaverse and web 3.0.\nFor this better understanding on this, no doubts that such researches are essential and will help to grasp how they'll impact blockchain. I alsoo see a good alignment of this proposal with the challenge (gamers on-chained), as, it is claimed that these subjects will impact greatly on gaming industry. I can also, at least indirectly, increase challenge kpis as \"Amount and evolution of gaming based tokens and wallets\", \"Number of CNFTs made specifically for gaming\" and so on.\n\nHowever, I think the proposal still lacks a bit of clarity on what exactly will be delivered in the research and how the work is going to be carried out.  It is provided some bullets where is said that literature review and interview with experts will be made but more information could be provided. There are plenty of information about the \"big picture\" (the sum of all DLT360 proposals) but only a few specific to this one.

However, more informantion on team background and experience could be stated in the proposal. It is possible to check in linkedin but it would be better to have it sumarized here, in a more straighfoward way and focusing more on the necessary capabilities the team has to develop the project.\nAll in all, I dont see major risks on executing this project. Therefore, 5 stars for feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There good kpis to audit the project.
