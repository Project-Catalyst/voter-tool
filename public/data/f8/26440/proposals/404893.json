First and foremost, apparently the team has gone out of their way to ensure this game delivers the most enjoyable experience for players as possible, as demonstrated through the numerous features in the game, the focus to make the content as engaging as humanly possible and creating a gamer-centric experience. The target audiences are varied into different groups of interest, all of which have the potential to become long-term users of Cardano. And most notably, this is the first project I\u2019ve ever seen where users can permanently own a property on a cryptocurrency blockchain just by playing the game. In addition, the proposal does also entail some possible problems and risks the project could face in the future, followed by a satisfactory description of resolutions. Combining all those said features and the appropriate listings of measured metrics, I have confidence that the project will likely be met with success", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As for this section of the proposal, I believe the team has included quite a well-rounded plan of execution, including a timeline and milestones for each phase. Commendably, all team members are enclosed with sufficient information on background, expertise and associated LinkedIn profiles to further verify their capabilities. Therefore, I can safely say that the demanded budget is reasonable, in addition to its detailed breakdown", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Some level of clarity is certainly up on the table, as evidenced in the use of popular tracking tools such as JIRA, GitHub, and Confluence, though I\u2019m not quite sure yet whether those tools will also be available for public access or just amongst those involved in the project. However, though the envisioned success undoubtedly falls towards achieving the initial goal of the project, It would seem as if the proposer has left out the part of the benefits and profits that Cardano can expect to reap from this project. Therefore, I suggest that this crucial detail be included in future proposals", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1664", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Auditability: As statet we will use this tool to track the progress of our project.

"}, {"id": 4294, "q0": "This proposal looks extremely promising to me with all the effort and the very high level of detail and thoroughness put into a single proposal. As far as I can understand, this team is trying to create a 1st (meta) Goblinverse module - a place for socializing,  & housing in the world of AdaQuest. Overall, everything needed to assess the project's potential is fully provided, from the game features/mechanics, functionality to the team's main focus, marketing strategy, key metrics to measure and finally, the groups of people that the project targets. The most impressive part of this is the remarkable specification of the target groups. This proposal, unlike many others, not just talks about the groups that the project will focus on but also bring it to a whole new level with the separation of them into 3 categories with descending importance, namely Primarily; Secondary and Tertiary. The foreseen challenges and risks are also listed along with tools applied that are capable of helping the team minimize the risks that can possibly happen. In conclusion, this proposal is perfectly well-written, smartly organized and covers all aspects required by the challenge. However, there is still one thing that I think should be improved, and that is the language used. Sometimes in the proposal, the author uses words or characters that are too informal, for instance, \"shitty\", \"bloat\" or \":(\". Though I understand that the author is just trying to make the readers feel friendly and comfortable, it is still inappropriate to put those words into a proposal.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team behind this proposal certainly has sit together and discuss very carefully the roadmap of the project. Not only having a timeline with the main focus and goals for each month, but the team also provide the staffs or positions that are needed for the work of that month so that it aligns with the payroll mentioned afterwards. Information about the team's members already working on this project is also fully provided, with an attached LinkedIn link leading to the profile of each one and a bonus brief introduction of every single core member. Additionally, the budget breakdown is reasonable as well, with salary per month and months of working for each different individual position. The only thing that I would ask the team to provide more is a list of other expenses since to successfully execute a project, simply hiring a group of staffs and employees is never enough but it also requires other factors such as legal or marketing.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. The fact that the team has stated KPIs, key metrics and well-known tools used for measuring the progress can give voters a very high level of confidence that the project can be tracked and audited appropriately. The clear milestones and product delivery also provide identifiable measures by which the community can gauge their process and ensure they are on track to achieve what they have laid out.

By researching the market and determining that adding the housing and socializing features to AdaQuest will make every gamer as loyal as possible. I have always believed that updating and improving the game industry is necessary, and this initiative is not a bad idea. The proposer demonstrates to the community that the team knows what they are doing by creating an AdaQuest Development plan. The most serious problem, however, is with regard to development power. Because the proposer has decided to only work with people they know, the team must demonstrate the efficiency of developers.I can see that the team determined the tools to use to measure, but they do not appear to be aligned with the risks. Because I have the opportunity to review another proposal from the team called AdaQuest MARKETING campaign, I see they use the same tools for risk and provide no more insight on how the risks will be handled other than to pledge to minimize the risk. I recommend that the team provide more detailed solutions to the risks in this plan, such as: generating technical debt through \"bloat\" feature sets; compensating for non-productive time; and overcoming unforeseen technological obstacles. Overall, the metrics used to track and measure this proposal are appropriate for the objective.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This is a good roadmap, in my opinion, because it includes the major works, goals, and staffs who will work on them. The budget breakdown\u00a0is also appropriate. The community\u00a0can also view the team profiles in great detail. They summarize their job experience and skills with references to the proposal's requirements, and they all have links to demonstrate their profile and work. At the same time, because the proposer has expressed worry about the budget and time for this proposal, I recommend that the proposer include a discussion regarding the sufficiency of the proposed funds and time\u00a0to achieve a noticeable impact.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "More might be said about project KPI reporting, in my opinion. For example, describe how catalyst voters and community members in general can monitor development progress. Make it clear how data and tracking about the amount of new user accounts, Website Visits, Page Impressions & Views, NFT Sales & Land claims.The proposer may even outline a future vision for this suggestion.

Besides, I found this: after successful implementation of the project ARENA since Fund5, this round of Fund, the AdaQuest authors propose 8 proposals (6 proposals for ARENA mode and 2 proposals for Phase 2 of AdaQuest).
