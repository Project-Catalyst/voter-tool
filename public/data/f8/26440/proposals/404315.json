It demonstrates the need of combining three different game phases into one whole Fantasy World Game Experience. Adding Quest stories to the Player versus Player (PVP) is reasonable to achieve the proposed objectives - cover bigger Player versus Environment (PVE) audience. The proposal seeks to maintain GAME experience First - to keep the community excited and curious, while reaching a wider gamer-centric base and at the same time ensuring the development cycle. The proposal reveals that it will have a huge global impact and it has high level of scalability. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The information in the proposal reveals that the proposer has a great history with Cardano funds and seeking funding to build upon the previous funded projects. The media information provided, past history with the Fund, the will power to scale-up the ideas, the team experience is enough evidence to conclude that the team\u2019s experience and credibility is sufficient for the kind of work. The strategies and activities proposed are sufficient to achieve the objective the proposal. The budget is defined and well explained. The risks are taken into consideration and the expected outcome/impact of a successful implementation surpasses the expected risks and cost of fund", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPIs, roadmap, milestones are defined. The team intends to provide \u201cwell-know\u201dn tools like JIRA, Github, and Confluence to track the progress and success of implementation and I believe its adequate for the purpose.

They are proposing to create a PvE (Player vs Environment) mode instead of just the usual PvP mode already being developed and/or covered by other proposals. The idea is to have a more broad audience since many people prefer PvE over PvP. This is a fair point and something that other game developers on Cardano are also thinking about. And it\u2019s very well aligned with the challenge since this will increase adoption and consequently the number of minted CNFTs, total amount of transactions and all related metrics. The risks and challenges as well mapped and they make sense based on the kind of project they propose to develop, but based on their proposed mitigation and on the team\u2019s experience, I believe they will be overcome without much trouble.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is a good roadmap presented, with a set of milestones per month, which makes sense according to the proposed development. Although, a single developer working for 3 months doesn\u2019t sound to be enough to build an entire new game mode, so this makes me a bit skeptical about this development. But since they mentioned that parts of the code are going to be re-used from a previous development (ARENA mode), it\u2019s difficult to evaluate it properly. The budget is aligned with the roadmap, and values are fair. The team\u2019s background seem to be very appropriate and enough to execute the project, also considering the help of freelancers that might participate in the development as well.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "It is well stated how they are going to keep track of the progress internally, using project management tools. What\u2019s missing is some way for external auditing, i.e. how the community will keep track of the development and check if everything\u2019s going well with it. The success definition for the proposal is not well defined, unfortunately, since the statements there are very vague. Even though some metrics are mentioned in the impact section, there are no numeric goals to go after and any way to really measure the success of the proposal.

Adding more variety is good to cater wider audience that leads to more user/player onboard. With the introduction of single player mode also can create more business opportunities for the devs. More users means more transactions which gives more value to the network. As a hardcore gamer myself, I used to spent countless of hours playing RPG games such as final fantasy. It will be interesting to see a blockchain RPG game that is entertaining and also easy to access through mobile app. A pocket adventure game that can be accessed anywhere, anytime. Therefore, this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposing team provided their verified background in gaming industry, also they have been with catalyst since fund 5 therefore it is unquestionable that they are able to implement the plan. The proposer identified the required manpower and resources needed to effectively complete the project. The roadmap provided in details and realistic. They aim to release the first version on September 2022 which I am looking forward to try out. The budget presented seems appropriate, although the coder salary is quite on the high side. The proposing team presents a very good and detailed analysis of the proposal risks and challenges, and suggests possible mitigations \nin a good manner and most of them make sense. Based on all of this information, I believe that this proposal is highly feasible.

As this involves developing the PvE aspect of the game, they are synerging mechanics developed in their Arena mode to the PvE mode making it faster to work and progress their timeline. \n\nAlthough from an outsider perspective one can ask that, if going for a broader available experience ranging from different modules and scenarios (PvP , PvE), one might be neglected or that both might not be as top quality as it could\u2019ve been. That if their focus were put only into mastering/finishing one aspect the end product could\u2019ve been higher quality instead of being this solution to fix all sides of the gaming aspect.

We need to see what AdaQuest is by clicking into the link https://ada-quest.com/ to see the first mode ARENA, to understand how cool it is (playing free without any paywall, being easy and user-friendly, involving the community into the development). Besides, I found this: after successful implementation of the project ARENA since Fund5, this round of Fund, the AdaQuest authors propose 8 proposals (6 proposals for ARENA mode and 2 proposals for Phase 2 of AdaQuest). I think we should read all of them to understand the AdaQuest project as a whole.

Especially they delivered the first mode ARENA successfully and truly great, I think that is the strongest evidence to prove the project is in expert hands. The clearly understandable plan allows us to see what need to be done and what are the goals of each month in a chronological order in term of 2,5 months. The target groups as well as the interesting marketing strategy are also explained reasonable.
