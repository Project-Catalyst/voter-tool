He says that, many times, players who are not familiar with the cryptographic world and have never bought NFT are scared by it, because they don't know where to go, basically, and that this project would have the differential of being simpler when buying NFT . But why? How is this action easier here than in other games? This is not clear in the course of the proposal. But anyway, analyzing the impact of the game, I think it can be a good idea, in general it's a racing game in which each car is an NFT, and your objective is to defeat bosses until you pass the level (each race would be in a city, in a hypothetical future). According to the proponent, 10,000 car NFTs would be launched later this year and whoever acquired them would have an advantage over those who would start the game from scratch, let's say. I think this could be interesting for Cardano since the cars are CNFTs, that is, NFTs minted on our blockchain, but I would like to know two things: 1) how players would know Cardano differentials from the purchase of these NFTs? How would you realize the advantages of buying/selling active tokens on our blockchain and not on others? 2) is there any other way in the game to benefit our ecosystem? For example, would there be some transactions in smart contracts? Some shopping in Ada? Would players have to link their digital wallets to the game at some point? In general, I like the idea, I think it can work very well because the racing game audience is considerable, it's already a popular style, and if added to the recent NFT boom, this can generate a good adoption of Cardano for new users. But, it is still a little difficult to understand precisely to what extent this game would relate to our blockchain and what advantages it would bring beyond the minting of some NFTs, or if it would be just that. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is good, but not perfect. In general, we have the basic information we need to understand about the roadmap, budget division and staff, but each of them could be explained more (especially for staff). The script is good, the project is divided into 3 phases, each one being a quarter. The activities carried out in these time intervals are mentioned, however, I think it would be better if the time scale adopted was shorter, for example, monthly. Every 3 months is a very long time to follow the progress of such activities, I would like them to be divided like this, by month, so that the understanding of the process is more solid. The level of detail of these activities is medium, some are more detailed than others, it would be interesting if they all had the same level of detail. The requested budget is quite compatible with the dimension and complexity of the project. In other words, I found it a fair value. It is divided into several small parts, so that we can understand the need for such funding. Each of these parts gets a fairly fair share as well, but what I think could have been done to improve this part was the inclusion of the working hours of the professionals involved. I mean, 4.5k requests in 3d modeling, for example. How long would the designer responsible for this work to achieve the end result? If we had such information, we would know the hourly rate of work required for each small part, which would generate an even stronger understanding of that part. And regarding the team, I think that part was the one that left something to be desired, because we don't know exactly who the team members are. We know which professionals would be involved (such as modeller, 2d pixel artist, etc.), and what their skills are, but that alone doesn't give us so much confidence; we would need to know: their names, examples of work they've done before and how they relate to Cardano. In this way, our knowledge about the team would be fully, and not partially, as it is presented then. Therefore, my suggestions for improving feasibility are: specifying the roadmap in shorter time intervals, explaining all parts of the requested funding equally, and introducing more properly the professionals who will be part of the team. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I didn't find the game's auditability very good, it exists but it's not enough, because the ways to monitor its success are very basic (game downloads, website visits and social media engagement), just like the biggest success scenario is plotted abstractly (create an exciting and easy way for players unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies, NFTs and the metaverse to start their journey on the Cardano blockchain). Let's try to delve into this here. Starting with the fact that it's not just the end results that matter. It's important for us as a community to measure all the variables, from the point when the game got off the ground, started its construction, until the moment the final version is delivered and the public starts playing. I believe it is necessary for the team to prepare a summary of the activities carried out each month and make this information available in some way to our community. This can be done through online tools, such as a simple google docs, or something more, such as monthly meetings with some members of the Cardano community, who feel engaged to follow the development of this project more closely. In this way, we would also monitor the process, not just the results. However, it is also important to track whether what was initially intended was achieved, and this could be done by measuring the statistics suggested by the bidder, and putting these research together into perhaps infographics that could be presented again to the rest of us. This is something that would happen towards the end of the project and would perhaps require a single meeting with more participants, so it could be done in some debating room after Town Hall, for example, or if the team prefers they can prepare a full report and send it to them. it to the community on some communication channel, such as Discord or Telegram. It is important that we understand if the final scenario has been reached, that is, create an easier way to deal with NFTs, cryptocurrencies, etc. Therefore, I suggest that there is a small questionnaire in the game itself, which could be made available after some time that players have started playing there, trying to ask if such questions actually happened. So I think the auditability would be deeper. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 5, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 399, "q0": "We noticed that the game has a good plot and scenario for the concept of NFT's to be introduced. From the beginning, the use of this dynamic was thought, but we realized that the game does not seem to focus exclusively on this, as it appears that it will have good gameplay, without the need for exorbitant expenses on the part of the player so that he can have fun. The description of the environment in which the game takes place also seems quite interesting, a near future where cities are dominated by corrupt rich in cryptocurrencies. As it is a mobile game, we see that its success could also imply a wide adoption, increasing the visibility of Cardano's technologies being used, which can have a positive impact on the ecosystem. Given the goals you're aiming to achieve, the requested budget of $25,000 doesn't seem too out of the ordinary, but some points seem to need to be fixed for the game to achieve considerable impact.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Among these points mentioned above, we realize that many positions in the team still need to be filled. This is a negative factor because in order for a game to reach visibility and be a constant success, one of the things to consider is the game's personality. This personality is more easily built when there is an in-house design and development team that is very connected to the game, and knows well what direction the project should take at any given moment. It is true that the game is a racing style, and it has a great popular appeal, due to the ease of learning and low difficulty barrier in general. But even with this factor, it still seems interesting that a more complete team was structured to improve the viability of the project. It would also be interesting if the CVs of the professionals involved in the project were made available.\n\nRegarding the steps described for the construction of the project, we see that they are organized and it is interesting to note how engagements with different social media are taken into account since the first quarter. Regarding the details of the budget, the amounts allocated to each area seem reasonable, but again, the observation is that it would be important if more professionals had already been assigned to these areas. Aside from that, spending $1,500 on marketing doesn't seem to be enough either, because today one of the most conditioning factors of a game's success is how well known it is, and allocating approximately 6% of the total budget seems a little low. So we see that there are some gaps to be filled in order for the viability of the project to be better polished.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Regarding the metrics chosen to monitor the evolution of the project, we see that plural parameters were established, aimed not only at the number of players or downloads, but also in relation to the engagement generated around the game (when monitoring the number of members on the server from discord).\n\nAn also interesting factor is trying to predict the initial number of players from the amount of NFT's sales, before the game's launch itself. It is also interesting to see that numerical goals were exposed that will help in monitoring the evolution of the project, such as the objective of reaching 3000 followers on Twitter.\n\nDespite the negative points mentioned in the previous section, it is worth remembering that this game has an interesting premise, and with some adjustments the project can become much more viable. A final suggestion would be the presence of an 'extreme' game mode in which, given some limitations, players could challenge someone to a race (with only 2 participants) in which the winner wins the NFT being used by the other player.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 4, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1709, "q0": "This is a proposal for a casual game, a game idea familiar to those who play games on the phone, it appears a lot on the android app stores and has nothing special.

The roadmap is given in each Q of 2022 the items listed, I have not seen the game system design, server, or web game. \nEspecially at the fund, the images that I see are 2D but the author is asking for funding for the 3D part, which makes me feel conflicted.

Please include additional information if possible to make your proposal more credible.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proponent gives numbers like 3000+ Twitter, 5000 members in discord in 3 months, I think it is not too difficult to achieve this number but if you mention a certain marketing solution for it, it is very good.

Why is the project development process important? it will help you to ensure the progress of the project, detect the problems that are about to happen, and help you to quickly come up with a solution to them.

The means of distribution and cost of these on-chain assets are not clearly defined within the proposal but some design concepts can be seen from the proposer's attachments. The problem's solution, bringing more gamers to the Cardano ecosystem, is not necessarily solved by simply adding a new game idea and minting of NFTs. This proposer has failed to mention exactly how they would accomplish such an accelerated timeline given that this funding round is successful or not. Is there already a community built who follow the game development, i.e. a Discord server dedicated to the project, or a formal twitter page with strong community support? There is no doubt this proposer could add value to the Cardano ecosystem upon a successful launch of NFTs and a working, developed game nearing completion, but to date, the goals of the proposal are not aligned with the challenge.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer is confident with the given skillset of perhaps one person to manage and complete all allotted tasks presented in the timeline and roadmap with the help of minting NFTs from SeabugNFT Market. The references of said skills cannot be validated from the information presented in this proposal. The artistic quality of concept art and animations are a promising selling point as an Non fungible token if priced fairly to ADA holders, but the building of community interest is lackadaisical to say the least. From a non developed website to a Twitter account without a discord, the amount of accomplishments and milestones outlined here by the proposer are unrealistic for the timetable. The budget from the proposer is an estimated amount as stated and fairly reasonable, but the actual identifiable members that will be taking part in such tasks is not clearly defined here. Are these developers being outsourced from reputable companies or community standing? How many members will be involved in the project? Without a more clear representation of where funds will be going or to whom, it's difficult to verify if the timeline is far fetched or an accurate description of what can be completed given funding. The impact within the ecosystem for Cardano does not seem feasible at this time. Presented with a working website and being able to communicate with community members/developers, would add more merit to this proposal. Not having any solid updates or ways of verifying the work that's been done already, and for the accomplishments to follow is something the proposer should consider when attempting to create a game specifically for inexperienced on-chain users/gamers, that could and would feel truly safe when buying in. For these reasons along with the uncertainties left unanswered, this proposal only raises red flags without lowering them. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "As stated above, there's no clear understanding of the targeted solution to the overall problem. Bringing gamers on-chain is the main focus and how to introduce those users to a safe and friendly community like Cardano. The lack of information in regards to the timeline and game development makes understanding how the launch of said game (METACARWARS) will result in the hopeful numbers by Q2 of this year. Twitter following must grow 1000% given the current total, while a discord following of 5,000 members within 3 months seems unrealistic without a current discord community backing of loyal followers before minting of in game NFTs. Having a strong community is everything to the success of any NFT project and the longevity within the Cardano ecosystem.

The author mentions that the game will be launched on the Seabug NFT market, which is one of Cardano\u2019s properties, so apparently Cardano will be able to acquire some form of beneficial inheritance from the project. I must also add that I\u2019m a fan of the extra security and protection from theft feature that the Seabug NFT possesses.\nThe team shall receive praise on my part for being able to deliver such well-written and engaging content of the game. The proposal basically covers all aspects that would give increasing rise to players\u2019 interest in the game. Specifically, the author states that this is a game for both NFT holders and non-holders, boasting equality in the community; offers a stimulating game lore and setting with various missions to complete in exchange for valuable rewards. The game also features different game modes, customizations that players can apply to their BattleCar to compete with others, and 6 rarity rankings for players to distinguish their possessions. The target audience aligns closely to the challenge setting as well. The only small tweak I\u2019d like to make is that though a particular obstacle to the project has been brought up, yet there seems to be a fitting solution to the obstacle.

I also notice that the timeline for the completion of this project is considerably shorter than the previous proposals that I\u2019ve encountered, which I assume is a good thing if the eventual quality of the game is guaranteed. I would argue that the proposed budget is admissible, especially given that the proposer based it off careful research.

In fact, there are a lot of threats for game projects such as: the scale of the game, unrealistic expectations or publishing. If you're creating a game in an existing genre, you'll have to compete with everyone else on the market. Often, the competition is made up of large corporations with a lot of money, who will not suffer if their game fails. Hence, in order to get a good knowledge of the game and how it works, you'll need to have a solid core and meta in place for a soft launch. An early soft launch will allow you to understand the game's attractiveness. The only validation to look at is based on the game's playtesting and analytics to reduce the possibility of unreasonable expectations. Sequels are effective when the target audience has demonstrated a desire for one. The requirement has been discovered using data that supports the premise that the target audience is interested in playing comparable titles with a high level of novelty.
