So far, many people have been scammed and rug pulls can and will happen in the Cardano ecosystem sooner or later (few have actually already happened). The author himself/herself has been a victim of such a scam and with this proposal wants to the address this problem. The author aims to create a platform where people can be educated about NFTs and other crypto related topics. The most interesting feature will be the time-locked identity functionality. NFT creators can submit their project and their identity and set a predetermined date on which their identity will be revealed to the public.
