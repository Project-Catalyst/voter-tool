This is no exception. The concept of combining a puzzle game and H.P Lovecraft\u2019s renowned horrendous works sounds creative and engaging, and with the integration of Cardano-based NFTs it should be capable of inviting gamers to join in the fun, at least in theory. I\u2019m also amazed by the proposer\u2019s claim to have already completed most of the development and illustration work, hence the need of seeking extra funding.\nHowever, I feel the proposal would perform better with the addition of\nMore details on gameplay, game lore and settings. For example, which of H.P Lovecraft\u2019s creations will be chosen to be featured in the game, or are there any game modes, quests or perhaps a time limit commonly seen in puzzle-theme games, or what kinds of NFTs will be available in the game and will they be manually crafted by players or handled by the system?\nKey metrics (in figures, if possible) related to the supposed success of the game if funded. For instance, the reference of a user base or the reward mechanism.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "In this regard, even though I mentioned above that I\u2019m pleased with the team finishing most of the work ahead of this proposal, I would still prefer if they included that particular set of information to present and further establish the potential of the game. Otherwise, the budget breakdown is sufficiently specific, and $34,000 seems to be a rational figure. The statistics for the team members are presented as well (though not plentiful), and I believe that the search for freelancers is a wise move, as freelancers are more cost-effective while still capable of delivering satisfactory performance.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I do agree that this proposal does provide a good sense of auditability, as demonstrated through the means of development progress tracking, which include GitHub and Trello, two quite popular and efficient platforms.\nHowever, I strongly suggest that more materials related to the foreseeable success of the project be included. Specifically, other than promising to deliver high quality gameplay and experience, the game should also meet the challenge requirement of adopting massive numbers of players to the game in particular and Cardano in general. I also notice that there is no information regarding whether this is a new project or not.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1664", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3757, "q0": "Since the result of the proposal is to attract more users to the Cardano blockchain, I think this project aligns with the challenge.\nHowever, there are some points that I think the writer can consider adding to make the proposal more complete.\nThe introduction to the game is shown quite briefly. The writer should specifically add features by the example as well as the attachment.\nThe only risk shown is lack of capital and the treatment measures have not been exploited deeply,  the author should propose detailed solutions to deal with this risk and analyze more closely other possible risks in the project development process.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The author mentioned that the game will be released in the second quarter of this year and has completed most of the work except for the step of improving the quality of the project. However, I think it would be better if the author could analyze the current situation more specifically, adding specific timelines, especially how long the last step will take as well as the items to do in this step. \nBudgets for items like refining implementation and marketing should be described by smaller items with specific costs for each item. The team member about Illustration & concept art has not been described specifically and has the reference link attached same as the member about software development. For the participation of freelancers, to make the readers can better visualize the personnel of the proposal, the writer can mention a number of freelancers who have collaborated or are planning to collaborate.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A big plus is that the project allows the community to track the progress of the project in a variety of ways using git tools, public Trello board, their GitHub repositories. There, readers can see what items the project has completed.\nHowever, this section will be more complete if the author can add quantitative indicators with a timeline, the reader will be able to rely on these points to be able to see if the project is on the right track with the original plan or not.\nThe success of the project is being described quite generally, if the author can further analyze the performance criteria to determine whether the project has achieved its goals or not, I think the community will have enough more information in the assessment.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1674", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4480, "q0": "Generally, this game is a nice-to-play game, even though I would like the team to consider some concerns below for a better proposal. First of all, this is a horror-themed game, so is there any PEGI age rating issue that need to be noticed? Secondly, the game features can help to on chain gamers that are looking for problem solving and puzzle game, but how can you guarantee that this game will be stand out among other similar games? Move to the next point, this game planned on giving NTFs and tradeable tokens as rewards, but are there any plans to up selling or increasing the using of ADA? Last but not least, lacking of funding is just the start of risks in gaming industry. The team need to also consider other risks. For example, is there a market risk involved? If yes, then what exactly is market risk? Is there a consumer need for your game? And how did you get to that conclusion? Any case study or research methods that are used during the process?", "q0r": 2, "q1": "As checking  up your Github and Trello, we found a list of what you completed and what is still on processing. Even though we will need it to be more detailed, likely, how did you guys finish these tasks? How long did it take? What languages or methods were used? For the future plan, we would like to have a timelines with tasks and reports or metrics to measure that you are working effectively. Comes along with the detailed budget, we will need the exact numbers for the team members that you planned to hire, how many hours will they work in a day? How many days a week? Is there any deadlines and KPI for them to keep? Is there any solutions to manage delays and unexpected issues? What is your targeted market? What channels will you use for marketing? One highlight here is you guys already had 2 professional team members who are experience and matched with the project mission. That can be a help with delivering everything qualified. However, the missing of other team members can cause hiring problem, which will lead to publishing obstruction. In addition, working with freelancers can be a threat to people management, will there be anyone that are experienced enough to help you guys with that?", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Meanwhile,your Github and Trello are basic of listing. I love how you bring up the smart contract in Girhub to help increase transparency and reduce operating costs.
