It is a new proposal that will complement an already existing chosen project. The game Duo by Revelar, which is part of the Cardano ecosystem, will now be translated into other languages, here into Portuguese. Language translations help to expand the player community globally, which will have an immense impact on Cardano. The team is committed to ensuring that the translation is accurate and that the game experience is optimised. Players from the Portuguese-speaking world will be introduced to the Cadarno blockchain. NFT's cards will be used to create a play-to-earn experience tied to the Cardano Blockchain. The team has done a risk analysis and developed appropriate solutions to keep the risks low.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has chosen a rather short time frame for this task, which is divided into short work steps.

Based on a quick search we did we saw that different translators have different lead times and hourly rates. We therefore though it prudent to put in a high level budget that describes the funding allocation without committing to specifics, and drop the amounts we are asking funding for. The shortfalls we will cover internally.\nAuditability: Our website for tracking proposals presents more information that required, however we cannot present the time taken for each line-item yet as the work still needs to take place.

"}, {"id": 5974, "q0": "This proposal\u2019s goal is to translate the Duo\u2019s first deck from English to Brazilian Portuguese. Duo, as a card game, could be quite easily translated to other games since the content is sizable, limited and well known. With this, the reach and therefore impact of the game would be increased to other communities, specially the Portuguese speaking community (focused in Brazil). This is a quite simple proposal, which aims at expand the impact of an already existing game. This is aligned with the challenge\u2019s goals since it would increase the reach of the game and onboard new gamers that otherwise couldn\u2019t be comfortable with entering this world. All the mapped risks make sense - since this is a joke based game, it\u2019s not guaranteed that it would work in different languages because of many linguistic and cultural reasons, but it\u2019s expected that the majority of the jokes would still work. To lower the impact of such a thing, it would be interesting to also include the original version in English, so some curious players could look for the right meaning, if they don\u2019t understanding already in English. This team is proposing similar proposals to other languages, and for Portuguese I believe the impact is going to be big, since the gaming Community specially in Brazil is quite significant. This translation can really increase the impact of this game. [For QA: part of this assessment is similar to the assessment of their other translation proposals.]", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The presented roadmap seems to be feasible for the execution of the plan, and it makes sense according to what was proposed to be developed. The budget is also well explained, but it looks quite low and seems to be short, but the team must have done some research to come up with these numbers, therefore they are probably enough to deliver the content. The proposing team from Revelar is well experienced in game development and they are known in the community. Although, the translator themselves are yet to be found, what adds a small uncertainty to the execution, but what shouldn\u2019t represent any high risks to the timeline presented. [For QA: part of this assessment is similar to the assessment of their other translation proposals.]", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The Revelar team keeps track of the development of their Catalyst funded proposals in a dedicated webpage, which is very good for auditability and easy to track. The success of the proposal is well described and there are KPIs to track it\u2019s success after launch based on the number of new players from this new community. To make it better, I would also include some KPIs related to the sale of the translated NFTs, at least. At stated, this is not a continuation of a funded proposal, but it is attached to another \u2018main\u2019 proposal submitted in Catalyst in this same fund. It would be good to have better explained the relation between theses proposals, is this somehow depends on the main one getting funded or not.

", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The experience and formal education of these proposal members are plausible and coherent to make the project happen. But one thing that made me wonder is the time and the money requested to make each project phase happen. Is that enought only 2 weeks to find a translator and start a partnership with him?

It's important to know that if the deadlines are wrong, the money requested also would be insufficient.

I think this is very true and a laudable idea. Translating Duo, the NFT card game on Cardano, into a variety of common languages , not only enables people to experience utility-based NFT in their language but also provides a more diverse and enriched Cardano community. \nDuo is the flagship play-to-earn NFT game powered by Reveler. Duo brings together humor and CNFTs as an easy entry NFTs game in the next wave of gaming. Duo aims to bring more people into crypto and does so through humor. \nBy porting game content across language and cultural barriers, more games from around the world are given access to a global community in a way that is familiar to them, and this addresses very well the challenge called Gamers on-changed. \nThe risks associated with this proposal are listed in the proposal such as translation challenges, cultural translation, remote collaboration, product fit, to mention a few. However the proposers want to deliver the highest value with the least amount of technical complexity to grow the community. This proposal has put in a lot of effort and the social impact of creating humor for people through this Duo game can relieve a lot of people stress and related problems, thus making people happy for growth in the communities. My rating is 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The timeline and plan is clearly stated in weeks of activities such as 2 weeks for finding a partnership with a translator, 2-4 weeks for translating the content and creating new content if time allows, 2 weeks of generating new assets from the translated content, and 4 weeks of marketing and launching a game deck in the appropriate region relative to the content.\nThe budget breakdown is clear and understandable with costs allocated to translation services, REgional content creation, collection design overhead, Regional marketing for the new collection. However, with this laudable idea, the total budget requested amount of USD4750 somehow looks low but maybe their economy is not costly so I will not comment on it negatively. I think this is a great proposal and I recommend funding for it.

The metrics are on time delivery of translated and regional content, onboarding of gamers divided into 3 months - 100 new players, 6 months - 250 new players, 9-12 months - 500-1000 players.\nThis is a new proposal though Reveler has past proposals.
