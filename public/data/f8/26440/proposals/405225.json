By provided a no-code, GUI based experience for minting gaming assets, it will accelerate development for gaming on Cardano. As an NFT artist, without much blockchain technical experience, this approach will take the complexities of minting with a CLI out of the picture. One point I feel the proposer could elaborate more on, is how minting gaming assets is much different than minting jpegs. Other NFT services exist on Cardano, such as Tokhun.io, NFT Maker, and JPEG store, none of which have a GUI based builder approach like the one demoed in the video. Honestly ,it looks very nice just from the demo. Good work. If successful this application should increase the nunber of games on Cardano, the number of users, and the total value of CNFTs on Cardano by opening up the space to artists, who may or may not be blockchain professionals. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The funds requested, and hours provided are justified to deliver the project as described. The dollar amount proposed to be paid to a senior developer are comparable to market prices in the U.S. The proposer gives summary descriptions of the proposed development path with the use of sprints. The sprints are broken out into reasonable time frames, with just one sprint on the UI/UX, as the team already has a demo project, as shown in their YoutTube video. I work for a local municipality in Information Technology (Specifically GIS), and I have had to work with several application development companies, and have seen the time and effort that is required for development. The time and effort as described are reasonable. \n\nAdditionally, the resumes provided for the team members are excellent. Thank you for providing detailed information on who the project is in command of, and how their qualifications and experiences can give the voters ease of mind that the funds, if awarded, will be put to capable hands. \n\nLastly, in terms of giving the voters a more informed view into the project, it might be beneficial to provide some information on Revelar's API. Perhaps a link to what services the API offers the DUO team in regards to this project. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project might be a gold standard in regards to auditability. The use of a website to specifically provide written and video updates every two sprints with demos is excellent! If awarded, its up to the community to hold the team accountable for the their promised communications. However the team is very transparent and well organized so there is little reason to have this caution. Additionally, I think they put a \"cherry on top\" when they promised to provide an attribute in the meta data for all of the CNFTs minted by the product to allow for tracking of assets. This will allow for tracible proof of the effectiveness of the project, and to hold it to the goals as set out for the year. 50 projects in the first 3 months post version one, seems a little high, as that would require onboarding a project every two days. However, I do not have direct experience in working with the CNFT ecosystem as a gaming company or minting service, such as Revelar and the Duo team, so this may be a realistic target. None the less, if they achieve their goal, it will bring great value to the Cardano gaming ecosystem.

And yes, this aims towards those who are looking to cut down some of their budget spendings and embark on an easy and convenient NFTs minting process, which I believe aligns closely to the main objective of this challenge by drawing in more NFTs developers in the process. The team has also managed to put forward 3 main issues that the project could face in the foreseeable future, followed by what I consider to be 3 highly viable resolutions for them, and the team further reassures me by including extra help in the proposal as well.

With continuous advancements, it can be expected that more and more gamers and consequently game developers will be attracted to Cardano. The proposal outlines the initial difficulty of a game development team to raise funds and make themselves familiar with the Cardano protocol. With their No-code NFT minting software, the team wants to enable game developers an easy access into the CNFT ecosystem and allow them to raise funds early on that will make further game developments possible. \n\nImportantly, the proposal highlights several challenges and potential solutions. The solutions indicated in the proposal indicate the team\u2019s determination, their creativity (e.g. launchpad application) and their strategic planning. \n\nOverall, the proposal clearly addresses the challenge, and if successful, will lower entry costs into the Cardano game ecosystem, will increase the game variety and will help developers build their communities much faster.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Altogether, the team has experience in different fields including mathematics, software development, engineering, entrepreneurship, and marketing. Two out of the three members have also participated in the Plutus Pioneer programme, indicating a solid understanding of Cardano\u2019s protocol infrastructure and technical programming knowledge. \n\nThe team is requesting funds for one Frontend Developer for 3 months. The requested budget of 36k USD for one developer is high but reasonable, as good developers generally come at a price. However, it is not clear to me whether this developer will be hired or is already part of the team and if so what experiences he/she has. Furthermore, speaking from experience, the three months time frame might be tight for one developer. Sickness or other uncertainties might arise, that could affect the developer\u2019s performance and time available. \nNevertheless, given the team\u2019s background and their combined experiences, I am confident that the team can find solutions along the way and implement the proposal successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Since the code won\u2019t be open source to begin with, the team has set up a dedicated website where they provide real-time progress and final developmental reports.

These KPIs will be included as metadata element in the JSON file, therefore visible to anyone. This is a fair and transparent way to audit the success of this proposal.

It was not clear to me if these NFTs are going to be only generative - as mentioned in the problem statement - or any kinds of NFTs, as it seems based on the other parts of the proposal. Since it mentions the creation of attributes, which are probably going to be stored as metadata, this fits well the Gamers On-Chained challenge, since it\u2019s a tool that can be used by other games as well. This application could definitely help small projects on creating their first NFTs, at least. The functionalities presented here are good enough for a first version of this applications. The risks mapped  makes sense, and the proposed solutions might work out well if these risks become problems in the future.
