In addition, we note that a very correct strategy was chosen, first focusing on gameplay and building concepts that make the game interesting, before bringing purely commercial aspects such as the introduction of NFT's or micro transactions. When analyzing both the ideas present in the proposal and the concepts exposed on the website, we see that in general there is information that aims to convince the reader of why the game is interesting and has great possibilities for adoption. In this context, we were able to find instructions on how to play the game, possible strategies, the average time of each game, the idea of \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200beasy learning of the game and even ways to escalate its difficulty if you are looking for an additional challenge.\n\nAll of this helps to create a solid foundation for an interesting product to exist and, after that, the 'bridge' connecting players with the Cardano universe is created. We also realized that the strategies chosen to create this bridge are relevant and have a real possibility of increasing the visibility of the game among the different groups around the project. We see that there are even strategies to attract different audiences around Captivate. Given all these factors, we realize that the project has a good possibility of increasing the visibility of Cardano's ecosystem in the long term, as well as meeting the goals of the challenge in which the proposal is. The only detail not so positive at first would be the requested budget amount, $63,000. Let's take a closer look at this later.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Having seen all the factors described above, one can imagine that the process as a whole is expensive. In fact, the destination of the capital being requested is explained in the budget breakdown and its allocations make sense. The question in question comes from the fact that a lot of capital will be allocated to the physical production of the game, already aiming at the construction of different print versions and their future commercialization. In this, we notice that tens of thousands of decks will be produced and this raises a little doubt if there will really be a sufficient audience to absorb such production. From what was described in the proposal, it was not so evident whether the team already has previous experience with a project of this size.\n\nGiven this caveat, we noticed that the professionals involved have very relevant experiences for the project, it is also interesting to mention that Lisa Lee's experience as a Starbucks supervisor can help a lot in the negotiations that will be made with retailers about the commercialization of the game. In addition, it is possible to find the curriculum of the professionals involved in the project.\n\nThe way described in the plan of inserting elements of Cardano in the game also seemed quite adequate for not being something too intrusive. The strategy of inserting elements of Cardano's culture into the game's cards seems like a great way to gain popularity. Adding informational cards about Cardano to the deck is also an interesting way to spread knowledge about the ecosystem and related projects.\n\nThe actions planned for each quarter are defined and it is interesting to note that marketing is also considered, but not only with the aim of exposing the game, but also teaching how to play it, which is quite interesting for building a community engaged (including establishing a presence on social networks such as discord was also idealized).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In line with the steps indicated in the feasibility plan, we also have a roadmap on the project website that indicates the goals that must be achieved in the quarters of 2022 and 2023, already visualizing media actions from the beginning. The monitoring of the arts being developed for the cards also helps to see the evolution of the game, including in relation to the fact that themes are produced for different niches.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that, additionally, once the goals presented here have been reached (or even during their execution) it would be interesting to get in touch with people from Cardano so that new ways of integrating the game into the ecosystem are discovered, in addition to the already existing. A numerical goal could also be established, representing the expected revenue to be achieved with the launch of the game or a number of followers present on social networks that promote the game.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 3, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1731, "q0": "Game market and physical collectibles.

Possible difficulties and problems on the way to success are also considered honestly and soberly and solutions are provided. The team as a whole brings a great potential of skill, knowledge and experience, as they are obviously in the gamer scene and have studied their craft.

These also help to understand the project better visually.\nIt is exciting to see that board and card games also have the potential to connect to customers and build bridges to the digital world through tools such as Extra Info Cards, FTS, NFTs and Crypto Payment Modules. In this respect, one can say that a strong impact on the Cadarno community is to be expected.\nRemarkable is also the focus of the team on the environmental compatibility of the product and the willingness to stand up for the environment and climate within the framework of the project.

The timetable is easy to follow and is divided into concrete milestones. Design work, preparation for distribution and advertising run in parallel and in sensfull stages. All in all, I can say from my own experience, albeit in the field of fashion design, collection creation and distribution, that the timetable seems feasible and can be adhered to. However, I have to say that the team seems rather small to cover all the tasks. This can lead to the risk of delays.\nThe budget seems reasonable if you look at the planned number of pieces and take into account the creative workload. Only the item shipping and distribution is a little irritating, as these costs are usually distributed to the customer and are reflected in the product price.

It is straightforward, flawless in grammar and vocabulary, and organized with highly specific details with a crystal clear methodology. \nFor me, a successful presentation of how a game could perform a powerful impact should consist of these factors:\nThe proposer goes out of their way to include various information regarding the gameplay mechanism, game lore, game settings, features, rewards, its exclusive content and ultimate goal(s).\nThe proposal includes noteworthy and trustworthy content such as KPIs, core metrics and target audience, with concrete evidence or estimated figures.\nThe proposer is able to include obstacles and/or risks that the project may potentially face in the foreseeable future, and solutions to successfully eliminate those obstacles and/or risks in great detail (even though the world-scaled conundrum known as the COVID-19 pandemic renders two problems unsolved for now, it\u2019s still acceptable as the world economy has yet to have an effective solution anyway).\n\nThis proposal manages to check all those criteria. Additionally, I\u2019m genuinely surprised by a few elements as well, namely the different approach that this project takes from the traditional way that a game with a cryptocurrency-based blockchain would, which is focusing on the physical aspect of games rather than digital. And the Cardano ecosystem will not be the only thing reaping benefits from this project, but also, according to the proposer, nature will receive some positive changes as well, since the project aims to cut down on the use of plastic-based items and deforestation by making to donations to the Cardano Forest organization.\nAll in all, this is a very promising beginning.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Once again, the proposer has put together a strong performance in my opinion. The estimated road map is logically allocated to each quarter in great detail, going so far as to categorize which part of the project is completed, in progress or in queue. The estimated budget funding is graspable, and this is the first proposal I\u2019ve seen where tax is also part of the budget, proving that the proposer has considered all expenses. The provided information depicting the team members\u2019 background and capabilities is sufficient as well, though I imagine that any sophisticated project like this one should take up more than 2 people.\nOne small flaw I noticed is that there is a hired professional who is in charge of creating a promotional video and an instructional gameplay video listed in the road map under Q3 of 2022. However, this individual does not come up in the team members section. Since that\u2019s the case, I would like the proposer to supplement that person\u2019s information and payroll (if not already included in the budget breakdown section).\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As far as auditability is concerned, the team has illustrated the key information necessary to assess auditability excellently.

I think it\u2019s a fair idea. Firstly, tabletop games are one of the most popular game genres on internet. The games that the proposers promise are simple but difficult to master with a lot of features to keep gamers and their friend interest, hence it\u2019s addictive and can attract a lot of different type of gamers come to Cardano. Secondly, the idea of building a game based on skill but not pure luck and bring gamers a fair platform to. It\u2019s solid foundation on the way to make Cardano become a go to blockchain for gaming. However I have a huge doubt of the physical game idea since it seems to be going to take a lot of efforts to make the game popular and attract players to actually buy the game and gather around to play it while they can learn about Cardano from other source. Without a real cultural aspect in the game and an attractive rewards system, I\u2019m not sure about how the game will help with the challenge objective which is achieving mass adoption of Cardano\nMoreover, besides all the pros of the game that I agree with, I have more worries about the cons like how effective will the proposer\u2019s solutions for those foreseeable difficulties that they address especially most of them are out of control.

However I would like to see a more thorough budget breakdown for each phase of the project, even maybe the cost per deck and the profit from that.

Regarding seriousness, this team is certainly not just saying but has already done some remarkable works creating a beautiful website presenting its idea and providing information. And in terms of addressing the challenge, specific statistics and core metrics to measure different factors are very carefully listed, not even to mention a wide range of creative ideas given such as making donations to plant trees or putting QR codes that link to the Cardano ecosystem in order to not only provide the highest value to both players and the environment but also bring Cardano closer to the community. Additionally, the author has also done massive work presenting what challenges they have faced and will face in the future, along with overall solutions to those problems. Finally, the most impressive part of this proposal is undoubtedly the fact that there is a link attached almost anywhere a reliable source of information or proof is needed, making it looks tremendously reliable and also indicating the professionalism, enthusiasm and great capability of the team behind this project.

Despite the two pretty good previous parts, there are only details about the two founders of the project provided in the proposal.
