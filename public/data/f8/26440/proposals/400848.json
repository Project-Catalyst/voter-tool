The team has identified this problem and is trying to address it with their proposal and idea. \n\nWith their card game app framework, they want to facilitate and accelerate the development of novel card game applications on the Cardano blockchain. With this framework available, game developers won\u2019t need to start from scratch but can directly begin with implementing their ideas. Consequently, the time needed from start to finish (of a card game) could be considerably reduced with this framework and more developers might start building card game applications on Cardano. With a larger variety of fun and exciting games (facilitated by this technical framework) more gamers could be boarded on the Cardano ecosystem. \nTherefore, the proposal very effectively addresses the challenge and could have a strong impact on the Cardano community.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Unfortunately, a detailed timeline is not provided in the proposal. The proposal states that the framework will be available in November 2022 but additional information on milestones or other deliverables is not specified. \n\nThe budget plan is detailed, overall reasonable and importantly, working hours are specified. This shows that the team has considered all aspects of the projects. From my experience, the costs for legal advice are underestimated and more funds should be allocated to that. Potentially, the funds allocated for project management could be slightly reduced and reallocated. \n\nOverall, the team members have backgrounds in engineering, software development, cyber security and UX design. Every team member seems to have a unique skill set that is required and important for the successful implementation of this project. The Github repositories of some of the team members indicate active development and code contributions. \n\nThus, it is likely that the proposal will be implemented successfully. However, since a detailed plan and timeline were missing, only 4 stars were given.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Metrics based on which the progress and the development of the project could be measured are not outlined in detail. Individual developmental updates or reports could be useful to keep track of the progress, but no information is given on that. Furthermore, it is not stated clearly whether updates can be tracked on the team members\u2019 Github repositories or the project\u2019s Github page. This should have been stated more clearly. Additionally, social media channels (e.g. Discord, Twitter) where updates could be shared with the community are not provided. This makes it difficult to assess the progress along the timeline. \n\nThe team states, that the proposal can be considered successful if the framework is used by one or more projects. Given the funds requested, this metric is not really convincing me and seems \u201cnot enough\u201d. It would have been better if the team had specified certain user/project numbers that make use of their framework. This would have been a good KPI based on which to measure success since eventually it comes down to how many game developers actually use this framework and benefit from it.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1939", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6091, "q0": "Creating an opensource re-usable framework to bootstrap card games on cardano blockchain will attract developers to cardano and in turn the developers will attract their player base to use cardano.\nIt will be nice to add a link to Cardano after dark(https://www.cardanoafterdark.com/) as it is referenced in this proposal instead of the github page.\nIn the Potential risk/challenges section, It will be nice to give a clearer context as to the term \"State\" as most CA might not be Programmers(In this context, the word state is used as a way to store information during a process to speed it up). \nA suggestion on how to manage state if you permit me to suggest is probably off-chain and will speed up interactions at no cost , only keep interactions that finalize transactions to the chain.In so doing the fees will only be charged only if you need to interact with the blockchain (A smart-contract should be able to handle off-chain requests through you Master wallet- secondary wallets can reside on exchanges) one major drawback to this is that you will have to manage your wallet as well as your copy of the blockchain (Please note that these are suggestions without knowing the full context of the problem).\nI will be giving 5 star.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal provided verifiable links of the team and a detailed milestone with cost breakdown.\nLinks provided for the team show they all have the capability to execute this project to success.\nI am giving 5 star", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPI's of this proposal are easy to follow.I have not much to say here but wish the team good luck.\nI am giving 5 star as all necessary information to track this project are provided.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_331", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10025, "q0": "The team is proposing a enhanced card game experience on the cardano chain.

The solution offered is something that would uplift the gaming ecosystem in Cardano, specifically in the card game genre. If I understand it correctly, it is the architecture/scaffolding for developers to build on top of: matchmaking; sit on table and lock funds; connecting to a Cardano node. There doesn't seem to be anything related to card game specifically so I wonder if it could also be applied for other 'simple' games like chess, checkers, backgammon where two players can add money into the game.
