The intention is that some NFTs will only be generated from combinations at certain times of the year, so that they are really special. I didn't understand very well what the profitability of the players would be. How would they profit from selling the NFTs directly? Would this sale happen in the game itself or on an external platform? In other words, would there be a marketplace here? Other than what I explained, no further information about the game is given. We don't know if there would be mini games within the game, which players vary with the NFTs once they were possessed... would they be a kind of virtual pet, would they need to be fed? Would they go through some challenges? Would they level up? Aside from minting the NFTs on the Cardano blockchain, are there other ways the ecosystem would benefit from this game? Would people need to create digital wallets? Would there be transactions in Ada? Overall, I think it's a great idea in terms of it seems to be an attractive game by nature, let alone if players actually make a profit from it. However, I think there was a lack of more details about the rest of the game, we couldn't fully understand how it would be built, what parts it would be made of, what activities would be developed there, that is, how its gameplay would be. It's also unclear whether there would be any other benefits to Cardano besides the minting of the NFTs itself. So, despite being something that I liked at first and could even meet the objectives of the challenge, which are in general to popularize Cardano through games, as the gaming public has a lot of potential to become active in the community, it's not as clear as that. would be done. I recommend that the proponent improve the explanations both about the game itself and the other possible benefits it could generate for the Cardano ecosystem. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The script presented is very superficial. All we know is that the first couple of months would build the \u201cdAPP including SC or server backend logic that runs the game by sending NFTs to a specific address. Here too the designs of the game elements will be finalized.\u201d However, what small activities would be needed to build the dAPP? A project like this is very complex, requiring the work of several professionals (programmers, designers, narrators, illustrators, etc.). There would be several people performing several different activities. The way it is presented to us, the roadmap gives us a general idea of \u200b\u200bwhat would be done, but in reality what we need is for the proponent to explain what would be done monthly in detail. That is, exactly what activities would be performed, by whom, how, for how long and in what order. The Dapp building process involves many things, each of which should have been informed and detailed. In the period of 3 to 4 months, an initial \u201cmint at mint cost\u201d would be made of the first NFTs that will be used by our connection game.\u201d I don't understand what this means. The bidder should be more clear with his explanations, detailing exactly each activity that would need to be done. Now talking about the budget, 3 thousand dollars are requested, I found a very low value for the complexity of the project. However, it would still be necessary to understand how the work routine of the developers and the designer would be, because it is said that they would work on the project in their spare time, which can be a long or extremely short time. Without knowing exactly how many hours they will dedicate to the project, we have no idea of \u200b\u200bthe value of their work hours (although it will be well low, probably because of the total amount.) The team's presentation is quite abstract. The developers talk a little about themselves claiming that they have experience in Cardano through NFTs and are a pioneer s Plutus. However, it would be necessary for them to be more specific in their presentations. I would like to know their full names, which areas of training exactly they have, in addition to their experience in our ecosystem, which previous and parallel jobs they have already developed, it would also be positive if they attached their linkedin profiles. Regarding the designer, it would be much better if they already had someone defined for the position, as we cannot trust the preparation to execute the proposal on someone we don't know. Therefore, I think the feasibility of the project is not good, and it tends to improve in the three fundamental points (script, budget and team). \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I think the proponent is already off to a good start in auditability when he suggests that we monitor \u201cmonthly users, tagged secondary NFT sales, and reviews/articles about the game and community size\u201d. All this data must be measured from the moment the game is released. In the meantime, it would be necessary to monitor the work routine of those involved. Therefore, it is necessary that the proponent prepares monthly reports, containing in the first months feedback and updates on how the Dapp development activities are happening, if there were any problems and how they were overcome, in short, information on how the process is progressing. game pre-release. And after being launched, the reports must contain the data previously suggested by him. This report should be available in a simple and direct way to all members of the Cardano community. It would be interesting to use tools like Miro or Notion, which allow text and images to be attached (drafts of NFT characters, I believe). Finally, regarding the auditability of the final results, success is imagined as \u201cBuild a game that is used by many Cardano fans and allow them to convince friends to try Cardano in a simple and fun game, thus increasing the Cardano community with people who are mostly casual mobile game players.\u201d Right, but how will we be able to monitor whether this scenario has actually come true? I think the proponents lacked a more practical and scalable monitoring strategy. Once these strategies are put into practice, the results of the surveys should also reach the Cardano community, either through Town Hall meetings or even the elaboration of a larger and more detailed report compared to the monthly reports. on partial results. So I think auditability is ok, but it still needs to be further explored and the bridge between the Cardano community and the project team (and the information about it) needs to be better built. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 5340, "q0": "Although several P2E Cardano games are under development only few of them are mobile-based. The mobile/cell phone gamers are a huge part of the gaming sector but have not been addressed specifically in the Cardano ecosystem. To attract those gamers to the Cardano blockchain, the author wants to create a mobile-based crafting game using CNFTs. As there are many mobile gamers but not so many mobile games on Cardano currently, a fun crafting game could potentially onboard new players. However, it should also be noted that there is much competition in that sector. The entry barrier of the game is stated to be comparatively low, as the NFTs can be bought for cheap (however no detailed numbers were specified by the authors), but nonetheless a certain level of understanding of CNFTs (and cryptocurrencies generally) will be required. \nThus, this game is more aimed at blockchain-familiar gamers rather than blockchain beginners. A good mobile based Cardano game could attract more people to the Cardano ecosystem, but at the moment this proposal only sounds like \u201canother CNFT game\u201d. I suggest the proposer to develop more ideas of how this game could be more unique (education aspects, rewards, free starting CNFTs). Overall, this proposal has some interesting concepts but the team should find more attractive features to address the challenge more effectively.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "A rough time line for the first four months was given but a detailed roadmap and milestones were missing.\nAlthough the requested budget is comparatively low (3k USD), a more detailed budget breakdown should have been provided. The team is quite experienced in mobile-based programming languages and creation of CNFTs. Noteworthy, members of their team were also part of the Plutus pioneer programme, indicating a solid understanding of Cardano\u2019s smart contract infrastructure. Unfortunately, no names or social media channels of the team members were given, making it impossible to verify these statements.\nA designer with a larger fan base/community will need to be hired. I am unsure whether such an experienced designer would accept the low salary (1k USD). The team should think more about that and potentially allocate more funds (or request more money) for the NFT design. Based on the information provided, the team seems to be technically capable of implementing the proposal. However, there are some uncertainties regarding the timeline, budget requested and the team itself.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The developments will be trackable by checking the game features within the app. No additional information is provided and thus the progress assessment seems vague to me.

How can the success be measured if no actual number or estimates are given?

The idea itself has to be appreciated in my opinion. However, the type of game the proposer plans to develop is not given in much detail, thus estimating the impact and the kind of audience it might attract is quite in the dark. Also, the proposer seems to be aware of the lack of widespread adoption of Cardano in the gamers community but makes no mention of how they intend to tackle this situation, probably a tad bit of marketing and advertising to popularize the game and its impact is necessary in my opinion.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The feasibility, however, looks promising considering most part of the game is already in place and the only major work left is the integration of ADA-related incentives into the game. The 2 existing members of the team certainly have a reputation and are capable enough of pulling it through. The timeline of 3-4 months to get the project started and the requested funds of a mere 3000 out of the allocated funds is a small chunk. The action plan in place to get the project up and running is quite acceptable. I feel the community could take a chance with them and then see how they come back in the further rounds.

The successful implementation would bring a lot of casual gamers onto the chain, but the team fails to recognize how the game would keep their interest up and retain them active for a sustained period of time. The metrics are very outcome-based, a little more effort in providing the community with development metrics would do the trick considering the proposal is completely new.
