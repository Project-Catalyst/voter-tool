The project seems to be falling within the scope of the challenge setting, which is the large-scale immigration of players to the Cardado ecosystem. The proposer also poses a possible risk to the project, followed by a plausible resolution, even though the project sounds somewhat dependent on the funding.\n\nNevertheless, I would like to bring up some following deductions:\nFirstly, if the proposer promises to deliver a A-listed well-crafted game, what content and features will the game contain, and will they be stimulating enough for players to give it a shot?\nCurrently as we speak, the Battle Royale genre scene is making huge strides in the gaming industry, with Apex Legends being the latest giant on top of the chain (even more impressive considering the game was just released nearly 3 years ago) and lesser-renowned titles like Fortnite and PUBG. And while none of those games above offer an income-generating mechanism, still, it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that a majority of gamers aren\u2019t just in it for making money. Hence, I suggest putting up some sophisticatedly specific details about the game should the proposer wish to strongly interest investors and the community.\nSecondly, while the project does seemingly aim to benefit Cardano as a whole, I imagine the proposal would be more convincing with the addition of core metrics (in figures if possible). For instance, an estimation of a user base, income that each player could possibly earn or what NFTs will be utilized for the game.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "From the plan laid out by the team, I must say that while there are listed relevant stages for the development process of the game in the road map, I notice a lack of milestones that each stage would be predicted to accomplish. And perhaps, a particular year would sound more persuasive rather than \u201c20xx\u201d. \nWhile I cannot ensure that the budget requested is justifiable since I have no experience regarding application/game developing, its purpose, according to the proposal, is for hiring professionals to perfect the building of the game. However, there is no information, LinkedIn links, profiles or affiliations given to verify the background and expertise of those involved. This renders it difficult to provide a detailed feasibility assessment. I strongly advise that for future proposals, the team should present the plan breakdown in a manner that enables the community to evaluate more precisely.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "While the team does mention a means of tracking the development process in the form of quantitative indicators, whose framework will be based off the roadmap, I believe this section could benefit from a more detailed unraveling of the functions of said quantitative indicators. More specifically, what quotient or milestone should the project be expected to achieve at different marks of the roadmap?\nFurthermore, the proposal has left out the part of citing what kinds of benefits the Cardano ecosystem would reap from the success of this game. The same pattern repeats in the listed SDG goals and KPI. Unfortunately, this is an error that should not be present.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1664", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4074, "q0": "The proposal\u2019s intention certainly aligns with the challenge since it aims to build a fun game that consists of Blockchain features such as play to earn, defi components and assets ownership intended for gamers. However, in my opinion, this plan is not articulated and presented properly. You have only vaguely introduced the idea of the solution without delivering any aspect of it. There is no description of how the game will be a solution for this challenge. If I\u2019m being fair, it looks more like a short description of any random game on AppStore, and certainly not enough to deliver the idea for funding a whole project. I have so many thing to ask about this project, for instance \u201cWhere is the fun elements? What is the selling point of the game that will attract gamers and bring benefit for Cardano? Which platform will the game be on (mobile/PC?)\u201d and such. So many questions that I can\u2019t find the answers for them on this proposal. If you plan to run this project for at least 3 years, you definitely need a better presentation of the idea.

Although I agree with the main outlines of this to-do list, I would like to see more details of it such as what you are going to do to plan the development, what kind of research you are going to do? In term of feasibility, I don\u2019t think the proposer has done a well planning for what the team is going to do in this project. Everything still stays as ideas. There\u2019s no detail of requirements of relevant skills or experiences for team members so it\u2019s very difficult to justify the amount required", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This proposal hugely lacks of key metrics. There are not any key metrics to measure so how can the auditors audit the game after its launch? There\u2019s not indicator about any KPIs that could be used by the community to keep track of the progress of the project. Especially when this project is aimed to run for 3 years, it need a short and long term plan and a KPIs with time-related target so that the voters can have confidence in the project\u2019s auditability.

One good point is that the team has foreseen the possible risks in the future and also think about how to mitigate the situation.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has provided a schedule outline as well as budget breakdown. About the way they presented the timeline, I think they should have paid more attention about writing the year, because for me personally, \u201c20xx\u201d is something unclear and pretty hard to understand.

At first, the project sounded very potential and promising to success, however, the author does not make it very clear what the solution really is and to what extent its impact will be. The author says that this game will mimic \u201cSir Charles\u2019s practical methodology\u201d, but does not use even a word to explain what exactly that methodology is. Additionally, there are so many uncertainties in the proposal, which can be clearly seen in parts such as: \u201cif it includes the ability to make money\u2026\u201d or \u201cif the community felt necessary\u201d. Besides, although this proposal is about creating a game, there are barely or just very meagre ideas of what the game is about, how it is built, which features of the game are related to blockchain and how it can help players to gain knowledge about the cryptocurrency or NFT. For me, the impact part of this proposal is more like an unshaped idea that suddenly popped out and was directly written down on paper without any meaningful research or careful consideration.

Just the \u201c20xx\u201d provided as the timeline for the project is already terrible, not even to mention some meagre works listed out with no detailed KPIs or key metrics to measure and track the progress. There are, fortunately, improvements in specifying the allocation of invested money, with very specific positions, numbers of people needed and salary per hour and month for different positions. However, when it comes to approximating the total amount of funded money required, there is a huge asynchrony, while the number given at the beginning of the proposal is 50.000 USD, and the number here is almost 10 times more (489.984 USD)?? As a result, the budget breakdown, despite its details, is still unreliable, and in the end, it is fair to say that this part of the proposal is another disappointment, thus my rating is 1.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Regarding auditability, this proposal lacks almost everything that is necessary to allow the community to follow its progress during development.
