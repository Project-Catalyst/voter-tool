However, the transpired methodology does apply to the gaming perspective as it explores the influence that the gaming industry has had on said aspects, thus engaging the audience and changing their opinions on gaming by imparting such content. Furthermore, legitimacy is guaranteed by the team by offering evidence-based findings only. And since this is a media platform, the possible challenge presented by the team seems relevant to the matter, and the solution, to me, sounds somewhat dependent on the funding approval.\nNevertheless, I feel obligated to point out that the ultimate goal of the project does not seemingly align with the challenge setting of adopting massive users to Cardano, since the proposal only focuses on spreading awareness of the impact of video games, with no mention of the Cardano blockchain.\nAnother question of mine is that while there is an acknowledgement of this being an engage-to-earn platform, I believe the proposer has not yet dug deep into this subject. For instance, in what exact methods should the target audience interact with the brand, and what sorts of prizes or rewards can the participants expect to receive after having engaged with the brand? Further details in this regard would be a further solidification to the project.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Given that the development process is completed, all that\u2019s supposedly left is to advertise and market this project, which has been pitched in the plan. Yet I would prefer if the proposer had included a timeline or time marks to each stage, and perhaps brought up the details of said completed development and the resulting functions of the product. One welcoming feature that this project possesses, at least according to the proposer, is self-sustainability in the foreseeable future. The required amount of funding is reasonable, and each team member listed is accompanied with highly specific details regarding their backgrounds and expertise.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As far as auditability is concerned, I believe that the proposer has mistaken progress measurement for success measurement. Speaking of success, as I have mentioned above, the resulting goal of this project does not include the great benefits that Cardano is promised to acquire, and that effect carries on to this section of the proposal as well.\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1664", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3754, "q0": "The description for Checkpoint is quite general and it is quite difficult to understand all the functions of the project. Detailed explanations of examples or other illustrative materials may be added to give the reader a more general picture of the project. The results of the project are quite brief, general, not yet able to clearly show whether this project has met the challenge, but more inclined to describe more features of the game. The author needs to describe more how this proposal will affect the Cardano ecosystem. Thanks to that, readers can more easily assess the impact of the project\nThe risk part is quite lacking in information and the detailed solution has not been mentioned. Detailed plans for addressing risks that the team is working on or intends to do should be included in this section.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I am very impressed with the team members, all members have a lot of experience in related fields such as Media, gaming, blockchain,... The members' profiles are also described in a concise and clear way. If there is a point to add, that is the author can add link profiles or reference documents of members.\nHowever, the detailed plan is presented quite briefly, so more detailed information is needed. The author can break down the timeline items in the roadmap together with the results to be achieved at each milestone to increase the ease of feasibility assessment.\nThe budget part is being divided into 5 main parts, I think it would be better if the writer could add cost details for these items, for example, number of staff needed, the unit price per hour, number of hours needed to complete, equipment costs and other costs.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Unfortunately, the auditability part is still quite flawed. As stated in the proposal, the success of the project will be measured by the number of people engaging with the product IPs.\nHowever, this needs to be described quantitatively with a specific timeline (at least a 1-month or 3-month cycle), the form of the project reporting its results, and the ways in which the community can follow the project (via email, website, or other tools) should also be added.\nThanks to that, the auditability of the project will also be clearer.\nThe success of the project is also quite general, it should also be more clearly described and clearly show the criteria to determine whether the project has achieved its goals or not.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1674", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3789, "q0": "I understand Checkpoint provides a diversity of video game products for users in many fields. But one of the most significant points I think you should focus on here is the target audience. You should list who will be your aimed players or participants and most importantly, what they will receive from your deliverables. Fortunately, Checkpoint\u2019s mission - exploring the impact video games have on the evolution of society, politics, culture and education - aligns with the key metric that the challenge wants proposals to follow. Thanks to your project, the amount of value made by content creators and gamers will be upgraded significantly, and especially about education for the future generation. Finally, you manage to foresee the risk that your team could face in the future but I think the solution \u201cwe need to be ubiquitous\u201d that you put forward is kinda ambiguous. My advice is that you had better come up with a more viable idea, such as investing in a marketing campaign to upgrade the popularity.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I can figure out what you will conduct in the year 2022 thanks to the work plan that you gave. However, you should remember that the important thing that investors would rather you provided here is a detailed timeline for the whole process of the project. It is unquestionable that you handed in a list of various future activities, but without specific timeframe. To be specific, you\u2019re highly advised to supplement timelines to every milestone, like in which month of 2022, you will release our first sets of NFT cards, distribute the Governance Token or announce major partnerships. This would be much clearer. Similar to the budget breakdown, the information of this section is extremely limited. At least you should mention the total cost of your requested fund to make it clarified because the fundraisers have no time to work out the final number of your wanted budget. Additionally, I want you to know that a good proposal is the one that can present a detailed budget allocation as much as possible. Therefore, if you desire the attention of investors on the project, please add more need-to-be-done activities in every single main content including smart contract creation, marketing, contingency, equipment and team.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "On the whole, the measurement index you proposed is close to reality and highly convincing. Apparently, the traffic index will be one of the most effective tools for investors to keep track of a project under way. Taking your definition of success into consideration, you were able to identify it, namely the quantity of content consumers and marketing spend from game publishers for advertising across the brand. Nevertheless, in my opinion, it would be much better and more convincing if you could roughly calculate these numbers, for example, there will be 5,000 or 10,000 consumers engaging with your content monthly. Such specific numbers will help investors assess the success level of your project.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1675", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 2, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5318, "q0": "The concept of a checkpoint for\u00a0video games is intriguing. Videogames are the simplest form of entertainment for people at home during this pandemic, which is currently ongoing. Investigating how videogames affect people's lives, social lives, education, and so on is a good idea right now. In general, more people are interested in videogames than ever before, and taking advantage of this trend, this is an excellent approach to increase Cardano adoption. In the meanwhile, the proposer appears to be sure that there will be no risk if the project goes as planned. However, I believe that videogames are a big niche, and thus using checkpoint in all forms of videogames would take a significant amount of time and work. So, to have a better idea of the influence checkpoints make, I recommend starting with some of the most popular videogame genres. To summarize, this proposal focuses on a variety of topics and offers a solution to the problem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Although the goals\u00a0for 2022 have been determined, the proposer has yet to submit a work plan for their proposal. I believe they should create a timeline that outlines when they should begin when they receive the budget, how long the project will continue, and what they must accomplish to complete the project. I see where each mission's funding is placed, but there is no plan in place for them. When the smart contract is constructed, when should the proposer add? What kind of equipment do you have?\u00a0The community will be able to see how the budget will be spent if these things are listed. On the other hand, the list of team members is extremely detailed, and the team's experience is publicly available, giving a good first impression of the team's technical and ability to achieve the proposal's goals. I can only give 3 stars rating because of the missing timeline.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The measure for tracking the project's progress, in my opinion, is enough. I also believe that the more people who utilize the product, the more chances there are for Cadarno and the business to grow.
