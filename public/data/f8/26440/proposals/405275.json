For one they have identified the lack of dapps and tools for on-chain gaming experiences, and two, have laid out their vision for a web application or mobile app experience to entice new users to Cardano. As a casual gamer and someone who works in an office environment with colleagues who routinely play quick intersession games, such as Wordl,  I can attest that introducing a play to earn model for quick online based gaming would receive much enthusiasm. By enticing new users to this web based model, in turn, Cardano will see in an increase in new wallet creation and more holders moving off of the exchanges. Obviously the ultimate goal of blockchain based gaming is to reach the big players in gaming such as Epic games, to bring millions of users and total value to the blockchain, but you have to start somewhere and Duo brings a very reasonable and achievable approach. Only limitation to the project is in regards to the possibility of a mobile app version of Duo. There are not many mobile wallets, compared to browser based wallets, and it would be a greater challenge to fulfill that promise. In addition there are major differences in the app requirements for each OS. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This project has a very great chance of implementation. The team is very experienced in regards to backend and frontend development, and all team member resumes (linkedin) are clearly provided. They are upfront about needing a React developer and have budgeted that in the proposal. As student of web development I can attest to the experiences as delivered on the team resumes to be realistic. \n\nOutlining the roadmap of development is clearly laid out in sprints. The timeline is realistic in regards to development. The YouTube videos provided outlay a demo of a frontend app. The first two sprints revolve around laying out the frontend, but perhaps the Duo team could elaborate on how much development has already occurred? If so, clarify if some of the funding requested is to reimburse for work already performed. \n\nHosting web applications that can scale requires API and database backend infrastructure, which can be costly. The Duo team mentions Revelar will provide that infrastructure at no cost. The funds requested seem adequate and are clearly lead out for the web development.  Good work. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Proposer makes it very clear and accessible that all projects funded in the past can be tracked and audited as progress is made. With a proven track record we can be confident that this project will be tracked the same. This is the kind of audibility we want to see in proposals, in which the proposer comes to the community and shows progress, not the community having to ask first. \n\nFor parts of the code base that are open source the team is providing access to GitHub repos. \n\nThe team has laid out weekly user goals and wallet connections and will report on that in their sprint updates via YouTube videos. With all of the information that is blasted at the Cardano Community each funding session it is great to see such effort to be transparent. \n\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1003", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 8, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4820, "q0": "The proposal delivers a precise brief of the game's features. The idea behind this game is simple yet captivating, suitable for casual meetings with friends. The team clearly understands the risks of their project and comes up with fair solutions. \nOne big advantage of this proposal is that it shows the game already had a community of players on Discord which is quite large, about hundreds of people. The content on their YouTube channel is well-thought too in which we can tell they invested quite some time to develop this channel.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Milestones for this project seem transparent and pretty achievable with the durations and outcomes of each sprint. The budget is reasonable and specific to every expense.\nAll of the team members have formal education. I believe they have a solid foundation to handle this project well, both technically and socially. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team dedicatedly built a website for us to keep track of the project's progress along with all their other projects. However, updates about the Duo game\u2019s progress haven't been found yet.

Now they propose to prove its worth by building a (social humor) game with it, one for which they already have a website and have playtested. Adding a game to the Cardano ecosystem with a tool developed for making Cardano games is a double-win. The target of casual gamers is a strong one, and onboarding them into using the Cardano ecosystem will potentially bring magnificent gains.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Proposers are a three-person team with clear technical abilities to accomplish their KPIs. They have a track record for completing Catalyst-funded projects on Cardano. The CEO has been a fullstack dev over ten years, the CTO has post-doc experience working on blockchain tech. While I do not have experience developing a game, they appear to me to have a clear roadmap toward creating the basic elements of the game and then tweaking and balancing gameplay as they improve the design. The requested funds goes mainly toward a React developer ($36,000) who will implement the game as a Chrome extension. The smaller amount of $3,500 would be used well for their goal of completing surveys to rate the game.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is auditable, with planned progress releases on their website, and with a clear end goal of finishing a public web app that lets you play their game, Duo, after connecting your wallet. Toward this goal they have broken down a 6-month timeline of 5 milestones that summarize the steps involved in creating their app, from UI/UX design, to MPV, to tweaking, to load testing.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1842", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5978, "q0": "This proposal asks for budget to transform a Discord based game into a web-based application, also available on mobile. The game\u2019s Discord server has hundreds of people - not sure how many are active, but that\u2019s quite good for a start at least. The game itself might have a small niche though, which are gamers who like fun card games, but it is aligned with the challenge for sure, since it has the potential to increase the total number of players in Cardano, increase the number of CNFTs and contribute to the play-to-earn ecosystem, as they mentioned this would be something they are looking to develop. To increase the impact of this game, it\u2019s essential that it migrates outside Discord, so this proposal is also aligned with increasing the impact of an already existing game as well. The risks are well mapped and they make sense. The proposed solutions are also good and might be enough to mitigate the risks.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The roadmap of this proposal is well presented, milestones are well defined and make sense. I believe some of the sprints might have a bit more or a bit less of work than expected, so there would be an unbalance, but that\u2019s something that can be adjusted during the project\u2019s development. The budget is well explained, and it includes a front end dev full time for 12 weeks. I\u2019d like to see something mentioning the management and integrations costs that this application might have with the already existing content, and also an explanation if the web-version is going to substitute the Discord server or even complement it. There\u2019s some marketing budget, which is good to increase the impact of the game. The Revelar time is well known in the community and they are experienced enough to deliver this proposal successfully, even with the mapped risks.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of this proposal should be easy to do, since the team manages a webpage only for auditing Catalyst proposals. Even though this is not a open source development, the milestones might be able to be verified and also during the IOG Coordinator Meetings and progress reports. Success metrics are defined and enough the preliminarely evaluate the success of the game, although I\u2019d like to also see some metrics related to its sales, at least. It is stated that this proposal is a not continuation of previously funded proposals, as we can see their progress in their webpage.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_31", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Instead of a Discord focused game, bring Duo to the Web.", "experience": "The Revelar team is a known contributor & has been received funding on several projects in previous Catalyst Funds.
