The project here is about creating a Dapp that, in the author\u2019s own words, provides an \u201cupload of legal documents (if necessary)\u201d, that are easily read by users, and are minted on the Cardano blockchain via smart contracts. . The purpose of this new platform would really be to facilitate document attachment in various cases (it would be interesting if the proponent could cite some examples of using Dapp. houses, I don't know?). It seems to me to be a platform that is quite versatile, and precisely because it has so many usage options, it would be useful for the proponent to explain with practical examples how Dapp would work for people. This project is certainly very beneficial for Cardano, because it would allow a series of documents to be minted on our blockchain, payments would be made in Ada as well, that is, a practical way of how our technologies could be used would be generated. This would be a gateway for new people to get to know Cardano and maybe become adept at the facilities that our blockchain provides, that is, I realize that this Dapp would be a good way to popularize Cardano. My biggest doubt in terms of impact would be how it aligns with the objectives of the specific challenge, to mine here we want to finance projects that have a strong social nature, that help the economies of developing countries prosper, that are able to facilitate and benefit the lives of those who are most in need, either through different types of aid. I think this Dapp is going to be very beneficial for Cardano and also for its end users, but I'm not so sure about the more social impact as I said at the beginning of my review. Therefore, I will give 4 stars for the impact of the proposal, precisely because I still have doubts about these more humanitarian applications of the project, which in my view are what differentiates this challenge from that of Dapps and applications. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is ok, we generally know information about the roadmap, budget and team, but they could be described in more detail. In the case of the script, first, it says the tasks that would be done so that in the end the Dapp would be ready and complete. Each of these tasks is also explained better, even if they are just summary topics. In fact, the project is very technical so not all CAs will understand this process from the information that has been provided, but at least the proponents are concerned with placing us on the process. What remained pending was a better established temporal notion. We don't know exactly how long each of these tasks would take, so it was difficult to understand the phases. It would be important that, together with the presentation of the tasks, the proponent inform us in how long, approximately, they would be executed. Would each one take weeks, or months to complete? Would they all happen next, or maybe some could run in parallel? These notions were a little abstract, I always indicate that the script contains a good description of the tasks to be performed as well as deadlines to be obeyed. Now talking about the team, I thought this part of the proposal was great, we know who those involved are and information about them such as their names, roles, professional experiences, etc. It's positive that some people here have experience with Cardano, as it gives more security that the technologies in our ecosystem are executed correctly. My suggestion is for everyone to attach a link where we could see more of their work in practice, as happens with Micha\u0142 in gitlab. In this way, trust in the team would be further emphasized. Finally, regarding the budget: the asking value is considerably high, however the project is complex, many professionals would be working here and many tasks would need to be performed. With this, the need for a large investment is justified. The explanation of the parts is good, it is known about each part of the budget, how much it would cost and why, although some parts, especially the more expensive ones, such as the \u201cenvironment for uploading and signing documents in Cardano\u201d (which would cost 20k alone) should have been better detailed. Thus, we would understand the reason for the requested value for them. So I think feasibility has strengths, especially in the team presentation part, but it could also make some improvements to make it perfect. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability suggested by the proponent would verify the success of the project objectively and accurately, but not completely. As a success, the scenario outlined by him was that people sign documents on his platform, SaaS automated tests are established and at least 1 large organization uses AdaSign to sign their contracts, eliminating the bureaucracy. In fact, these are very direct statistics by which we can get a sense of whether the project is being embraced, that is, if its use is being done as planned. But in addition to how many people used this new technology, a user satisfaction survey could be carried out. That way we would know what these people would be thinking of the new functionality, if they genuinely achieved the goal of dispensing with the bureaucracy that involves reading and signing documents, if they started to adopt Cardano's technologies for other things too, such as if they are investing in Ada or using the blockchain to mint NFTs... Finally, to understand what impact this proposal had on the lives of these people, both in relation to AdaSign and through external means. The proponent does not suggest how to audit the process, I suggest that, as I said before, he includes dates in the elaboration of the roadmap and also that he establish a direct contact with the Cardano community, in order to provide gradual feedback on the progress of the process. This can be done either through the preparation of reports (monthly, for example), or in meetings through video calls, which could take place in specific rooms to follow up on funded proposals after the Town Hall sessions, in short... different ways to establish this bridge, the important thing is that we are constantly updated on the status of things. So I don't think the bidder suggests us specific ways to track and audit his bid, despite doing so by basic means. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 5, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "They proposal has indicated the main features of the product, how their solution will operate to address the raised problem by providing English description of smart contracts.

The proposal team explained the solution in great detail. It is specific to each technical aspect. This clearly shows the impact of the project.\nThe content to show the project in accordance with the key metrics of the challenge is still quite basic and sketchy.

On the other hand, the development of the project also contributed a lot to the expansion of the Cardano community.\nHowever, the project needs a more specific roadmap. Roadmap should be divided into specific timelines. Each milestone must state the tasks that need to be completed. A realistic timeline to push the project to completion is essential for the project to be assessed as having the potential to achieve its goals. The work items to be completed should also be described in technical detail and examples can be drawn from case studies.\nThe budget plan is logically divided and presented clearly and easily with bullet points.
