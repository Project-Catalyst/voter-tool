The challenge setting clearly states areas for dApp proposals and the closest match for the possible directions would be \nEducation Census, and Licensing & Certifications, both imply the use by government agencies or public/state universities that cannot afford to create their bespoke or offline solutions to the problem. \nThe d-edTech Platform dApp for LatAm promises to work with selected universities in Latam, but does not name them. It will deliver a \"learn to earn\" incentive scheme for students and teach about blockchain development and use cases. This is all good, but not suitable for Nation Building Dapps where this proposal will compete with funding and may cut off worthwhile services and integrations that help delivering basic government services like registry, identity, healthcare, elevating poverty etc.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The profiles of the proposers are presented and give the impression of motivated, qualified individuals who have been funded in the past and have close links to the Cardano ecosystem. The roadmap is drawn out over 3 years where \"Success will be achieved if we generate between 50,000 enrollments [...] with at least 10% of these enrollments acquiring jobs\" but starts I may say slow with a 3 months curriculum drafting period. It would have been better for the proposal to ask for a low-budget proof-of-concept to implement the project and be able to in some form quantify the progress. The team has submitted proposals for dApps in many different categories and the quality of each of them may suffer if all of them should be funded, something to bear in mind when voting on this proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I am not entirely sure if the proposal drafting has not been finished or if categories for possible metrics are presented without actual quantitative goals and targets, or if I have to refer to Feasibility to understand possible metrics. Either way, I am not convinced this lack of detail or ability to provide metrics/KPIs is a good precursor for a successful and transparent project that can be audited along its implementation period, especially as the most relevant quantifiable target from  the \"what success looks like\" section is given 3 years into the future. The proposers do mention this under risk assessment where it is stated that they \"plan to maintain this project by gaining support from investors\" meaning that the Catalyst funding is not sufficient to reach a stage where the proposal can or cannot be identified as successful without additional outside funding.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1329", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4059, "q0": "The idea is very  interesting, it is about creating a Dapp, which is based on a previous website, to motivate users to learn through incentives with money prizes. I think this would certainly be useful for users in South America since the majority of them get access to the website through apps. The team has recognised the potential of this phenomenon and developed an app which not only brings benefit in the education fields but also increases the number of catalyst proposals and participants in the Cardano Ecosystem. I notice that the team will be partnering with Techademia to implement a Learn To Earn course with a year of development in selected universities in LatAm, which is fascinating since it provides students knowledge about Cardano and i believe that this is a great method to find new talented developers/ contributors for the ecosystem. A given list of major concepts that will be taught is detailed written to increase the quality of the proposal. Also it would be better if the proposal mention whether the app is free or it does charge an amount of fee, just for clarifying purposes. Overall, I do agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "here is a brief and concise timeline for this project. The author has broken down the plan into three terms and given specific tasks for different time points. However, I think it would be better if the proposal can provide an estimated number of professors onboarded instead of just saying \u201chandful\u201d. They also mentioned detailed targets and tasks to achieve success in the first 3 years of operation and they are all well explained. The budget outlined carefully and broken down into reasonable requirements to be executed. The team members seem very committed and potential since they have necessary experience to cover what is needed for this task and more. It is also possible to verify the information and members\u2019 achievements due to the reference links provided. Having members who had worked with previous Fund can help strengthen the reliability of this proposal and increase its quality. Overall, this is a good feasible proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The mentioned KPIs are relevant and deliverable. Key metrics are in line with the success of the proposal. However, if there had been a roadmap with milestones and estimated time frames added then merged with the KPI info, I think that would increase the quality of the proposal. Besides, I suggest a kind of social platform where the community can be able to audit the development and interact with the team would further increase the level of auditability of the project as a whole.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1702", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4408, "q0": "I see too many intentions in this project that the proposer mentions, create a collaborative and open source d-edTech App for iphone and android that promotes learning through incentives with monetary prizes; partnering with Techademia to implement a handmade Learn To Earn course with a year of development in selected universities in LatAm. I don't know exactly what core product they want to develop, course or d-edTech App? They go into detail describing the course implementation plan and course content without introducing the core features and operation of the open source d-edTech App. I also don't know exactly who they are targeting, at first they stated that their focus was to develop a decentralized application for all users, then they came up with a deployment plan for open courses at universities in LatAm for students. In general, I do not have enough basis to conclude whether their solution can solve the problem of the challenge or not, there is too much inconsistent information in their proposal.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "They develop a project development plan consisting of three short-term, medium-term, and long-term phases, each of which sets out the main activities/tasks that will take place and the goals/results that will be achieved. . As for the budget, fortunately, they provided more detailed information (activities/resources/personnel) in each category. I encourage them to give a cost for each small activity in each large category, for example, $2000 for operations and infrastructure, how much for the cost of the venue rental, the travel cost, and the security. Some members still haven't fully updated their Linkedin profile or something that can verify their qualifications as described. In general, other members are provided with a full LinkedIn profile, career profile, and work history by the proposer. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer should include two core pieces of information so that the community can measure the progress of the project. The first is the way for the community to access information about the project's progress, I encourage them to build social networking sites or blogs as information channels for the community. The second is a specific roadmap with timelines, goals to be achieved and specific KPIs to be achieved, for example, 3 months after the platform is stable, we plan to have 100 students registered in class, 30 lectures, at least 1 student become a developer and get hired, 2 universities are referred for. Auditability and reference value in this section are very low, I wish they would focus more on these issues.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1724", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Create a collaborative and open source d-edTech App for iphone and android that promotes learning through incentives with monetary prizes", "experience": "Defi Discussions LLC partnership with Techademia, Plutus Pioneers, 20+ of years experience in software engineering, 15+ of years DEVOPS expertise, counseled by Business Advisors, Marketing advisors, and Deans of respected Universities, F4-F7 Project Managers, Access to BoE"}
