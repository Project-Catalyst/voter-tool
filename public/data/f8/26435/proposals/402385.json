Having a dedicated challenge is definitely worth it. DAAP at the moment is at the forefront of Cardano research. Expanding the scope of research and resources through catalytic proposals can strengthen the DAPP ecosystem and development. The Cardano community should have the opportunity to discover and do consistent research encouraged through catalyst funding", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The community's ability to tackle an open research challenge should not be underestimated, especially given the early age of the Cardano ecosystem. DAPP develops and integrates in a new innovative environment like Cardano Blockchain with its unique features, which requires a great level of participation. I strongly believe that the Cardano community is capable of doing so. We are in good hands with longstanding Project Catalyst community members, legal expertise, global government and citizen services, along with members of the open government, open government, global RAC communities. demand in the challenging group, is more able to motivate and inspire that effort. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As an open-ended research challenge, one could argue how irrelevant the proposed metrics and success criteria are. The challenge proposal does not clearly outline the success criteria, key metrics or research models that should be followed, e.g. a formal peer-review approach. I believe that in this case the proposal would be clearer and more informative to voters on the research standards to be followed (like the IOG that has set the research standard for Cardano on peer review methodology) . However, the challenge team will have an additional opportunity to clarify and provide additional details to suitors once the challenge proposal is approved by the voter.

First, the proposer introduced the solution specifically, such as introducing the characteristics of the project, how the project impacted Cardano and Cardano development. Moreover, the proposer has outlined the strengths and needs of the project to be able to show the importance of the project and how this project can deal with the outstanding problems. The risks that the project may face have also been identified along with solutions, which will reduce the risk when the project goes into operation", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A detailed roadmap has been provided for voters to easily see the progress of the project. In addition, the information related to 'detailed budget breakdown' is quite good. The proposer provided information regarding the project completion time and from there framed the spending.

First of all, the main audience that the project targets are Dapp users in the Cardano ecosystem. Any project that aims to improve the quality of Cardano is very detailed and effective and this project is no exception. Recognizing the diversity in national legislation, the proposer intends to improve Dapp by integrating and updating regulations from multiple countries consistently. Even in the case where too many regulations lead to confusion and inconsistency, the proposer also offers a RAC platform to minimize this situation as much as possible. For persons who have been hurt by legal disparities, the project includes an example Dapp that allows them to regain confidence in registering for and receiving what they are entitled to, in partnership with a social services organization. Needless to say, this will produce a favorable impression on consumers and considerably boost the number of users for the Dapp. Finally, the proposer's suggestions are extremely clear and thorough. It makes great sense in my perspective and will solve the challenges they expect", "q0r": 5, "q1": "With the information provided in this section, I believe the project success percentage is very high. The proposal contains all of the information that investors and specialists require. From the executed strategy with a clearly defined monthly roadmap, the comprehensive budget with a percentage linked, to the team operating with many years of industry expertise. Nothing should be criticized in this part", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Each of the ideas presented here is entirely applicable, extremely cohesive, and rational. The proposal not only states that it would assist users but also claims that it will aid in the development of the Cardano community's capacity. A characteristic that is uncommon in other projects. Particularly, precise data such as 100+ persons contributing to the RAC or a 5% rise in the first year are included in the evaluation of the project's success and development. This tremendously assists investors in determining what the project will accomplish. Although I am aware that in order to prepare so fully, the team had to conduct an extensive study and devote significant time and effort.

One of the biggest challenges for developers is to build a global Dapp that is able to meet local jurisdictions.  I believe this is one the most important projects ever in this category because it will benefit future projects in Nation Building Dapps and in all categories dealing with different nation-states and local governments.  It will allow Cardano Dapps to integrate with varying local regulations and codes to successfully implement their projects.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This is a new project idea but this team is very experienced in working with Cardano and the Catalyst community and has experience in legal and government services and in writing rules as code.
