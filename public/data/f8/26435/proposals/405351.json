That makes this proposal categorically relevant to this challenge, for certain. But it also makes it hard to feel confident about its potential for impact when the minimal level of brainstorming has yet to be done.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The previously mentioned underdevelopment of the proposal definitely affects its potential for success. The team isn't fully formed yet, and it doesn't list any needed cadastre experts, though the two team members listed have good qualifications. A little more legwork would go a long way for this proposal. It needs, probably, at least one more individual on board, though probably two (a technical person as well as cadastre expert), and I would recommend they hold a few brainstorming sessions and come up with a list of more tangible ideas for a future proposal.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Some more information on the \"public process document\" would be helpful.

Since it aims at protecting individual data in particular and national infrastructure in general, this proposal is suitable for the challenge. However, its impact is still a big question mark because the issues related to politics are pretty complicated and time-consuming. This proposal is lobbying for blockchain application in public administration only, but not a blockchain-based security solution. Thus, the broad application is possible, but it is vague as each country has its characteristics. The proposal also did not mention that it will advocate using Cardano's technology or security projects. (Rating given: 3)", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Since the project has not mentioned a technical solution, I will evaluate the economic and political feasibility. The proposer claims that team members have extensive public policy experience. Also, one is the legal leader of Colombia's Multipurpose Cadastre. It can be a considerable advantage in lobbying, which requires political connections. However, I wonder why to ask for funding from Catalyst but not the Columbia government. Economically, a budget of 18,000 for three professionals in 4 months is quite reasonable. However, proponents should consider a longer-term plan. What happens after that? Lobbying is just one step in applying blockchain technology to public administration. Therefore, I recommend developing a completed, detailed outline rather than asking for small funds for each step. This way, the community will have a clearer view of your project, and it will be easier to support fundraising. (Score given: 3)", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The implementation and solutions outlined in the proposal are somewhat general.

The Cadastre register has a wide affect on anyone owning or working in jobs linked to real estate.  The proposal aims to investigate the potential of linking a national Cadastre to Cardano.  The potential exists to significantly improve the security of the register from outside manipulation, and potentially encourage dapp building on Cardano relating to linking the Cadastre register.\n\nFor anyone wondering, a Cadastre is a fundamentally important record for the operations of any country.  It is defined as a comprehensive recording of the real estate or real property's metes-and-bounds of a country. Often represented graphically in a cadastral map.  It includes details of property ownership, the tenure, the precise location etc.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team provides linkedin profiles and list experience in law and involvement in advising public policy.  The team does not appear to be experienced in any areas of real estate, Cardano, or any comparable project.  The team aim to hire the necessary specialists to enable the project to proceed.  A specialist in Public Policies for Development, a specialist in Multipurpose Cadastre and a specialist in Blockchain.  \n\nGiven no names are listed for these potential specialists, it would seem the proposal is waiting for funding before doing the research on who these people should be.  I would suggest the proposer gather potential specialists who are interested, and provide their names in the proposal so they can be evaluated.  This would then enable a judgement on the feasibility of the project.  As it stands I disagree the project is feasible without this critical planning.\n\nThere is no budget breakdown, only that the funds provided will fund the specialists.  I would suggest the budget should at a minimum include the amounts paid to each specialist.\nThe total funds applied for appears sufficient and the 4 month time period also seems reasonable.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The goal is well defined - being the investigation of integrating Colombia Cadastre into Cardano.

In this section, you have mentioned fundamental entities that need to be advised in your purpose, but you forget to identify who they are, exactly. Plus, which benefits could they receive after being given adequate information about the Blockchain system and how to access its use? Please put more words in them so that the community can see how great this project will support the users. Moreover, I think that from what you presented, this project is expected to complete its aim, which is to protect collective & individual data and properties constituted by the cadastral information of private and public real estate. But my advice is that you should explain why this project could accomplish its objective in order to convince the voters better. However, when it comes to your foreseen challenges, it\u2019s obvious that they go with no certain solutions here. No matter what the risks are, the central point is that you need to find a way to address them effectively so as to avoid the rate of failure.

Therefore, my recommendation here is to give your roadmap a precise and detailed timeframe, associated with central activities within each phase, especially as the community could acknowledge what your team will do to achieve these goals and deliver the solution successfully. Next, I can not deny that your budget breakdown is transparent and sticks to the plan, absolutely. What\u2019s more, from all the background of two core members of your team that I have read (including the LinkedIn profiles that you inserted), I strongly believe that this project has a great ability to thrive and succeed thanks to their high competence in this field.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "According to what you announced, the progress of this project will be reported publicly monthly by percentage of each of the four determined stages.

I think this solution can bring many advantages to countries where dispossession and property invasions have already generated a lot of damage since it helps bring appropriate instruments for the formalization of property and to guarantee it.

However, I suggest that some detailed information on 3 specialists should be provided to further increase the quality of the proposal. The team members are very committed to such activities.

The risks of this project are particularly centered on the difficulty of access to the officials responsible for the multi-faceted cadastral policy in Colombia.

Columbia already has a public multipurpose cadaster policy but is identifying ways to allow it to be updated, reliable, and consistent with the real estate system and to make it digital and interoperable with other information systems. \n\nThe team plans to engage those entities working in the space to identify opportunities for integrating the blockchain, for enhanced security and resiliency of the system. Those countries that adopt this technology from the outset are more likely to have solutions that are durable and cannot be changed at the whim of a government or military change of power. While the team is looking at Colombia for their use cases, one could imagine there would be many other jurisdictions that could benefit from such an analysis. \n\nThe introduction of a blockchain solution for cadaster registries would not only provide benefits to the individual through a persistent record of ownership overtime, but it would also likely have benefits for the state apparatus, through large cost saving and increased efficiency. \n\nIn order to get full marks, I would have liked to see some discussion on the current desire of the Colombian state to work towards a blockchain solution. Is there a welcoming sentiment for these solutions or are they seen as undermining to the overall regime? If the state is not inclined to pursue this approach then the impact would be significantly reduced.

The team lays out their plan over a four month period with four different stages at each month starting with approaching the appropriate-level government contacts, to doing a analysis on the current state of play, to developing a blockchain solution within the updating of Colombia's cadaster, to the final stage where they will present their proposal to the state authorities in charge. \n\nIt is a little difficult to know the full feasibility of the project as there is not really a way to know what is entailed at each stage, particularly as it is dependent on agreement from the state to participate. If the state is not willing to engage the project team, there is a high chance it won't be implemented successfully. \n\nNonetheless, the team's credentials do inspire confidence in the proposal and may mitigate the previous point due to their proximity within the system they are trying to change. Specifically, the team notes \"One of the proponents was the legal leader of the project for the implementation of the Multipurpose Cadastre in Colombia at the National Planning Department and the group has extensive experience in public policy\".
