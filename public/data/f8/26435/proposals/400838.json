After the plant\u2019s cultivation process was complete, they would extract the blue dye and dye clothes, and all the information about that piece, such as \u201corigin of the fashion product, such as production areas, raw materials and date on which the fashion items have been dyed\u201d will be minted on the Cardano blockchain. The proponents also explain that each time the same piece is dyed, a new NFT will be generated. The idea is, in short, to produce clothes and fashion accessories in a more conscious way, proponents argue that the heart of the matter is to fight the pollution generated by the traditional fashion industry, where most of the dyes that dye the clothes are from petroleum derivatives; and we all know how bad this process is for the environment. As interesting as the idea is in theory, I disagree that it's a high-value proposition for Cardano, and I also don't think it fits well with the goals of this challenge. Let's go: first, I don't think people will be so curious about information as specific as where the plant that gave rise to the color of your clothes was grown; this seems to be an interest of a more select public, people who like fashion and sustainability. It doesn't really seem like a common curiosity among the general public. So I don't think there will be as much engagement around the NFTs that will be generated. Secondly, the proponents themselves claim that they still do not have an exact development plan for the software that will produce this technology, they admit that the greatest difficulty of the proposal will be to integrate the fashion world, the color extraction process and the Cardano blockchain. During the team's description (I won't go into this now, but just to make my point), we see that only Osamu Takahashi is involved with blockchain, but apparently he's not that knowledgeable about Cardano in particular. For these reasons I am unsure how much this project will impact our blockchain, since even the integration is uncertain. Now talking about the specific objectives of the challenge, in this challenge our purpose is to fund Dapps that benefit a specific country/community. Gabon is mentioned here, but it is not clear whether its inhabitants would contribute to this project and how they would benefit. It seems to me something that would generate benefits mostly for the specific team, but not for the local population. So unfortunately I think the impact here is low. \n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Unfortunately, the viability of the project is low. Let's look at each of the main parts individually. Starting with the script, the activities to be developed are not described in detail, nor do we have a temporal notion of how long each phase of the process would take. Proponents report that it is difficult to predict the exact time of harvest, I agree, we have no way of controlling nature, but they could have given an idea of \u200b\u200bhow long it would take for other tasks (team work) to be done. For example, \u201cdyeing the fabric, etc. using the extracted pigment\u201d; Could the bidders have said how long this would last, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months? Who would work on it? It would be really cool if we knew how this process would be done, what pieces of clothing they intend to dye and etc. In other words, the script is too superficial, we have no way of understanding how long this would all take in practice. Regarding the budget, I also found this part explained in an inadequate way, very superficial, asking for 50 thousand dollars, a very high amount; and the explanation of the parts is very basic, lacking in detail. For example, \u201cPrototyping Product: 20,000 USD\u201d. Why would this process cost $20,000? Who would work here? What would you do, how is the creation of a prototype in practice? Even, from the way it is said, we thought that only one model of clothing or accessory would be dyed, but on impact I had understood that there would be several. I think that the financial explanations are not enough to have an accurate view of how the money would be spent, we don't know, for example, the exact salaries of the professionals involved, nor how much time would be dedicated to the project (how many hours per month, for example) . Thus, we do not have a good idea of \u200b\u200bwhether the asking price is fair or not. Finally, speaking of the team, I also think that the explanations provided about the 3 team members are basic. We don't know examples of their previous work, all we are told is in which professional area each one works. It is also unclear whether the blockchain enthusiast has any specific knowledge about Cardano, as I said at impact. Therefore, trust is not conveyed in the team, it would be important to have examples of what they have done before (for example, a portfolio with the articles dyed by the indigo specialist, examples of projects that the blockchain enthusiast has already been involved in, etc). \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The auditability of the process is very low, the proponents claim that \u201cevery detail of this manufacturing process will be recorded\u201d, so that the information that will be minted on the Cardano blockchain can be gathered in the future. Okay, but where exactly would these records be made? Will they use some data sharing application, such as google docs? How would the Cardano community have access to such information? In addition to data on the cultivation, extraction, dyeing and finishing of fashion products, how will the tasks behind it be monitored? That is, how would we be aware of the work routine of those involved, how would we know if the plans, whether monthly, weekly, etc., were being duly obeyed or if there was a problem? In the way it is explained to us, auditability is still very abstract, remaining in a very theoretical field. Now, for the final results, bidders also very imprecisely state how this auditability would be done. They reinforce the success scenario, said since the impact, being \u201cthe essence of future fashion that we envision is an unprecedented sustainable fashion, with unalterable information about the origin of things, such as raw materials and manufacturing processes\u201d. But how can we perceive the impacts of this, in a measurable way? How can we understand if fashion has become more sustainable, even if on a local scale (Gabon)? The profits generated from the dyed accessories, which will be handmade so I imagine they will be a little more expensive than items sold in fast fashion, where would that money go? How exactly can we measure the return of this project to Cardano? Also, targeting the specific objectives of the challenge, how would this project help the local population of Gabon? How will all this data become accessible to the Cardano community? Unfortunately, I think that everything that is said is very much in the theoretical field, we do not know exactly how this project can be audited, lacking objective data to be achieved, methodologies on how they could be analyzed and form practices through which our community would have knowledge about everything. \n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 8, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The environment is increasingly polluted, people create a lot of things for life such as the invention of dyes from petroleum products, but this also trades off a lot of the living environment.

Gabon may be a small country in Central Africa with a population of over 2 million but I think if this proposal is successful it will have a huge impact on the fashion industry in the future.

Alongside, the proposer also analyse the potentials of development for Cardano ecosystem in the focused country. In general, the proposer has expressed themselves as enthusiastic contributor and changer to the fashion industry and environment, who owns great vision about a more sustainable future and a critical realistic look into the current problem.

I can tell that the team wants to make a sustainable supply chain of fashion with indigo dyes in Africa by involving directly developing the resource, production, and blockchain technology for tracing them. The team has a very good acknowledgment of the context of the society, environment, and resources for the project in the target area - here is Gabon, a small country in Central Africa.
