In this case, the Cardano blockchain will function as a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to identify and track performance of students and teachers thus addressing the need for foundational registry solutions stated by the challenge. \nThe proposer refers to paper by Park (2021) which describes potential benefits of utilizing blockchains in the education sector of which employing blockchains for educational administration as according to the proposal can support authentication of identities, certificates, and records. \nHowever, while the assessor agrees that the idea proposed is good, the proposal could be much improved by emphasizing the greater benefit of supporting educational administration by blockchain. The assessor recognizes that particularly in developing countries, there is a need for a verifiable unified educational database due to difficulties in record keeping and to prevent fraud or misrepresentation of data. Mentioning the problems created by the the currently fragmented performance data could strengthen the argument towards the need for a Cardano supported identity and performance tracking Dapp. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers have divided the timeline into three phases beginning with the lobbying process to the Ministry of Education (3 months), the Dapp development (3 months) and then proceeding to the deployment and marketing of the Dapp (6 months). While the timeline as it is might be doable, delaying the development of the Dapp to the end of the lobbying process may result in a lost opportunity as the lobbying process might be helped by the presence of a working or at least an initial version of the Dapp. It is thus better to conduct the lobbying process at least parallel to the development process. This will also be a more effective use of time since development will begin early and the feedback from the lobbying process may improve the Dapp. \nThe details of what is conducted in each phase and how it is conducted can be improved, especially for phase 1 and phase 3. At the proposal\u2019s current condition, important questions remain :\n-\tWho will the team meet at the Ministry? Will he or she have the authority to decide or will the proposal be brought to a higher level? If it does need to be brought to higher authority, will three months be sufficient obtain a favorable decision?\n-\tWhat will ground team training consist of? Who will be the stakeholders the teams will meet to disseminate awareness of the program?\n-\tWhich provinces will be prioritized early on? Is there a specific reason why?\nThe answers to these questions will also justify the size and division of the budget. The current breakdown of the budget is still very vague. Funds are divided into the three phases, but it is unclear what those funds be used for in each phase. A more detailed action plan can help clarify this. \nThe proposers should realize that it is very likely that government institutions may meet the proposal with skepticism. Thus, the possibility of rejection or non-committal reception is likely. The proposers should prepare an alternative approach in anticipation of this. For example, the team may plan to then directly approach schools that can independently decide to buy in to the proposed Dapp, such as private schools. \nIn regards to the team members present, while the assessor can deduce who will be responsible for each specific phase, the division of labor is not clearly stated in the proposal. The proposers should also describe previous projects and experiences of team members relevant to the proposal in addition to credentials presented in their LinkedIn profiles. Doing as such will reinforce the proposal and strengthen the reasoning of the feasibility of the plan. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposers specify the total number of schools and colleges onboard as a KPI for progress. However, it is not mentioned what can be categorized as \u201conboard\u201d. Does it mean that performance records for all students and teachers are present in those institutions the dapp? Or is a partial population per school considered acceptable?\nWhile indeed the proposal also mentions the number of active users on the dapp as a metric, it is also unclear what constitutes an active user. Are active users the number of individuals whose performance data is present and continually recorded? \nThe last metric is also unclear as the measurement of \u201cDapp performance metrics\u201d is also vague. What kind of performance metric will be considered? \nThe timeline for the project proposed is 12 months. Meanwhile, their marketing and deployment phase is half that. With this in mind, the proposers have also not mentioned the how they wish to measure their KPIs and at what frequency as the timeline for deployment is short. \nThe proposers envision success as the implementation of the solution at 15% of educational institutions in Sri Lanka in the first year. Will the first year include the lobbying and development phase? Or will the first year mean the first year since deployment and implementation? The proposers should clarify definitions and milestones set.    \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1662", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 5, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1283, "q0": "Registries of credentials is a major focus of this challenge.

It is reasonable to provide the context in the proposal, and it is illustrated understandable. But it can be more generalized as the description now goes into many details. It may distract the readers from the main idea of this part. The information is cited from another source with the link making it more reliable. There are not many proposals that can add such a good point. Moreover, the plans are deployed so clearly and organized such as in the proposed plans and demographics, in case you add more explanation in proposed activities, it could be beneficial.

The thesis presented to take the reader to the proposal's main point is quite detailed and thorough. The proposer, on the other hand, claims that they must lobby the Education Ministry and propose the concept. This is frequently challenging and necessitates a well-thought-out strategy in order to be accepted. Because the proposer did not provide a solution in the proposal, I doubt the problem would be simple to solve. Despite the fact that the proposal recognizes this issue and includes it in the main challenge, as well as the uncertainty of blockchain and crypto regulation, they have not provided a convincing answer for it. I believe that a lack of certainty in the regulation of blockchain and crypto will result in the security of digital identities not being fully guaranteed. As a result, I propose that the proposal find a solution to the blockchain problem, and then submit an error-free proposal to the Education ministry.

However, the proposer could go into further detail about what the executives will perform for each phase or for the entire project. Having a general idea of how many employees will work as planned can also help in better asseting the project.

And what is the proposer's expectation for the number of active users after six months or every 3 months? These details are critical for the community to track progress, and they must be presented in a clear and concise manner.
