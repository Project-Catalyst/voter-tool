They aim to build a strong community with fundamental elements, as presented in the proposal. This DAO-coordinated community will have considerable impacts on the entrepreneurs who are struggling to run successful projects and approach the non-DLT communities. The team also mentions the expected outcomes of the project, which are to address the current problem and ultimately accelerate the growth of the Cardano community. \nGood risk management has been proposed by the team including the prediction of the main challenges and suitable mitigation orientations. The community can see their proactivity when it comes to risk mitigation strategies. This will help them minimize the probability of failure in the future and achieve the key objectives of the project.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Main activities  in the action plan are pointed out very clearly, including (detailing the concept, coding, and community development). Each main activity is followed by carefully planned subtasks. It would be preferred if they could provide specific dates or clear milestones for the action plan. This will help the community mark their occurrence over the timeline and detect any potential delay. The budget breakdown is detailed enough to be tracked and assessed the effectiveness. The community can see that all the costs are allocated based on their action plan, thus reinforcing the transparency of their financial strategy.\nThe team is strongly built by highly qualified members. The proposal has covered their backgrounds excellent working experience with their sample work provided. This could be a good team with a high capacity to complete the project, and the community can take that into account for the assessment.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They have presented their impressive achievements to prove the potential of the project. However, they need to propose some key metrics to measure the progress and the development of the project after being funded. They also have to make sure these metrics are well aligned with the objectives of the challenge. Once these KPIs have been specifically set, the community will be able to monitor and examine how effectively the project is executed. The success of the project is well visualized through the clear goals they have made.

The solution proposed by the proposal group is to establish a community to identify, empower & support (social) entrepreneurs for successful implementation of projects. Personally, I see this as a potential development project for the community and I strongly support this idea.\nProposers have presented very clearly the elements of a community that the project will establish. The potential audience is also well defined. Moreover, the proposal has also shown the impact of the project on these audiences. Technically, the proposal also meets the needs of an in-depth explanation of the technological aspects as well as how the project works.\nThe project has set KPIs that match the key metrics of the challenge. The project aims to contribute significantly to social transformation. KPIs are presented clearly to each section, each stage. The community is created taking advantage of the cooperation from the networks to promote the source of profit. This greatly affects the development of the Cardano ecosystem.\nThe proposal team predicts 3 challenges that will be encountered in the process of community establishment. It includes Coding Accomplishment Quest, Reaching and Linking Technological Classes, and Community Engagement. These challenges not only carry risks but also potentially benefits. By providing a way to prevent and reduce risks, the project will have the potential to inherit great benefits.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Objectives have been clearly stated by the proposers. The plans will be implemented within 6 months. However, to be more specific, the team should have a clear roadmap instead of just stating the results the project is aiming for. Break your goals down into small chunks and set deadlines for accomplishing those short-term goals. A realistic timeline will be essential when evaluating the team's project execution plan. Technological aspects should also be detailed.\nThe project's budget plan outlined in the proposal is still quite basic. Proposers should clearly identify the positions and the number of people needed to carry out the proposed project, from which to make additional spending plans for personnel. Other investment categories should also be more specific. The spending plan will be presented by breaking down the budget and represented by bullet points. That will help viewers easily assess the appropriateness of the project's budget plan.\nThe project management team consists of members from different fields. They are all experts in those fields. With their knowledge and skills, along with their rich experience in doing many previous projects, they promise to develop the community according to the plan and bring growth to the Cardano community.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I think that in order to convince the cardano community more, the proposal should show clear quantifiable numbers for the outcome of the project. For example, after six months of project implementation, how many users does the community aim to attract? How is the amount of traffic and interaction in the community? Please visualize specific numbers and add to the proposal. This makes it easier for the community to track project progress.\nProposal has clearly stated the image of the project when successfully implemented. The definition of project success is also very clear. It can be seen that the team has seriously pursued the set goal.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1709", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 3, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you for the comprehensive evaluation of our proposal.

To develop faster, it is essential to design a community to multiply successful projects and responses to big obstacles, as well as to form connections amongst entrepreneurs. The proposer explains how token-based organizations will be coordinated with and therefore form DAO, and how they will benefit the project. The proposer expresses some substance for the project's result that is completely aligned with the challenge: accelerate the expansion of the Cardano community, as evidenced by the figures provided by the proposer. The proposer outlined some of the most significant risks that the project would face and provided suitable solution for each. But all three solutions have one thing in common: they all rely on the Cardano community in some way. I have no doubt that this project will succeed if the proposer prepares ahead of time and provides a stronger solution. It might be form a strong community they need first.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "According to the roadmap, four major steps will be implemented in order. The required time is six months, but no timeline is provided. For example, what does the proposer think of the deadline for the first step of the project, which is to detail the concept? How do you estimate the time it will take to complete the work in the plan? The same may be said for other steps. It is critical to provide a timeline so that the community can keep track of the project's progress, it is also helps mangae work in time. The budget breakdown for 4 steps\u00a0is mentioned. However, more details regarding how the budget will be allocated to tasks in each step can be provided by the proposer. So that I can figure out if the budget amount is reasonable. The information regarding team members, on the other hand, is extremely extensive. With each member's experience, it is a perfect fit for this project. The team has even set up a global website for blockchain technologies. So with the available resources and blockchain knowledge, this project will be supported to success.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "After six months, the proposer determines the achievement, but it cannot be used to audit the proposal's development or success. I recommend that the proposer think about how the measurements can be guaranteed to fulfill that goal. Because, as I stated in Impact, the risk solution is insufficient to demonstrate efficacy. For example, if the proposer states that the coding role(s) in the team has not yet been filled by coders, they can add the solution to the timetable and estimate when the risk will be handled. This type of data will assist the community in assessing the project's progress and development. In addition, I recommend that the proposer write the measurement procedure every two months.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1934", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you for the comprehensive evaluation of our proposal.
