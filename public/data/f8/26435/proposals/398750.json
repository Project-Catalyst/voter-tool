It is about selling works produced by indigenous peoples, both in physical format and NFT, so that financial funds are raised that would be used to buy land and return it to these indigenous communities, so that they can regain control over areas they lost over the years. of the historical process (in this case, in the United States) and have full autonomy to administer them. This fits perfectly with the objectives of the challenge, because here we are looking to fund projects and Dapps that serve both to help marginalized communities in developing countries, whether in economic, health, education, etc.; and also benefiting the Cardano ecosystem, through the popularization of the blockchain, the creation of new Dapps, the minting of CNFTs, the purchase and delegation of Ada, the creation of digital wallets and etc. I think this proposal works very well on these two points. In this case, we would be helping a marginalized community in an already developed country, but that does not mean that it does not need support, since we know how the indigenous portion of the population often suffers from social exclusion and lack of resources. I found it very positive that the author of the proposal made available two articles that serve as an argument about the need to solve the problem that was raised. In my view, this should always be done, as it brings a lot of credibility to the proposal. And regarding the Cardano ecosystem, our blockchain would certainly benefit greatly from this project as well. Starting with the fact that NFTs would be created and traded on our blockchain, which would help new people get to know Cardano - maybe those interested in buying these works haven't heard about our blockchain yet, for example. Second, because this, if successful, would make our ecosystem reach one of the fundamental pillars of its mission, which is to help make the world a better, more democratic place, giving a \u201cvoice\u201d to a portion of the population that sees itself marginalized. for a long time, not only in the United States but around the world. This would make Cardano not only an economic project but also a humanitarian one, which could even attract the attention of philanthropists who want to invest in social projects, but don't know exactly where. Therefore, I think the idea is theoretically perfect, just a few things that could have been reported so that we could understand even more about it: which indigenous peoples does the proponent intend to establish contact with, where in the United States would these lands be that he intends to be able to buy and at what approximate price. Other than that, I think the impact of the proposal has the potential to be maximum. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Unfortunately, the feasibility of the project is very low, because we have very little information about what we would need to know to understand the process, the budget and the team well. Upon reading the impact, I thought that the proponent already had a structured plan on how to make their idea a reality, however, everything is still in a very early stage, of research. Starting with the fact that he didn't elaborate a roadmap, as I said, the proponent says that the project is in an embryonic phase, that during this phase the objective would be to build an action schedule for the next 6 - 12 months of the project. This should have already been made available by the time the proposal was launched on Catalyst, it is not feasible for the community to fund an idea that is not yet structured with 25 thousand dollars. We would need to know what would happen each month, what activities (in detail) would be done, by whom, by what deadlines and with what specific goals. We would need to know what would happen during the development process of this proposal, what would be the work routine of the professionals involved, how would the contact with these indigenous communities be, what would be the themes of the works created, how long approximately the first NFTs would be launched, how they would be disclosed so that potential buyers could get to know them, what estimated value... Anyway, we don't have any visualization of the process. Regarding the budget, the proponent does not make a division of how the requested 25 thousand dollars would be used, from what I understood everything would be used as an investment, both in the matter of waiting for Ada to appreciate and delegating this amount to some community pool, for rewards to be obtained. This money would be used to buy the first lands in the future, mint the first NFTs, pay the indigenous artists and so on. At least, that was my understanding. Once again, it is not feasible for IOHK to provide such a high amount just for investments, it would be necessary for this money to be broken down into parts that would make the project come true. For example 5k for the developers team, 2k for marketing and etc... And finally, speaking of the team, there is not one either, only the proponent, we know he would be the leader of this project, but we don't have enough information about him . In terms of relevant experience, we are informed that he is a systems analyst, he has an MBA and MPA, we know his linkedin and where we can get to know more directly the work he has developed previously. However, we don't know how this person relates to the Cardano ecosystem, if he already has some experience with our blockchain and which one, and with that we don't know if he is qualified to successfully execute this project. We would also need him to have already formed a team, which was properly presented with names, roles in the project, a professional resume and their linkedin profiles. So I think the feasibility here is not adequate, this part of the project needs a complete overhaul. \n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Because we don't have a roadmap, we don't know exactly what to expect from the development process for this project. We know the metrics (\u201cfunds raised, communities served, artist agreements, things like acquired area\u201d), but not what the work process would be for them to be conquered. What would happen in month 1, who would be working on what, so that X smaller goal would be achieved in what timeframe? Unfortunately, I can't see how we would monitor something that is as uncertain as the daily work of this project. Therefore, my suggestions are that at first this roadmap is built in detail, and after that the proponent and his future team make an overview of how the activities took place each month, not only of the partial results obtained, but also of how were their working hours, if everything went as planned, if any problems were faced, etc. And finally, about the final results, what the author points out is in fact the main goal: to buy land and return it to the indigenous communities. However, other parallel successes would be: the popularization of Cardano through the sale of CNFTs, new investors turning their eyes to our blockchain, individuals from the indigenous community who discovered through art a new way to generate income, etc. It would be necessary for the author and his team to raise all these issues and prepare a final report. In the specific case of this proposal, it is essential that we have both a written document that can prove sales of CNFT and purchase/donation of lands for indigenous peoples; and a synchronous video meeting with members of the Cardano community, in order to explain how the whole process took place, how the communities are after the project, if they were benefited in the way that was expected, which and how many lands were returned to them, where are located... It would be great if some of the changes felt by indigenous communities could be recorded on video, of course, if they allowed it and felt comfortable with it. This could generate interesting material even to be disseminated in traditional media (which could be related to the Audiovisual challenge of this fund), in order to create a certain marketing content for Cardano. Therefore, I regard the auditability suggested by the proponent as incomplete, requiring further investigation. \n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 8, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Land registration is a major area that Cardano can help improve around the world. There is a lot of inequity in how records are kept now and blockchain promises to help a lot. This proposal addresses land registration, for sure. \n\nMost of the projects I'm familiar with attempt to create a durable record deeds. This project does that, but it also gets into land acquisition, which goes beyond this challenge. \n\nThis project also goes into art and NFTs. The impression is that the scope of this project is too big to fit in this challenge. \n\nCertainly, several Native American groups are nations, this does not really fit wholly under this challenge. The author argues that this project can start in the US and be replicated around the world. This project starts with the fundraising and land aquisition, which is a more unique situation.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "This is a very big plan starting with nothing. There do not seem to be any partners or connections to get started. There is no mention of existing partnerships. Every step to the plan is ambitious. \n\nThe author suggests that \"The goal would be to develop the model, including more nuanced timelines and priorities, over the course of the next 6 - 12 months.\" And not take any salary or payment, they would put this money in a fund for future use. \n\nThis seems to underestimate the amount of work that needs to be done. The scope and breadth seems bigger than the resources requested would cover.   ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There are no milestones or measurable metrics. The goals are highly aspirational and can only be met after this, and several more challenges. \n\nThe author has great goals and motivations. But by their own statements the goals can not be met this challenge. Milestones like connections or partnerships, or visits to properties are not enumerated.

By first using indigenous artists to use their minted NFT art as fundraising, which then feeds into purchasing, tracking, and ensuring ownership of indigenous land parcels via NFT, it doesn\u2019t just help them out of poverty, but returns their resources/assets to them and helps their infrastructure. \n\nIt stands to reason that as Native American communities see their land repatriated back to them that many of this Challenge\u2019s key metrics of increasing participation in Cardano or dApp usage should increase. As Hernando de Soto explained in the video about people living outside the legal system, this project providing land back to its original owners and inhabitants, while also boosting the economy of artists, is a great way to help everyone. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Because this project is early on still \u2013 largely research and information-gathering phase \u2013 it is difficult to evaluate how feasible it is beyond trusting the single proposer\u2019s credentials.

Outside of seeing breakdowns of artist agreements and acreage acquired, which are farther towards the end-goal of the project, it is difficult for me to imagine how to track the progress of this proposal until its end stages. Much of the provided details feel questionable still. \n\nIf a revision were possible, I would hope that this project would be farther along already, and have more clear-cut metrics to track such as numbers of NFT art projects minted, numbers sold (preliminary/prerequisite to the mentioned \u201cFunds Raised\u201d), partnerships established and geographic locations partnered with easily visible, planned land transfer and acquisition sites and projects, and then finally as mentioned the acreage acquired. More of an itemized, step-by-step list to follow, than just a few concepts along the way. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1446", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "As far as I can understand, the author of this proposal is trying to utilize the NFTs created by indigenous artists in order to raise funds for a mission, which is to acquire land and its stewardship back to the indigenous communities. In terms of showing the potential of the stated approach, two links leading to articles are listed in the proposal, providing some valid sources of information to help build a more solid belief among stakeholders. Overall, although the proposal is well-written, logically organized, easy to understand and closely aligns with the main value of the challenge, which is to provide people with digital identities and help them escape poverty, there are still a few parts that require further improvements. Firstly, the part where the author says that \u201cthe ownership of the land parcel would be tracked via the NFT on the blockchain\u201d really does confuse me, because, with my humble knowledge, I really do not understand how NFTs, which are digital artworks, can be used as a tool to check a property\u2019s owner, and I believe that many people out there do not know it too. As a result, this part here needs some brief explanation from the author to be clarified. And secondly, the challenge requires the proposal to contain foreseen risks or challenges, however, I really do not see them in this one since instead of mentioning what kind of challenge/risk the team may have to overcome in the future, the author writes about key factors that need to be considered along the process. Although they are both vital to the success of the project, I would ask if the author can focus more on the challenge's exact requirements.

There are only phases that are too general, not detailed enough with no timeline included so it will be almost impossible to assess the project\u2019s progress and development. The budget breakdown is another disappointment since although the requested fund provided at the beginning of the proposal is 25000 USD, there is absolutely nothing in this part thoroughly explaining how that amount of money will be used. There is no financial plan, no money allocation, no KPIs, estimations and the author also does not make it clear under what circumstances will he invest his own money in order to grow price and staking rewards like what he mentions in the proposal. Besides, this team right now has only the author as member, and he, however, does not provide any sufficient information about the specific positions that are important for the project implementation, along with abilities and skills needed for those positions.
