The budget is distributed fairly, I might even venture to say low considering the 9-12 month timeline for Dapp launch with only $3000 USD budgeted for the management team.  The only reason why I agree vs agree strongly on this proposal in fact is because I think the budget may be a bit too conservative/modest, and I hope the proposal team will consider a follow-up, or alternative bridge financing to keep the project moving foward if in case they experience some traction but start running short on cash to deliver a final product to address their market.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team has embraced the proper tools (github) for openness and transparency, and are planning to engage other community building tools to funnel conversation into an open and transparent resource for tracking progress and responding to feedback form their relevant market.

The challenge of \u201cdifficulty in finding accommodation/apartments/flats for rent in Ghana\u201d highlights the 2.4 million housing deficit in the country and the estimated number of people (1400) house hunting daily. This concretizes the problem, not reducing it to mere speculations or possibly personal accounts or experience of  a small minority. The problem statement also makes mention of the risks that house hunting in Ghana poses to people; long travel dangers, liable to imposters and fraudulent activities and high agent fees.  The Cardano Dapp for rent proposes to utilise Cardano smart contract and a platform for user registry, verification and authentication process, and payments using the Cardano ADA. According to the proposer, the Cardano Dapp for rent is a platform designed to provide an enlisting of available homes to prospective renters/buyers, providing quality experiences and cost reductions. However, the Dapp for rent desire to gain user trust using educational advertising,  transparency and success stories is very unrealistic because it fails to mention how to address individual user experiences when using the app and other methods of conversion to retain users and drive company success.

Aside from team strength, the members of the project are open to collaborations and onboarding with SMEs to scale the business. In the proposal, the stated mission of the team is to provide a registry for homeowners and landlords, however securing funds from Cardano for first quarter research to strategize and mitigate identified challenges would drastically affect the success of the implementation process.

The incorporation of Cardano DApp Rent into the process ensures that buyers, vendors, and renters will transact directly with each other to prevent fraud or intermediary costs. To reduce misunderstanding at the initial usage, Proposer additionally offers tutorials for users. Despite the fact that one difficulty was stated, and I am satisfied with how they handled it, I would want to add a few additional challenges that may arise in the future. For example, how do they prevent fake real estate owners from profiting from the program, or how do they ensure that consumers' personal information is not disclosed to other parties? Also, if they can add some positive influence on Cardano, the proposal will be more perfect. For example, not only does this expand Cardano's market to Ghana, but it also quickly transforms Cardano into a community with a greatly increased degree of trust. If they can address these issues, the project's future functioning will be more convenient, in my opinion.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As far as I can see, the proposer has done a good job of preparing for this idea.

People in the working team have also worked for many years in the research, programming, or commercial industries. However, I would want to make a minor suggestion.

I think it's a good idea to use a DApp to create an authentic registry for property owners to enable easy search and rent in Ghana. Because Finding a room is really a difficult and time-consuming process for newcomers to the city. Not only is it difficult to find, but choosing a good, safe and affordable hostel also makes many people a headache. However, with the growing technology of today, I think that it is completely easy to handle such situations with DApp. I strongly agree that creating a DApp eliminates scammers, middlemen (3rd parties) charging exorbitant fees that make rent in Ghana more expensive. This proposal to build a DApp is really useful in the Cardano ecosystem, especially this project also uses smart contracts, which is also one of the projects in the ecosystem.

Besides, it is necessary to explain more clearly and specifically the working mechanism of smart contracts. As well as security mechanisms, anti-fraud. The group has taken precautions against online fraud when 2 real estate agents were arrested for fraud in Tonaton and has an illustrative link. I see a lot of potential and value behind this project.
