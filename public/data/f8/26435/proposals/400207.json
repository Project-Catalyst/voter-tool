Adiuvat talks about registering businesses, that is to say that they will be in charge of promoting registrations of establishments in their system, which they promote as bubbles on the map. I think of this as if I open the Application and there are bubbles of businesses or establishments that are open and accept my TIPS token, when I open each bubble I can see the content that the trade creates or the experiences that have been made, which seem to be cheap at be based on human principles...\nAdiuvat raises the current systemic problems such as debt, inflation and scarcity to determine that the lower-middle class has little purchasing power and therefore when they leave, they spend their resources on activities that are the first step of the Maslow pyramid (psychological source) ... With this, they seek that each business registered in the Dapp encourages the user to use ADIUVAT so that the service or experience is more economical and complete (that is to say that in addition to eating, at the same time I can participate in an activity where I can interact and earn at a similar cost), they speak of each social category so that each company administrator can create their Partner profile (have their bubble).\nFor the added value: The experience, ADIUVAT allows each registered user to apply as a Talent and to communicate with an establishment to create content/experience in the service. Products are not created but it is a service that connects peers, so it is a worked system and it is not an idea out of nowhere because it feeds back into itself, that is, the work is actually outlined: Enroll businesses to their terms and conditions and developing the Dapp and tips. But what I love the most is that your TIPS token will be accepted on every trade and exchange so Cardano network usage will explode. ADIUVAT is a brand in itself that could make me enter with my native cardano token to every bubble in every part of the world, so I am a decentralized user!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Adiuvat presents not only his idea but also the website, the prototype of his Dapp, visuals, his YouTube channel and all the networks that we habitually use, they know that the budget is initial and that they will then have to risk it according to the value generated. of his company, his metrics are realistic and focus on two specific situations: The legalization of his token to operate in exchanges and register businesses to the waiting list that will position them.

The prototype of the Dapp through the youtube video is easy to elaborate (I am a Software engineer) and the tips under cardano can actually be the global payment method, I like its generic name. They promised not to deliver everything but what is necessary to get the project off the ground. I searched for the aforementioned JIRA tool and it is a management tool that can help the CEO to see everything from a big picture, and that is not all, cardano can to be there.

The community can also detect any delay that may happen and at the same time foster adjustments if needed. \nTheir budget is split into some main sections as follows: asset rotation (2 systems engineers and 2 layers), external operators cost, service employees (20 people), and the cost for increasing the waiting list.

By spending native tokens. a service decide what suitable for us to do can help save time in this fast life. But in order to establish a relationship/registration by each social business around the world, Adiuvat intends to position itself on the Web in a forceful way. So Audiuvat is not a real product and by utilizing other platforms, Adiuvat will spread faster around the world. However, there are risks that have a negative impact on Adiuvat, such as Crypto Restrictions, and the proposer will provide a management\u00a0plan to address these. It would be fantastic if the proposer could incorporate this management plan into the roadmap. According to the proposer, businesses must hold 9 events every month, accept crypto currency, and be trained to produce Dapps. I am curious whether there is too many conditions for those searching for a casual outing and business to register to Adiuvat or not, and what the strategy is to attract users to this platform. I think the proposer is overly focused on external sales forces, and the rewards users receive are not proportional to the effort expended because Adiuvat is still in its early stages and lacks resources.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The roadmap is extremely detailed in terms of the timeline but not in terms of the plan.

This plan must show how the task will be completed within the specified time frame. The budget breakdown, on the other hand, seems reasonable. It is meticulously measured and divided into three major categories. The budget breakdown would be easier to follow if the proposer synthesized and summarized all costs into bullet points. And I note that the team members are fairly young and have little expertise in the field, but they are described as being highly enthusiastic about this project.

It\u2019s an ambitious project ideated by a team of three young people that want to create a service with the scale of Ubber or Netflix. The proposed dApp is planned to have plenty of features such as a way to find commerce globally, see other people in those places, interact with them, join scheduled activities, payment systems, and much more. They planned to mint 1 billion tokens and launch an IPO. It is clear that the spirit fits with the goals of the Challenge however there are some aspects that the challenge have specifically stipulated that are not met. First of all, the team has a great idea but they have no proven experience. Minimum challenge requirement is a small team with relevant background, and for that case the project should be considered as a research with a budget capped at USD10000. That\u2019s my main reason for giving a low score in this section. I strongly recommend to this passionate team to keep developing the idea and convert it into a feasible plan. That initial step could be the development of a whitepaper detailing how the tokenomics will work. Also I recommend scoping the project in small phases, where activities can be planned with more details.

That does not mean that the idea is not feasible, I\u2019m just mentioning that the project needs to be developed with more details to make us feel confident that it can be executed successfully. I\u2019m pointing some of these missing pieces as references for the proposers to improve. First of all, a project of that size needs to be backed up with some expertise or previous experience; one suggestion is to team with others. Secondly, big projects are hard to tackle, it would be more appropriate to go in little steps with the full project goal at the end. A final suggestion is to develop a detailed project plan, with a list of concrete tasks that need to be achieved, estimating duration and costs. Putting all the details is not an easy task, you may find it useful looking for guidance and mentoring in the community.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The project has a roadmap with some big outcomes, but gives no detail of what are the deliverables as a result of the requested budget.

As described before, I consider that this proposal is a great idea that needs to be developed further. A recommendation to the team is to explore all the missing parts, find help and split the project into small pieces.

The comments that there is no need for a token under this system proves that the tester does not take into account the context of decentralization that the Cardano community yearns for.\n\nOur solution includes an explanation of competitive advantages such as having physical establishments in the cardano network, promoting content and p2p interaction of people through Realization and fulfillment experiences, being decentralized and highly interactive in the real world. It is an App delivery!\n\nAs Founders: We bring our personal experience and work history to the project by presenting a brand that has a management, commercial and globally scalable system, demonstrating that at the time of founding the model, only work on the general objectives described in the proposal should be worked on. The objectives are rooted: Have the token and the necessary legal documents (2 developers and 2 lawyers with their respective technology and necessary documentation such as the presentation of trademark, chamber and commerce documents, financial superintendence of Colombia and national registry of issuers) to carry out an IPO (Initial Public Offering on exchanges such as Binance or coinbase), a database (registered by our 10 external sales force operators) with businesses waiting to be bubbles on the map and an elaborate game plan by our operational team (20 people) who are waiting to have an organization founded by Catalyst elevator..

First of all. Our solution works because it adheres to the global reality of growing Apps deliveries due to the covid 19 pandemic, purchasing power has been reduced: This means that when they leave, they concentrate their activities on the first step of the Maslow pyramid, which is food, shelter and sex. Maslow's pyramid is a psychological instrument that measures human needs, for this reason, Maslow's pyramid shows us how people choose priorities. And the data from the sources shows how they are chained to the first step. (sources cited and displayed)\n\nThe market that we have identified has not been previously accessed or prioritized by the Cardano community and can be a real catalyst for network use since the token will benefit merchants by eliminating intermediary costs.\n\nOur roadmap towards user and platform acquisition is clear and well thought out.\nOur monopoly is that the businesses on the waiting list (of which we expect 6,000 after 3 months of operation) of 10 people who sign up at least 4 a day, in a work shift of 8 hours a day, which will be incentivized with the minimum payment + boificacion for registration in our country) must comply with terms and conditions (described in the proposal) in which the establishment must hold a minimum of 9 events per month, They must accept the token as a means of payment, encourage people to use ADIUVAT to access and be open to talk with any talent that wants to apply to develop an activity on your site.\nIt is understood that you can start working immediately once the funds are received because we make it clear that our management system is separated by departments which are described and can be classified in the JIRA audit tool. This is where our 3-month resolution to have a legal token to help us finance ourselves to finish the Dapp, hire ZenDesk for customer support, etc. comes into play. with a waiting list that allows us to sustain the value generated. in addition to the game plan that will help us train establishments as proactive creators of experiences and content in their establishments and the Dapp.\n\nKPIs:\nAcquired users we will go looking for them for three months of work of which 6000 are specifically expected (described in the proposal\nProduct capacity built is defined as the established brand, the legal documents to make an OPA (Described), waiting list of merchants (described) and internal operation of the service (also described)\nREFERENCE POINT OF PERFORMANCE ACHIEVED measurable in the JIRA work tool which has defined the specific and general objectives for three months of work\nNetwork stability achieved in 3 months of measurable work on the TIPS Token, DAPP prototype and website.\n\nDefinition of Success identified.\nAbout cannabis, we only emphasize that there will be bubbles (establishments) that tolerate this type of product that is being legalized everywhere globally.
