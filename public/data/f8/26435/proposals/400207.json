Adiuvat talks about registering businesses, that is to say that they will be in charge of promoting registrations of establishments in their system, which they promote as bubbles on the map. I think of this as if I open the Application and there are bubbles of businesses or establishments that are open and accept my TIPS token, when I open each bubble I can see the content that the trade creates or the experiences that have been made, which seem to be cheap at be based on human principles...\nAdiuvat raises the current systemic problems such as debt, inflation and scarcity to determine that the lower-middle class has little purchasing power and therefore when they leave, they spend their resources on activities that are the first step of the Maslow pyramid (psychological source) ... With this, they seek that each business registered in the Dapp encourages the user to use ADIUVAT so that the service or experience is more economical and complete (that is to say that in addition to eating, at the same time I can participate in an activity where I can interact and earn at a similar cost), they speak of each social category so that each company administrator can create their Partner profile (have their bubble).\nFor the added value: The experience, ADIUVAT allows each registered user to apply as a Talent and to communicate with an establishment to create content/experience in the service. Products are not created but it is a service that connects peers, so it is a worked system and it is not an idea out of nowhere because it feeds back into itself, that is, the work is actually outlined: Enroll businesses to their terms and conditions and developing the Dapp and tips. But what I love the most is that your TIPS token will be accepted on every trade and exchange so Cardano network usage will explode. ADIUVAT is a brand in itself that could make me enter with my native cardano token to every bubble in every part of the world, so I am a decentralized user!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Adiuvat presents not only his idea but also the website, the prototype of his Dapp, visuals, his YouTube channel and all the networks that we habitually use, they know that the budget is initial and that they will then have to risk it according to the value generated. of his company, his metrics are realistic and focus on two specific situations: The legalization of his token to operate in exchanges and register businesses to the waiting list that will position them. It is a realistic and achievable plan over time, they do not leave the context and they know the KPI metrics to advance step by step, it is clear that the future of ADIUVAT is very clear, these guys have impressed me.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "If it is enough, the data of the team and the scope expected by it is absolutely measurable, that is, if they hire 20 people to register at least 4 businesses a day each, in 3 months their database could be valued at 6000 or more, 4 deals seem like very little to me in 8 business hours but it makes them look conservative so they are committed to impressing. The prototype of the Dapp through the youtube video is easy to elaborate (I am a Software engineer) and the tips under cardano can actually be the global payment method, I like its generic name. They promised not to deliver everything but what is necessary to get the project off the ground. I searched for the aforementioned JIRA tool and it is a management tool that can help the CEO to see everything from a big picture, and that is not all, cardano can to be there. I suppose that to generate the decentralized world we need everyday use cases and I definitely prefer to do it in a simple way like when I order a car with Uber.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1646", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3377, "q0": "The proposers have  effectively got the insight of their targeted customers (people looking for a casual outing), thus offering a very detailed solution.

Using the decentralized technologies in their project, they genuinely increase the number of Dapps users, registry accounts and generate Dapps impact on economic development. Furthermore, they intend to develop a token in the Cardano blockchain to help clients control their assets, making their Adiuvat\u2019s impact far-reaching. \nThey make it very clear about the types of problems and then how they gonna address these problems with their Adiuvat. Several sources of the problem are provided in both form blogs and books, allowing the community to have a broad view of their solution. Their website is also included in the proposal, enabling the community to easily access and review their platform. \nThey have illustrated the main challenges they have to confront during the operation process.

The action plan has been divided into specific milestones coming with the expected deliverables. Based on this plan, the community can evaluate the effectiveness of their implementation process and track the accomplishments of the project. The community can also detect any delay that may happen and at the same time foster adjustments if needed. \nTheir budget is split into some main sections as follows: asset rotation (2 systems engineers and 2 layers), external operators cost, service employees (20 people), and the cost for increasing the waiting list. These spendings are fine-tuned according to their delivery plan, ensuring the transparency of their financial allocations. \nApart from the hired force, the team members are mentioned in the proposal with some basic information and their occupations. However, it would be better if they could provide some relevant working experiences or skills of their members. Instead of some personal social media such as Facebook or Instagram accounts, they can replace by LinkedIn accounts. These contact addresses will help them look more professional and the community can also have more information to evaluate their ability to run this project.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "To measure the progress and the development of the project, they will use a task management tool (JIRA), which can be managed by both Cardano and Adiuvat.

A small suggestion from me is that they can give a brief description of the main features as well as some key metrics of this tool. Reading this description will help the community clearly visualize the tracking strategies and identify the specific statistics to evaluate the development of the project.\nTheir goals for remarkable success have been firmly set in the proposal.

By spending native tokens. a service decide what suitable for us to do can help save time in this fast life. But in order to establish a relationship/registration by each social business around the world, Adiuvat intends to position itself on the Web in a forceful way. So Audiuvat is not a real product and by utilizing other platforms, Adiuvat will spread faster around the world. However, there are risks that have a negative impact on Adiuvat, such as Crypto Restrictions, and the proposer will provide a management\u00a0plan to address these. It would be fantastic if the proposer could incorporate this management plan into the roadmap. According to the proposer, businesses must hold 9 events every month, accept crypto currency, and be trained to produce Dapps. I am curious whether there is too many conditions for those searching for a casual outing and business to register to Adiuvat or not, and what the strategy is to attract users to this platform. I think the proposer is overly focused on external sales forces, and the rewards users receive are not proportional to the effort expended because Adiuvat is still in its early stages and lacks resources.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The roadmap is extremely detailed in terms of the timeline but not in terms of the plan. I expect the proposer to provide more information on what work needs to be done in order to achieve those goals. For example, what kind of employees or members do they expect in June 2022, and how do they plan to complete the website, have the token available, and implement the process of making contact with neuroclinicians, psychologists, and sociologists? This plan must show how the task will be completed within the specified time frame. The budget breakdown, on the other hand, seems reasonable. It is meticulously measured and divided into three major categories. The budget breakdown would be easier to follow if the proposer synthesized and summarized all costs into bullet points. And I note that the team members are fairly young and have little expertise in the field, but they are described as being highly enthusiastic about this project. They shown considerable competence and ambition in developing this plan, and they did a good job in terms of budget breakdown as well as identification of future risks.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Though I admire you for having a long-term vision with annual plans, there is a lack of information regarding the auditability components of this proposal.
