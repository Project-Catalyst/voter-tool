The proponent wants to create a series of DAOs that aim, in addition to promoting their activities and making a profit to their participants, to share part of the profits, generating a greater sense of equality and charity, as I understand it. He wants people to understand and practice the concept that the crypto world goes far beyond the desire to get rich, it is a humanitarian mission that aims to change the way the world works today. This, in theory, is perfect, it fits with the objectives of the challenge, which are basically to fund projects that can act as mentors for the populations of the developing nation, helping them on several fronts: health, education, employment, etc. In theory, the present project varies this, because it aims to create groups that would help each other and the people around them, giving financial assistance through profit sharing. This would also be good for the Cardano ecosystem, because, although this is not so explicit and well explained, DAOs are organizations that carry out their financial transactions on the blockchain, so it can be inferred that these groups would use Cardano ecosystem technologies to work, helping to popularize and expand our blockchain, benefiting it if it once again aligns with what the challenge calls for. Although everything is, in theory, very good, I think that this proposal has a big problem, which is precisely the lack of detail on how this would all happen. The goal is immense, extremely ambitious, so much so that the proponent says he intends for the first DAO to have at least 1 million participants (that's a lot of people, even if he helps boost that number through his company, we don't know how many people do part of it and what fraction of that total number would be incremented). We don't know how many DAOs he wants to create, how he will attract people to form them, he doesn't explain how he would educate people about blockchain and especially about the Cardano ecosystem. It also doesn't explain the nature of these DAOs, what kind of activities would be carried out in each of them, how they would be profitable, how exactly this profit sharing would happen - that is, how many % of the money and how this would be distributed (the donation money would be shared equally among the partner DAOs, a part would go to the population of the countries where these DAOs operate, how would that be?). We also don't know in which exact geographic location these DAOs would act, anyway, I think a lot was promised, at a very high cost of 200k dollars, and it wasn't detailed how this mega project would be put into practice. No, my opinion is not very valid that the theory of the proposal fits the objectives of the challenge if in practice this is so uncertain, if the day-to-day view of the project is not clear. Therefore, I suggest that the proponent reject the detail and amount of money requested in their project, so that it becomes more viable for our community to fund. \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is not very good in my opinion and I will explain why. Of the 3 parts, only 1, the script, is well explained, still not ideal. The script is divided into phases, numbered by letters (phase A, B, and so on). In each phase, the proponent explains what activities would be developed, what would need to be completed so that the phase is considered complete and people can move on to the next. It's not detailed how long each phase would last (he only talks about it in phases A and B, which are expected to last 6 months each). It is not described how long each task would take approximately, in this way, our script is very abstract: we know what should happen according to the phases, but there is not enough accuracy to understand, for example, how long each thing would take, so there is no solid understanding and visualization of the process. Some activities of these phases should be better detailed, in order to have a deeper understanding. For example, in phase A, activity 3: \u201cin order for the majority of members to agree on decisions, a consensus mechanism is necessary\u201d. What kind of consensus mechanism? This is very important to understand. This case is repeated with other activities, for example also in phase C activity 2: \u201cemployees will work 40h/s\u201d. How can we already determine at this point the number of hours of work needed if we don't even know what these DAOs would be about, if each type of DAO would have a different need for working hours and that would also vary according to the performance of each professional. I find it a little unfeasible to establish a strict rule for something that is still undefined, we also don't know what the availability of people who are interested in these DAOs would be, for example if I want to participate in one but I can't promise 40 hours a week of work because I have other occupations, will I not be able to participate in the project? Is there no middle ground? I really believe that for a huge project like this it would be more interesting to go little by little, I could suggest that instead of asking for 200k of investment and already defining the phases and their tasks with such specificity, it would be better to ask for much less money and propose first phase, testing and seeing how things would work before we move on. The other two parts are quite insufficient, the money requested is not adequately explained, percentages are assigned to each part, but each part of these is very high and needed a very detailed detail to justify the need for such funding, we would need understand its use, if it would be good and fair and etc. This part a lot to improve. And about the team, I also think it is not adequate because we only have the proponent as the right professional, who does not present himself in a very complete way, I would like to know more about his resume, that is, what is the name of this sports company that he is owner? How can we measure your experience and relationship with the technologies relevant to the Cardano ecosystem? It is very risky to finance such an expensive project without a team already defined, complete and well presented. We don't know who the others are and so there's no way we can trust them if they're prepared for the tasks to come. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This part of the project is unfortunately very superficial and inadequate, but again, let's break it down. Starting with monitoring the proposal: how can we understand that it is being developed properly if there are no parameters to be followed, there are no specifications on how to monitor activities, etc.? The author of the proposal claims that he will use \u201cproject management tools to ensure that all deadlines and requirements are met\u201d, but what are these tools? Are they enough to track the progress of all the variables included in this complex project? How could we have access to such information? It would be essential for the proponent to better explain what these tools are and how they would work in practice, he could also cite in examples how the auditability proposed by him would be in the daily life of his project. The way he proposes the monitoring of this project is very abstract, unfortunately. Through the detailing of the phases, it would be possible for a member of the Cardano community to follow the development of the situation, that is, if the promised tasks were actually being done on time, in the right way and by the right people, and if the partial results were being obtained (and what they would be). This information should be taken to the rest of the community, but as it is a project of such breadth and complexity, I think it would be more appropriate if the proponent and its future team prepared reports at least monthly and sent them to the rest of the community, as a way of to prove the good progress of the project. The notions of success are also very abstract, it would be necessary to elaborate clearer objectives, both numerical statistics to be achieved (beyond the 1 million people in this first DAO) and qualitative objectives, such as KPIs, which could assess whether the project would be positive for both the Cardano ecosystem and the people and communities involved in DAOs. \n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2198, "q0": "Most DAOs today are just centralized in the blockchain world in particular. Since this proposal is trying to apply the DAO model's advancement to the real world, it is logical. The idea is basically to build businesses owned and operated by communities, where distributed power and equally shared interests can help everyone become wealthy together. This is likely to be the trend shortly to narrow the gap between rich and poor. As Cardano is trying to revolutionize old-fashioned practices and build a more just world, this proposal would be impactful if successfully implemented. I, therefore, rate this proposal as suitable for the challenges presented.\n\nThe proposer also dedicates his own business as an example, which is appreciated. However, the DAO model also has its limitations. Everyone has different insights, opinions, and motivations. Thus, there are pressing issues where majority vote-based solutions may not be as timely and effective as traditional methods.\n\nBased on what the proposer has communicated, I rate the impact a score of 4.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has not provided evidence to prove his qualifications, experience, and business operation. The need for one digital marketing expert, one cyber security specialist, and three developer teams might make sense during the initial internal testing steps.\n\nThe infrastructure issues in building a DAO are technically possible. Here, the main concerns are a few unanswered questions regarding economics and the operating model. The proponent has not explained how the business will operate with the DAO model and its advantages and disadvantages compared to the currently active methods. The proposal mentions the issue of governance token, so what is the economic incentive for others (if any), except business owners and employees, to hold this token? How will tokenomics work to ensure benefits for all parties? We need a breakthrough and practical model that can be applied widely, not just for a few kind bosses who are willing to share the benefits with their subordinates. Also, what is the purpose of \"each member must contribute daily at least $1 in ADA coins\"?\n\nThe budget is outlined clearly, broken down into identifiable items, and reasonable to achieve the set goals. However, there are some inconsistencies in the timetable; for example, one week to create a forum for community members to present their projects and ideas is rushed. Technical solutions only state the concept, not precisely how to do it. Challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation also need further consideration, especially in legal terms related to a DAO-operated business.\n\nIn short, I give it a 2.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal describes the targeted problem quite well, but technical solutions need to be discussed in more detail.

And I haven't seen the specific community that the author is targeting and how large is it, so I think the author should have added this section to make it easier to visualize the scope of this proposal. So I wonder how the proposer will convince employees from a thriving community enterprise to share their benefits, since sharing one's benefits with others is not something many people would do. Moreover, I think it is necessary to be more detailed in the solutions. the author claims Dapps will give citizens economic rights, I think this part should be clarified. for example, it should be clear how workers will control the economy. The main risks that the author has raised is the formation of a community, how to keep a community from dominating the market, and ultimately decentralizing businesses, but in this part, I think the proposer should suggest some solutions to resolve these risk. to solve those problems. The most important part is establishing the community. the writer estimated that 1 million people participate but there is no specific potential community mentioned.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap  is presented in detail by the author about specific activities to be carried out, divided into several stages.

Are there any required qualifications or experience or other requirements for the position on the project? because if the staff are experts or prominent members in a certain field, it will make the proposal more reliable. Furthermore, if there are not enough employees, the plan will be difficult to implement. In addition, the writer has not presented how to select participants. I think the recruitment of staff and participants is very important, it will affect the progress of the project, so a more specific plan is needed.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project will measure the progress and success of the project by using the tool, and adopting the tool can be beneficial and convenient for a project that requires a lot of tasks, but I think it will it would be better if the author could clearly show the tool how it works and by what criteria it can be measured. and I feel rather vague with the success goal that the writer stated is witnessing staff and community members grow.

Regarding the first segment of the proposed solution's description, the proposer did an excellent job of identifying the themes, communities, and aims he is pursuing, but there is a lack of characteristics and functionalities of the Dapps you described above, which appears to be fairly unclear. Which Dapp feature, for example, may have a good impact on people? Also, I feel the most important aspect is how your solution addresses the problem; only a few lines cannot convey the whole impact of your plan, which has a direct impact on practicality. Concerning the challenges, they are practical, but the proposer might persuade readers more if he or she can attach some specific ideas for dealing with them. Finally, how will your suggestion affect the whole Cardano ecosystem, whether positively or negatively?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The roadmap appears to be well-thought-out and thorough. The steps are clearly listed in the roadmap, and I believe the project can be implemented. However, for some groups of individuals, especially the unbanked, blockchain and Dapps are still a totally new universe, therefore training them with knowledge about decentralized applications and other related technologies might be a stumbling barrier. Furthermore, although it has not yet been implemented, a look at the whole cost, at least an estimate, is required so that readers may assess the viability. However, the proposers proposed several useful techniques for encouraging people to trade using bitcoin (such as price reductions) and for expanding the role of blockchain in other aspects of daily life.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This section's description is far too brief. The claims are too broad to determine if they will be able to complete each step. There is no link between performance and other critical elements such as the KPIs and key metrics described above, raising doubts about their relationship. More significantly, I'm not sure where the quantitative gauge is for tracking progress, such as the number of users and the time it takes to complete each stage. As a result, there are no standards for determining which phase your project is in or how much of the timeframe has been completed. Furthermore, because it is directly tied to people, any possibility might develop to stymie progress, which is uncontrollable, it is vital to devise measures to counteract unforeseen elements.

However, in the marketing campaign section, I would like to see a more detailed budget table for this campaign, for example, what activities the marketing campaign includes, what tools and devices for the campaign, the campaign will run for how long. The identity of the proposer is not verifiable, there is no information, description, or profile of this person here, which will reduce the credibility of the project.
