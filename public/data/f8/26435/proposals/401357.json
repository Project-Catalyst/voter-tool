A great project to me, as it identifies many of the problems that need to be solved in this challenge, it covers almost all of the problems the challenge posed, it can scale quickly and large to many places, they can solve problems that arise in the future, this is a very good project, it brings great development value to the Cardano ecosystem.

Educating people, especially the poor about the usefulness of Blockchain technology in asset management is no small challenge, I agree with the risks and solutions that the author mentioned, however, in my opinion, the author should also mention the risks of inflation and currency devaluation in Mozambique, in addition, I agree with the author on the above issues.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Great when the project provides a clear, logical amount of timetable information for implementation and completion.
