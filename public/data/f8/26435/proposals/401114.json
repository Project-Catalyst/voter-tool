The idea is to promote awareness campaigns in four different communities in a country that was not clear to me, so that people would clean the facades of their homes. This certainly aligns with the objective of benefiting a location (but we don't know if it would be a developing country, as is the objective of the challenge), because with the cleaning of collective urban areas, the quality of life of the community's residents would certainly be positively impacted. . In this sense, probably less parasites such as cockroaches, rats, etc. would appear in the localities, improving public health, and the social sphere would also benefit in the sense that leisure spaces would be better preserved. However, all of Catalyst's challenges are also intended to benefit the Cardano ecosystem, whether through the creation of new digital wallets, an increase in the purchase and delegation of Ada, new CNFTs being minted, bought and sold, new participants in Catalyst (either as proponents, CAs or vCAs), new Dapps being developed, etc. None of this is mentioned here, I really didn't understand how this proposal would benefit the Cardano ecosystem. As much as it is environmentally advantageous, and in this challenge we want to benefit a community in some arbodement, be it in the scope of health, education, environment, etc.; the project would also need to make sense for our blockchain, it would need to help expand and popularize it. Therefore, unfortunately, I will give it a low score, it would be positive if the proponent reformulated the impact of this proposal in order to clarify, after all, what would be Cardano's gains in this context. \n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The information contained in the script part is basically the same as in the impact, and is quite repetitive. Basically in all communities the same would be repeated: \u201cPublic education for one week followed by cleaning on Saturdays for four consecutive times (4 weeks)\u201d. What would this public education look like? Who would teach? What content would be taught? How many people does the proponent expect to participate in these teaching sessions? Where would this happen, in schools, public spaces like squares? How would people in the community be captivated to participate in this movement? And in relation to cleaning the spaces themselves: how many people would work, for how long, in which exact locations (how many facades do they intend to sanitize)? Anyway, the activities are described in a very superficial way, it is not possible to understand with specificity how these movements would happen. It would be necessary for the proponent to answer all these doubts, explaining the minor details and placing them according to the passage of time. We know that activities in each community would last for 4 weeks, but what would happen in the first, second, and so on? The script, in my opinion, should contain a very specific division of time, for example, in the first week there would be an opening meeting of the project, where person X would address Y topics, for a certain amount of viewers, with certain marketing strategies, to call public attention, etc. I really think that part of the script is superficial and leaves something to be desired. Regarding the budget division, I think the money requested is quite high for the nature of the proposal, although the parts were explained well. We know exactly how the 21,000 dollars would be used, mostly to buy and rent cleaning supplies and accessories (clothing) for the action's volunteers. So, on the financial side, I don't think there's much more to go into. And finally about the team, this part is not good, we are only informed about the names and main roles of the duo that would be responsible for the project. But we don't know what they've done so far in their professional lives, examples of previous work and especially how they relate to Cardano. What are your experiences with our blockchain, how can we trust that you are prepared to successfully develop this project? Therefore, I consider that the only really satisfactory part of the feasibility is the budget, the others being necessary for improvement. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proponent is aware of what needs to be done to audit the project development process: inspect the work and prepare reports. However, by the way it is said, we are not sure if the two of them (the professionals presented in the feasibility) would do this, or if they would delegate this task to third parties, what exactly would happen here? In my opinion, it is fair that the proponents themselves prepare these reports at the end of each work cycle, that is, every 4 weeks. It should contain not only how the volunteers' work routines were, but also how the collective education process took place, any problems faced throughout the process. These reports must be forwarded directly to the Cardano community, through the means of communication that the proponents prefer, such as discord, telegram, Town Hall, etc. And regarding the final results, we have two very direct indicators: \u201cinhabitants fully committed to cleaning their environment / Having the necessary logistics for the cleaning exercises\u201d. In addition, it would be necessary to understand the impact of these cleanings on communities, if the environment was really positively affected, what changes were observed, how people started to relate more to these environments after the cleanings, in what way this all benefited the Cardano ecosystem and etc. It would be necessary for all this data to be gathered in a final report, in my view, in the case of this proposal, a written document would be enough to evaluate the final scenario, of course, if the team and some volunteers held a small meeting to discuss what was generated from the idea and make the video available to the rest of the community would also be great. However, only the elaboration of a very complete and detailed document on how the project reached the communities, both the people, the environment and our blockchain, would be good enough. As well as the reports every 4 weeks this larger one must be sent to each member of the Cardano ecosystem, either by email, by the telegram group \u201cProject Catalyst\u201d or different means of communication between the community. I will give it 3 stars because I think so, some relevant metrics were suggested, but this was not properly explored. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 8, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2236, "q0": "Although Cardano seeks to help in the development of Africa, this proposal i see to have impact on the local community while being skeptical about how it will impact in the Cardano community.

I think the writer should indicate how many people their target audience will include because they need tools to clean up so if the excess tools will be wasted, the tools are not enough, is there an alternative?. The author proposes the solution is to provide the logistics and education needed for clean the frontage successful, however, I think the author should state what the logistics include and with education, what content will be communicated, and through what media. Because in my opinion, the previous education was not very effective, so people did not follow the government's instructions on cleaning frontage. So there is a plan to help the education on frontage sanitation really have an impact on public awareness and be enjoyed by the community. The challenge presented by the proponent is enormous and it is not easy to convince those who are not interested in facade cleaning to participate in voluntary cleaning activities. But the author has not proposed any plan to solve the above problem when it happens in the future.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The works are done on Saturday each week however I think the writer should add in the addition when the work starts and how long it will take and what work is to be done.

Moreover, this project was held in only one area, Ga East District for 15 weeks, the impact on the community and the Cardano ecosystem of the project was very low. I think the proposer has not studied the Challenge well, the core purpose of the Challenge is through Nation Building Dapp solutions to create a foundation for creating prosperity for poor countries.

Do you have any marketing, promotion, or incentive solutions to address those concerns? Furthermore, how will the outcomes be reviewed and preserved? The cleanup will be in 15 weeks, so how can we maintain the good effect after that? We want to work towards sustainable and long-term development for the community, not just temporary solutions.
