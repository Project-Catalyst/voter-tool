Whether or not that pans out, it is several steps away from building dApps for national registries. \n\nthe proposal is to design and implement a new consensus mechanism for Cardano. This is much more than a dApp, which runs because of the underlying consensus model. \n\nThis is a rather esoteric proposal. The authors try to shoehorn the idea into this challenge, but it's not real convincing.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There is no bio information for the team. The proposal mentions 25 team members, but only one name is given, and no links to their bio. This project calls for professionals in several field besides journalism. It needs computer scientists, social scientists, computer engineers and marketing specialists. The proposal is asking for a lot of money, presumably to hire these folks. Perhaps this is a catch-22 where the project needs the money to hire the team and needs the team to justify the money, but I don't think so. A project of this size should have a few people who will put their names on it before asking for such a large amount of money.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Major milestones have been listed on the way to the end goal - three years from now.

Journalists can speak out publicly about pressing issues anonymously and still receive commensurate compensation for their efforts. Readers can access information transparently, verify its credibility and benefit from advertising costs. Transparent, decentralized communication channels will prevent corrupt governments and fraudulent businesses from counterfeiting, interception, or manipulating news. This model sounds promising at first glance and could change how information is created, provided, accessed, verified, and consumed, not just limited to developing countries. Therefore, it fits the criteria of the proposed challenge.\n\nHowever, the proposal focuses more on explaining the economic interests of journalists and audiences and less on the core issue: protecting freedom of expression and transparency of information. In addition, relevant technical and legal issues, relationships, and potential conflicts of interest among journalists, readers, and moderators need to be considered and explained more carefully.\n\nBased on the information provided, I give it a score of 3.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Technically, Proof of Articles that build on layer 2 is a theoretically viable way of validation. However, how to balance the parties' interests while ensuring security, stability, and scalability? The community needs to know more about how it works and the motivation to hold this token.\n\nEconomically, regardless of future hires, the $200,000 budget seems insufficient for the current 25 people over a 3-year timeline. Thus, the proposer should state an ISO plan with more specific tokenomics to forecast the proceeds and use this resource.\n\nThey are a team of 25 experienced people but don't provide any links or references. Their website has not been professionally designed and has historically low traffic. Roadmap only shows what is being done but not how, especially technology still vague.\n\nBesides that, there are a few points that need to be clarified:\nWhy can journalists post anonymously, but readers have to register to vote and comment? Solutions to IP problems (faking, authentication, management, security)?\nWhy should the SPO have permission to edit articles? Benefits and risks?\nWhat are legal issues related to advertisers (e.g., the possibility of tax deductions for advertising costs)?\nWhat are the advantages of using a layered token system rather than a single token?\nWhat are solutions in case of conflict of interest? For example, the journalist mentioned that a factory pollutes the environment, yet it provides jobs for many local people. Since this model suggests that only locals are allowed to vote, what if they go against the article for their benefit, even if it's true?\n\nTherefore, I rate feasibility with a score of 2.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The team outlined a roadmap and budget breakdown with auditable milestones. However, I suggest a more transparent and more detailed explanation. For example, the plan for 1st six months is to \"find technology already built on ADA and implement it into the project.\" So what is the expected technology here? Please name a few as they already exist.\n\nAs mentioned above, there are still many questions the team needs to answer to provide the community with more insight.

There are still many people who do not know or understand about Cardano, in this project the team has the idea to create a solid foundation for Cardano so that it has the power to change any country. I think this idea is very good, I saw in the group project that issues like Cardano not having a solid foundation, slanderous lies about blockchain technology spread in the media, not yet. When I say there are a lot of countries that don't accept cryptocurrencies, I find the problems very well defined. The problems are also well suited to the challenge. I found these to have answered most of the questions in the challenge. I think this is a great proposal that needs to be scaled up to address future challenges. In the description of the group solution, there are not many solutions to solve this problem. And I found the problem raised by the group did not completely solve the problem that the challenge posed. In the section on group risks, three main risks are also mentioned, but no plan to deal with those risks has been given. I would like to export more because many countries in the world have not yet agreed to use cryptocurrencies on the project, and there are still many disadvantages.

(partially) revealing one\u2019s identity and 2. limiting his ability to vote, not based on his knowledge but just as legacy systems do today, based on his physical location on a certain spot on this planet, creating thus an artificial division. For example, can someone from the UK not be much more informed on the political situation in the US than a US citizen? Why should that person then be restricted from voting on an article?\nThen the author goes on to describe how articles will be rewarded and how much permission they\u2019ll have to be submitted to the blockchain. This is a metric based on popularity and gives an example between a sports article that will have more views than a gardening article and as such \u201cthe sports story is more valuable\u201d and will not have \u201ca temporary window to add to the block-chain before it falls out of favor with the audience\u201d like the gardening one might have.\nThis is a rule that limits a journalist\u2019s/person\u2019s ability to upload information on the blockchain, based only on the fact that it\u2019s not very popular. Let\u2019s say, there is some atrocity happening in a remote corner of the world, but because it is much less popular than (as the author gave in his example) a sports story, then that person will have only a limited time to submit a second article regarding that story, just because it did not have enough time to propagate and not enough people have had the chance to read about it. Does that mean that the story about the atrocity is less valuable than the sports story? Isn\u2019t this solution more like censorship, based on likes ?\nThe author also describes other set of rules for journalists, and in one of them he\u2019s stating that if a journalist is sued for one of his articles, his tokens will be locked until the injunction is over. How could this be accepted? If this can happen on the blockchain with someone\u2019s tokens, what\u2019s the difference between banks in a dictatorial regime and this \u201cproof of article\u201d system if your money can be locked if you write something that displeases someone?\nAs a conclusion, I find the proposal does not offer a viable solution compatible to the challenge brief.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The detailed plan offers sufficient information to visualise the steps needed to implement the proposal.\nThe budget is broken down in 2 main categories \u201c80% research and development (160,000 ADA)\u201d and then each section has a percentage linked to it from the entire amount. However, there are no further explanations offered on why those numbers, especially since they are expressed as percentages are needed, and as such I cannot assess the proposal budget for feasibility.\nThe team is very loosely described as skills needed, they will probably all be hired after the proposal is funded, we have no one on the team who can be verified as having some kind of prior experience that would prove his ability to implement this proposal.\nAs such, there is too much information lacking and I cannot assess its successful implementation.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The project progress is well described, with milestones defined and easy to follow.
