Some of these problems can be effectively solved with the help of blockchain bases solutions namely Cardano\u2019s identity solution and attaining the capital from investors.\nThe solution will have a global impact as the proposing team have clients all over the world, they can utilize the DApp to provide microfinance services to their customers in their respective region.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposing team is qualified to carry out the feasibility study laid out in the proposal.

This expert group will be assigned by the lead of the proposal Mr. Fabio. This expert team will have command of Microfinance investment fund, investment vehicle, investment institution, and research impact.\nThe plan and timeframes are stated on weekly basis with the tasks to be completed. It will be better if these tasks to accomplish can be separated weekly as now it is stated as per 4 weeks.\nThe mentioned budget is reasonable and divided into identifiable subcategories of tasks to be undertaken. The proposer will require additional funding after the successful completion of this study and report finalization. It will be for developing the minimum viable product and subsequent operation.\nThey can come again to Catalyst for this additional funding.\nThe proposer seems to be aware of the risks and challenges posed by this proposal which they will require to look into for the subsequent phase after this proposal.\nTaking into account all the above facts, this feasibility study proposal is likely to be completed.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer provided the tasks to be completed on a \u20184 weeks\u2019 basis.

This can add great value to the Cardano ecosystem as the results of these research can be the debut of microfinance in the crypto space. The proponent has already identified the tools built in the Cardano blockchain such as Atala prism, smart contracts, NFT, and more, as part of the possible solution.

It wants to find possible and feasible connections between the microfinance sector in the current web3 scenario and specific Cardano products such as Atala Prism; smart contracts; money transfer infrastructure; tokens, and NFT business models, and so on.  There is a clear professional profile, so the credibility of the team in charge would not be a central point of discussion.   What would be under discussion is their equally clear overall purpose of the proposal and within that generality, what would be the true magnitude of its scope.  \n\nPaying my respects and consideration to the proponents, the thing is that I doubt that at this stage of the game, general efforts at the academic, research, creative, development, construction and implementation levels are enough to generate waves of impact that will significantly affect Cardano's ecosystem and our position as industry leaders.  \n\nIn the same way, and unfortunately for this and other proposals whose final product is the study and research, Cardano is an ecosystem based primarily on peer-to-peer review academic research, a situation that generates an overwhelming bulk of high quality research work that makes subsequent research and studies must be of similar characteristics as well as mean an advance in the development of the ecosystem.  These reasons make the conditions for research on generalities difficult: they are basically not contributing anything new. And based on the information provided in the proposal, that is the situation of the proposal: there is nothing outstanding that can differentiate it from the studies and research that have already been done in the area of Microfinance by equally talented and capable teams.\n\nGiven the professionalism that the proponents leave reflected in their proposal, my recommendation for future funds is to focus on a very specific topic, related of course to the day-to-day life and concerns of our ecosystem.

However, this condition makes it easier to dismiss the quantitative aspect of the dynamic process of measuring progress.   Qualitative measurement being the most common practice in the production of academic and theoretical type material, not even practitioners of this form of enterprise can deny the numerical possibilities present in their job, which can be channeled into KPIs for capturing refined and real-time information on the current state of a process. \n\nIn a brief subsection called \"Deliveries\" of the Feasibility section, mention is made of: \"Participation and/or partnerships with other international organizations\".  \n\nIn the subsection \"What does success for this project look like?\" of the Auditability section, mention is made of \"A feasibility study completed, and summary report findings published, enabling a framework and strategy to be fine tuned to determine the next steps in developing a MVP.\"    Findings published.  \n\nIt is seemingly obvious that the auditable outcome of a research process is the research itself.

Proponents explain what technologies would be used (Atala Prism DIDs for entrepreneurs, smart contracts, business models involving tokens and NFTs, etc.). It is also said that one of the problems faced in the matter is that investors do not fully trust the process and how their money is being used, which would be directly solved in the case of blockchain, as the information is transparent and incorruptible.

I read the proposal a couple of times and I couldn't understand what does the supply chain of microfinance has to do with anything and what is it. I searched for this term in the linked resources and googled it but I couldn't find a definition.
