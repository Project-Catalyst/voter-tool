However, it is unclear how it aligns with the success metrics and objectives of this particular challenge. The proposal is largely focused on the development of a new supply chain, as opposed to what the challenge requests which is the development of foundational registry solutions. As such, if there was a link made around the way this solution could interact with existing government bodies or whether it plans to entirely replace the need for government interaction was made unclear. \n\nIn order to turn this from a good to an excellent proposal, I suggest narrowing the scope to truly address the key problem statement at hand. For example, narrowing down on one of the key activities such as 'gathering farmer information' and putting this on-chain would be a sufficient proposal. This could then capture information on the farmer, farm details, crop information, etc\u2026 In the process of providing a lot of information for the proposal, the key takeaway and objective is left lost for the reader and voter. \n\nA key strength in the proposal from an impact perspective is the collaboration with the stakeholders (farmers). However, this again falls short in describing how it aims to build a strategy to engage governments, other partners and organisation's. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "One of the strengths of this proposal is the demonstration of the depth of skills and experience in the execution team. Roles ranging from project , product and business model leads. However, there appears to be a gap for someone that strongly understands the application of blockchain technology.  \n\nThe budget of $22.5k USD makes up a smaller proportion of the total $800k allocation for the challenge.  The budget is high-level and is not clearly broken down at a detailed level. For example, if you are requesting $2000 USD for the business proposal, how many days are allocating to this activity? How many people are allocated towards building this out? These same questions can be applied to every other budgeted item. \n\nFinally, the proposal does not  clearly address the key challenges to deliver the project successfully.  It mentions that it has already addressed the potential challenge of building trust. However, from past experience running projects both technical and strategy, it is vital to have a log of risks to watch out for, whether that is related to delivering the project on time, communication challenges, iterations requirements as product strategy evolves, etc\u2026 Highlighting what these biggest challenges that they could face would provide a realistic colour to what lies ahead and what actions are required to overcome them.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal can benefit from going into more detail when addressing the ability to audit the progress. For example, whilst there are high-level comments on how to track the progress such as having 'monthly-status documents', having a detailed roadmap that clearly links to the key value drops and how long it will take would give the community an added layer of comfort that the project will be properly managed and delivered. Further, there is a lack of specificity in the metrics used to track progress. For example 'increased income by > X%' is not a metric. What is the percentage value increase you are truly after? Can you select more direct metrics for value-add such as 'signing up 1500 farmers on to the platform' or 'signing up 10 different produce types.'", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_586", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1249, "q0": "The Nation Building Dapps challenge mentions two broad directions proposals can take: First; assist with basic government services where these are insufficient, such as governance, welfare, education, utilities and so on that can be bootstrapped from inadequate to world-class web3, and Second; increase the number of Dapp users in developing countries in general, and increase human development outside government services can also be seen as a decentralized layer of Nation Building. This proposal has potential in both, but it more relevant in the second. It explicitly mentions the potential for Dapp usage after the proposed research and the arguments presented are highly credible. Essentially, small-holder farming and agricultural supply chains in Africa (Ghana initially) operate very inefficiently and unfairly for the farmers, and can bring a lot of people to use Dapps and improve their livelihoods with decentralized web3 building blocks.\nThe proposal is the starting point for a much larger project envisioned. It will not have any Dapp launch or improvements \"on the ground\" as the desired result, but wants to accurately measure the status quo and potential. This will be done collaboratively with involvement of WADA, the Pond Foundation, Earthworm, AIM and C4C and the findings will be made available to the public / Townhall.\nThe proposal ticks all the boxes, but will \"only\" result in another proposal if successful. While this boosts feasibility and auditability, it comes at the cost of impact. I still assess this as a good fit and effectively addressing the challenge in terms of overall impact.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The large and highly experienced team of proposers showcases Catalyst collaboration at its best, bringing together leaders and pioneers in impact investment, NGOs, Africa-specific knowledge and web3 solutions. The proposal is highly realistic, limiting its scope to research and creating a much more ambitious roadmap for the actual web3 integration as a long term goal. It is well structured, backed up by references and milestones, and shares insight in project management tools and metrics. Given all the information presented, I consider it highly likely that the vision for success described can be achieved.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal has over a dozen KPIs. It is highly detailed about how progress will be communicated back to the community and stakeholders. It is also good that immediate success of the presented proposal is compared to and treated separately from the longer term project.\nThe product metrics presented demonstrate how much thought has gone into the proposal and all of them seem highly relevant to improving agricultural supply chains and the livelihoods of farmers.\nI would have liked to see a separation of phases 1 and 2 under auditability and a discussion of the timeline with regard to auditability. Overall, I am highly confident that the progress towards success will be communicated clearly.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1329", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1290, "q0": "Getting food to market is essential for any nation.

The proposer will be considering all the probable issues faced by the people and the whole supply chain and provide suitable solutions for them. Hence once completed the proposed DApps and the platform can be scaled to include larger geography.\nThis proposal will likely be bringing many users to the Cardano ecosystem in the guise of various parties involved in the Agriculture production and its supply chain at least in the farming of \u201cBambara Groundnut\u201d in Ghana and hopefully, this project progress to include other Agricultural products and a lot of farmlands across Africa in the future.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is qualified to carry out the proposal as it is the team of well-known organizations i.e., \u2018Pond foundation\u2019 and \u2018whatif-foods\u2019 company.

The budget also seems to be reasonable. It is distributed into the different tasks to complete Phase 1. \n I think that the tasks to be completed can be further elaborated and the given timeframe of 3 months for phase 1 should be divided on weekly basis.\nThe proposer did not describe how they will arrange the funding for Phase 2 and Phase 3.

With the help of blockchain technology and Cardano, the project can bring transparent and traceable information between farmers and consumers and supply them with reliable fresh and clean products, which is absolutely great. These days, more and more people tend to care about the food that they consume, so I think this app can be useful for its marvelous impact on the health field. It also brings farmers more effective agriculture practices and better accession to services such as microinsurance and microfinance, as the proposer mentioned. This project has a great effect on a variety of aspects such as social, finance, and economic development and it can result in the economic development of poor nations and increasing Dapp usage on Cardano.
