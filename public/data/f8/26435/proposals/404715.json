People usually think gaming is just for entertainment and distracts their children from academic study. However, the team's intention is to fix that misunderstanding and provide a free education system that uses analogue education methods to teach digital literacy for a digital world and provides free digital learning materials online. It targets a variety of users from children to adults and develops suitable contents for each age group. Not only it shows the value of gaming when it becomes an interesting method of studying, but also helps people in the industry to get a wider understanding that games are providing more impact in other ways than just entertainment. In my opinion, this project is quite interesting and beneficial to the users, especially to the future generations in the technology field. Since it also helps nurture and train their intrapersonal skills, develop resilience, fact checking and so on, this system is quite supportive in preparing the younger generation for the future.

The use of Checkpoint - a digitally-interactive media brand is a fairly new method to convey education to users. However, it appears that this is all the project has to give in this section, while several crucial components are lacking. To begin with, the proposer stated that they couldn't find any future issues, but as far as I can see, it doesn't. For example, how do they verify that checkpoint users understand what the project is trying to communicate, or that the material they provide is acceptable for all ages? In general, the proposer should learn more in order to provide particular solutions and minimize needless risks. Also, the proposer stated an attachment with information about their work, but I can't locate it anywhere. Before submitting this proposal, proposers should carefully double-check all information. Most significantly, I don't see how it will have any impact on the Cardano environment. This is a significant minus point for the evaluation process of investors.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "According to what the proposer mentioned in this section, the project can be completed in 2022. For an educational assignment, this was a relatively rapid procedure. However, there are three aspects that I hope the proposer can explain or enhance in order for the project to be completed. To begin, the proposer should provide a specific timeframe for each stage. It does not have to be hourly, but it must indicate how long each project activity takes. The benefits of this include getting things done on schedule and being able to easily follow progress, thus I hope the proposer can add it soon. Secondly, the proposal includes a $5,000 contingency part but does not clarify what it is for. It may not be mandatory to say it, but giving an example of it is not necessarily a bad option. Finally, as previously said, the proposer needs funds for marketing. Not to mention whether it is pricey or inexpensive, but as far as I can tell from the project team, no one has any expertise pushing a project. As a result, the proposer should recruit additional individuals with knowledge in this area to guarantee that the money is used wisely.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Overall, it seems the project hasn't really lived up to expectations. The proposal could not define a schedule or the number of schools that would participate. It may be impossible for the proposer to provide exact statistics, but it is feasible to estimate 20-30 schools in order to create a good impression on the sponsors and to keep the entire team motivated to achieve what they propose.

Seeing these examples will provide readers with a full understanding of the impact of Checkpoint on influence in education. The proposer provides comprehensive information about how Checkpoint gaming affects educational content to attract children, and all of it is provided for free. I recommend that the proposer provide some key metrics to address how they relate to the challenge. They can make it apparent that they provide numerous methods of learning and how they expect children approach these methods. According to the proposer, there are no risks other than the need to complete the project as soon as possible in order to own the area.

The problem itself is clearly outlined and the proposed solution can indeed address the problem. However, I do believe that there are three areas affecting the scale of impact that may benefit from a certain degree of re-evaluation, and they are:\n\n1. The problem itself can be more succinctly defined. \nIn the problem summary, the proposer stated that \"Every nation needs a free and relevant education system - class and geopolitical circumstance define the type of education accessible\". However, it's not clear what does a \"free and relevant education system\" entail, and why current education systems are not up to the task. This causes confusion for readers of the proposer as to what exactly is the problem that the team's trying to solve with the project: Is the target audience children? If so, what exactly is it that they're lacking under our current model of education that is in urgent need to be fixed? Is this problem specific to a specific country or region? Is this project a good-to-have-but-not-critical one, or is it really fixing something that dearly needs fixing?\nInstead of saying that every country needs a free and relevant education system, explain what exactly in our current model of education is in need of urgent fixing. Be specific. For example, I can identify the problem as: mindless learning of students in countries with high-stake standardized testing (eg. China, Korea) where students forget what they learnt immediately after the exam has passed; they do not know why they're learning certain things and view learning only as a means to an end - achieving high marks in exams.\n\n2. It's hard to pin down the unique selling point of the product as it's too broad.\nThe product seems to be trying to do a lot of things at once and as such, it confuses readers of the proposal on what exactly is the unique selling point of the product. i.e. why would people use this over the other competitors out there. When reading, I've been trying to actively look out for a unique selling point but can't see if it's the children-focused nature of the content, the interactivity of the content, emphasis on learning through gaming or anything else. This overlaps with the first point. Identifying a unique selling point would be ideal to cement dominant position in the market. \nPerhaps a good unique selling point would be the family-orientation. Instead of saying that this product is for both kids and adults, let's orient it as a playground for families (playground, because there is a suite of different sub-products like games, podcasts etc under it). Couple it with the interactivity across different medium and it'll be great.\n\n3. Scalability.\nFrom the proposal, it seems like the content creation will be primarily done by the team apart from the one for the kid's magazine. This model is not scalable. Instead, it might be good to experiment with other models - for example, by eventually positioning the product as a portable infrastructure for relevant content creators to reach the audience base that the product has gathered. This model is similar to how MOOC platforms like edX and Coursera are run. However, this links back to the point again: we need to be specific on who exactly our target audience is.\n\n4. There's little contribution made to the development of the Cardano ecosystem.\nApart from launching the NFT collection on Cardano, there's little reference back to the usage of Cardano's infrastructure for this project. Furthermore, as the audience are largely in the Web2 world, having an NFT collection requires them to have a web3 identity which may be a hurdle to overcome for it to succeed. This requires some consideration. \n\nThese are my two cents after reading through the proposal, hope it helps!", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Based on the founder's experiences as accomplished journalists and teachers, there is reason to believe that the team can deliver for the quality of content created given their ability to put themselves in the shoes of the audience to better see what would appeal to them. However, that's if the product is to remain primarily as a content creation and distribution medium. \nAs stated earlier, the content creation model may not be scalable and an infrastructure model may do better to enhance scalability. However, if the suggestion has been taken, it's related more towards operations and logistics and less so for content creation. If that happens, a new team member with the relevant experiences may be necessary. \n\nIn the short run, however, the team should still continue this model so as to build a dedicated audience base and establish itself as an incumbent in the space. As such, what is its unique selling point will need to be considered.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As a content-creation platform, this is easily auditable as we can track the progress of the contents created and see if they're going as according to schedule, and easily audit the quality of content created. To assess the quality of the content created, a routine feedback mechanism may be good where feedbacks from the users can be collected and shown to the wider Catalyst community for accountability. \nThe number of schools engaged will be a good metric too to measure the success of the proposal. However, it'd be better if the nature of engagement can be outlined in detail in the proposal as well - what will the engagement entail, how will it create more value for the students and if it's feasible to replace time for the main curriculum to this.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_912", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 1, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Checkpoint provides free digital learning materials online - using analogue education methods to teach digital literacy for a digital world.", "experience": "I've been a journalist for over 20 years and have come from a BBC and Guardian background - broadcast journalist (award winning).\u00a0I have been in the games industry for over 15 years working and launchings some of the most recognisable gaming sites specialising in audiences."}
