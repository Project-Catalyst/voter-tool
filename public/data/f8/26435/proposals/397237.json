Thus, the proposal really aims to cure a pain in society, creating a safer, direct and less bureaucratic way to make donations and also integrate donor entities. Therefore, there is an innovative feature with a considerable long-term impact.\n\nHowever, having cited these positive points, it is also essential to mention here that the budget is very disproportionate to what was explained about the project at the time. Therefore, this is a clearly negative point and the amount of $800,000 is unreasonable, not least because little is developed in the description of the objectives on how the work will be accomplished.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Regarding the steps that describe how the work would be carried out, we have a really scarce availability of information. We realize this because one of the first sentences about describing the feasibility of the project is that the idea has yet to be fully developed, which seems inconsistent with a proposal that is asking for $800.00 (the full amount of the fund).\n\nIn addition, the author of the proposal did not provide a simple access to his curriculum for the validation of his training and when describing the team, only the functions that each one should perform were pointed out, but it was not explicit who would perform each task. For example, in the description of the team, only software developers and website designers were mentioned, but no specific professional was designated to perform these functions.\n\nAdditionally, in the detailing of the plan for delivering the solution, the steps to be carried out at each moment were stated too comprehensively, but what portion of the total amount would be assigned to each of these steps? This was not made clear at any point during the presentation of the proposal. About software development, for example, it was just said: developing the software and its maintenance. But the question remains, how much to allocate for this development?\n\nThis problem is perpetuated during the exposition of the other stages, including when talking about the project's marketing, which would be fundamental in a project of this proportions.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "At this stage, we see problems similar to those that occur above, that is, we have a very weak description of what measures would be taken to validate the possible progress of the initiative. We see that no specific way was pointed out to measure, for example, the volume of transactions on the platform or the number of uses of the platform. However, these two indicators were pointed out as parameters to measure the projection of the proposal.\n\nFor a proposal of such proportions, it would be necessary to have a specific system dedicated to collecting user feedback, the number of transactions and also a list, for example, of donor entities using the platform. Furthermore, it would also be interesting to periodically carry out questionnaires with these donor entities in order to identify the significant improvements in carrying out transactions using Cardano's technology.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 6, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 7291, "q0": "In theory, this idea is very good, it is about creating software that can connect donors, non-profit organizations and who would receive the donation (as I understand it, it can be a family, a single individual, etc.). Transactions would be done on the Cardano blockchain and from what I understand DIDs would be used at some point in this project to identify the people involved. The objective is to help build nations through these donations and make governments and non-profit organizations realize the advantages of working with Cardano ecosystem technologies, which would generate mass adoption, according to the author. Donors could be aware of how their donations would be affecting the beneficiaries because there would be a platform that would establish this point, through chats, videos, etc. In other words, in theory everything is perfect, but I identified serious problems in this proposal. Let's go, starting with that the requested money corresponds to the total value of the challenge, 800k in dollars! It's not feasible for us as a community to put literally all our chips on a single idea. Second, although it is interesting to build software that works in the humanitarian field, and that dialogues with the specific objectives of the challenge, since we seek here to favor developing nations through support in more basic areas such as education, food, health et cetera (I believe donations would cover these areas), it's all very abstract. Which organizations does the author intend to contact? In which countries would this activity be developed, at least initially? How could we see how the efforts were rewarded? I believe the scale here is too macro. A little more specificity would be important, for example: we are going to focus on Latin American countries, our target audience for donating would be X, the people we aim to involve so that they donate are Y, and the organizations we are thinking of establishing contact with are Z. As it is said, it seems like a somewhat utopian and extremely expensive project, and as it does not focus on anything in particular, we cannot be sure that the objectives of the challenge will actually be met. So I suggest that the author review a few things, starting with the budget, it's not unreasonable to ask for all the challenge money for your project. I would like the proponent to tread a more palpable path on how all this would happen, we cannot bet on something indefinite. So, unfortunately, I'll give it a low rating, two stars, because I think the idea is the way we're looking, but there's a lot to be modified for it to be valid to be financed. \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The viability of the project is very low. All the information we need is either missing or insufficient. Starting with the script. that does not exist, the author only vaguely included what would happen in the first and second year of the project. It would be essential to establish a time-based schedule, that is, first divide year 1 into quarters, and within these quarters explain what would happen according to the month at least. Each activity should be detailed, for example the research, where it would be done, with what methods, who would work on that part and how the results obtained would be organized and delivered. How the NGOs that would participate would be chosen and the justification for each of the choices, how donors would be attracted, as I also explained in the previous topic. Would this survey last the first month? What would happen in parallel, or would that be all? About software development, this is something very big and complex. How long would it last? Likewise, which small tasks would result in this whole, in the final product, in the developed software? How would the professionals involved here organize themselves? The information is passed in a totally abstract way. About the funding, nothing is explained about how it would be divided, we know that it would be used to develop the software, promote marketing, publicize it and so on. But how much would go to each park and why? What is the need to order 800k? What is the salary of the professionals involved? How would the publicity campaign be carried out, what specific expenses would it be? It is always necessary to justify how the money would be used in detail, especially if it is such an expensive project. Finally, basically nothing is said about the team, they are just listed which professionals would be involved, but we don't know any details about them. We need to know their names, backgrounds, what role they would play in the project, how they would work (for how many hours per week, for example), how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem and we would also need a way to verify all the information described, some online profile, whether linkedin, portfolios, your contacts on discord, telegram and etc. Unfortunately I don't know what happened here, maybe the proposer is not very knowledgeable about how to submit a proposal and the details it needs to include, I suggest you review your idea as a whole and provide all the details quoted here. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Similar to the first two topics, the auditability of the project is very shallow. What we do know is that success can be measured based on numbers (number of NGOs involved, DIDs integrated, donations made, etc.). However, it is not just by quantities that we measure whether a proposal was successful or not, especially in this challenge, which aims to help developing countries to establish themselves better. It would be important to have a direct follow-up of those who received the donation, I believe it is just as important to know the number of people/families/places that have benefited. In this way, we could see if what was promised is being fulfilled. In the same way, it would be important to know if in fact NGOs and government institutions have realized the advantages of the Cardano ecosystem and have adopted its technologies, used our blockchain in some way. It would have to be something reciprocal: good for those who received the donations and also for us, who would finance the project and have our technologies at stake. This qualitative research should be done, in my view, by the project team itself, and the reported information should be made available to the entire community. Likewise, it would be essential to follow the project development process, but as there is no roadmap here, there are no ways to do that. To perform a monitoring, we would need to understand what we are trying to verify. Therefore, it is necessary for the team to establish specific tasks, so that some members of the Cardano community can follow them, perhaps through meetings with the software development, marketing, research teams, etc. Updates should also be shared with the rest of the community. Unfortunately, the proposal as a whole is quite incomplete, what we have is just basic information about what we would need to know, without the necessary level of detail. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 7, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2195, "q0": "One of the goals of this campaign is to help poor people in developing countries move out of poverty sustainably. Thus, leveraging blockchain technology makes charity fundraising more transparent, and ease is needed. The idea of creating a digital ID and building a bridge between donors and recipients is brilliant. It gives donors more peace of mind knowing that their money is being used in the right places and helping the right people. Those who are donated will thus have more opportunities to receive support from benefactors, thereby changing their lives. Besides material support, it will also help provide donees understanding and emotional help from donors. The proposal can be deployed on a large scale and will contribute to the reputation of the Cardano ecosystem. Therefore, I appreciate the potential impact of this proposal and give it a score of 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Regarding the team, the proposer claims to have education and experience in international political science, which could help develop this Daap but has not provided any evidence. The proposer is aware that he will need software developers, website designers, marketers, outreach coordinators to join his team. The technical requirements of this proposal are not too high, so I suggest looking for additional roles from the community to finalize the idea into a serious proposal and participate in the following funds.\n\nBesides, for the project to survive and develop long-term, it is clear that the amount of funding from Catalyst (if any) will not be enough. So, where will the necessary revenue come from? Will it grow towards non-profit and regular crowdfunding, or will the revenue come from organizations you partner with or some other way? Is the project planning to issue tokens or develop in the direction of a DAO? If so, what is the blueprint for tokenomics? Your team should consider this carefully to build a sustainable development model.\n\nSince there has not been any roadmap, technical solutions, or budget breakdown yet, as the proponent also admitted, I can only give 2 point for feasibility.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proponent raises the problem and provides ideas for solutions. However, he has not yet come up with a specific implementation plan.\n\nThe proposer identifies essential targets to be achieved during the product development process. However, the goal of \"1000's of nonprofits sending millions of dollars per year in funds, and adding millions of new digital IDs\" may sound too far-fetched. I suggest setting more realistic milestones like \"work with five non-profits\", \"generate hundreds of digital IDs\", and \"help raise hundreds of thousands of dollars\" during the first year. Setting smaller goals and achieving them step by step will make the audit easier. \n\nTherefore, I give this criterion a score of 2 over 5.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1459", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4017, "q0": "The proposal is detailed with clear goals, specific audiences, main activities, and approaches, and this activity takes advantage of the existing Cadarno network and helps to develop the Valdarno ecosystem and attract Participants., Nonprofits would act as clearinghouses or oracles, ensuring that the data provided by the donee is verified. Tools will be developed for nonprofits with specific focuses, such as education and microfinancing. Create software that Non Profits can use to connect their donors with the end-user. This will make the funding sources more transparent and can go directly to the end-user without going through many intermediary steps. In addition, the impact of your activities is mentioned in a very specific way, such as encouraging non-profits to create trust, this coordination and synergy would be beneficial since it would increase efficiency and inspire more collaboration within the nonprofit sector.

How will the survey results help with project development? which department will conduct the survey... And how is the software developed, for how long, and how is it tested. I think the more specific project roadmaps will make it easier for the reader to assess the feasibility of the project. the project's members are departments related to the project implementation process, such as software development, web design, marketing, community coordination, but those roles are all integral parts of this project.

Compare with the project's plan, I feel there is a contradiction, in the plan the author mentions for a year will only be surveys and outreach to interested nonprofits and the development of the software and there is no mention of the growth of the built-in ID number.

What remittance service will be used (an existing service or will you create a new one)? How can we verify that the money is used correctly? Connecting non-profit organizations is a fantastic concept with a strong community focus, since it allows organizations to learn, improve, and become more perfect.
