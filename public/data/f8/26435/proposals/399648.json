These can somehow cast light on the notions and provide communities a foundational understanding of the proposed solution. For instance, the proposer provided a background problem to show that his product is a perfect fit for data communication in Africa, presents how it works and how to use it, etc. Furthermore, the benefits of Lokole in terms of cost-efficiency and resource-saving are apparently advantageous for the poor, vastly and positively impacting the users\u2019 life, which is very pragmatic and convincing to implement the project. Besides, it is immensely impressive for the project to embrace the potential challenges as well as highly practical properties of the system to resolve them, which evokes a persuasiveness among communities. The proposer also did a great job in showing possible challenges in implementation as well as well-prepared plans for it. However, I see that the description lacks a list of key metrics as measurements of accomplishment to compare with the challenge KPI. Also, the proposer did not cover the potential impacts of the project towards the whole Cardano ecosystem such as popularity, number of users, positive impacts, etc. More key information and interpretation about the KPI and impacts on Cardano in the description can get the proposal to be clearer and better.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "It is encouraged to break these two quarters into smaller stages so that the project is able to become easier for the proposer and the communities to monitor and assess. For instance, Q3 includes 3 months, which can be considered a considerable period for manufacturing 100 Lokole boxes. In my opinion, the proposer could break the progress into small stages, for example, 30 boxes would be produced and used for a pilot test in the first month. If the short-term and real-life results are positive, the manufacturing process can be accelerated for the rest of time in order to meet the needs. By this way, the project can be regarded as safer, more thorough and robust. Similarly, the same strategy adoption can be applied to the marketing and sales process. What if by the end of Q4, the proposer would have not sold out 100 boxes? If this really happens, it cannot be a success in the roadmap or worse, it can delay the planned roadmap.. Thus, the roadmap should be more specific and thorough. As for the detailed budget breakdown, it is hard to believe that the only spending is focused on manufacturing expenses. It is possible that incurred costs can emerge, which is worth noting, during the manufacturing process, let alone marketing expenses. However, this lack does not mean that this project is unpromising, especially with assistance of an experienced and skillful team. These experts are capable of promoting the proposal's potential.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The key metrics presented in the proposal are practical, comprehensive and can totally be indicators of success. They are correlated with the number of users and their attitude via surveys, and other related-user data. Therefore, it is conspicuous that the close relationship of success and users is significantly important. Besides, this information is in line with the proposer\u2019s plan, showing his seriousness and effort in implementing the project. About the success that the project can bring, the proposer covered a lot of useful and sufficient information in terms of criteria of accomplishment, social impacts, convenience in distance, and so forth.

My suggestion is to consider and show the community how the project can generate income from local users and entrepreneurs so that it can scale.\nIn terms of personnel, the team is knowledgeable and experienced.

The proposer has also mentioned that there are other technology on integrated registry systems applications which does the same application but his idea of making it cheaper for the poor economic countries stand out as the proposer uses compressed and encrypted SSH tunnel with appropriate authentication which reduces the bandwidth usage and will be more effective.

The problem statement is clear and the proposal points out solutions for it accordingly. The author has clearly explained the background reasons and also presented the usefulness level of the tool as well as Lokole device\u2019s functions. Developing a device, which can help bring the Internet and advancements to developing countries, is actually very meaningful and crucial. I like the fact that it can give people opportunities to interact and get access to information and knowledge to improve their lives and the next generation\u2019s education. I do believe that if there are more humane projects like this being funded, they will have a great impact on the Cardano Ecosystem since developers and contributors are motivated to create quality projects solving real problems for people living. Any technology has drawbacks, however, the team has actually converted the disadvantage of using cheap material and made it beneficial by giving the fact that if any particular part is broken, it can easily be replaced because that material is cheap and modular. I believe that this solution is smart and effective. They also give 2 more possible risks, which are cellular network failures and security and data privacy, then come up with detailed solutions for each. Besides, I have a minor suggestion that if the team can provide an approximate number of the device\u2019s price, it would be better and increase the quality of the proposal.

The timeplan is quite brief, concise and sensible since the whole plan is mainly divided into the last two quarters of 2022 and having one main task for each of the quarters. The budget breakdown is understandable. However, I think it would be better if the team can provide more information on the amount of money required for building each Lokole Box.

The proposed team has done a good job of preparing for the successful implementation of the project, including surveying the project implementation area (Africa), assessing the potential and challenges of the work area, explaining the technique, presenting the core features and operating methods of the product. Risks and mitigation measures are also analyzed and presented in great detail, I appreciate it very much because the author has focused on reducing the risk of data loss and privacy for users, a big challenge that many dApp developers often fail to focus on, and mention in their projects.
