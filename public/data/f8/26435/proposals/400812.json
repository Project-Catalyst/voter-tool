I agreed vs strongly agreed because it seems like the project is aimed at building on Cardano, although the first phases in M1-M6 covering grant funding from Catalyst F8 are aimed at preparation for Dapp building, while the later phases may be funded by VC, revenue, or later grants (not sure).

Lastly, once we've closed our targeted B2B and B2C clients, this will fund the further expansion as the field boundary dataset will have additional and wider impact and value to the agricultural value chain - land management, national grain inventory, large-scale yield forecasting, assessment of sustainability, traceability and carbon mapping which will enable wider commercial impact and financial longevity. Our value add is the ability to use free, publicly available Sentinel-2 imagery data at 10m resolution from the European Space Agency (ESA) and increase the resolution by 10x in order to get commercial-satellite equivalent accuracy and quality (such as Planet, Maxar and Airbus) at a fraction (10%) of the cost, which in turn makes our field detection tool not only higher accuracy and resolution by 10x but also significantly cheaper (25%) than existing solutions (commercial).

In addition, the concept and construction of the project seems well designed, and I will also be available as an expert in the field to assist with the concept and implementation of the project.
