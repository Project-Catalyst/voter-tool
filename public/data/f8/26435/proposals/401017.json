The proposer gives the community one feasible way to mitigate the utilization of such unreliable materials and resources. The nations spend a huge amount of their reserves in building sustainable long-lasting amenities for the people and sometimes the greedy sharks out there try to make some quick money out of this. Especially considering the housing market, this is an area of primary concern. The proposal shows an intensive amount of spadework done by the team in this field and seems to be aware of the market demand, the opportunities, and the risks involved. The risk involved is huge as the opposition are reputed cartels and a lot of support is needed in making the proposal impactful. The team assures involving the Anti-Counterfeit Authority of Kenya and other government agencies to overcome these hurdles. The involvement of such agencies instills trust and confidence in the work of the team and can surely sky rocket the reputation of Cardano and its charitable community provided we are able to extend our help to the team by funding them appropriately.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer bestows upon us a carefully crafted manifesto that enriches the wonderful ideology they bring into this funding round. The team has a variety of members and catches all the required essence to build this solution be it developers or trustable material companies or the surveyors to assist in market scenarios. The phase-wise elaborate plan with crystal clear deliverables at every milestone is commendable. Any reader can see the amount of work put into the plan to cover all aspects and parties involved and define specific goals at regular intervals. In spite of the plan's extensive amount of work involved, the funds requested ($55000) is a very practical and have not been overemphasized in any way. Considering all the green flags in front of us there lies negligible doubt regarding the possibility of the proposal being implemented.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal has covered almost all the required areas and has left the readers in awe. However, I might have to make a small concern regarding the KPIs available upfront to drive conclusions on how effective the auditing process will be. The success metrics and the final outcomes set are very much like the challenge's success definition and look promising. But the proposal having failed to raised funds in previous rounds, I would had expected some measurable quantity metrics along with the usual development activities such as git commits, discord discussions, and milestone reports. Metrics such as number of material suppliers onboarded, number of end-users reached, number of smart contracts that can be expected would have made the proposal complete. Thus I score a 4 out of 5 expecting a little more work from the team on the auditablity metrics section.\n\n\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1985, "q0": "This proposal attempts to establish an anti-counterfeit marketplace for the building, construction, and electrical parts industry on a country level in Kenya. Thus this proposal is aligned with the challenge statement as it is trying to solve a national problem.\nThis is an important problem to solve as it poses big risks both economically and fatally.\nSuch as in one study it is found that \u2018Counterfeit materials used in the building industry can present a threat to fire safety. Hence if solved, this proposal will have a huge impact on the lives and finances of many people.\t\nThis proposal has the ability to scale after the successful execution. It can expand to other African countries and to other continents.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer being in the banking and construction industry is seems to be well skilled and experienced to lead on this proposal. The team members also qualified in the area of blockchain and software development. \n He seems to be very well aware of how to execute this proposal and the resources required to complete this proposal.\nI like the way the roadmap and phases are laid out with extensive details which shows how well the proposer knows the industry. This will really help the team undertaking the proposal as well as other concerned parties.\nThe budget is provided assignment-wise. But it would have been clear if these assignments are broken down into identifiable tasks with \u2018assignment wise\u2019 milestones allotted to each along with the duration required to achieve those milestones. \n The stated timeframe is very brief (3 months). It could have been spread out on weekly basis for the betterment of tracking the progress.\nThe required budget is $75k as per the details.  They requested $69k in this proposal and $6k will be arranged by the proposer from family and friends.\nThe proposer appears to be aware of the challenges and risks. They provided the details of how they will deal with the risks and challenges. \nIn view of the above facts, this proposal is likely to be executed successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditors or other concerned entities can check the progress of the project on Github, Discord, and Trello where the proposer will be updating the status of the proposal.\nIt would have helped if the proposer had broken down the timeframe from 3 months to weeks. Then the target is assigned to each team on weekly basis. This would have smoothened the progress tracking and auditing.\nThe same can be done with the budget. The proposer has divided funds assignment-wise. But if they could have assigned the hours/weeks required by each team member to execute the assignment with the budget corresponding to them. It would have helped the auditors. \n The delivery date is clearly stated which is 3 months. So, we can expect the minimum viable product \u2018anti-counterfeit marketplace\u2019 for building materials after 3 months. Initially, they will track cement products and will onboard at least 3 manufacturers, 3 wholesalers, and 3 retailers to final consumers.\nThe milestones as mentioned are set to 3 months for Phase 1 which is the above task and 3 to 6 months for Phase 2 in which we expect the real product to go live with at least 20 to 40 customers using when they seek building materials.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1444", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4028, "q0": "The first thing that I feel is that the writer's proposed solution is very specific and clear on each important point, so it is easy to follow. They have fully covered each specific positive action their market will bring to the community such as eliminating illegal goods, customers getting good prices, creating a  fair market for customers. A fair-market-play for potential business models. The example included by the writer is also very intuitive. In addition, the proposer also offers ways that they will implement to build a reliable market by using the IOHK/EMURGO Atala PRISM solution to authenticate relevant documents for donors who want to enter the market, providing retail customers with access to data in their ecosystem, and ensuring data security with smart contracts. They mentioned the consequences that the counterfeit market brings and the result they get from creating a fair play market is a lower-cost source. The author also points out the big risks they will face but also offers other ways to mitigate the risk. such as overcoming the indifference in the counterfeit trade of many by looking for pilots who have always been doing legitimate business. Overcoming the situation of the system being hacked by creating high-quality code... I can feel that they will always be in a position to anticipate risks and take backup measures so it is worth trusting and this project.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has clearly shown the KPI section, the objects they are targeting are specified and all have professional certification documents from associations and information closely related to challenging key metrics.

This also makes it easier for me to track their progress. the costs are corresponding to the roadmap they give, corresponding to the roadmap they give. however, I wonder if the salary of all employees is included in this. The team involved in the implementation of the proposal are members of many different fields and have experience in areas closely related to the development of the project such as the tasks in the trail map, the sections related to the blockchain, The Chief Innovation Officer is a blockchain and computer science expert who has worked in a leading blockchain information technology company in addition to a Cross team with extensive experience in programming languages and technologies.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The use handy tools to track project creation and milestones so, in my opinion, this would be an easy proposition to measure progress, however, I think they should have a plan to measure the development of the project.

I believe they are ready to work anytime and will do well on this project according to the schedule they mentioned. As for the budget, it would be better if they could allocate the budget on an hourly basis and mention more about the number of employees in each position. They plan to fill a few more positions and have a plan for that. They have made efforts to gather members with deep, multi-disciplinary knowledge and skills that are beneficial to project development and operation.
