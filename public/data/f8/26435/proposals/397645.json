Specifically, in the very first small task of the Impact segment, the description of the proposed solution lacks a host of key factors to determine its efficiency such as features and functionality of the CLEAN Stake Pool, technical components of it, and main operation, and so forth. More importantly, I did not see any subjects mentioned in the proposal, which is essential to the impact of the proposal. I see that these missing factors are listed in the description as to how to address the challenge, including problematic situations, vision, project activities. Therefore, perhaps reorganization in the more proper segments is welcome. Maybe readers can be perplexed whether CLEAN is aiming at who other than what, the word \u201cpeople\u201d needs to be exactly narrowed down regionally or else to provide a specific vision. As for the key metrics, you could clearly figure out which key metrics are aligned with which KPI/ key metrics of the challenge. Despite this, you include some use cases as cooperation with other platforms, which is quite obvious for readers to visualize the outcomes. However, it is encouraged to dissect the final results after finishing off the project. Concerning the foreseen challenges or risks, they are well-prepared with potential solutions and impacts on Cardano ecosystem are mentioned, but a little more information on it will have more influence on readers.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "It is impressive to attach a link of detailed project plan in this section, the plan is well-prepared despite being a draft version, but it can offer readers an overview of your plan by showing duration, individual tasks and due dates. About the roadmap, personally, I think it is quite well-structured and proper, there are timeframes that describe tasks which need to be done, yet at least some interpretation or explanation of these headlines can be added to elucidate each task. Hence, the community, especially the non-expert, can catch up with what you are trying to deliver. About the budget, each headline is presented clearly with estimated expense, but as for me, I believe that if you could attach an estimated budget to smaller task, it can help build your proposal stronger (not necessary to write the exact number). About providing details of your team members required, you did well in this segment, full information of each member, including portfolio, linkedin, etc., giving rise to your proposal feasibility and credibility as what these high-profile people, who specialize in medical health, can massively contribute to it is highly prospective.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Firstly, there are a number of measurements to monitor the proposal progress. These units can be regarded as milestones to know which phase the progress is at, so they need to be inextricably linked to the roadmap mentioned above. It means that listing a number of measurements is not enough to determine if the proposal can be done progressively or not. For example, in the line \u201cNumber of water quality published: Our goal is to record 2000 test results to the blockchain\u201d, what if this goal either could not be achieved, let\u2019s say, under 2000 samples after several months, can this be counted as a success \u2013 meeting the demand of the route? Therefore, your proposal will prove auditability if these key metrics comply with the roadmap, adding predicted timeframes to key metrics as indicators of progress accomplishment is extremely constructive. What\u2019s more, it would be great if you can estimate the number of participants (enough as you may think to have influence on media and the public), so you can keep your plan under control as expected. Concerning how the success for this project looks, it is not obvious enough to meet readers\u2019 demands. For example, can these outcomes be the criteria to assess the final successes you gain or not? These \u201cgrowing\u201d results can be more solid if you can supplement them with clear definitions, interpretation or at least overview. Or are they parts of the whole picture or just it? Hence, from my point, these results can be more persuasive, obvious and influential to others. More importantly, you seem to miss a significant segment of Auditability \u2013 information provision on references or previous information of this project. It is worth noting that there are not any counterparts to make a comparison, all of which is to give rise to the credibility and chance of funding or success if funded.

I can easily identify their capacity by provided references on Linkedin.\nThe roadmap of this proposal is clear and specific identified, easy to track and follow the progress by the website for the community. But the proposal offers an unrealistic timetable to complete the work because there are so many works to do. It will enhance the feasibility if the proposer considers to prolong to at least 6 months for preventing the risk in recruiting developers.\n\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items for auditing but some items is still overall to justify they are reasonable or not to achieve the set goals, such as: Web app development, Smartphone app development, Plutus smart contract development,... I suggest to improve it by calculating engineer working hours. And it's missing a futher scaling plan so I don't know if additional funding is required to implement the proposal after 3 month.\nAbout the technical aspects, I concern how to input testing results from Kit tests into application, manually or automatically. I hope the proposer think about choosing the technology for helping accurary and trusted result of testing and data collecting from smartphone such as: electronic ID Kit test with replacable sensor probes which connected to smartphone directly by wire or indirectly by wireless (could be bluetooth) methods. So it will help to eliminate error or fraud in data inputting, enhancing the confidence for the community.\n\nAbout the community building, I look forward to seeing a marketing plan to outreach to government agencies, universities and organizations in detail about: what advertising campaign, what communication methods, frequency, budget for each promotion periods and so on.\n\nIn general, I neither agree nor disagree the feasibility of this proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "KPIs of the proposal are identified, easily measured and tracked within the first 3 months after it's funded.

A decentralized platform dapp (named CLEAN) for water quality testing and reporting is proposed which will reward participants (via ADA) and empower communities to monitor their water quality, store and disseminate the water quality data via Cardano blockchain. \nThe assessor views this as an excellent idea as a readily available database of water quality, collected by communities, will go a long way into improving living standards. Water quality data is often not available easily, either due to scarce presence of testing in a given area or difficulty is accessing water quality records. Communities will not only benefit in regards to health from the easy availability of such data. Water quality data can also assist and increase productivity for economic activities such as farming and animal husbandry which are highly reliant on water.\nThe proposers have provided an informative list of project activities. The list clearly describes processes from initial procurement of equipment and recruitment of testers, to development of the dapp and method of data validation, establishment of a DAO and minting of Cardano native tokens to reward participation in the program. It is very encouraging that the proposers  are also collaborating with another developer (Orcfax) that is focusing on delivering real word data for use by smart contracts. The collaboration between developers can expand functionality of both CLEAN and Orcfax. It is interesting that the proposers also mentioned that the water quality data system can also assist valuation of property which can be a service that can be monetized and possibly support the further scaling up of the system. \nThe challenges described by the proposers are valid. Indeed there may be parties that may see the information provided by CLEAN to be a threat to their interests. Creating a strong community that benefits from the system can be an answer. The initiative could also be helped by approaching key persons in the government or NGOs that can be sympathetic to the program. The challenge of validating the collected data is also true. The proposers seem to have a solution to this which is enhanced by the collaboration with Orcfax. The third challenge stated is the financing of tests. While ADA rewards can be a good incentive, perhaps the CLEAN program could also provide special services that are payable in addition to the freely available water quality data to support the scale up and maintenance of the program. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have provided a detailed timeline of activities which can also be viewed visually via Gant chart. The proposed activities are reasonable. However, the timeline for the initial phase (purchasing water testing kits, contracting labs, community building, etc) might be too short to achieve good results, unless the activities have already partially been started. The assessors would also advise that community outreach also involve an initial approach to the government as the second phase will involve access to government data. \nThe budget is broken down into three components : \n-\tSoftware development\n-\tAdministration, Management, Community Building\n-\tMaterials, Equipment, Fees, and Expenses\nThe budgets for software development and administration, management, community building are based on estimated work hours and cost per work hour. While a list of activities for each component is provided, the cost of each activity is not described. It would be better if it were. Also, the proposers should clarify which team member is responsible for each component and activity. \nThe proposers currently focus on water test kits for lead and pesticide content. Presence of harmful biologicals such as E. Coli within the water supply should be an important part of water quality testing. Why did the proposers not include this?   \nThe team members themselves have credible backgrounds capable of executing the plan to a degree. However, at the moment there are still open positions in the team for an Atala Prism Developer and Plutus Developer. Nevertheless, the assessor views that timely recruitment of the required members is possible. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers have specified quantifiable metrics for assessing the progress of CLEAN. This includes the number of monitoring participants, quantity of samples collected, number of tests published on the blockchain, number of queries, and the size of the contaminant database. \nIn regards to the number of participants, while the total proposed numbers are reasonable, the proposed demography of the participants is interesting. Why did the proposer choose students, faith based organizations and non-profit organisations to be members? And why were the groups divided evenly? The assessor asks this because the above sections of the proposal did not mention this. \nThe vision for the success of CLEAN involves the presence of a working dapp, growing number of users and communities participating, and growing number of partnerships. How many users? And at what rate of growth?  It would be better if the proposer provided these numbers. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1662", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 7308, "q0": "The idea is very good, it has some positive aspects and others not so much. Simply put, the proposal is based on making testing the purity of water (whether it is contaminated or suitable for use) accessible to everyone. People could test the water, through, as the author of the proposal puts it, \u201cproviding low-cost field test equipment and building a network of third-party labs.\u201d They would build a Dapp, where this information would be stored on the Cardano blockchain. On top of that, whoever did these surveys/analyses would receive tokens as a reward. The author also states that in the future this project may become a DAO. In other words, only advantages for the Cardano ecosystem, countless positive points. However, what worries me is whether this proposal aligns exactly with the objectives of the challenge in which it was launched, since at no time is it emphasized how developing countries and the most disadvantaged populations would be targeted. Even to exemplify how the situation of water quality testing is precarious, the author cites the United States. Shouldn't they aim to promote good among the most needy? This challenge seeks to strengthen nations through improvements in \u201cbasic\u201d sectors, such as health, education, security, identity, etc. Health would be the case here, something of course fundamental. But I believe that if the author gave examples of how economically disadvantaged communities would benefit from this, the objectives of the challenge would be better achieved. How could a person who doesn't even know what blockchain, Cardano, tokens, etc. be part of the project? Would this app be fully accessible to all audiences? That's why I'll give it 3 stars, I think the idea is very good, but it lacked focus on what we're really looking for in this challenge. Perhaps this project could better fit the Dapps challenge, for example. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There is a roadmap here that is divided based on months (30 days - first month, 60 days - second month and 90 days - third month). In these time periods, which activities would be developed are listed. It is a satisfactory way of understanding the process, but it is not exactly complete. We do not know, for example, how long each of these activities would last or who would work on them. Some parts are very well explained, such as the user registration. You can fully understand what things would result in that record and how people would use Dapp. The author also describes what would happen in the future on the part of future deliveries, it would be interesting to have a perspective of how long such things would take to happen (nothing exact, because I find it complicated to be so inflexible, but at least a projection of when the project would unfold). I think here would be a good space to explain how people who have never had contact with the cryptographic world would get to know, understand and use this Dapp. How could these people understand how digital wallets work in the first place? Anyway, the script is present, but it could be more detailed and include more explanations, such as the less educated public's adherence to cryptography. Regarding the budget, 115k are requested. A very high value! So I would like more detail as well. 45k for software development, the author even explains what would be done within this general block of activity, but I would like to know, for example, which professionals would be involved here, what would be the salary of each, how many hours of work they would have in total and how that time would be distributed. Likewise with the other part of the money, the 36k that would go towards various things, for example marketing. What would the strategy be adopted here? About the kits, how much would each cost? How would users go about accessing them? What about the reward token, how much would it be worth? Would it be enough to encourage people to do such an activity? Although there are details about the use of the money, even more would be necessary for us to have security in its use, since it is a very high amount. Regarding the team, there would be a total of 4 people, two of whom are already known: in this case, their presentations are very good, we know their names, roles and a little of what they have done so far, we also have linkedin profiles to prove the information said. However, the other two vacancies: it would be better if we already had selected professionals, since the investment here would be high, it would convey more security. Overall the feasibility is good, it would just need more detail to look great. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "All data presented as process auditability are in relation to numbers. That is, how many monitored water collections, how much data uploaded to the blockchain, how many volunteers, etc. This works for us to understand how big the project is becoming, but I don't think it's enough for us to measure the human impact of the thing. It would be interesting to promote research in the selected areas in order to understand: did this project have a positive impact on the communities? Have people's lives been changed for the good? Did the volunteers receive fair rewards for their work? Did it help needy communities to support themselves better, live healthier? What happens when the analyzed water is unfit for consumption? Is there any kind of water treatment? I believe that the project team itself should promote these more qualitative analyzes and bring the results in a simple and direct way to the Cardano community. This can be done by preparing some reports, containing infographics, etc. It would also be necessary for the community to accompany the development of the project, if the volunteers would be able to understand how to use Dapp, if the steps were being carried out accurately. We know what would happen each month, so it is possible to monitor the development of the situation. Some community members could be responsible for this, and always be in touch with the project team. In general, the author provides us with quantitative data to audit the process, but I believe the analysis here needs to be more human than numerical. Now, speaking of the final results, the qualitative information that I talked about is provided. My question is more about how all this can be objectively monitored, how these consequences would become measurable and how the Cardano community could perceive them. In my view, it is necessary for the team to make this data scalable for us, making this information easy to understand.

Among such skills is experience in training users in health laboratory systems.\n\nThe downside in the plan on how to deliver the solution really seems to be in the total capital being requested, and especially in its distribution. Given the innovative nature of the project and all the technologies and integrations that are required by it, perhaps a better approach would be to direct more efforts to the validation of the concept than to its actual implementation.\n\nOf the $115,000 requested, $45,000 will go towards Software development, ie approximately 40% of the funds. And as described by the authors themselves, this will be a pretty dense idea, involving the purchase of quality test kits and partnerships with local labs. It seems then that given the complexity of the project, more funds should be allocated so that the idea was actually validated, both at a conceptual level and in relation to public adoption, so that so many resources were destined for the actual implementation. In this regard, we realize that the amount allocated to community construction ($36,000) is less than that allocated to development.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Regarding the parameters that were established to measure the possible success of the project, we realized that they are valid and relevant in terms of measuring the scope of use of the application and its adoption. It is interesting to note that very detailed quantitative metrics were established, which measure the use of the tool by people from the most diverse sectors, such as volunteers, school and university students. Also, in relation to the tests that will be carried out on water samples, we also observe a concern of the team in considering different scenarios. In addition, regarding the perception of the project's success, we have taken into account not only the use of the application, but also the growth in the number of users, evidencing the team's attention to the future of the project.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 5, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4382, "q0": "I would like to commend their project presentation, the necessary information listed is quite complete, easy to understand.

The proposal also inspires a list of use cases within the same topic, within the same platform that you could choose to get water quality certification for businesses, schools, restaurants or get environmental training certification as a monitor and I believe that more uses can be achieved.

CLEAN aims to provide a decentralized platform for water quality testing and reporting. People are authorized to sample, test, and submit results on the water quality in their homes and communities. Results are stored on the blockchain. Combine DID and reputation management to ensure data accuracy. When reading about this project, I was like, wow wow... this is such a great one. It will drive the Cardano ecosystem's growth.\nTo address the project's problems, the proposer made valid arguments describing solutions such as reporting water quality in homes and communities as necessary as registering properties for financial capital. They provide data and evidence to prove that people cannot rely solely on centralized government and bureaucracy to protect their water resources.\nHowever, every project undertaken has challenges or risks. In this one, the proposer has outlined three main threats, and the solutions to these risks are particular.

The abundant resources can be considered from high school and university students, who are knowledgeable, accessible, easy to propagate, and rapidly expand the community. The marketing should be optimized to attract more organizations, businesses with voluntary activities, non-profit organizations... The number of water sampling locations should be increased, including industrial parks, high water quality areas, ponds, lakes, residential areas...\nThis is a new project that has never been funded before in Catalyst. I haven't tested it, but based on the proponent's description, I can quickly determine the project's success. Provide a working web and smartphone app with a backend side-chain supporting the decentralized collection of water quality samples; this is completely decentralized, so citizens no longer have to rely on institutions' centralized authority to provide this data. The growing number of volunteers, the increasing base of user proves the rising level of data reliability and people's trust.
