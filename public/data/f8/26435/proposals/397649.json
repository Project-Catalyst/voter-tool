Data is synonymous with knowledge. Good data gives irrefutable evidence, however anecdotal evidence, assumptions, or abstract observation may result in lost resources as a result of acting on an inaccurate conclusion. Data will assist you in explaining (both good and negative) actions to stakeholders. Whether or not your tactics and judgments provide the desired results, you can be certain that you built your strategy based not upon guesses, but good solid data. As a result, this project has the potential to reach a certain segment of the public. It is not just a legacy, but it may also be used for confession, similar to online letters. This is an intriguing concept in theory, but we will need more evidence to establish its impact. The author should clarify on the predicted user metrics, the important KPIs that the project intends to achieve with this application, and the clear effects of the mentioned metrics on the growth of the Cardano ecosystem. When it comes to data, security is the top priority. Another problem in data storage is automatic backup functionality. It is more convenient if we provide backup automatically. Those that do not provide backups, on the other hand, provide users with a safety net in the case of unexpected data loss. How do you intend to address these issues?", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The author makes no mention of the project's practicality. To have high feasibility, the author must have a plan with a clear timeframe for each task that must be done in order to complete the project.

In terms of team members, the author must have a detailed strategy in place to recruit employees, and this proposal must explicitly list team members with the relevant experiences, skills, or qualifications to deliver the intended product.

Although the author's viewpoint on success is intriguing, without specific metrics, reports, or comprehensive plans, everything becomes unrealistic and difficult to achieve the intended objectives.
