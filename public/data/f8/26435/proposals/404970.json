You have described your proposed solution in the most detailed way. The project, yes, has its own target users, namely displaced and homeless ones, and its features are relatively obvious and perspicuous. It seems that they and other people in difficult circumstances could receive much assistance from your project. Introducing your partners is also known as an indicator of a professional working style. The second plus point is that most of your key metrics align reasonably with those of the challenge. But there are some tips I want to give you in this section. With regards to the Dapps impact on social/financial inclusion and economic development, you shouldn\u2019t provide such scant information like that because you know, influences of dApp on social, financial and economic growth are known widespread as crucial factors for these proposals to reflect their possibility of success. For this reason, I believe you should add more information about your project\u2019s impacts to these factors instead of only expressing some words like \u201cVery positive\u201d or \u201cGood\u201d. If you can present how positive these effects can be, it means that your project completely has the ability to tackle the challenge. Finally, concerning the risk that your team could encounter, you said that it\u2019s very low thanks to your previous experience of a successful shared housing application. Obviously, the rate of risk is low, yet it\u2019s not zero, isn\u2019t it? Thus, in my opinion, you should try your best to predict which hindrances your team can get into in the working process concomitantly with the best solutions.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Awesome! Upon reading the introduction of your working team, I find it very detailed, to the fullest extent, and I genuinely believe that with such in-depth working experience in the relevant field, your team is highly regarded to make headway with the project. And even it would be perfect if you can attach LinkedIn links into every introductory part of your core members to demonstrate the authenticity of your words and persuade the voters well. Your requested budget is broken down explicitly and linked with your roadmap, which is presented in a well-organized way. From my viewpoint, I have read many proposals related to this topic, and I was truthfully satisfied by the very detailed way they provide their work plan, including activities within every milestone. I admit without doubt that your proposal provides adequate information about the timeline and goals of the project, but as I said before, if you could name several typical activities in the milestones, the voters will be able to see the transparency in your schedule.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Your success criteria is easy to capture and sticks to the reality, the housing crisis. You manage to figure out the success for this project by giving a specific number of prosperities (100) listed after 3 months of the platform launch. Regarding the methods you use to measure the project development, you were able to come up with some initiatives to assess it, like retrospectives and sprint planning. You declared that the community could measure the project progress based on your milestones, too. However, on the technical side, you failed to let them know which measurement tools they can access to keep track of easily. This is also the most essential content, so please put forward at least one or two tools for the voters to supervise your project thoroughly. Anyway, I wish that your project could flourish and succeed as fast as possible.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1675", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 7457, "q0": "This proposal is extremely necessary and can be very useful for society and also beneficial to expand the Cardano ecosystem. The idea is to create a \u201cone dapp for homeowners to register their properties/properties for housing programs. These programs may include long-established voucher-based housing programs, time-sensitive temporary housing (to serve people displaced due to natural disasters, refugees due to war, etc.), or the common rental market.\u201d That is, a platform that will help people who are experiencing some type of vulnerability to register their homes, while using technologies relevant to the Cardano ecosystem, as the data will be recorded on the blockchain. I believe it is an idea that aligns very well with the proposal, since it will have a very strong humanitarian impact, and this challenge from what I understand is to help promote Dapps that are beneficial for Cardano but also help people from developing nations or those that are experiencing a problem (in this case, whether social, if they are trying to link to affordable housing programs, or environmental, in case they have been affected by natural disasters). Several points are positive here: some bidders already have previous experience with the property registration issue; the project will be developed by the team of the company Loxe Inc., which is extremely skilled in the technical aspect, has already won other financing and they already have projects being executed (such as the Win Win platform) with our blockchain; another positive point is that they have a lot of networking, connections and important partnerships that are certainly a differential to increase the quality level and the future success of the proposal; etc. In other words, I think the proposal makes a lot of sense with the challenge it was submitted to and has a high chance of having a truly positive impact. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the proposal is very good, starting with the script, which activities would be carried out over the months are explained. In this way, it is punctuated in a very exact way how the project development process would be, making it simple for us to understand the steps that would need to be taken. In relation to the budget, the amount requested is high, however it is well explained, it is basically the salaries of the professionals involved. There are a lot of people who would be working on this project, so it's justified because the requested amount is needed. My suggestion for making this part of the proposal even clearer is: it could be better explained how the work routines of those involved would be. Would everyone dedicate themselves full-time, or just part-time, to the project? Would some spend more time working on it than others? I think that if we knew how many hours each one would dedicate to the realization of this Dapp, we would have a more solid understanding of how the money would be used, since we would know the price per hour of work of those involved. Now, speaking of the team, this is the best part of feasibility. We know a lot of information about everyone involved: their names, academic backgrounds, areas of professional activity, so they relate to the Cardano ecosystem (we have experts in Plutus and people who have developed important tools for our community, such as CA and vCA tool, for example). There is a lot of confidence in the team and in its ability to carry out the project successfully. Therefore, I believe that my only suggestion is to add the working hours information from the budget part, this would be an addition to improve what is already good. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "It is possible to follow the project development process based on the steps provided by the roadmap, but it would be interesting for the team involved to make their weekly analyzes (or part of them available to the Cardano community). With this, it would be possible to understand if the small objectives of the smaller time periods were reached, if the established KPIs and goals were being achieved. However, it is not very clear, in my opinion, if this weekly analysis would really be shared, how the Cardano community could have access to this information, how we could safely understand if the tasks were being accomplished at the right time and in the right way. So in my view, even though the team has provided information about the feasibility of the project, it is not so clear how it would reach all of us, requiring a review of this part of the proposal. Regarding the final results, the main objective is to help solve the housing crisis, as the proponents say, and this can be seen by the number of houses registered in Dapp (the goal is 100 properties in 3 months). I believe that as properties are registered, this social benefit will occur as well as the popularization of Cardano, after all, more people will be getting involved with the technologies of our ecosystem, knowing them and understanding their advantages. So my opinion is that the process of auditing the progress could be better detailed and clearer, but the final results part is more tangible and simpler for the community to follow. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2201, "q0": "This proposal is to effectively solve the housing crisis, making renting and leasing easier.

I think this is a great idea since it gives people who do not have a house to live in and solve the housing crisis at the same time. The team also specifically notes the impact of the project and shows how effective it is based on the challenge key\u2019s metrics.

For instance, by what action/ factors can it bring positive impact on the social/ financial inclusion?, etc.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is an already committed team with experience in such activities proposed. However, I suggest the team should provide some reference links for verification purposes (Linkedin, for example). There is also a solid time-framed plan divided into three main phases and noted with specific tasks, which I think is very good. There is a sensible budget breakdown which is clearly broken down into project activities and hours required; and it also matches with the timeline. I strongly agree that this project will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I think you should provide more clear information on which ways you can measure the development of this project.

This is advantageous since the proposer will learn from the predecessors and improve the inadequacies in this area. As a result, rather than focusing just on homeless individuals, this project also includes persons who are only temporarily housed as a result of natural catastrophes or war. This is a wonderfully humane project. The proposer, in particular, underlined the influence of Dapp on financial and economic growth, which perfectly aligns with the challenge's KPI. Overall, everything is good, but I still hope the proposer could specifically state the project's influence on the Cardano ecosystem. Whether it is a rise in the number of individuals engaging in the community or the number of Dapp users.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "From the staff to the implementation plan, and the proposer's way of using the budget, I believe that nothing can stand in the way of the success of this project. First of all, about the team members, they have all worked together and developed a shared housing application as well as a questionnaire app for a large housing service provider in Los Angeles. They will benefit the project much in the future since they understand one other's working ways, know each other's strengths and shortcomings, and comprehend the working attitude. Plus, the project is specifically planned for the last 7 months of 2022, with a series of activities outlined in a very well-ordered layout. Finally, I appreciate that they specify a monthly amount and then multiply it in installments. This makes budget management transparent and assists the team in spending money in the most cost-effective manner possible.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Specific information about the properties is supplied in the successful delegation section. It appears to be brief, but I believe the proposer has mostly satisfied the standards for this section. It should, however, be linked to its influence on the Cardano ecosystem to emphasize that this project is acceptable for development in this community.
