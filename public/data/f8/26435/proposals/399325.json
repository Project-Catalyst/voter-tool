This is not entirely in line with the objectives of the challenge, although it is something that is quite interesting. In the present challenge, from my understanding, we want to fund projects, applications that are beneficial both for Cardano and for some developing community. This includes helping a certain population in the community, whether in the areas of health, education, employment, etc., through of course technologies present in our blockchain, so that both parties benefit: there is social impact and also an expansion of Cardano. In the case of the present proposal, I think that only the second part, that is, improvement of our blockchain, is being targeted. It is not stated in the proposal at any time that this project has any social role, it wants to generate an impact on communities in need from developing countries/localities. I think that if this platform had some kind of investment in the humanitarian sector, then yes, it would be fully aligned with the objectives of this challenge, but the way the project was structured I think it would better fit the Dapps challenge. It is certainly a project that can help the Cardano ecosystem, in this part I have no doubts, as it would connect possible investors, people interested in undertaking and participating in projects, generating products and services that are used within our blockchain, all this would certainly increase investments in Ada, number of digital wallets, transactions on our blockchain and it would be a good way to publicize it (by establishing these new relationships). Therefore, I think it is still a high-value proposition, which could be modified and improved to fully align with the specific objectives of the Nation Building Dapps challenge. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The script part is very good, a monthly schedule of activities is established, where the tasks to be done each month are listed, so that we have a full understanding of the process. I often see in the proposals an explanation of what would be done but not when, and this does not happen here, in this case we also have a temporal notion, which helps us to understand the process as a whole as well as it will help with auditability, as I will comment on analysis topic below. It would be even more interesting if the team determined how long on average each of these activities would take to be developed, but this is just a suggestion for improvement. The level of detail provided on this part of the proposal is already quite satisfactory. Regarding the budget, this part is ok, it is possible to understand how the requested money would be used, the proponent states that more details on this would be provided in case the proposal is actually funded, but I think that as much detail as possible should already have been attached to the proposal. For example, we know the journalist's salary (1200 dollars), but it is not justified why he would receive this amount. I would like to know more about his work routine, how many days a week he would work, for how many hours a day, etc. And about the team, we know who those involved are, having the following information: their names, roles in the project, a small resume of work developed so far (and a way to prove this, such as their linkedin profiles) in addition to something fundamental : how these people relate to the Cardano ecosystem. As an active member, we only have Ot\u00e1vio Lima, I think having a person who is very involved with our blockchain is the minimum that proposals should present (ideally with all participants being active members). In any case, through Ot\u00e1vio's participation, we can guarantee that there is someone qualified to handle the technologies in our ecosystem. The auditability part is almost perfect, with a few more details, as I mentioned, I would give it full marks. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of the project in my opinion is good, but it is not ideal either. We can monitor whether the development process was done properly through the rich detail in the roadmap. It is possible to verify that the tasks that were promised for each month were actually being done at the right time and in the right way. For this, it would be necessary for: either the team itself to gather this data and make it available in a simple and fast way to the Cardano community, or that some members interested in the project could, in a private way, meet with the team at the end of each month to verify the what has been done so far, the gradual results of the project. Regarding the results, I think they indicate the clearest ways to see if the project was successful, which would be the number of investors on its platform, the number of contracts generated, etc., that is, a lot of numerical data. But I believe that we must go further, also making a qualitative analysis of the impact of this project on Cardano, I think that this can be done through the individual follow-up of some projects that were born through the networking generated on this platform. How would they be developing, if they achieved their goals, if they helped to expand Cardano's technologies and took them to people's practical lives, etc. This information should, in my view, be synthesized and forwarded to the proposal team, the leaders of the projects that were born there would contact the leaders of the present project, some of this feedback could be added and with that presented to the Cardano community. That way, we would have a better view of the results of the efforts presented here. In summary, I found a good proposal, auditable, that needs some improvements. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 8, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "We appreciate your comments and feedback on the proposal presented, thank you for seeing value and helping to improve this project even more.

We count on your support in proving this project and, if possible, improving our Catalyst assessment."}, {"q0": "I'm not sure that Nation Building Dapps is the appropriate channel for this project, perhaps Developer Ecosystem challenge.  Regardless, in terms of impact I am familiar with many investor networks and website that specialize in segmentation, but I believe something more focused on Cardano could be more useful for the development and expansion of this particular network.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team, timeline and budget are functional combinations of planning and capability that may lead to a good product.  However a primary concern with an aggregator like this is the data source, i.e. the willingness of investor networks to provide useful information or access to useful information that would make the tool functional to the target community.  Without knowing more about the existing investor and support network outside of Catalyst, this are is difficult to evaluate.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I'm confident that the project proposed will deliver a result that can be easily reviewed, but I would caution the team against putting too much emphasis on metrics like number of investors \"registered\" since they may have to pivot at a later stage to scraping or otherwise aggregating data if they fail to engage enough active users in this space.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1224", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "We really appreciate your comments and ratings, they were great.

In addition, this will certainly help the Cardano ecosystem to grow, be known, and participate in more people. However, I think the author should be more specific about the strong impacts of the project on the participants. The target that the author aims to include newcomers, startups, and potential investors and entrepreneurs, so this will be a place to help investors find potential startups and increase the opportunity to find investors for start-ups. So I think this community will support and interact with each other to create development in the community. with CryptoDemoDay Event, the writer also presented the specifics clearly. Their activities include the concept of the event, the time, and purpose all these increase the effectiveness and success of CryptoDemoDay and increase the cohesion of the community. The risk presented by the proposer is also very real and I also agree with the proposer that creating the Investor Network Community Platform is the optimal solution to this risk.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I highly appreciate the presentation of the proponent. First, the roadmap proposed by the proponent is very specific and clear, and logical. The author clearly divides the tasks that they will perform and the results obtained each month. This will make it easier for everyone to follow and visualize the progress of the proposal. The budget that the proposer presents is also very specific about the costs that they will need to pay during the implementation of the project. This also demonstrates transparency in project implementation. Another factor that demonstrates the feasibility of the project is a team of experienced and skilled professionals. with a head with extensive experience in the founding of many startups. Rich knowledge of the economy, market, technology and will be of great help in building a network of investors. Software engineers start their careers at a young age with a high degree of expertise, thus building a quality foundation. Editors with experience in various fields will help create a platform with content that attracts participants and convinces investors. In addition, the marketing assistant who founded the company, captures and updates market trends, so will create tactics to develop networking.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In this section, the author has not given any specific data to show the implementation progress of the project. To measure the development of the project, the author should add a specific number to help readers easily measure and determine the implementation progress of the project. For example, how many investors will the target call for, what types of investments are included, and are there any core items? In the roadmap section, the proposer mentioned a lot about building websites and platforms, but I have not seen the authors evaluate website success and its specific functions in attracting and calling for investment.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1701", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "I would like to thank you very much for your comments and also for the note 5 in all topics.
