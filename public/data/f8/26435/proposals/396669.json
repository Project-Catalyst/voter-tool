It indicates and provides a solution to the problem raised in this challenge. The proposer gave us some demo product demonstrations, which is highly appreciated. However, the proposer claims that Consenz has been tested and proven effective in a few specific examples but has yet to provide evidence. From sofi.coop, I have only judged that Consenz's interface is well designed and professional, but that is not enough. Also, the critical concept of \"an automatic algorithm that calculates the level of consensus\" has not explicitly been explained. Therefore,  I propose to provide evidence for the adoption of Consenz in Israel and clearly define this algorithm to help the community have a more realistic view of the project.\n\nThe impact is not limited to developing countries but can be applied anywhere globally. I give it a score of 4 for its promised scalability and contribution to the Cardano ecosystem.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Technically speaking, building a web/mobile app platform on a blockchain is highly feasible. However, the proponent only generally says that the project will deal with the \"overflow of comments\" and \"noise\" without offering a specific solution. The proposer should explain how your algorithm will help make proposals, comments, and voting more organized. What evidence, test, or survey proves that the algorithm outperforms the current way of working? Also, how will blockchain be involved in this process?\n\nEconomically, a budget breakdown seems reasonable and well thought out. However, the proponent did not clarify whether the requested amount is for the entire project execution or just for a single \"Build MVP web app\" step. This will significantly impact whether or not the community agrees to fund the proposal. Additionally, it is better to explain more clearly how to earn and use the revenue from partners after using all the capital from Catalyst. Obviously, a model with sustainable development potential will be easier to convince the community.\n\nIn terms of mass adoption, the approach from municipalities and NGOs makes sense, but I suggest considering a community-based approach, too.\n\nTheir members have the necessary knowledge and experience regarding the team. They had participated in funds before and did not give up when failed, which is a positive sign. The current member number may be acceptable in the early stages of development. Still, the team should also plan staffing for the longer future.\n\nIn summary, I give a score of 3.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Success metrics and KPIs are appropriately set and easily auditable. Besides the number of agencies and active users, the number of proposals discussed and approved and user satisfaction are also important indicators that can be added.

It happens in all countries, at all times, although there have been many strong sanctions, but it cannot be completely dealt with. with the idea of \u200b\u200bbringing a web application that can be used for public participation in policy-making, from the urban to the national level. is a very good idea. Here the group raised issues that would reduce corruption by implementing and practicing public participation in decision-making processes. issues are also very well defined that is bringing public scrutiny into voting or policy shaping. I find this idea very suitable for the challenge, this proposal I think can be scaled up to solve future challenges, the solutions given have also been clearly defined that is helping the situation. corruption is reduced, encouraging a new culture of conventional goods management that can ultimately make a lasting impact at the national level. This solution solved the problem of the challenge. but the project has not provided any specific evidence or research.

I hope the team will be able to produce a report with milestones. specific time, with a budget of less than 5% of the total challenge budget and has been broken down into 5 sub-categories. I think such a division is reasonable, but the group needs to have a contingency plan for the case of a lack of budget that needs to be supplemented, with a report on team members.

I see the success of the project in relation to the challenges of the campaign. this is a project that has been studied very carefully and has been presented at many different conferences but the project has not been approved and funded but i think it is very cool, through research I see that the group is very enthusiastic about the project.

The voting system applied as a feature of the application to define the content of sections of a document (as seen in the video) can certainly reduce the noise around decision making. \n\n - on a large scale (a city, a whole country participating and interacting at the same time) it would be necessary to see if the web app can resist.\n\n- I would like to read more extensively about many details and interactions of the application that can be seen in the video: how people can interact with the parts of a document, how they can vote on the definition of the sections of a document, how the final version of the document is defined.\n\n- The big missing element in the proposal is how traffic to the Consenz web app would impact traffic to the Cardano blockchain.  In its current state, the proposal establishes the destination of the volume of activity generated only to Consenz and not to Cardano.\n\n-The time variable is not involved in the description of the Roadmap, so it is difficult to imagine a more precise implementation scheme.\n\nA broader explanation of the related items in the budget is needed.
