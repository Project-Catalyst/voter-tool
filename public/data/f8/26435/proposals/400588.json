This could really ease the entry-barrier for developers. The how it will integrate into Cardano could have been more elaborated in the proposal itself.\nKey-metrics and goals do support the project thesis in alignment with the challenge settings.\nThe foundation for the proposed System is already set, and the attached API promises further growth for the future.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team of Clear Contracts is working with MLabs and has already been funded in previous catalyst rounds. The team also has other (funded) proposals ongoing. The given links are show-casing a landing-page, a demo-CMS, the current status-quo of HIE (Health Information Exchange) in a whitepaper, and explainer videos of how the Hippocrades platform will work as an infrasctructure as a service (iaaS).\nThe core team comprises of one experienced IT-management founder and three technicals. They complement each other as full-stack in frontend, backend, server, and relevant blockchain skills.\nWith a total headcount of 10 and a pool of tech consultants the team should be well prepared to tackle the technical challenges. Above that the team has been working since the last 5 years on digital health care projects.\nBudget and and breakdown on team members are given in an identifiable manner.\nThe budget is reasonable as rates are more calculated like wages. The contrary would be a US/EU consultant day-rate of several hundreds.\nIf the team is continuing to deliver on this round as on the previous rounds. I would highly expect an additional round of funding in F9.\nThe timetable is well structured and set at a modest pace. But this modesty is sourced from the stated drawbacks, as the team suffered from Covid cases during the execution phase.\nImplementation follows a good development cycle-flow lead by agile methods.\nThe resources are focusing on describing the needed man power, running costs for infrastructure are currently not given.\nIf you are reading the whitepaper and know the focus of MLabs, then you could potentially derive the technicals. However, this could be addressed a bit clearer in the proposal and if it is just to make it the technical reading more inconvenient for reader.\nThe team greatly loops back on unforeseen challenges since the last round and now implements a more conservative timeline. However, as progress and growth continue it could be argued that legal constraints should be considered as well.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Problem and the solution are well summarized and at present a great fit for the current challenge to create nation wide solutions for Cardano. One of the biggest challenges Cardano currently faces is the adoption of Haskell and Plutus. The eased onboarding process for developers via the Clarity smart contract framework could have already been mentioned in the summary. The major concerns which should be addressed as early as possible is if and how the team wants to move its infrastructure to a decentralized state. The debate is happening in the whitepaper.\nThe writers clearly state that the team already has experience within the area of digital healthcare, decentralized infrastructures, and Cardano.\nThe baseline for the requested funds is later properly outlined in the roadmap.\nThe proposal provides a seven months roadmap with measurable milestones in months one, three and six.\nThose milestones align very well with the evolution within the challenge to build Cardano into an accessible ecosystem.\nIf I understood it right, Hippocrades is based on the Clarity smart contract framework, thus basing the given metrics on adoption, user activity and retention seem to be the right KPI. Especially the expected increase of open source projects can be a transparent KPI. The proposal lays out that other metrics will be explored.\nTo provide more clarity the proposal could have provided stronger details about the current status-quo of Health Information Exchange in Blockchains. For new readers this would have provided an even stronger foundation for the development thesis and the underlying issues.\nThe proposal is describing a template system that enables developers to upload reusable smart contracts. Everytime one of these smart contracts is getting called, a small fee will be forwarded to the developer. This incentivizes building and open-sourcing projects within the Cardano ecosystem.

As stated by the proposer, Hippocrades is a system that assists local or national governments in swiftly developing and deploying powerful health technology infrastructure in their jurisdictions, including features such as electronic medical records (EMR), clinic management, and pharmacy management systems. This is a strong foundation, in my opinion, that is ideal for the development of a modern hospital management system. The proposal also specifies up to 72 characteristics that the new system will include. That is an incredible figure for a management system. Despite the integration with the Cardano blockchain, I have not yet seen the proposer point out the positive effects of the project on this community.

They have Hippocrades inventors and programmers, therefore developing a new system on this platform is not difficult at all. The proposal specifies that the funding is divided according to each member's salary over a period of 3 to 7 months.
