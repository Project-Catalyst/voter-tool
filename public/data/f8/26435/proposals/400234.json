The initiative primarily focuses on issuing DIDs to residents in Goma, DCR, particularly young people, allowing them to obtain a driver's license or use it for voting. Further, the government intends to utilize Dapp for storage, so if this project is successful, it would undoubtedly bring Cardano a lot of value, such as growing the number of Dapp users or the Goma Cardano Hub gaining notoriety from many people here. Everything, however, is great except for the remedy offered by the proposer. It's not quite obvious yet, and I believe it won't be appropriate to address the issue in the future.

Even how they intend to spend the funds is demonstrated with clarity and appropriation. Moreover, the project will be conducted by a team of reputable and experienced staff. However, I note that the proposer includes marketing charges in the budget breakdown section, but I have not seen anyone on the team who is capable of managing this. If the proposer does not intend to hire extra marketing professionals, they should explain how they intend to spend the $1500, whether through social media or government assistance", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I hope the proposer could include a timeframe for the project's progress.

If people are willing to record in detail, on video, their budget spending process, it is because they really want to honor their commitments.  It may seem a bit over the top (videotaping a purchase, taking it so seriously that it goes so far as to set it to music) but in my world, that's called having all the skin in the game at a level of heat so high that it can incinerate to the bone marrow.
