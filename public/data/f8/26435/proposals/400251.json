I believe Google has been working on something similar called Minespider (https://www.minespider.com/). This could turn out to be a very productive project that could help DRC establish new practices to ensure the mineral resources in their country become local wealth, which is more-or-less exactly what this Challenge is looking for. \n\nHowever, since this is a new issue to so many people, a little more education from the proposers might help strengthen the argument behind its impact statement. The proposers could tell us a little about how mineral tracking works, practically and scientifically, and share a source or two on the subject. Still, this doesn't detract much from the proposal, which describes the issue and their resolution with decent clarity.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The roadmap is well-composed, and includes reasonable goals for this ambitious project.

Due to the smuggling and violence, the small-scale miners in DRC are not getting a fair price and the payment made by the foreign sellers is largely going to the intermediaries. The proposer wants to establish blockchain-based mining traceability in the mining industry in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nBlockchain-based traceability solutions are being explored worldwide in supply chain systems. But Cardano has an extra edge over other blockchains, especially in \u2018supply chain\u2019 related matters. The Cardano blockchain apart from being the best also has 'Atala prism identity solution', which will help in establishing good traceability by utilizing the Atala Prism.  \nThis proposal will have a good influence in DRC as well as in Africa if the proposer can successfully implement and help the small miners and quarry operators in obtaining the maximum benefits.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team appears to have the experience required to develop the software for the proposal. They have a good plan to map quarries, and register/onboard the miners & quarry operators. The team\u2019s skills and experience can be checked on their given LinkedIn profiles but it is skipped for a few members.\nThe roadmap specified in the proposal is on monthly basis with the tasks to be accomplished in those months. I think it will be better if more details are provided and the plan can be broken down into weeks, which will assist in tracking the progress.\nThe provided budget is reasonable and it is broken down into specific tasks to be done. I suggest the tasks be broken down and allotted to the concerned team members who are supposed to do them. Then the fund required by a specific member along with the funds required to acquire the resources can be written beside them. \nThe proposer seems to be aware of the risks and challenges posed by this proposal but I have my skepticism about the onboarding process and violence.

All these can also be tracked for performance evaluation.\nThe delivery dates are provided in months which starts in April post-funding and ends in Aug-2022 with proposal execution.

For the rest, all ideas are carefully considered before recommending this project. With the goal of eradicating mineral smuggling in DCR, the proposal allows small-scale artisanal miners to register at a quarry and will receive a certificate for their work. This not only helps small miners make money but also helps buyers ensure the quality of the product through mineral traceability. Furthermore, the way they approach potential future issues is incredibly sensible and reasonable. Specifically, in the case that the operator wants to move the working place to another, the proposer can also meet. Miners have since remained certified at the new place as well as the application maintaining the number of users. So, just to reiterate what I said previously, the initiative will undoubtedly be praised by specialists.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Having stated that, I don't want to modify or add any specifics in the project's feasibility stage.

For August 2022, the proposer is dedicated to modifying manufacturer DIDs to ensure authentic information, thereby avoiding being cheated or profiting from scammers. To do this, they recruit individuals with master's degrees and graduates from prestigious colleges. One of them, in particular, kicked off the project by gathering crucial information regarding small-scale miners who would be onboarded, demonstrating that with approval, the entire team would be ready to begin the project in no time. Even the spending budget is filled with important information. Perhaps, I wish the proposer could break down specific numbers for each action, although I know this is quite difficult.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Maybe the project will be more complete if the proposer adds a timeline in the measure the progress and the development of the project section.
