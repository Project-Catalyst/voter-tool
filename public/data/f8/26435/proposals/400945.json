It also has a general decentralized marketplace where users can post listings at their own price. The instant swap is only for people who want to sell a property. And for the 10% price depreciation, in order to sell a property instantly, there should be a risk-free incentive for the buyer. If we go less than 10%, then I'm afraid people will not have enough incentive to facilitate instant swap. Apart from instant swap, there are many other features that are required to build nations. Like a decentralised mortgage to finance properties, decentralised insurance, decentralised real estate market place, property management, fractionalization of real estate. Using the fractionalization, users can also run INITIAL PROPERTY OFFERING. There are endless features and deep use cases other than the instant swap.\n\nAs for the feasibility, PropX plans to do token sales in order to receive further funds for Liquidity and Oracles. PropX will have a yield farming program with good incentives to attract liquidity apart from the in house liquidity that will be generated through token sales. There also will be an Oracle Provider Incentive Program, through which data oracles would get attracted and connect the platform to the outside world, in return, they will be incentivized with minimal fees that will be collected for every price evaluation.\n\nAs for the auditability, the project's website and social media pages are just around the horizon.
