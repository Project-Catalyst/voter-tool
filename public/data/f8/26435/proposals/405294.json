The proposer understands the requirements and the expectations of the challenge and has narrated their plan in a simple and understandable manner. The idea to target the African countries and involve the government and other major organizations like African Development Bank gives the proposal more validity and effectiveness. The proposal plans to make the adoption of Crypto across the poor countries faster and also bring in capital for various projects through their platform which in turn will improve the infrastructure and the quality of life of people in these countries. The involvement of huge public entities and community hubs will eventually bring more players into the ecosystem and also a lot of capital which the government alone could not bring, and therefore the development in these countries will revamp.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The fine detailing provided by the proposer regarding their action plan and the plan being stretched over 12 months shows that it is not an overestimated project and the team clearly has plans to continue attracting funds in the upcoming rounds. The 4 monthly road map is a reasonable plan and looks sensible in every way. The Wada team being a recognized catalyst community player and the expertise they carry around their shoulders makes the plan all the more valid and interesting. There lies no doubt in their experience and also the team is aware of the challenges and risks involved in the successful implementation of the project and also seems to know their way around them.  The requested funds of 80k with the breakdown along with it looks practical and necessary considering the 12-month road map the team has in mind. So I would make no reservations in providing 5 stars for the feasibility of the proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer understands the success of the project and has laid out the possible performance indicators that the community can use to track its progress.

The proposer also mentions the success of the project be it the involvement of government entities or the number of individuals onboarded or the ease of use of the product, all are aligned with the challenge.

The current team includes verifiable quality members who have a lot of related experience and capabilities to carry out the project.

The goals that this project aims to achieve will have a direct impact on the Cardano community and accelerate its growth. The strength here is that to be even more specific, the proposal provided details about the platform's features. How the platform works were explained very well.

In terms of personnel, it can be considered as part of the spending budget to pay salaries for employees.\nLooking through the profile of the project management team, these are people with extensive experience in the field.
