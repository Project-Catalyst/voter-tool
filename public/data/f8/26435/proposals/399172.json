They have outlined some basic information about the market share in which they will launch the project \u2013 Cameroon, in my opinion, they should include specific indicators of the survey they have done so that they can go to the conclusion mentioned in the project that Cameroon is a potential market, this information will increase the persuasiveness of the project. They provide case studies to illustrate the main activities of the project. The proposer describes in the project as the technology behind the scenes will be on Cardano and the bounty is distributed in Ada or stable coin.
