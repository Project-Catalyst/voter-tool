We can thus see that the proposal fits the goals of the challenge in question. It is also easy to see the different possibilities of application of this technology in various areas and organizations, as well as the success of this method of deliberation there is a vast field for the Cardano technology to be disseminated.\n\nWe can also see that the project innovates by using AI concepts to solve problems that are inherent to common assemblies, such as the selection of participants. Regarding the size of the project and the steps that were detailed, we see that the requested amount of $40,800 is also consistent.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "For a project of such magnitude, it seems interesting that ways are established to measure the result starting from a smaller scale. We see here one of the great positive points of the proposal, because, despite the complexity and importance of the project, it was not intended to establish a broad commercialization of it or its direct application with large audiences. Instead, a pilot project was established with a smaller group of people to validate its functionality.\n\nIn addition, a fixed cost was established for the hour worked, which facilitated the breakdown of the budget in relation to labor costs, approximately $37,000. Another very positive point of the feasibility proposal is the organization of the steps to complete the project, through two-week sprints using the scrum methodology, which is one of the most used currently for monitoring projects.\n\nIt is also possible to notice a very elaborate website, which explains the project's mission well, including examples that complement the understanding of the proposal. It indicates, for example, the use of this new mode of deliberation to decide how to use the taxes collected in a smart city and the use of this new form of democratic debates to purchase insurance.\n\nAlong with the innovative proposal and the application examples, perhaps the most important thing here is that there really is a public identification with the premises cited by George Zarkadakis in the TED talk; there is a great lack of trust in today's politicians and also in relation to various institutions that have decision-making power; thus, it is possible to notice that this great idea, allied to a great team, has good chances of success.

We realized during the explanation of the project that the way to carry out the validation of this mode of debate will be a pilot test, and here we see that reports of this pilot test will be made. In addition, the commits in bitbucket and the final project report also help to keep a track.\n\nAnother general characteristic of the project is that the participants have a close relationship with technology, some of them even being software developers. Thus, it seems likely that great choices about how to evolve the product will be made, as the parameters for measuring AI performance are certainly also quite accurate.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 4, "ng": 9, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This project is perhaps the best example of dapps in the nation building dapps challenge that I have seen, and a great step towards newgen government and decision-making processes that I have seen so far.

At Voxiberate, they believe that decentralizing the web offers tremendous opportunities for communities around the world to self-organize and create new social and economic value. But for this vision to happen, and for Cardano to be accepted by the wider society, it is necessary to introduce concepts and practices from political science in blockchain governance. They can contribute to this goal by developing a discussion platform based on citizen councils.\nFinally, a plan to communicate from this platform in the Cardano community would be much appreciated.

In the presentation about the team members, I saw that the group had at least five members, who had assigned specific tasks to each member. In terms of degrees, certifications of intellectual property, and experience of each member, I think the motivation of each member is very good. because these are all masters and doctors with a lot of experience in the field. profession.

Also shows the reasons that Citizen Assemblies do are inefficient and expensive, so the author's suggestion becomes more necessary with a more economical but faster and more efficient solution through the use of AI. I also really like the author's presentation style when it comes to listing the jobs that the platform provides and what they want to achieve. The author's wishes are also the common wishes of everyone, especially the vulnerable. However, this is probably an unpredictable outcome.

The target audience or convenient activities are also very clear. so the impact of this project in my opinion is high. They also pointed out the risks as well as how to deal with them.

What is the specific small group of test participants and are there criteria for selecting test participants? I think, adding more detailed execution tasks in each activity will make the process more intuitive. Regarding the budget part, I think it is advisable to specify which departments are involved in the implementation of the project so that it can be easily compared with the implementation plans. I am very impressed by the staff involved in the project who are experts in many fields such as Dr. George Zarkadakis who is a business expert and a marketing expert in the field of technology will make the project development in terms of communication.

If possible, he could offer more useful knowledge to shed light on why Voxiberate deserves to be the key to the problem rather than some main technobables such as AI-powered learning module, incentivisation mechanism and innovative algorithms. Another point to consider is that the proposer described his proposed solution addressing the challenge in a comprehensive and convincing way. For example, the proposer explained how the proposal mission is in line with Cardano\u2019s in terms of society and economics, and the way Voxiberate operates can potentially contribute to the common value of the Cardano ecosystem. As for me, it is very clever to modify their product to adapt the Cardano blockchain, proving its updatability incorporated into the blockchain.

These phases can totally be regarded as milestones and indicators of stage accomplishment, facilitating much in monitoring and accomplishing small tasks by the due dates.
