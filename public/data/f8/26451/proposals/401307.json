It brings up additional insights for the importance of witnesses to a birth, or evidence of a birth, and what we accept as validation of a new human life, outside the life itself.  As a stepping stone for SSI, having such a reference immutably on the blockchain makes it easier to imagine the first identity documents the child may require as being verifiable, so I would have liked to have seen here more information on the trust registry that would be used here to authenticate and make available this record in the DAO, presumably as a DAO membership protocol (would it be regional, as governments are now?  Global for all of humanity?  Hyper-local or family oriented?).  Also, as a nascent SSI initiative, I would have liked to seen more details on what could be issued by the DAO, particularly some sort of concept of Issuing a live birth verified credential.  I suspect that is the idea here (though the proposer does mention issuing paper documents), but it should be made clearer if so.  Additionally there was some confusion around the issuing of passports...I assume they mean copies of passports, or verification of passports, not some sort of VC that originates from the DAO.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "We will need more team information for this for sure, along with the principals of the DAO formation.  Unfortunately it doesn't look like the proposer was able to completely finish the proposal, so there is no timeline to establish the milestones and deliverables, but we can isolate some things like the creation of the DAO and the trust registry associated with validating claims.  The trust registry, in particular would be good to see fleshed out and really thought through.  It doesn't need to be fully defined, but knowing things like which protocols it would ensure (Issuance requirements, such as affidavits or witness testimony, or certification such as birth records etc.), how it would establish membership (is it a membership of issuers, holders, or both?  How are these populations represented in DAO governance?).  The team did manage to get the budget broken down, and a few entries get me thinking about how much more they really needed to describe here.  For example, I pointed out the passport issue above, but they have a budget item for a \"Travel Law Researcher\", which indicates they may have bigger plans for the DAO (and with the travesties regarding displaced peoples, I am all for solutions in this area).  All in all, I would have liked to have seen a lot of the missing information.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "While no detail were included for auditability, there are a number of relevant KPIs that could have been chosen:  number of live births recorded to the DAO, milestones like issuance of governance tokens or institution of the governance framework by the DAO, onboarding of research participants (training expectant families).  For something like this, I highly recommend opensource repos for the governance of the DAO, which makes it both scalable and easy for the community to follow.  As a complete proposal, I think this idea has some real potential, and I encourage the proposer to keep building with an eye on the trust registry/governance framework.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 6, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1633, "q0": "The idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal is to build a certificate of birth identity on the Cardano blockchain through a DAO. A breakthrough idea in identity recognition, which has a huge impact on the way society operates today. Firstly, it will have a huge impact on the paperwork process, eliminating complicated procedures in some countries. There will be no more images of people having to wait in long lines for their turn or running around organizations to get birth certificates. Secondly, it will be very useful to provide the birth certificate (and later other documents such as passport, visa, household registration book, etc.) in a convenient way. This will come in handy for the homeless, who lack the ability to verify their identity at all except for an ID card - it's going to be tough if they lose this card.\nSo the proposal is suitable for the challenge \"Self-Sovereign Identity\" presented.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There will be many reasons we need to discuss here to evaluate the feasibility of the proposal:\n\n1. The recognition of birth certificates on blockchain requires the approval of many countries around the world. This is covered in the risks and challenges section but it is suggested that additional solutions should be added to address this challenge (which I think is very difficult because it belongs to the country level)\n2. How can the witness groups in the DAO remotely certify that the information that users submit to the blockchain is correct or not? This has not been mentioned by the proposer.\n3. In the budget breakdown, most of the budget is used for research and website building => the proposal only stops at the idea, there is no solution to this problem.\n4. roadmap has not been built.
