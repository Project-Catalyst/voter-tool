It is a suggestion for a verification protocol for endorsements.  Think of having your MIT degree on your electronic CV get a nice green \"verified\" badge that anyone can look at to see that MIT has verified this statement as true.  The proposers give other examples of logos, positive statements, etc, but the basic idea is to think of situations where verification of an endorsement might matter, and apply this model, simple.  Where it gets really, really interesting is a particular use situation that the proposer just breezes by like it's no big deal:  the situation where a potential Holder can use the portal to essentially Issue there own certificate, and send it to an Issuer (who doesn't even know they are an Issuer) for Verification...  the whole DID world is upside down!  Cats and dogs living together!  Mayham!  I spent too much time thinking about how the trust registry would work on something like that, what kind of protocol would be in place for the portal to create trusted Issuers, how Holders should have the ability to define at least some aspect of that trust, and for a protocol to recognize the role of a holder as verification of an Issuer, in a reciprocal nature that sees SSI not as separate entities all trying to get along, but as one entity trying to stay true to itself.  I can't say that this humble proposal to verify digital endorsements is a proof that this holistic integration of SSI is possible.  No, that is going too far.  I am saying only that every successful transaction it manages to create using this model is evidence in favor of a proof of that nature, and that it could change the way SSI is used and understood.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "For a two man team, this may end up being too much to take on, and I don't think the proposer did themselves a favor by trying to bridge the gap by providing their pro-bono work.  A happy medium they may be able to pursue (whether funded or not) could be to create the PoC for this first, but not worry about the onboarding of Issuers.  This could essentially put guard rails on the project, create a working model, and then go after more funding to onboard the Issuer cohort (understanding here, that this means instituting the trust registry, not necessarily signing up a bunch of DID wallets, although a protocol should be in place for institutional onboarding).  Having said that, what I would really like to see here is a breakdown of how they plan to approach the trust registry, as that component makes or breaks any SSI implementation, even one for verifying endorsements.  If that model is understandable, then the PoC can deliver that promise in order to secure funding.  Everything else I see here looks like it has been well thought out, with a UI/UX in mind, a general business model to support all 3 portal aspects imagined in this project, and plenty of room at the beginning of the timeline to get protocols designed (again, we need an approach to the trust registry to validate the design intentions).  Using the time waiting for the Atala SDK to zero in on design is a good project management decision, and will probably avoid too much reworking based off the testnet differences.  All in all I think an mvp is deliverable under these conditions.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I think the project is selling themselves short on whether the developer community will care if they opensource later work.  I think their repos will absolutely be of interest to developers working on the intersections of roles in SSI, so I encourage the proposers to commit to making the whole project opensource.  They do note that the early work will absolutely be opensource, as they fork existing repos, so the community will be able to follow along.  They also have set up a blog to post regular updates on.  They correctly note that getting the workflow operational and intuitive is the critical KPI for success here, so focusing progress reports on milestones for its development will be the best measure for completion.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 6, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Feedback to the CA: Thanks for the effort to work and think through our proposal like this! The idea to use the verification not only for endorsements but also for CVs is very interesting. We thought about it briefly while writing, but since this is a tool for public websites, we didn't pursue it. But of course this is an essential use case! E.g. through the integration into PDFs or emails. Technically, it's not that trivial, but there are certainly plenty of interesting use cases. Thanks again! "}, {"q0": "This is proposal adequately summarizes the challenge that the proposer wishes to face, through a short, simple, accurate but crude statement. \"Distinguishing trustworthy websites and projects from shady ones is a challenge - especially in crypto. Fake reviews and BS is everywhere.\" Following this statement a longer, more in depth explanation of the problem is given. This explanation draws readers in through the use of first person perspective \"...we use review systems, trust badges or simply the search rank on the results page of a search engine...\" Then addresses the issue of trust within endorsements directly. \"Often, however, these signs of trust are manipulated, paid for and fabricated by fake reviewers.

If funded and successful this project will add significant value to the Cardano ecosystem and provide new utility and adoption of DID's.

They have also provided a website showing their existing accomplishments towards implementing on this proposal/project. The budget has been discussed carefully within the proposal and seems reasonable. The team has acknowledged and mitigated the risks of the project exceeding the budgeted funds. The deliverables are clearly explained, as well as potential additional work that is outside the scope of this proposal. The team has provided a detailed actionable plan, with dates and milestones. I have given 4 stars, not 5, because as the proposal states: \"Beyond the 9-month plan\nThe project is aimed to be a sustainable long-term business, adding value in the Cardano ecosystem and beyond for crypto nerds as well for the public. However, the approval of the proposal is only the first step for such a venture. With the completion of version 1.0 and the simultaneous development of a business model, the issue of follow-up financing also arises: The team prefers subsequent financing via Catalyst but is open to alternative concepts. \" For this reason, that the full scope and potential of this project may not be funded, I cannot give this proposal 5 stars for feasibility. Additonally there are some unknown risks around the implementation of Atala Prism, and the Atala Prism development, release and roadmap. However, I believe the team has discussed this transparently in the proposal and provided mitigation strategies should additional funding be required. The proposal clearly explains the technical architecture and it is evident that the team has the required skills and knowledge to deliver on this proposal. The proposers have clearly explained some of the risks with this project and provided detailed strategies to overcome these risks.

Additionally the team has committed to providing reports to the Catalyst community in the form of bi-weekly development blogs on their projects website. This proposal receives 4 stars because while it may not be fully auditable by the wider community, the team acknowledges this and makes the following commitment in the proposal: \"We are well aware of the trust put into a funded project like this by the community and are happy to be as transparent as possible. In the end the proposal is all about trust.\" \n\nSome of the KPI's discussed are not easily quantifiable, and are up for interpretation by the community, for example: \n\n\"Success should be measured in three categories:\nCompleteness and degree of polishment: The proposal is not just about 'presenting verified credentials on a webpage', but the workflow and easiness to complete that feat. Is everything well-presented and can be understood by someone with no deeper technical understanding of Atala PRISM and Cardano? Does the process result in the expected presentation of the VCs? Are the presented credentials indeed correct and up to date?\nUsage inside the community: Are there enough projects onboarding and using the project? Is there talk in the community about the benefits and is there a steadily growing number of Holders and Issuers? How is the trajectory looking for projects outside from Cardano?\nDoes it benefit someone? Are there metrics that show increased trust and therefore growth for their projects that are using the cryptographically signed endorsements. It's definitely hard to track on a general basis, but a good indicator is surely the usage of the project itself and reviews of participating users.\" \n\nDue to the above discussion, I have rated 4 stars because I believe the team is attempting to provide as much detail and direction as possible for the community to be aware of the development progress, however not everything can easily be turned into a specific quantifiable metric.  One suggestion I would have for the proposing team, is to attempt to add quantifiable goals to the outcome of this proposal. For example, instead of writing \"Are there enough projects onboarding and using the project?\" consider using quantifiable targets such as; we aim to onboard 50 projects within 6 months to this platform.

Ideally the whole system should be open-source so that multiple parties can run instances of this reputation protocol (removing the need to trust one centralized entity that operates the system). We have seen in other web3 applications (such as NFTs) that centralization with a few players is a major risk. Reputation is one where realization of the web3 vision particularly requires this problem to be avoided. Because of the need to articulate a clearer vision on decentralization, I have rated this proposal 4 rather than 5 on impact. (Making the proposed protocol open-source does not need to undermine the business model for the service being provided -- e.g. my company is currently building a successful business based upon open-source software, and many others have done so.)\n\nI also believe that it might be simpler to deliver all of the functions of the proposal in a single portal (we are currently doing this with a different authentication application using Atala PRISM).

This is a crucial metric, and it will be difficult to assess without identifying initial test use cases that will be measured. The proposal properly suggests a very flexible protocol that can be used for a wide variety of reputation applications. But implementation/rollout will benefit from focus on particular use cases, and therefore the proposal would benefit from defining initial use cases and proposing quantitative metrics associated with them.
