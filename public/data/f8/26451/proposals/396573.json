The proposal asks for funds to attend SSI meetings on behalf of the Cardano SSI community, make SSI ecosystem aware of Cardano SSI (PRISM) and have influence the specs that are currently being written and evolving.\nThe proposal also produce written summaries from the meetings and blogs which is a fear payback to the community.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "RootID has a good track record and resource has relevant experience as they have attended these meetings in the past. The proposal is clearly budgeted for the 13 weeks time line. \nEven though I give this proposal top rating this time around, there are some recommended changes to receive top rating in later funding rounds if and when a similar proposal is submitted (as I encourage you to do!)\n\nSome constructive critique:\nWork with the risks section. The risks identified are vague. All proposals have the inherent risk for not receiving funds, but the mitigation doesn't say how this particular proposal will go forward if funds are not received. Will this proposal get attention from you if your other proposals are funded? If not, I do not see how funding of your other projects will mitigate the risk in this proposal.\n\n$900 (10%) of the proposal budget is for updating RootID roadmap. Please keep RootID roadmaps outside of the project scope and keep RootID work separated from the efforts you do for the community. Even if you are part of the RootID team and will use the acquired data in your rootID roadmap, remember that you in this proposal is representing Cardano SSI community in the SSI meetings. RootID work should be put in RootID proposals.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal gives clear insight into what the funds are used for and what will be delivered back to the community.

Education is still the most important aspect of SSI for the Cardano community to be involved in, and there is SO MUCH TO LEARN.  Think of this proposal as the establishment of an Embassy in a far off land where we send the RootsID team to be the ambassadors of Cardano, and when they return, they are loaded with the secrets of gunpowder, the wheel and the semiconductor.  The knowledge they come back with can change the world of Catalyst and Cardano.  Right now, the focus is on a working Identity wallet, but that simple goal belies the incredible complexity of what to leave in, what to leave out, how to approach privacy, how to define trust, how to respect the human who holds the wallet, how to represent them fairly and securely with SSI, and leave no room for bad actors to attack or manipulate them through that opportunity.  Sometimes the issues faced are frustatingly philosophical, sometimes they are painfully technical, but it is something that takes a lot of careful thought and inspiration to get through.  The facts of this proposal are that there are numerous working groups that are actively parsing these deep questions from ToIP and Hyperledger and DIF and others, and that is a table we want to be sitting at.  RootsID has already been invited to the table and contributed to the progress, and this funding will give them the resources and incentive to work this knowledge up into a vlog (video) that both keeps us up to date with the state of SSI, but also archives their progress in an opensource way on solving the problems the entire Cardano SSI ecosystem is facing, which includes every proposer in either of these challenge settings.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The hard part is already done, which is establishing a network of informative working groups that feed inspiration and solutions into the Cardano SSI space.  Now the question is whether they can accurately transfer the progress from those conversations to a vlog for the community's consumption.  My only worry is that they might try and dumb it down too much for us, which I suppose is a forgivable transgression, as this SSI stuff can get out-of-hand complex if you let it.  But hopefully they let us have it, good and hard.  They have kept this part of the overall SSI project pretty simple:  attend meetings, make vlogs about the meetings, put out vlogs to the public with some post-production, probably for slides and demos and stuff like that.  All in all they figure on 84 hours of work, and they have squeezed the budget for this in under $10k, which is a key consideration, when you figure they are working on a large multi-proposal funding round, and they have to be careful about losing a piece of funding on the margins, like this one.  The included roadmap from their site helps keep the multiple  threads of the project in order and you can see how close they are getting to having this DID wallet ready for us.  Let's not lose sight of how important things like this proposal are, where education and resources like ToIP are firmly on our side.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The included roadmap has all of the meetings laid out clearly (we could even attend if we wanted) so following their progress shouldn't be an issue.  They intend to release all the vlogs in three places, including youtube, so we should have no trouble getting access to the deliverables.  Finally, any demos or SSI related code that they create during this time will be opensource in GitHub, which is a part of the SSI philosophy that they are staying true to. This funding should cover the course of 13 weeks, and at that point, the hope is that they are delivering an SSI wallet to Catalyst (maybe for the first community credentials!!).", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 5, "ng": 11, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6276, "q0": "There is no question that RootsID is addressing this challenge and that it is contributing to disseminate Catalyst, Atala Prism, or Cardano.

The proposed solution is mainly based on attending working group meetings, when the problem that they point out is the lack of \"open source identity project contributing to SSI standards\". Once one reads all the proposal, it's possible to understand the real goal and the problem framing, but still, making the proposal more cohesive would help voters to analyze it accordingly. It's worth nothing that the video contributed a lot to make the proposal more clear.\n\nIn terms of auditability, the proposal has clear deliverables and the proposers will keep track of their milestones (meetings attended). There's a roadmap and the proposers know exactly which meetings they will be in.

This ties very closely to the goal of the challenge.\n\nHowever, I have two concerns with the proposal. First, participation in these groups needs to be a multi-year effort, and the proposal only addresses participation for a 13-week period. It may be that the proposers will seek additional funding to take this forward, but if that is the plan there should be more information on it.\n\nSecond, I would have expected more specificity on which groups are the intended focus and who will attend which groups (or at least a process for figuring out how to do that). There is a link to a list of groups, but it is not linked to a participation plan.\n\nSo I agree but do not strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. I believe that I am well-positioned to assess this because I have been involved in identity issues for 20+ years, and have founded a business that is proposing identity-related solutions using Atala PRISM in the Accelerate Decentralized Identity challenge (funded in F6 and F7, proposing in F8).", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers of this team are leaders in the Cardano identity community, with existing experience representing Cardano in SSI working groups.

However, given the lack of specificity on who will attend which group (see Impact assessment), the auditing will be somewhat arbitrary -- i.e. just meeting the goal of attending 40 hours of groups is straightforward, but doing so in an organized way is also crucial (and there do not seem to be KPIs to assess the latter).", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_495", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7880, "q0": "Projects related to technology development at the foundation layer are the biggest challenge of the entire cardano network.
