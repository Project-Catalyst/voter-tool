I'll focus on what I think are the best SSI benefits, however I will note that this has massive chain-wide (and possibly cross-chain) implications.  The biggest may be the onboarding of the many DID wallets necessary to execute this idea, and how the trust registry will be set up.  In particular, who do they imagine as the issuers of these DIDs?  Obviously, for the PoC (they consider it as an mvp, but it seems to me that what they rollout, while it may still be able to add functionality, will most certainly be able to be adopted by others out of the box) WAYA intends to sort of create a \"lab\" where they can onboard and institute the protocols, but even in this instance they will need to collaborate with exiting businesses.  Do they see the businesses as the issuers or WAYA?  While it may be easier (and more lucrative, and I have no problem with that) to have WAYA be the issuer, the real scalability to be had here is if businesses can onboard as issuers (more on that in feasibility).  In that instance I would like to see how they plan on approaching governance protocols to onboard these issuers as well as the holders, as well as the frameworks that could make such protocols interoperative.  True SSI makes this possible, and in the process guarantees the privacy and sovereignty of these workers, which the project has rightly placed as a centerpiece of their value system.  There is much more to talk about (the possibility of company governance scrip (employee DAO?), or of rep systems (say goodbye to the Peter Principle), or the whole idea of owning your labor the way a company owns its business (fahgeddaboutit!!), but I leave it to dear reader to let their imagination run wild (and check out the WAYA whitepaper, you won't regret it).", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Its a shame that this project lowered its ask to in order to ensure it was competitive in this challenge, as I would have liked to have seen this idea go head-to-head with the top ideas in the category --in my mind it is in the running.  But it has made itself more palatable with the mvp ask (I still don't see any real reduction of scope here), and I appreciate that it is part of a larger suite of ideas looking to be implemented under the WAYA name, including an ISPO, so I think they should realize some network benefits that can bridge the gap where needed.   The timeline describes the setup and implementation of the equivalent of a lab experiment, with the steps lined out in a logical progression.  They anticipate a few of the issues that jumped out to me, like privacy (critical!!) and just the ossified nature of the legacy status-quo (they are approaching businesses differently than workers, with tailored presentations).  I would have liked to have seen more details on the tech stack here:  are they using a community wallet, building their own, do they envision a single portal for both B2B and B2C, or do they want to really dig deep into SSI and let the workers \"own\" the credentials and rep (if they don't do the latter, then I would be onboard with calling this an mvp).  They presented plenty of links and information on their team, and overall I would say this is a crew that not only is united in their passion over this idea, but well qualified and prepared to pursue it.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They have included a robust number of success metrics, but it would be helpful to see them isolate more of the progress metrics for the development.  This shouldn't be a problem however, as they indicate this is a fully opensource project, so we should be able to follow along with their github commits.  I really want to leave a note here as well that opensourcing this project is a fantastic decision, and a longterm trend to track is the forking of this code, or the pulls of people able to implement industry or region specific protocols that strengthen the whole affair (not to mention the possibilities in spinning up DAOs to address issues in peaceful, impactful ways.

For example, will there be some kind of app that connects them to the Cardano blockchain infrastructure, and if so how will this link to the retail experience? \n\nThe proposal makes various references to privacy issues, but does not explain how these will be addressed as a practical matter. It seems to be suggested that all of this private data will be stored on chain, which is not efficient and does not permit later removal or alteration of data.\n\nIt would be desirable to start this effort with a pilot, and the proposal suggests that it will do so, but there is no information on what the pilot would involve.\n\nFor reasons like these, I agree but do not strongly agree that the proposal effectively addresses the challenge.
