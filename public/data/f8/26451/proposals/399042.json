The problem?  One of the hottest crypto regions of the world, \"CryptoValley\" in Switzerland, is beginning to look into SSI initiatives, and Cardano's PRISM solution isn't being suggested.  The solution?  Suggest it!!  Allison presents a compelling case, with lots of attending evidence, for how influential the CryptoValley can be on blockchain related projects, and leaves the reader with a real sense of FOMO if Cardano doesn't have a seat at the table when SSI is being explored.  Further, she presents loads of information on her connections and qualifications in both communities (CryptoValley and Cardano) that will allow her to seed the idea of PRISM in the most fertile area of Switzerland.  While this kind of outreach is bound to bear fruit, the voter must consider the value yielded vs the rest of the challenge, and in the big picture.  What measureable impact can we expect?  I have no doubt about her qualifications to deliver what she proposes, but if the message is heard...then what?  She has presented a case for Swiss influence on blockchain, and history of decentralized governance, but is this about citizen SSI, business SSI...what result are we expecting for PRISM and Cardano?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This is a well designed outreach program with all the necessary components in place:  existing relationships in the spaces to be leveraged, a gregarious and engaging personality, a bridge with deep knowledge of both communities and experience with presenting the material.  In addition, Allison is engaged in multiple projects in the SSI space, so her interest and education is very focused right now, making her an ideal candidate to be engaging others.  I appreciated her including presentations she has already done that will be models for how whe will be presenting the SSI content.  She is a great speaker!  While she intends to present this material at least three times, what I like the most is that she is committed to joining (or forming?) a working group to hash some relevant topic in the space.  This kind of peer-engagement is the best shot at creating something persistent beyond the outreach campaign, as it could iterate itself to keep the dialogue present, or it could spin-off a project or two.  This is the aspect to watch the closest, IMO, and I would have liked to seen a few more details about whether this was an existing working group she was targeting, and what they might be approaching (a government ID wallet?  An internal business community rep system?) or if she intended to organize a group (beyond the ones she is already involved in) and what the issue it was working on was.  All in all this is a well organized approach and the ideal person to execute it.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For the deliverables suggested, 3 live presentations (can we get the documentation for them?  I expect they will make an excellent opensource document for others who wish to present the same information) and documentation from the efforts of the working group (she suggests \"if possible\" a nod to privacy or security requirements, but I would imagine that some version of Chatham House Rules can be implented in most cases to allow for the community to audit the workshop), this should be an effort that the community will be able to effectively measure the progress of.  And while these deliverables are certainly a measure of success, what I would really like to see is a measure of the impact this could have.  Are any of the companies or entities she intending to approach working on something particularly interesting or popular?  Is there any initative for SSI adoption in the region that is especially compelling or imminent?  These are the things that could provide an impact metric, something we could anticipate as a fruit of the labors invested here.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 8, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "I loved how the proponent defends her idea and her argument, right at the beginning, through links that prove the premise that several countries are already adopting the system of decentralized identities. It claims that there is a location in Switzerland called \u201cCrypto Valley\u201d, and that it \u201cserves as one of the most prominent global powerhouses for blockchain activity\u201d. She still argues by means of numbers (how many companies, for example, the local contains, that dialogue with the technologies of the cryptographic world) how interesting it is for Cardano to invest there. I really think that this context is perfect for what we are looking for in the challenge, the author goes on to argue how decentralized identities are a topic of interest and investment in this region of Switzerland, in which even local political actors are mobilized to promote greater knowledge among the population about this technology; this is a very fertile context for the wide acceptance and adoption of Atala Prism DIDs, as mentioned here, the population is already open to this technology and interested in learning about its various use cases. The self-sovereign identity is not something unknown there, but it needs to be further boosted, so that it is fully understood and adopted by a large mass. This disclosure would be made directly by the bidder, it would disclose what Atala Prism is, the differentials of Cardano's decentralized identity compared to other blockchains, and this would be done \"by joining relevant organizations, participating in working groups, giving lectures on SSI in general and promoting the advantages and benefits of Cardano and Atala PRISM technology\u201d. I think that this proposal meets exactly the specific objectives in this challenge, as the proposer would probably address the topics of \u201cparticipation and adoption growth, portability, usability and accessibility, security, regulation, business models\u201d among others, as described exactly in explaining the challenge. Therefore, I think that this proposal is totally in line with the challenge, it is extremely relevant, the proposer argues very well why this location in Switzerland is strategic to be financed, it explains very well how the current situation is and what it will do to expand knowledge about Cardano there. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal script is ok, the proposer tells us well about what will happen and also in which months (although it would be better in my opinion if she had divided the months individually and not in pairs). I would like more details about the activities that will be developed, some of them don't need further explanation like \u201csign up and join DIDAS, CVVC and potentially the nascent TrustSquare Blockchain community\u201d; however, others deserved more details, for example: \u201ccontact the organizers to provide lectures or participate in working groups\u201d - how will this contact be established? How do you ensure that event organizers make room for her talks, how do you ensure that they pay attention to this project? It would be interesting for the proponent to inform a little about how she would initially present her idea, in order for it to gain space in the desired context. In \u201cPrepare standard presentation on SSI and Atala PRISM\u201d, the proponent could have informed us which topics she will address within these themes, in what order and why, and for example, if some lectures would be directed to a more beginner audience and others to a more experienced audience; how the lectures would be structured, for example, how long does she plan to present the aforementioned contents in an expository way, whether there would be question and answer sessions; it would also be interesting to know how she would captivate listeners to keep in touch, in case they need further clarification if they come to create DIDs; how this target audience will be captivated to become active members of the Cardano community... Anyway, the activities could have been explained more at length, in my opinion, the way the script is presented to us we have a general idea, but not so deep, of what it's coming. Now talking about the financing, 7 thousand dollars are requested, which are divided into some parts, these parts are very well explained. My only suggestion would be for the bidder to let us know what time is planned to be spent on each of the parties, for example in \u201ctime spent creating a standard SSI presentation - $1,500\u201d and \u201ctime spent attending meetings and group activities of work - $2,000\u201d. In order for us to ascertain whether the asking price is fair, I would like to know how many hours she plans to dedicate to each of these things. Finally, speaking of the proposer, I would like to begin by extolling the fact that she is a woman; we have few women in our community, let alone proposing on Catalyst and taking charge of something so significant and important to Cardano. Allison Fromm gives us a rich and extensive description of who she is, what she has done so far, what her area of \u200b\u200bprofessional practice is, how she relates to the Cardano ecosystem (in many ways! she is very active and important to our blockchain, having been involved since the first Catalyst fund), she also makes her linkedin profile available where we can check all the information said. Therefore, I think the feasibility is great, I have full confidence in Alisson's preparation to successfully carry out this project, and although the other parts could be more detailed, we have a solid idea of \u200b\u200bwhat would be done and for how much investment as well. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I think the metrics chosen to monitor progress are quite satisfactory. In the parts where the bidder states that it will provide recordings of its presentations, links to the materials generated from the working group, dates and details of the presentations: I think that this data should indeed be provided, I don't understand why it couldn't be. In case event organizers do not allow the recording of a meeting, the proponent could inform the agenda of subjects that would be addressed, as well as other feedback about the day of the presentation, for example, what was the public's reaction, if they were interested in learn more about Cardano and, if so, through which technologies will be inserted into our ecosystem (in addition to the DIDs, which will be the central issue, of course). I think the proponent could also prepare reports talking a little about the pre-production process of the project, how it was to generate the materials, if she created videos, slides, designs, how was her study routine and preparation to address these complex issues of simple form. Now, focusing on the end results, the proponent claims that success would be \u201cthe Swiss blockchain community and the Swiss SSI community become familiar with Atala PRISM and explore the use of Cardano technology for their use cases\u201d. Indeed, this is the main goal, but through what measurable data can this be realized? It would be important for the proponent to carry out a study that objectively points out how Crypto Valley companies started to relate to Cardano after his lectures; which companies she managed to reach; what has changed in their inner workings; how many new DIDs were generated from this initiative; whether the increase in the purchase and delegation of Ada in that country was observed; which other Cardano technologies started to be adopted (if, for example, companies started to carry out transactions through smart contracts minted on our blockchain). It would be important for this entire study to be scored in a simple way and presented to members of the Cardano community; I think the most appropriate way would be through a video presentation, during a Town Hall, or that it be recorded, posted on youtube and disseminated on one of the community's communication channels. Therefore, the auditability is good, but it could still be a little more explored, in my opinion. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The challenge specifically asks for projects participating in SSI discussions, working groups. Doing presentations to attract adopters to Cardano SSI is a great example and fits the challenge perfectly. The proposal will focus the attention in Switzerland, which is crypto friendly country. This might seem too small or narrow scope, but I would disagree to this. We can't always start with every country at once. If this proposal turns out to be successful, similar clone proposals for other countries may result in the future and in this way we will get global footprint for Cardano SSI with time.
