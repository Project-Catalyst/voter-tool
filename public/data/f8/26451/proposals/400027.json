The diversion of support and aid has long been a critical blocker to increased opportunity and awareness as a certain level of opacity is enforced by the status quo.  For such an arena, blockchain is an ideal ally, and for establishing that critical root of trust, Cardano is the champion.  This proposal is a continuation of Direct-Ed's previous ideation and teambuilding work, and the progress there shows here.  Specifically, this proposal seeks to fund the part of the project that deals with SSI --DID wallets and implementation of issuance and verification on the backend.  These DIDs are linked to smart contracts which allow donors to contribute (In crypto for now, specifically ADA) to highschools of their choice (and the team should consider a contract that allow alumni to fund scholarships for their university rather than picking a highschool), and when students of those schools are verified to have met the terms of the contract, scholarship funds are disbursed.  This mvp version of the program is impactful in its own right, but an adjustment that allows granularity beyond the high school to the specific student (not for the smartcontract, which should be no more granular than a highschool or region, but for the output of the smart contract, to tie it to specific DIDs) would leverage the program marketing.  For example, you generally donate to a highschool, but once someone qualified under that smart contract, you were given a basic profile of the student with some idea of whether they were able to succeed because of your help (this profile is ideal for the SSI solution they seek, as it could allow certain parameters to be visible to the NFT holder, but hide others, and it would be transported in an end-to-end encrypted way.  This could be a HUGE selling point, especially with later scaling to onboard employers looking for employees, as they could have a \"seed-to-sale\" approach to their donations).  All in all there is much that can be said about this program, all positive.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal makes utterly clear not only the teams approach to this SSI implementation but how it interlocks with current and past proposals, including avoiding overlap of funds while introducing mitigation techniques for having certain components not funded (though for a fully funded proposal, they are leaning on Catalyst at this point.  What isn't funded now, will need to be approached again in Fund9).  One area I was concerned with as I read about their planned rollout was how difficult it can be to have a solid development rollout in SSI...have they considered DIDcomm implementation, the need for many of the key modules like presentation exchanges, do they know how to roll out a wallet mvp that has the sockets to absorb later SSI protocols as they are standardized?  It is a real minefield in SSI.  But I see that on their (extensive and well assembled ) team they have Rodolfo Miranda which takes a weight off my mind.  As a principal of the RootsID team, a Catalyst-born (much like Direct-Ed) initiative to create a full SSI opensource platform on did:prism, this is a great addition and a perfect partnership, especially if later Catalyst projects are able to work in this space as well.  Finally, the budget is reasonable for an SSI mvp (especially given that they may be using an integration of RootsWallet, and not building out a platform on their own), and is heavily weighted to the development side.  I would like to see the trust registry for this project in explicit detail, but they have included the relevant components to integrate into it (onboarding the schools as issuers, and the process of credentialing) and it is understandable that they will want the smartcontract V2.0 to play a big part in what the trust registry is able to include.  I'll consider both under development and filed under deliverables for the project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team has a fantastic Notions setup that is basically tracking the contents of all of their progress reports, which makes me wish every project had one.  They have listed commits to Github which is always a way to maintain transparency, and the timeline had plenty of solid milestones with several key deliverables to keep progress on track.
