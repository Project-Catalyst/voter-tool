The problem and solution statements are written as asked. Voters will find the Impact statement clear and concise\u2013\u2013the highest achievement for the design of any proposal aside from funding itself.\n \nIt should be stated that this CA has a background in SSI environments and is well versed with Atala PRISM. Thus, my experience means I\u2019m qualified to be duly impressed by the work the team has done thus far. They met in the Plutus Pioneer program and accomplished 2 separate funded projects (that are all part of RootsWallet\u2013\u2013the product they are still perfecting with this proposal) over the past 2 funded rounds. The further development with the RootsWallet (who\u2019s growth is truly organic in nature, around the work of others in the space that they have wisely used as a way of understanding their own path forward) is an actual value add for the Cardano ecosystem as it gives real life to the SSI environment on its Sidetree nodes.\n\nAt the risk of redundancy, it should be said that the work of this proposal is undoubtedly designed to build a foundation for further scaling. Thus, preparing RootsWallet to meet tomorrow\u2019s challenges through the work of making it interoperable.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan is thorough and uses a proven method (Agile methodology) that the team is well familiar with. One team member will execute the total 76 hours of work (at a rate of $100/hour\u2013\u2013fair for the field). His experience and capacity are well documented in the proposal, leaving no doubt of his capabilities (added to that is his proven track record from work on past funded rounds). Contingencies are already planned (an actual \u201cplan b\u201d and \u201cplan c\u201d) in case they are not able to do the work alone. Because of this, the potential for success seems highly likely, and both the timetable and budget reflect clear, well-thought-out details that satisfies the rigor of this CA.\n\nThe plan shows what work will be done and precisely how that will take place in its \u201chigh-level scope of each activity\u2026\u201d section in Feasibility. Further, all resources necessary are accounted for (essentially the funding and the alternative plans for completion if necessary).\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap is well laid, and the time horizon for the 6-week project is thoughtfully planned.

In particular this is the continued development of an interoperability protocol, in the form of straight software development, so that something like HyperledgerIndy can interoperate with PRISM (specifically the did:ada call method).  Interoperability is not only key to Cardano adoption going forward, but critical to the overall opensource framework within which SSI must function.  Linux Foundation's Indy is the leader in the space, so this kind of connection is critical, especially if one takes into account the potential opportunities arising from DIDcomm (another project integration the RootsID team is pursuing) and the ability to have peer to peer relationships across platforms.  This specific piece of software is meant to bring together multiple operations, including the existing wallet code and the cardano sidetree plugin.

The proposer notes the only real risk as a possible shortage of time, or competing projects, but with the timeline for this so clearly outlined and the backing of the team behind RootsID (plus the ability to pull more cohorts from fellow graduates of the AtalaPRISMPioneeers course) I have no doubt that this project can be fit into the schedule.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This is an opensource project being fully implemented in Github, so the ability to create issues (community tracking and concerns) monitor the project planning kanban (auditing oversight) and to see the total commits and completed repos (deliverables) gives high confidence that this project can stay on track.
