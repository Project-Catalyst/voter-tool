The idea of a platform where verified users audit \"digital news sources and contents\" in exchange for reputation that builds up to a verified credential sounds like it might work.  My first question is what incentive do these verified users have to do this work?  The implication from the proposal seems to be threefold: 1) the chance to be issued a DID, 2) accrual of a reputation that leads to a badge that could be used elsewhere to signal the persons interests, accomplishments and 3) people already want to do this work, they just need a platform to do it on.  These answers bring up a number of questions not answered in the proposal that amount to layer upon layer of difficulties that just keep piling up.  The SSI as membership to the platform has grand implications, around requirements for membership or revocation, around how a rep system can be accrued to the DID, what the root of trust is to establish what is allowed on the site and what isn't, what the implications are of such limits or of a wild west.  The idea is thoughtful, but it isn't well thought out.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "This is the area where the proposal struggles the most.  There is no mention of a trust registry to establish how DIDs are issued, or of the role of such a registry in issuing a rep based credential.  The robustness of the incentive system is an afterthought, even though it is probably the most critical  element to this ever getting off the ground.  The very large issue of what is in and out of bounds content wise isn't defined, and under the terms that are presented, it is only limited, initially, to content of interest to Catalyst Community.  Even this scope is far too wide, as they could potentially be interested in anything, in almost any language.  The attempt to capture swarm intelligence for the purpose of news curation, without incentives beyond badges and flairs sounds more like reddit than Cardano.  Fixing this with SSI seems to be a non-starter as well....the integration of a holder wallet (PRISM) for the member, and the platform level integration of a CLI type wallet is a big project...with no real description of what is required.  The proposer suggest that the development and atala integration will be the easier part, but without any links to their qualifications or skills, it is hard to agree, because a DID implementation is much easier said than done.  Additionally, while the budget is heavy to development, that is only because the proposer is declining to apply for funds for marketing, project management, or community building (the part the proposer feels will be the hardest, yet no budget for it).  The proposer, of course, can provide all these services pro-bono, but it wouldn't be wise, and is more likely to lead to the failure of the project for want of enough funding.  All in all, the execution of the idea needs significant tightening up in order to find out if it can reach its potential.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer establishes that they will begin the work in a private repo, but opensource what they can, which is a good sign, but not very committal.  For finalization, they suggest a number of KPIs to measure the success of the project, but what we really need to see are some milestones on a roadmap.  The general description on the project is as close as we get, and it isn't really in order or tied to a timeline, so I found it difficult to effectively parse how they see the workflow of the technology stack going, or how it could be tracked.  Github, even a private repo has plenty of tools for this that can be reported, including kanban boards for establishing a map of the work and a workspace for organizing everything and assigning tasks.  Additionally a tool like sprint burndown will help to not only track the work for themselves, but it provides a %complete metric which is good for those parts of the project that don't fit well into monthly reports with clear beginnings and ends.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 5, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Impact / Alignment\nThe scope presented here is for the MVP with the clearly defined functionalities narrowed down to the basics. \nRegarding the specific questions:\na) How a reputation system can be accrued to the DID? - Verifiable credentials related functionality fully covers this item\nb) What is allowed on the site and what isn't? - This is usually defined and controlled by the site\u2019s user interface\nc) What the implications are of such limits? - Once the MVP is implemented it will be clear the strong and the week points of the app. Any observed strong limitations will imply quick fixes or possibly bigger developments in the future.\n\nFeasibility\nThe scope of the proposal is the MVP of a news, content management site powered by SSI.

Communities usually follow a model where early adopters get an advantage regarding the clout they generate compared to late arrivals. The reputation model designed for the tool has a few extra features. In addition to the date of registration in the community and the activity performed by the user, reputation is defined by other criteria (which will be transparent to all members) such as availability, amount of data entered, participation in the forums, diversity of sources entered and analysed, among others, plus new criteria and features developed as the platform matures. Finally, the reputation of community members will not simply be cumulative. Users who have acquired high reputations only will keep them if they remain active constantly. Even early adopters may see their credit expire after periods of inactivity or red flags from other users.\n\nFeasibility\nBreaking down the question:\nPM and marketing costs: the initial development and management will be done by a small team, already with the availability agreed, so no further costs are predicted. Marketing will be limited to social media activity because the application core-audience will be within the Catalyst community, heavily relying on the individual networks within the community.

We must have in mind that this is an MVP, not the application in all its maturity, because the potential to evolve is massive.\u00a0\nReliability measurements: the definition of reliability is the key to the process, but at the same time, the term can be interpreted in so many ways. There is a clear plan to that. The starting point relates to usage, mostly, because it is the low-hanging fruit, and can be easily measured without much controversy. In time, however, new ways to measure become available. The reliability patterns won\u2019t be given - they will be built over by the community input. As more data is processed by the app, more resources will be available to increase the accuracy of the output for users. In the media industry, reliability (or quality) has always been a slippery subject because it involves a great deal of opinion. However, if one observes the \u201cbehaviours\u201d generated by usage, solid patterns emerge, with strong, transparent and comprehensible explanations backing it. We have a clear set of concepts to apply when defining these patterns, but we need to have the data first, or we run the risk of confirmation bias.\nIn a nutshell: reliability KPIs start from basic ones (quantitative usage like popularity and upvotes) and evolve to patterns that can be extracted from larger datasets."}, {"id": 4645, "q0": "With so much news items published everyday (more than 200 per day by major news platforms each) and people constantly accusing of faking the news, it is crucial that the data published, by any source, is scrutinized.

The use of SSI would just be to issue (1) membership confirmation and (2) reputation scores. While the first makes sense, I do not understand why an SSI credential is needed for a reputation score.
