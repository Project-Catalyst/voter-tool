I did not see this one coming, but it is a really intriquing idea.  First off, there are two elements to the proposal.  The first is a sort of research/education/brainstorming phase, the second is what they describe as a game to be developed, but which I would describe as the \"gameification\" of a learning protocol they intend to discover in the first phase.  There is a lot to unpack here, so I will try to be brief.  The suggestion here is that in every conversation about Self-Sovereign Identity there tends to be a lot of discussion about how we obtain a formalization of what we mean by \"self-sovereign\", but that we often take for granted what we mean by \"identity\".  How inclusive and decentralized can a paradigm be if it fails to include those who might think of identity differently than is typical in the western world?  There is a real question in SSI about delimiting roles and framing access to the information contained in an SSI, but how might we rethink these questions if we see some of the roles without clear beginnings and ends?  I don't want to get too philosphical, so I will try (badly, you've been warned) to craft an example.  A common concern for crypto users is how to handle their assets if they were to die.  With SSI, you actually can complicate this issue more than help.  If you tie that SSI to a wallet, than, like not having a \"will\", the assets will be immutably locked up (and not even the .gov can step in to save it).  You could create a protocol (will) for that situation, but what if you were a young person and were not prepared for that contingency?  What if the underlying protocol actually took something like that into account?  What if it recognized the connection you had to people around you, whether your family or your colleagues or your peers?  What if the assets, rather than being related to you, as an individual ID, were instead a reflection of your values and relationships?  In practice, it may just look like crypto keys transferring seamlessly between members, but the \"why\" behind it is where the interest lies.  Regardless of where someone may fall on the issue, it seems clear to me that this is a conversation with merit.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "First, to address the dialogue around Identity, it seems that the team is well prepared to have that conversation.  They are both well versed in the Cardano blockchain, and through previously funded work it is clear they have a deep interest in this question of Identity, especially as it relates to the deeper more profound implications on defining people and culture.  It also seems to me that this is a conversation that the African Tradition has been systematically left out of, historically.  We know for sure that they have not been included in the economic or political versions of the dialogue, so it is hard to pass up the opportunity, at a party they are welcome contributors to, to take advantage of the moment.  They seem not only well suited, but well timed to open this idea up.  I do wonder if one of the results of that will be the discovery that SSI, fundamentally makes allowances for the idea of individually or collectively constructed identity paradigms (as I suspect it does), and that what we might think of as unsympathetic protocols are really just one way of executing them, that in the end it could be tolerant of many approaches.  However this does not mean that the discovery process here is without value.  The plan for the dialogues is straightforward, and the budget is also clear on that point.  About half of the budget is for the gameification of the learning protocol, over $14k, which is actually low for a game.  But as a gameification (and by this I mean adding game concepts to a learning environment:  leveling up, map exploration, scripted events, etc) it is much more reasonable.  There are platforms for rolling out simple environments with custom scripts, and the presence of three developers on the team means that they could probably execute those with no problem and within the time allotted.  But the real product is going to be what that learning environment is about, which is the subject of the dialogue.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As a series of presentations, the audit requirements should be easy to meet and the metrics included should cover it.  I would like to see interest tracked over time on this one, i.e. over the course of the 12 or so meetings they intend to hold, how much interest is being generated and is it picking up steam.  Sometimes the \"High Concept\" can pull early participation out of curiosity but fail to hold the attention of a community, and I am very curious about what kinds of emergent discovery a topic like this could create.  I think that could best be captured by a metric that sees interest growing over time.  In terms of the game, they really don't cover it much in the roadmap (another sign that they aren't really thinking about it like a traditional game development idea), but it seems they envision it being built out and opensourced with commits in parallel with the presentations, and then I suppose at some point the dialogue in the presentations will have evolved enough for the game environment to accept scripts based on it.  Those weekly commits will be the only clues about the game development the community has, and I expect they will hit a dry spell somewhere between setting up the dev.environment and completing the presentations.  But with the rest of the project in parallel development, they should still be able to keep regular progress reports rolling in.

The stated goal of the proposal aims at \"an interactive platform incorporating a unique journey to discover our real self through African lenses with a gaming component\", but there is very little information about what the platform or the gaming component would involve.
