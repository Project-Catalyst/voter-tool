I appreciated the proposer giving such a good breakdown of both the problem and the history of the problem, and the included links helped a lot.  On thing that I found that wasn't mentioned by the proposer was that East Africa has 5 of the top 20 nations (and Ethiopia is in the top 5) in the world for coffee production, so this is definitely a high impact opportunity.  The idea here is not the usual blockchain route of a seed-to-sale tracking protocol (though they have plans for one of those in the future).  Instead they intend to create a paradigm where they essentially credential the middlemen in order to start driving out the waste that makes their prices uncompetitive in the world markets and which makes the smallholders vulnerable to large interests.  There are issues with this that I will discuss in feasibility, but on the surface it is a fantastic idea, the equivalent of patching a leaky boat (with implications for the \"leaks\" in the economy caused by farmers who's interests do not align with the sustainability of the industry, more on that later, too).  Other issues involve things like currency stability and financing, but I will leave you, dear ADA-holding reader, to consider those on your own.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "They have assembled a good team with general knowledge of SSI and Atala, but my suggestion is that what they are building here is going to require more than PRISM Pioneers, and they may want to approach IOG's Professional Services department for help on the Atala integration.  The budget looks robust enough to absorb any Atala overhead they haven't considered and it is heavy to development, so I have confidence they can get the product rolled out under this timeline and budget.  However, the biggest piece of this puzzle (of any DID puzzle) is the trust registry of the issuing body, and I didn't see any mention of this here.  The trust registry (and the governance framework behind it) are the key to the adoption of the credentials that they seek to bestow, because it is the protocol which gives authenticity (and thus authority) to the credential.  First, they have to define the issuer, in this case the farmers or someone representing them (ideally this is a DAO of coffee farmers with robust governance defining membership, voting rights, requirements to validate a coffee buyer (the middlemen in this example) and governed processes, including the issuance of credentials and possibly even price setting protocols).  All the members (or the representative organization or the DAO) will have an Issuer ID.  The credentials they issue don't even need to be held by the coffee buyers (they can be offchain) because they are defining a protocol by which to be selective as a group of who they sell to.  By using DIDs and a trust registry, the terms are transparent and thus incentivized to be fair and equitable across parties.  It is in the best interests of the coffee buyers to not only seek this credential but to participate in its governance (a source of maintenance revenue for the trust registry), thus making it more and more robust over time.  Capture is prevented by the structure of the trust registry (like smartcontracts, registries should be audited for errors that lead to corruption).  In this way the middlemen become critical infrastructure to the farmers, and a relationship of equals can begin to be realized, which is the root of fair economic transactions.  With a good description of a trust registry, this project becomes an easy to imagine success story.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team has a good vision that starts in the right lace with gathering a consensus from enough farmers to deliver a working mvp for this project.  That might be a hard to report goal in progress but it is a critical milestone for the realization of success.  Once they get into the development, things get much easier to track as the are maintaining an opensource repo where activity and commits can be tracked.  Worth noting that opensource is another critical piece of the infrastructure as there is no reason that this project couldn't be developing alongside, and leading, other industry adoption.  At 3 months to testnet I fully expect blockers on a total 5 month timeline, but this project could certainly fit into that, and a 6 month timeline would be totally reasonable for a working version onboarding users.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 9, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 6423, "q0": "The issue being African coffee farmers and producers aren't reaping benefits as much as middlemen and end users when it comes to coffee production. which in turn making African Coffee growers poor and disenfranchised. The proposer wants to build a SSI tool that will be helpful to estimate quality of the middleman and also the provides a opportunity for the framers to choose who buys their coffee and at what price. This proposal does address the problem and tries to resolve it. This will help to increase the adoption of Atala PRISM and Cardano hence adding value to the Cardano ecosystem. The milestones do align with the challenges and the proposer has given a clear idea on what are the problems and also how this proposal will be effective in resolving those issue.

The budget asked for looks expensive in this developer cost looks good but other expenses seems bit expensive to reach the set goals.

The problem statement is not specific to the challenge, but they are using SSI as the core solution, so it fits well.  They are looking to restore fairness in pricing for farmers and producers of East African coffee by using a rating system for the middlemen that are based on Atala PRISM integration.   The proposal gives an in-depth background of East African coffee, so we quickly get an idea of the market size and complexity.  The proposal lists several risks and challenges that may be encountered. However, it does not detail any mitigation strategies for these risks.  This section of the proposal could be greatly improved by showing how these risks would be overcome.  For example, Inexperienced Atala Prism Pioneers is listed as a risk.  Potential mitigation could be that more experienced Atala PRISM developers will be sought out for mentoring.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal details the team members' backgrounds.  This could be improved by including their linked-in profiles.  The team has a good mix of relevant business backgrounds and related technical experience.  The plan includes deliverables and a 5 month timeline.  This could be greatly improved by including more of the specific tasks and their individual timelines and related dependencies.  The budget breakdown appears too simplistic and doesn\u2019t instill a lot of confidence in the way it is written.  For example, the first entry: 1 month Atala Prism Pioneers 20000.  It's not clear what this means.  Is this 20K for completing the Atala Prism Pioneer program or 20K to be paid to Atala Prism pioneers?  If the latter then it would be an improvement to understand in more detail what they would be doing.  There is an entry in the timeline for Code the SSI tool prototype, but if 20K is going towards that, it would be good to understand the individual tasks involved.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability section of the proposal needs improvement.  For example, it's unclear how the Orbit model relates to auditability.  Also, more defined KPIs need to be included so progress and success can be measured.

It seeks to add a level of transparency and a sense of accountability by implementing a rating system for middlemen that can be used by coffee farmers. The way to do this is using SSI technology, giving remote farmers. a more direct access to the supply chain. In that sense, this proposal fits well within this challenge and addresses a specific problem to be solved.\n\nWith the growing centralization of big companies like Starbucks and the economies of scale, local producers are faced with very harsh choices, leading to a reduction in their numbers which ultimately hurts everyone in the long run.
