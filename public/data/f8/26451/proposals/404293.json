I am looking at a bootstrapped, bottom-up SSI architecture for a DAO to defeat Sybil attacks, but I'm not seeing where the scope of the project is defined.  The budget makes it look like a full SSI implementation, with DIDcomm enabled wallets and the ability to recognize other SSI  DIDs and incorporate them, etc., but the buildout on the plan looks like a basic implementation of a DAO membership represented by a DID with a zero-knowledge proof of life....So I am left without a clear sense of what it is the project is seeking to build with these funds.  After digging through one of the proposer's previously funded ($94,900) proposals, which is also a Sybil Defense project for these DAOs, I can't see anything that differentiates the two outside of wanting to add the term SSI to the project.  In principle, much of what was being asked for was already a basic SSI protocol, just undefined.  Similarly, what is being asked for here is also not pinned down.  There is no mention of Atala for the wallets (and the proposer has another Atala proposal in this Fund, also trying to establish DIDs), no mention of a trust registry from which to base these proof of life credentials, basically none of the landmarks I look for when parsing an SSI rollout are presented here.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "A fellow traveler of the lack of clarity for what is being sought here in this proposal, is an approach to certain concepts that doesn't make sense to me.  For example, $30,000 is being budgeted for a cryptographer for 6 months for the zeroknowledge proofs, but no explanation for why they wouldn't just use the many opensource ZKP repositories with loads of different signatures, capabilities and libraries (just one example but very robust, from HyperledgerINDY and Sovrin: https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa ) these are designed for SSI and being used everyday for functionality that sounds to me like exactly what the proposer is asking for.  If there is some reason for a proprietary or unique solution, it wasn't made clear in the proposal.  Then the rest of the proposal, for the SSI buildout which is usually the lion's share of an identity platform, due to the wallets and the required comm protocols (many of which are currently getting design standards introduced, which makes their implementation slow or expensive), comes in at less than a quarter of the full spend.  Again, not saying that there isn't a smart contract ready to rollout already (though one isn't mentioned in the proposal) but this is an approach that is just not familiar to me in the SSI space.  I think more sense could be made of it if there was a description of the work to be completed from the previous Sybil proposal, and then the creation of some specific SSI component build outs (and a reasonable and clarified approach to the ZKPs), so that the way everything fit together was made clear, and doubling up funds was avoided.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I give high marks to this proposer for always making all the projects under his umbrella opensource.  Not only is it a nod to the community, but it really makes tracking and reporting progress much easier.  There is a portion of the budget devoted to audit, which, with the requirements for the trust registry and the smart contract playing together, let alone on-chain, is a wise move.  That should also turn up some good reportable metrics, including getting fixes in on the way to 100%.  I would have liked to have seen a discussion of the trust registry that involved some auditable points, as it is impossible to run  a secure VC or DID scheme without it.  It may have been part of the smartcontract protocol, and if so, it would be good to clarify that.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "The Impact assessment has a number of incorrect statements, starting with \"After digging through one of the proposer's previously funded ($94,900) proposals, which is also a Sybil Defense project for these DAOs, I can't see anything that differentiates the two outside of wanting to add the term SSI to the project.\" The previous Sybil Defense proposal was NOT funded and as stated in the proposal while they both seek to address the same root issue there are substantial differences between the two. Namely, the previous proposal sought to port over a replica of the existing Ethereum open source Proof of Humanity solution while the new proposal seeks to develop a completely new solution that better matches the DAO-NET requirements. The CA's lack of understanding of this difference carries over into the Feasiblity assessment where they do not understand the requirement for the cryptography developer due to this same misunderstanding. The CA cites the lack of mentioning Atala as well, although the this challenge does not have a requirement for using Atala Prism and given that Atala does not have a built in method protecting from Sybil attacks therefore it is not necessarily beneficial in this instance. The CA mentions another DAO-NET proposal to use Atala which is true however this proposal is designed to be independent of that proposal in that if the Atala proposal is not funded then this proposal could proceed using Shelley addresses instead of DIDs as the basis for accounts. "}, {"id": 933, "q0": "The proposal name is poorly chosen as it prioritizes branding of the multi-proposal team over clarity what the proposal is about. The problem statements hints that SSI needs zero-knowledge proofs to function, the proposal name introduces the name of the team colon sybil defense by ZKP, and the detailed impact statement reveals that the suite of products by the team for DAOs would require ZKP. This creates some confusion. Atala PRISM or some other existing solution for many SSI applications and use cases would not benefit very much from the proposal, but it seems to solve problems by prospective customers of the team's other proposals (9 in total) or future proposals by the team for DAOs. This defeats the purpose of the SSI challenge brief, as most other proposals of the team are in other challenges, and does not advance the adoption of Cardano for self sovereign identity.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The group of proposers has submitted 10 proposals in Fund-8 across a very wide range of specializations. They do not seem to have a deep understanding of any of these areas, and instead make a business plan assuming suitable talent can be hired, in this case a cryptography expert for zero-knowledge proofs in SSI applications. To allow for this, the budget requested is relatively high, which makes sense as apparently there are no contacts yet with possible talent. \nThe website link provided with the proposal is a placeholder, and looks unsuitable for the serious subject that is likely to be rolled out to governments, academic institutions and other institutions that might benefit from SSI solutions on Cardano. Despite the use of DAO for the team, the proposals and the repo, there is no information given about an actual DAO so this seems to be for branding only.\nGiven the lack of specialization and low display of being passionate about what they are building or want to devote their time to, I think that this project is not likely to be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "4 possible criteria for assessing the success of the proposal are presented, but they are vague. For example:\n\"Relevant software successfully pass security audits from a credible third party.\"\nIt would have helped the auditability of the proposal if relevant and credible would have elaborated on more. At least there are metrics to assess the proposal by, this is not too bad, but without multiple milestones and corresponding targets, controlling distribution of funding over time would not be possible for this project and we would need to pay the yet to be hired core team members regardless of the successful implementation along earlier milestones.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1243", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "The Impact assessment is biased, essentially stating that since the proposed solution solves DAO-NET's challenges and not the challenges of other existing solutions that this proposal does not align with the challenge brief. First off, DAO-NET is part of the Cardano ecosystem and is explicitly working on governance solutions within Cardano. The Challenge brief clearly indicates success as \"partnering with ecosystem, governance and working groups\" which would include DAO-NET. The proposal is also open sourced making all the work done available to the rest of the community in alignment with the challenge brief. Finally the proposal explicitly aligns with the Security and Zero Knowledge Proofs aspects identified in the challenge."}, {"id": 5113, "q0": "The proposal adresses the issue of self-sovereign identity head on; by proposing research into a ZKP for self sovereign identity it certainly aims to position Cardano at the forefront of self sovereign identity implementations. Sybil attacks are problematic particularly for one-person, one vote scenarios and DAO\u2019s where people can adopt various on-chain identities and act maliciously or nefariously. This thus also has important applications for governance, while also potentially addressing issues of privacy if identity can be verified by an oracle or third party without needing to reveal one\u2019s actual identity. Developing further ideas in the SSI space is particularly important for Cardano, given that a lot of development has already been happening on other chains, for instance there is a Proof of Humanity registry on Ethereum which allow users to uniquely link their address to their real world identity. This is however not really privacy preserving and potentially vulnerable to bots, so a ZKP approach would be pioneering new and ground-breaking work.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The main challenge is outlined by the proposers themselves; zero knowledge programs are not yet very mature and it is hard to find competent cryptographers and researchers. The timeline is ambitious, but if someone with the right development and zero knowledge proof skills can be onboarded as a cryptographer, it seems feasible to the reviewer. Both team members demonstrate experience in the relevant areas with several decades of IT management and consultancy and several years of software development experience, as well as familiarity with Cardano and Plutus. The only worry is that full auditing and testing may take longer than two months, particularly given the technical complexity of the desired product which aims to combine a self-sovereign identity credential framework with zero knowledge proofs and that more time may be needed until the product has matured and can safely be launched on main-net. Hiring more Plutus developers, should be no problem, particularly given that one of the team members is a well networked VCA.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The project seems vera auditable due to its transparency and clarity. The code is open-source and progress is tracked rigorously on GitHub which makes the entire idea very auditable. The proposers have laid out very clearly defined criteria for success and have included a third party audit, which given what is trying to be done, is an important stepping metric guaranteeing the legitimacy and security of the proposed framework. The only suggestion the reviewer would add is to actually test this framework\u2019s resilience against Sybil attacks, one could for example have a small bounty for logging on and verifying credentials for several accounts as the same individual or one could simulate a Sybil attack. Some explicitly outlined collaborations would also be useful, but I\u2019m sure the proposers have some ideas in mind, as to whom to collaborate with for testing their ZKP identity framework.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1860", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Research an open source zero knowledge proof to protect against Sybil attacks.", "experience": "DAO Coders Inc is an experienced team of Blockchain developers, Plutus pioneers, Veteran Community Advisors and Solutions Analysts that was incorporated after previous round funding for several DAO-NET suite proposals."}
