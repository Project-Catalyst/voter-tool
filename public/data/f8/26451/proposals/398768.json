It's about creating an issuer in the ecosystem of decentralized identities, with the goal of generally having a verified credential that can be part of the customer's knowledge process (as proponents abbreviate it, KYC). The justification for the problem is that customers currently have to provide their data many times, and the creation of this technology would generate a recyclable KYC credential, that is, one that can be shown to several companies; another advantage in developing this platform would be that this credential can be proof that they have gone through a verification process. In other words, the proponents gather a series of current problems (having to prove our identity several times, and also the lack of security for both companies and customers about the said information) and claim that all this will be solved with the creation of this credential. To my understanding, it would be a kind of extension of the Atala Prism DIDs. I found something that can revolutionize the way customers and companies relate, generating more practicality and security throughout the process, however, two things could be better clarified, in my opinion. First, I would like to know more specific features of these credentials. We know that in it, various information about customers would be minted. But which ones? What kind of personal and financial data would be made available? How would customers allow what data to be provided? What would the process of \u201ccreating\u201d these credentials for the client look like? It is not very clear how this relationship would take place, once the technology was ready for use, how customers would configure it, that is, how the verification process would be carried out that would result in the recyclable credential, which would be presented several times for different companies and services. Another question I had was whether this project will integrate with the Atala Prism DIDs, we know that the two technologies will be linked, but in my view the proponents could have explained this issue better, in a language accessible to everyone. I think so, the proposal aligns well with the objectives of the challenge, because in it we are looking for ways to democratize, promote, make it more accessible, in short, increase the use cases of decentralized identities coined on our blockchain, and I'm sure that the usage suggested here would be very useful and positive for both customers, businesses and the Cardano ecosystem. If the doubts that I commented were better clarified, I would give the maximum grade to this topic of the proposal, but still, it is satisfactory. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "We know the total duration of the activities to be performed (14 weeks), which are divided into two groups: business tasks and technical tasks. The proponents explain what actions would have to be taken in each of these groups, for example in the business tasks there would have to be a search for candidates for service providers, a contract and service would have to be negotiated and so on. The estimated duration for these tasks is four weeks. I think that the way the script was presented to us is very logical and simple to understand, my only suggestion is that within these groups the estimated time for each of these tasks was defined. This is not strictly necessary, but it would help to deepen our understanding of the whole. How long would it take bidders to search for service provider candidates? How would this research be carried out, would it be online, probably, how would the authors of the proposal present their idea so that partnerships could be established, contracts would be defined? I think the script is good, being able to be a little more detailed regarding what would be done and also how long each thing would last. Speaking of the budget, the total amount of 26 thousand dollars (approximately) is well explained, we know which parts it would be divided into and most of these parts are very detailed. For example, in \u201c60 hours of commercial work at a rate of $100/h: $6,000\u201d, we know the amount charged per hour of work (I found this to be high, but it is up to the proposal readers to decide what to do). think), this budget topic is quite understandable. But already in the \u201cPurchase of initial licenses for tests and demonstrations: US$ 2,500 (minimum estimated commitment)\u201d, the proponents could have explained better what initial licenses are these, how much they are, why they are needed, what they would do in this project and etc. That is, some parts are more understandable than others, I would like the same level of detail to be presented for all. About the team, this part is average, because we don't have much information about Deryck Lance and Patrick Rivenbank; we only know their names and linkedin profiles, it would be necessary for the bidders to attach a small resume of them, in order to understand more about their careers and previous experiences, and also if they have any kind of relationship with the Cardano ecosystem. As for Rodolfo Miranda, we know a lot of information, his linkedin, what he does professionally and how he is situated within our community (he is an extremely active person, by the way). It would be perfect if the same explanations were provided for the other two team members. Finally, I think that the feasibility is very high, just needing a few points of deepening, but even so, it deserves the maximum grade. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Apparently, the proponents are very well prepared and have planned to audit the process in various ways. They claim that they will use the Agile methodology (based on the tools provided by github) to monitor the progress of activities. I think it would be important that they had defined and exemplified how this methodology works, I personally don't know it, and I believe that other CAs and readers of the proposal will not know it either, so we couldn't have a complete understanding of what this way would be like to follow the succession of steps. They also say that progress would be tracked by github issues (how would that be visible to the Cardano community?), that they would make reports (how often, will these also be made available to community members?). They also claim that they will view the Kanban board; once again, it would be positive if they had explained better what this framework is like, what tool it is, how it works and what its objectives are for every project. It would also be interesting if they explained a little better about sprint burndown, used as a way to measure progress through sprint percentages (what exactly are sprints?). That is, I trust that they have objective and efficient ways to audit the development process, but they are explained in a very technical language, in which people who do not know the technologies and tools used will not be able to fully understand what will be done. Turning now to the final results, this part is explained in a very abstract way, the proponents claim that \u201cthe success of the project is the launch of the Proof of Concept system that will allow us to show demonstrations and KYC verification tests with credential issuance\u201d. However, we already know this goal since the impact, it would be necessary for them to explain measurable ways of realizing if this was achieved and how it was achieved. Are these credentials really being used by customers as expected? Has this changed the process of purchasing services and products, making it safer and simpler for both end consumers and companies? How can we see in a proven way what the consequences of this project were for Cardano? The Atala Prism DIDs were popularized, did more people get to know and use this technology, thus meeting the specific objectives of the challenge? To summarize my opinion about the auditability of this project, I would say that the first part is great (audit of the partial results), but the second is still very abstract, as there are no direct ways of perceiving the success scenario. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 655, "q0": "There are two aspects to this proposal:  the first is that it is meant to deliver a proof of concept, so it is focused on researching and iterating the buildout of its solution, but only delivery of a single functioning case is required to be completed.  The second is the content of that PoC, which is creating the \"holy grail\" of business-side KYC compliance:  the \"reusable KYC\".  The team does a good job of describing the issue, KYC costs add up and are a frustrating redundant activity for both the business and the customer.  Where I start to lose confidence is in the idea that DIDs or SSI can function as the fix for this...  What I believe this PoC will be able to deliver is a technical ability to issue a DID that can represent a KYC verification protocol.  That is good, right?  Not if that protocol doesn't lead to true reusability and user privacy and control of data.  The issues facing DID-KYC integration have little to do with technical implementation of DIDs and more to do with the privacy, data and reuseabilty issues inherent in any kind of KYC transaction.  SSI doesn't fix KYC, it eliminates the need for it.  Adding DIDs to KYC does nothing to address the issues around needing to assign liability for keeping the underlying documents up to date, of addressing trust protocols regarding who has the original documentation (Hint: it is SUPPOSED to be you), and of storing the copies of the original documents (what 3rd party servers have been introduced by this solution?).  Adding DIDs to KYC just adds another level of complexity to an already burdensome problem, and this \"second-handing\" of credentials begs the question: why are we introducing yet another middleman between us and our data?  I have no doubt that some company can come into this space with some half-truth it has discovered about DID-KYC reusability, and make a little money.  But it doesn't end well.  Let's use SSI to get that information off of servers, onto our personal devices, locked behind ZKP, and communicated securely via peer to peer channels whenever possible.  Forget about KYC.  When this team successfully delivers this Proof of Concept, I fully believe they will come to the same conclusion: it was never worth proving.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The makeup of the team couldn't be better, with experience on the DID side, the KYC side and the project management side.  Despite not agreeing with the approach to the problem, I absolutely believe the team is qualified to deliver a client side integration of a RootsID DID implementation.  The robust timeline and tech buildout support that notion, and they have apportioned enough resources in the budget (very heavy to the development side, around 3 to 1) to get this done.  At a little over 3 months, it is kind of a tight window, but they are only trying to get a single operating case up and running.  It is worth noting here, that they go out of their way to note they are not trying to establish a use case, but rather a PoC...it is a subtle distinction, but I appreciate it.  The goal isn't to show that the company they onboard (it sounds to me like that company is ready to get under contract for this, you may read that part differently) is an ideal scenario for the idea, only that the idea can be done (for better or worse.)", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The development side of the project looks pretty tight, and has excellent auditability, via github and %complete metrics from sprint burndown.  Final delivery is, of course, easy to measure, as it is straightfoward PoC that can be used to show the process of issuing a KYC-credential.  I have a small issue with the first business phase of the project, as it doesn't seem measurable outside of onboarding their test case.  Because it is only a one month phase, that means one report to continue funding, but it would be nice to see some more KPIs for this part of the project...but I get that that is tough.  How do you measure negotiations?  Maybe consider documentation of the process as a deliverable for this phase, and then make that process open source.  It may function as either an example of establishing KYC or DID general needs, or it may function as an example of how to approach businesses with a proof of concept like this.

I know of many Catalyst proposers who have idea related to tokens or NFTs where money is involved, and who were shocked when they found out that almost nothing can be done without \"KYC\" - know your customer, in many legislations, notably US, Canada, EU, UK, Japan, Latam. Any token sale where you potentially end up with dollars, yen, euro, sterling and so on is on the radar of regulators. By trying to solve this problem, the proposal can support almost all goals of the challenge: boost adoption, help with regulation, privacy and even philosophical implications like its impact for \"quadratic voting\" (you can split a wallet many times but not a KYC identity). The aspect I like the most about the proposal is that it takes regulation \"away from the regulator\" and creates a crypto solution for a crypto-to-non-crypto bridge. What else is self sovereign identity?", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The main proposer is a veteran of Project Catalyst but not one of those who propose 100 projects and hope some of them will be funded.

It looks like Auditability received about one tenth of the attention. Although I really like the proposal and the proposers are highly credible, I find this is not enough to convince me audit of progress will be possible.

It will help grow adoption and participation and align with the challenges of interoperability, regulation, business models, and trust registries. As someone who has opened many Defi accounts with various exchanges and wallet providers, I know what a pain it is to go through the KYC process repeatedly.  Repeatedly uploading photos of your passport and driver's license, bank statements, and other critical personal information is intrusive, not to mention time-consuming.  There is always concern about the security of your personal information.  It would be great if there were a few service providers that this process could go through and that entities that required KYC could connect to.  Similar to how Plaid is now used to connect different bank accounts.\n\nThe proposed plan is good.
