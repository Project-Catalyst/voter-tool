A reusable KYC token that saves users the hassle of multiple KYC onboarding events, and saves businesses the cost and poor UX that is a fellow traveler of this common regulatory burden.  But upon closer inspection, this is actually not using SSI in its intended way and actually runs the risk of raising costs for businesses.  The first thing to note, is that under the principles of SSI, you don't want a third party provider between you and your data.  The way SSI should solve the KYC problem is by originating better verified documents in the first place:  DIDS and VCs.  At the point a KYC check is underway, you are still reliant on the 3rd party, where the KYC check has to be maintained and stored.  In the proposers solution, the token that is issued represents that a traditional KYC check has taken place, but it doesn't validate it.  This is different from the need to verify it, which is what other businesses would be doing when they accept the token.  But they will only accept the token in lieu of trusting the validation process of the original token issuer (i.e. the issuer's trust registry).  Think of the liability a company is taking on in trusting someone else's KYC process.  Furthermore, this leads to issues regarding maintenance of the KYC documents.  Are they out of date?  Is the jurisdictional rule being followed?  If all of these protocols were lined out, and the governance framework they constituted created a trust registry for the 3rd party issuer of the tokens that was acceptable from a liability standpoint for a cohort of businesses, you would still have the issue of the original documents for the KYC check being stored and maintained with a 3rd party provider in violation of basic SSI principles --opensource, openstandards non-KYC checks performed with the customers informed consent, using credentials they own, that have been issued by originating authorities, cryptographically secured and verified, in real time. Just first party and second party, no middlemen, no additional fees and complexity.  As this proposal stands, could it provide a service of some value to the KYC business community?  Absolutely, no argument from me, and I believe there are plenty of businesses that would adopt this model.  Are there interesting use cases for the proof of concept laid out here, such as in voting protocols?  Yes. But can it provide an actual SSI solution, in an SSI challenge setting, that abides by the opensource standards of SSI?  No.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "This is not a feasibility rating of the SSI protocol, but rather of the implementation of the plan provided.  See my impact assessment for my concerns about SSI.  This team, Proofspace, is well underway for delivering a number of the aspects of this proposal, including already having the partnership with Onfido (a major travel industry solutions provider) onboarding and claims that they have others lined up with interest.  The budget has been painstakingly laid out, and it is helpfully aligned to the timeline.  The timeline  covers multiple sprints and for such a large project is very tight, coming in at just under 4 months.  All the steps in the timeline are described in actionable terms (enable..., draft..., deploy...) which makes it easy to count up the auditable beats, and each phase (roughly correlating to the months) contains a clear deliverable.  You can tell you have fullstack developers on the team, as every tech in the stack is spelled out.  Beyond the SSI issues I noted above, the team does take into account risk involving the makeup of their trust registry (what if they only have one Issuer?), by noting that the protocol still works with just one issuer, and additional issuers can be onboarded at any time.  Since there is no intent in this MVP to go beyond the one issuer (would be nice to test the dashboard with multiples) I find the risk to be low and adequately addressed.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "While disappointed to see something that isn't explicitly opensource (Proofspace is built on HyperledgerINDY, I believe) in the SSI challenge, it was not an explicit requirement of the challenge. So, while we don't have opensource Github repos to drool over, the team has committed to the monthly progress and KPI reports, and indicates a willingness to give more significant updates (making the smart contract repo public would be nice) in town halls or other community events.  The clarity with which they mapped out the process indicates to me that they have a good feel for how to deliver the project, and the absence of any openended \"soft\" action points tells me that their focus will be on the project and keeping it on track.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "The reviewer has provided some really fantastic arguments and we take seriously the points made in the impact / alignment feedback. My concern is that the reviewer makes a set of claims about SSI that are idealogical and subjective, rather than realistic and objective:\n\nIMPACT\nReviewer: \"The first thing to note, is that under the principles of SSI, you don't want a third party provider between you and your data.\"\nResponse: It's true that we want KYC data to be originated as VCs and DIDs in the first place, but this requires us to convince Governments to issue foundational identity through SSI. Unfortunately, this is not realistic in the near/mid-term. In the meantime, there is an opportunity to grow the adoption and utility of SSI, still bringing significant benefits to end users in terms of privacy, while partly relying on well-adopted and well-trusted solutions in the market. There is unlikely to be a \"big bang\" transformation in how our online identities are managed. It takes experimentation, compromise and a willingness to work with the existing markets to gain entry to those markets. If we remain staunchly idealogical about the origination of foundational ID credentials in SSI networks, then the SSI market will not be able to make use of those credentials and it will struggle to provide value to businesses who rely on them.\n\nReviewer: \"Think of the liability a company is taking on in trusting someone else's KYC process.  Furthermore, this leads to issues regarding maintenance of the KYC documents.  Are they out of date?  Is the jurisdictional rule being followed?\"\nResponse: The reviewer assumes the credentials will immediately be used in regulated settings, where of course there is a liability issue. We would start with organizations who see business value in a higher-assurance identity verification, but for whom that identity verification is not a regulatory requirement. This lowers the liability risk / if not waives it. As for whether documents are out of date: these settings can be configured in ProofSpace. Verifying parties can can configure predicates to set their tolerance levels on particular identity values/attributes. And as for whether jurisdictional rules are being followed: I don't see the relevance - it is the responsibility of the verifier to meet their jurisdictional requirements. But, going back to the original point - it assumes a regulated setting, which in all likelihood is not where this solution will be first deployed.\n\nReviwer: \"...violation of basic SSI principles --opensource... issued by originating authorities\"\nThe reviewer makes untrue and subjective claims about the basic principles of SSI.\n+ Opensource is a good long-term objective, and one that we hold, but it is not a basic principle of SSI and there is no principle prohibiting us from developing intellectual property. We use and contribute to open source technologies and standards, but we also develop our own IP. Sovrin is a reliable authority on \"Basic Principles of SSI\" and opensource is not one of them - https://sovrin.org/principles-of-ssi/. Open standards, yes (and we comply). But not open source.\n+ Originating authorities: discussed above, it's an unrealistic stance that risks ruling SSI out of transactions where identity binding is needed."}, {"q0": "I am convinced that the proposal addresses the challenge. KYC (credential-based token) will work like a physical ID. There are many benefits like cost reduction, reduce customer drop off, tranparency improvement via KYC tokens, and the possible use in smart contracts. The KYC is a useful medium when the organizations need to perform customer identification. However, I think relying on one KYC provider is a risk in itself. I don't agree that the customer should take comfort that they only need one KYC provider as the proposal said. Other than that, the utility of KYC-verified token still has limitation in some regulated entities depending on their jurisdiction context. The proposal can be improved by offering ways to mitigate these risks. With more alternatives of KYC providers and the addressed concerns, the credential-based token e.g. KYC should help to position Cardano as the leader in SSI.
