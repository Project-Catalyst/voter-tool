Why can't we authenticate safely and privately via web3?", "f6_no_assessments": 5, "f6_rating": 4.0, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"q0": "This proposal wishes to standardize the sign-in workflow and improve interoperability across existing services of the Cardano ecosystem. The solution would be useful for app developers who can integrate such sign-in ability into their app and later on of course Cardano wallet users who will be able to sign-in via this method instead of the classical methods (facebook, google, 2FA, email, etc).\n\nI think that this proposal is very well suited within this challenge and has the advantage of an extremely high scalability potential if successfully built and adopted by the app developers. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind the proposal is already functioning under the umbrella of an existing web-site and also diverse paid solutions to customers, including apps available on Android / IoS. There are also good descriptions of the team members, but somehow I have mixed feelings regarding how big the team is and how well they fit with the project. The leader is definitely visible but searching for the next layer of competencies \u2026 things just don\u2019t look right: not enough company presence on social media, not enough visible employees, and a few other red(ish) flags For the development they would also use external contractors, so definitely lacking internal resources. Another worrisome point is that their existing apps advertised are barely even downloaded on Android (counter sits at 10+), but I did not check IoS. \n\nIn terms of budget there are 5 phases of the project, with budget broken down at phase level but not much else. I suggest that future iterations put more effort into a detailed budget. Timewise the project would be delivered during   32 weeks, with independent milestones.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The team proposes daily github commits for stages 1 and 3, weekly beta releases on iOS TestFlight for stage 2, third-party assessment in stage 4 and proof of social activity and proof of integration by wallet providers in stage 5 (mostly communication + marketing). Overall this approach ensures a high degree of auditability of the project, and I don\u2019t see any major issues with the value proposition in terms of how transparent the project would unfold, if voted for.

The Authenly app and cloud backend were both developped entirely by Eric and Tiffany. We are fully autonomous and do not need a large team of devs. The project has been planned for a 6 months development, enough to be done by the current team, which shipped the full Authenly solution in the same time."}, {"q0": "Good idea, however, it is worth thinking about the potential downside where others could attempt to also create a Cardano log-in just to hack people. Due to the increasing number of crypto-natives and education regarding Web3 safety, it may be that people are less inclined to login with Cardano associated with their ada and more so just log in with something less risky. Hence, I may argue that logging in with social media may be a more frequently chosen option. Needless to say, signing in with Cardano may be the future however, it will take a lot of education and behavioural change to encourage others to be vigilant as to where they are entering their 'web3 details'. Hence, it may be that a portion of the budget is spent on blogs, more videos, social media efforts to fully educate those who are especially new to the blockchain space. I did see that the proposal mentioned \"A small marketing budget is sought to make the crypto community at large aware of the project once delivered.\" but it may have to be more than anticipated, hence requiring some reallocation of funds. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The timeline is thorough and well explained. I would recommend the security assessment to be longer as this is key. Right now, 4 weeks has been allocated for the security assessment of the entire open source stack by a third party reputable contractor and/or public body of similar reputation - it may need to be longer to really understand weak points. Furthermore, the team look to outsource this aspect of the proposal but I would suggest they have someone in-house that they hire to be part of the team. Additionally, stage 1 and stage 5 mention a discord account, would these be different for testing and implementation or is it the same discord being referred to? \n\nThe team is very strong, Eric having 20+ years in software and was previously the CEO/CTO of a $30m software business. Eric also has experience in cyber as well as crypto via building Authenly's passwordless authentication solution from the ground up. Tiffany, is a Dphil candidate at Oxford University studying quatum computing. Both parties compliment each other well and are looking to hire someone in marketing potentially (subcontracted).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Following on from the feasibility section, I believe the budget could be broken down further in order to further illustrate how they would go about their activities. Additionally, some of the tasks they hope to outsource may have not been budgeted accurately yet so I suggest they get some quotes so they have a rough indication of how much it would cost them. This would help with the plan so they'd know how to go about their alternative options and when. To that end, daily github commits sound great as well as weekly beta releases on iOS. It would be great for them to mention/consider who they have in mind to review and give them feedback, they mentioned a discord group but who are they targeting initially as their first testers. Perhaps this would come under their marketing plan. Consequently, for proof of integration by wallet providers they'll need to start reaching out and building networks for potential partnerships.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1586", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "impact : this project is to put in place a standard for Signing with Cardano.

It does take a while for the user to set up his profile but overall it saves time in the future and makes sign in so much easier and accessible with maintaining the same level of safety.

However I question if a new secure sign-in solution is a major area of need.  I would have liked the proposer to outline examples of sign-in issues especially with real-world examples.  The proposer does benefit from having an existing solution (Authenly App) which would need to be development for Cardano.
