Proposers will explore open ecosystems in the broader blockchain space as well as Cardano projects and Catalyst initiatives. The report will include a list of recommendations that will be made public. \n\nThe proposal not only promises to deliver an Ecosystem Report, but also the beginnings Research Guild, a collection of individuals with academic research skill. The guild will use those skills to generate tailored research projects for Catalyst campaigns and proposer collaborations. The proposers will start by contacting individuals in their researcher network but will also open the Guild to others to apply.  \n\nThe proposal is completely in line with the challenge. The research provided by this proposal will help everyone in the Cardano ecosystem. We will see pain points, areas of collaboration, needs and desires of users and developers. Solid research is fundamental in establishing open standards. We must know what is available, ready and being used in order to converge on standards. As a developer in the ecosystem, I see great value in such information and can't wait to read the report.\n\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have gone out of their way to provide the most detailed budget in Fund 8. They have selected 5 surveys from which to find an average hourly rate for researcher work. This results at an hourly rate of 32.74 USD for research assistants. If the proposal is any indication to the attention to detail and quality of work we are to expect in the report, this is a bargain. \n\nThey have also created a 80-20 split for each proposal under Research Guild. 80% of the budget for each proposal (including this one) is reserved for research. The rest is for Admin Fund for Research Guild. The details of what these mean are given in astounding detail. They have a solid grasp on what they need to do to build Research Guild, how they will spend that 20%. They also define Custom Guild Reports and set an expectation for future Research Guild proposals and this one. \n\nThe proposers are a group of three PhD Candidates with varying backgrounds. Collectively they form a strong foundation for Research Guild, bringing in skills related to software, technology, intellectual property, law, international relations, media, creative, health and community development. With a clear methodology to find more researchers with expert knowledge when necessary, I have full confidence the team will be able to produce a high quality report.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is the most clear and auditable proposal I've seen in Fund 8. The proposal is divided in two: establishing Research Guild, covering its administration costs and creating the ecosystem report. There is ample detail on what each of these entails, what will be done to make them happen. There are multiple KPIs for each which can be used to gauge the success of the project at any time.\n\nThe process by which the report will be generated is provided in detail. There is a report time budget template, which highlights how research will be loosely based on. This details the steps of the research project and provides a general timeline for those steps. Also, the proposers have provided a frame for this research, which can easily be used as a checklist by auditors looking to see if the goals of the project has been accomplished. Overall, this proposal is very clear and auditable.

This potentially lines up with the challenge setting as a whole: avoid things being done twice, many times over, coordinate open source projects. But that's where the similarity stops. By putting their own academic research at the centre of the proposal and assuming the authority currently held by IOHK, decentralization is not democratized but put into the hands of a business-like entity. I am unconvinced this is a good idea, and the power of the \"Guild\" can easily be abused by pursuing research interests beneficial to the proposers' network and own academic careers and not necessary to the benefit of the whole space. The KPIs of the challenge setting are not addressed as this is just a \"feasibility study to investigate strategies\" with quite a big price tag and no concrete improvements to open source contributions, resource pooling and vibrancy of the open ecosystem.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposers are PhD candidates from universities not prominent on the Cardano published papers front like Renmin in China, Osnabruck in Germany and Auckland in New Zealand. Tasking these kind of researches with setting up a Guild that only makes sense for the Cardano ecosystem if it has authority and credibility to coordinate academic research globally and many areas, this is a bit too light in my opinion and the highly respected academics currently working for or along IOHK should have been consulted prior to submitting such a large, ambitious and far-reaching proposal. The timeline is not well-aligned with the roadmap, and it is not clear how many future funding rounds are required to make this a success. The hourly rates for this kind of work by PhD candidates that support their own research seems high and external grants or pro bono university work should have been incorporated or at least explored.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal has a very long, detailed Auditability section which is commendable but also slightly misleading. A lot of time is spent discussing templates and possible performance metrics, but it is not clear how success will look like and how this can be monitored by Catalyst. I get the impression that this funding round will be absorbed by the proposed project \"no matter what\" and future funding is required, and all the metric presented are part of the research that it to be funded.

It is unclear if or how this rationale has been applied to other proposals (or only ones judged to be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcambitious\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 enough).

This proposal is judged partly through its individual merits, and partly through the way it fits into the wider Research Guild framework. My assessment takes into account aspects common across all proposals (the network\u2019s organizational aspects, competency, research approach, workload, or similar reporting mechanisms and budget logic). You shall therefore find common parts across these proposals and parts specific to each proposal.\n\nKey takeaway: good but not excellent problem identification, fair alignment with the challenge, some potential for added value for Cardano if the report is shared with the community and thoroughly digested by future proposers before designing open source solutions. \n\nThis proposal aims to deliver a report addressing issues inhibiting open ecosystems by conducting a feasibility study that investigates ecosystem challenges and solutions across blockchains, and within Cardano and Project Catalyst. From all the research proposals put forth by the Research Guild I find this one to be the most challenging in terms of identifying actionable items and delivering the message across a wide range of stakeholders, so I am slightly less optimistic regarding its impact and added value. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Key takeaway: A solid academic-oriented team behind the proposal, a clear plan and recruitment process for the actual researchers and a reasonable timeline for completion. Good value for money.\n\nThe plan. The core team consists of 3 PhD / PhD candidates from Auckland University, Renmin University respectively University of Osnabr\u00fcck, all currently undergoing blockchain-oriented activities. They would NOT conduct the research themselves, but instead they would extend invitations to their networks of academic and professional colleagues to participate in the actual research. Perhaps the standout of the team is the wide-net that they can cast within their own respective networks when searching for viable research candidates. They would subsequently undergo a recruitment / selection process based on received resumes / review of academic work published / blockchain experience. The actual work itself would be undertaken by this collective of independent researchers onboarded as above. \n\nBudget talk. 20% of the budget would go towards building the research network (research identification, outreach, project management, support, designing reporting templates, etc.). 80% of the budget would go to creating tailored research projects following a loosely based pathway which makes sense considering the knowledge-building capacity of the project. Payment for individual researchers would follow a determined base hourly rate, based on the average of online surveys already undertaken. There are extensive figures offered in the proposal, but the key figure to remember is the overall base pay of USD 32/hour and US 60/hour for highly specialized work.\n\nThe team estimates that the report will take six months to complete: from May 2022 until November 2022.
