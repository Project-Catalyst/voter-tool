There is a lot that needs to be researched around it and there are a lot of ancillary questions that also need to be answered that would have a significant effect on the Cardano ecosystem. One the foremost is ownership and what that means. e.g. If ownership of an NFT is wholly sovereign, then there is no responsibility for an owner to conform with a royalty standard. At that point it becomes a societal norm that can be ignored or conformed to. I think the team presents a valuable proposal that could result in some good discussions and value being generated for the community.\n\nI would however suggest that the team needs to provide some clear indication of what deliverables look like, outside of just discussions with key role players. This proposal is appropriate for the challenge, but what is it that is being produced besides discussions on standards? What about producing a whitepaper?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team is large, and diverse in terms of skillset. The project feasibility also seems in line with the type of project it is.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is a Discord server and a public github for information auditing. There are also relatively well defined high level KPIs which give substance to the auditability aspect of the project.

This is particularly aimed at contribution and collaboration between open source projects. This proposal provides some suggestions for developing standards regarding the redistribution of sales of NFTs. It would indeed be good to have consistent standards within the community with respect to this matter. However, all decisions made will be non-binding, and not necessarily beneficial to open source projects - rather for NFT creators. Finally, this project hopefully increases collaboration between NFT marketplaces and finds ways to increase interaction with new artists, but omits any technology focus.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers seem to provide a good mix of experience people in the NFT creation, resale and overall Cardano network. They seem to also be part of the NFT guild, which itself has probably a good connection to many active in the NFT scene. The plan of first sending surveys, brainstorming and then collaboratively developing and articulating a standard seems a good basis and it is likely that it can be followed as described.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The progress is supposed to be shared in weekly calls, which is suitable for active participants to assess but will be hard to evaluate for outsiders and retrospectively. However, setting up a public repository seems like a sufficient approach to publish regular updates.

By tracking royalty and distribution information, royalty sharing in \"NFT resale\" will be fair for artists who take some reward from profitable resales. The significant challenge that the team could mention in the proposal  is that the standards would need to be adopt by the majority of CNFT community.  With the big marketplaces like JPG store or CNFT.io run their shops with their own rules and the CNFT market is still in early stage. By introducing standards, there will likely be some who don't bother to comply to the Standards. If such cases happen, what the team would do to mitigate the issues. The project will boost the Cardano NFT market which despite growing still got some area to catch up with other chains. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project duration is 4 months splitting between information gathering and specification. It is very important when the team approaches the standards topics that the NFT community voices should be heard (not only the partners). The proposal budget will improve if it could numerate the working hours involved in the process. The team members have skillset/experience in NFT space and can provide the valuable input to steer the project in the right direction.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "While the project has listed key metrics in tracking project progress, some key figures would be appreciated so that we could see if the project completion is near the horizon. The standard itself along with the compensation of NFT guild will be available publicly on GitHub. The community server like discord is the place where they discuss about the standards. The proposer team understand the importance of having NFT standards to nurture this growing area of Cardano and the solution can have a good impact if approached in the right way.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_653", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9617, "q0": "This proposal states a clear problem and well connected with the needs of the challenge, as well as its solution based on a collaborative process to explore and establish standards and resources for Cardano NFTs. Its positive impact is conscious is widely explained on different scales both of the community but also globally. The KPIs are linked with those of the challenge, it could have been interesting to state more clearly and highlight the relationship between this solution and the points which precisely solve the challenge (to simplify the direct understanding of the reader), but the explanation is still understandable and the link quite clear. On the other hand, this initiative is new but is part of a continuation of the efforts of the NFT guild and it contains the possibility of addressing future challenges, particularly in its character of exploration, analysis and collaboration.

Their collaborators, also well integrated into the community over the long term, support the coherence of this team. The fact that it is also in partnership with the NFT guild, which is very active within the ecosystem, provides additional support. The budget seems coherent, it is well detailed. The set seems realistic and well built, which is also felt in the plan and the different phases of implementation. And the risks are addressed with an interesting and valid solution. \nPS: I really learned a lot of things by reading this proposal, all the detailed explanations and its didactic and explanatory aspect is really interesting. Not being an expert in the field of NFTs, I still understood all the information, which in my opinion constitutes a considerable effort on the part of the team as well as a good demonstration of their knowledge of the subject.

It is possible to follow them thanks to their discord. Also, A public Github site will always show the latest standards they develop. We are invited to join their call, as well as those organized by NFT guild on a regular basis. And it also provides for the establishment of a website. the detail and set of explanations provided also works in favour of this proposal, showing the team's interest in being understood.
