They want additional funding to perform security audits on the smart contracts they're developing. They will release their smart contracts as open source after the audit, improving open standards for the Cardano ecosystem. \n\nThe proposers have identified a critical problem within the challenge: There aren't many good references for developers when writing smart contracts. Without examples, development work becomes very difficult, especially with inherently complicated subject matter like DeFi and smart contracts. What is worse is when there are limited examples of questionable quality. The proposers make clear why this is an issue with an example and well though out explanations.\n\nAs a developer learning Haskell and Plutus the past 4 months, I've felt this problem first hand while navigating the various information sources available. High quality, well documented smart contract examples are difficult to come by in Cardano. Contracts with successful security audits even more so. Such examples are a critical resource we need in the ecosystem. Good references would lead to higher quality projects and thus increase reputability of projects using them. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of this proposal depends mainly on the ability of the proposers to finish their work on the smart contracts. The two proposers are First Cohort Plutus Pioneers. They haven't provided a linkedin or github, but with a quick search we find their linkedin. One proposer has finished their bachelors in computer science and engineering in May 2020 and is an working as a software engineer. Haskell is not listed as a skill in their CV while many other languages are. This is likely outdated information. The second proposer has at least 11 months works experience working on Plutus and that is a big plus. \n\nI also asked for some examples of their code in Discord and got to take a look. They have working contracts with a large code base. This clears any questions in mind as to if they can deliver the code. They most likely can and will.\n\nThe proposal budget is estimated to be 50K to for the security audit and 25K for bug bounty. There is no justification provided for this estimate. Has any auditing companies been approached? What price have they given? It would be good to have some of this information available. Without it, it's difficult to assess whether the budget is appropriate for the proposal. We also don't know how many smart contracts the proposers are developing and how comprehensive they are. Audit price will depend heavily on that.\n\nOverall, I believe the team is capable of producing the smart contracts. Since they will outsource the audit and bug bounties, that means they are capable of delivering. I do have questions regarding the budget, but I feel their budget estimate is not wildly out of the ballpark. \n\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers suggest a good way to measure the success of the proposal: Number of forks and clones of their open source repository. This is a good early tracker of success once the security audit is completed and the code is open sourced. \n\nOne critical thing I felt is missing from the proposal is some detail on the contracts we can expect from the project. The proposers give this information but not much more on the topic: \"There are contracts for the NFT-FT exchange protocol, an emission redirector, and a fee farm.\" So we can pin down 3 of the contracts that will be open sourced. How many other contracts/features will be made available is not known. Some detail here would be appreciated.\n\nDeliverables are given in two parts. In the first 3 months: Fungify will be on testnet with extensive tests and the audit will be started. In the next 3 months audit will be completed, Fungify launched on mainnet with documentation and the contracts will be open sourced. The dates are unclear yet expected as a software project of this type is difficult to estimate time wise. Yet these targets could have been made clearer. \n\nThere are no deliverables/targets/milestones connected to the bug bounty, which is estimated to be 1/3rd the budget. When will it start? Will it be a challenge to find hackers? More details on this would be appreciated given the significance in the budget.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1323", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 163, "q0": "The proposal aims to audit and opensource a set of Plutus scripts for managing pooled liquidity of NFTs. This is aligned with the Challenge objective by introducing common standards and processes and incentivize their adoption across projects and by contributing to a cohesive knowledge base.  It adds value by providing an audites set of scripts as examples for other to build on. The project is scalable as once released any number of developers can use it - it will be hosted on github", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Both team members were part of the first cohort of Plutus Pineers which gives them credibility for early adoption.

The link provided leads to a description of how the \"Fungify\" smart contracts will work, but does not show an example, nor a prototype. This leads to believe that the smart contracts have not been finalised and have not been made into a product just yet and its benefit and uptake has not been tested by the community. The budget of 75k is requested to audit those contracts, however at this point there is no information to demonstrate if and how they work. The suggested timeline is 6 months and a basic schedule is provided. The risks are discussed and center around the risk of creating a smart contract that has bugs.

No KPI schedule is provided, however it is mentioned that progress can be measured through the number of forks and clones of the github repo.

It's pretty difficult to share an example of a contract or a prototype of a contract, especially in a proposal like this. We feel that sharing prototypes of our current codebase is akin to open sourcing, as it would now be public. We think that, given the fatal vulnerabity discovered in Minswap's open source, auditied code, to open source any significant parts of our code at this stage of development would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous to the Cardano ecosystem. Our large codebase has not been audited yet or extensivly tested. While we are designing it with security as our top priority, it would be dangerously naive to assume that it does not contain any critical bugs in its current state. Another reviewer was curious about the state of our contracts too so they hopped in the discord and asked. We decided to share a limited view of some high level input design choices and endpoint outputs as a way to show progress without addressing the black box in between the inputs and outputs or inadvertantly open sourcing implementation details. The other reviewer provided the following feedback: \"I also asked for some examples of their code in Discord and got to take a look. They have working contracts with a large code base\". \n\nIn the feasibility section, the reviewer faults us for not providing an accurate estimate for how expensive the audit will be. We believe we provided a satisfatory explanation as to the uncertainty involved in pricing a security audit. Prices vary wildly between projects in the crypto space as a whole, and within the plutus commmunity, which is still relativly small compared to other blockchains like Ethereum, there are have been very few security audits, none of which have shared the price they paid. The only way to obtain a more accurate estimate of price is to engage with multiple audit firms and accumulate quotes. This however cannot be done until the codebase is finished. Prices are heavily influenced by the size and complexity of the codebase, which will not be completely known until it is finished. We even explained how we will handle the uncertainy involved in pricing, we stated that should the actual price of the audit differ from our estimate, the difference will be added / subtracted to the whitehat bug bounty program. We feel that giving a rough estimate, explaining why there is uncertainty, and providing a plan to outline how we will handle the uncertainty is sufficient and the best we can do at this time."}, {"id": 3045, "q0": "The proposal matches the challenge in that it seeks to establish a process for building on existing open-source projects. It also lays the grounds for fair competition as most of the DEX\u2019s code are closed-sourced. Having an open-source dapp code template will allows anyone to use it. This gives equal opportunities to all and will therefore result in fairer competition. Also, it may potentially force those dapps with close-source code to innovate further resulting in better products and services to the end-user. The main beneficiaries from this initiative will be new developers and the Cardano dapp users.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "All of the budget goes towards ensuring the safety of the code which is very important. If there is a bug in the code it could make its way in many dapps that use this code as a template. It would be helpful if the proposer could indicate how these monies can be tracked. \nThe team has a small discord group and a gitbook for this initiative. \nThe proposer did not provide reference links on the two co-founders. One needs to go on their Project Catalyst profiles and then do a manual internet search to find their LinkedIn profiles. I would suggest that the prosper include these links in the proposal to avoid possible negative commentary or rating. One of the co-founders is a Plutus developer and the other is a software engineer. Both has a Bachelor of Science \u2013 Computer Science.

To achieve this the roadmap focusses mainly on testing and audits in a simple and clear way. \nThe major risk is clearly identified and the solution is given to mitigate the risk. Having a full security audit as well as a white-hat bug bounty program will increase the changes that the open-source code is safe to be used by other developers. \nThe proposer suggests that the project will be a success if at least 3 projects are able to use the code as a starting point and zero vulnerabilities are exploited. Some projects that use the code as a template may have many users while other projects will have very little users. Adding timeframes and users will would make for better measurement.
