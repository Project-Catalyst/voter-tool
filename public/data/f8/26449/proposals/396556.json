There are several other factors that need to be taken into consideration while researching a potential investment before being comfortable committing some money.\nThe tool will allow also user to see what other users evaluated, in order to avoid researches on projects that have been evaluated previously by others.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has been already funded in Fund 6 and 5 on the same project, demonstrating the capability of delivering the proposals, providing a working tool for 'DYOR'. \nAs this current proposal aims to ameliorate the already existing tool, it is very likely to succeed.\nThe team is also mitingating the risk of people not understanding the tool by providing training material, and dedicating a part of the budget for promotion of the tool to avoid poor adoption.\nHalf of the budget (31600 usd) will be allocated to development, which seems reasonable. 3600 usd will be dedicated to promotion/marketing.

They plan to build a new versions of DYOR Tool which is designed specifically for NFT project after the first version for tokens is completed. Also, they aim to continuously improve it based on the community feedback. The proposer shows that they are reliable and trustworthy team who working hard to provide the best services for the Cardano community, even the newcomers who could use this DYOR tool to assess a new project before investing in it. Also, the team know their strengths and challenges about their projects as they try to promote their project to community by regularly organize contests. Therefore, I think this project need more support from the community to further develop and provide a full package of research tool for the community. I appreciate their big vision and hard work.

They have worked together for quite a long time with good team work of effectively  finishing the first version of DYOR Tool. Also, in the next months after being funded, they gives three main focus and clear timeline for the project and detailed budget for each cost which is appropriate at this stage of the project. It is very important at this latter stage to get huge support from the users and community to get to know about their tool. I hope they do well and get funded soon.

By doing this we could check whether the team is active and how engagement of the community to their project. The proposer shows they are willing to receive any feedback or suggestions or ideas related to their project. I think, this is very promising and practical project.
