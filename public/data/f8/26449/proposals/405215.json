The only reason I'm not giving the proposal five stars for Feasibility goes back to a lack of clarity regarding the scope of the project in the Impact statement.

There will be research but not implementation of a DAO. \nHow do I see this in the Open Standards challenge context: this is primarily an impact business in its own right, so may have been proposed in B2C/B2B this fund instead. Hopefully, there will be Impact/Sustainability categories in the future to better accommodate proposals like this. \nPossible Open Standards angles: vendor neutral ecosystem, lower the barriers and increase open participation, collaboration across projects.\nI am not entirely convinced the proposers have done enough to present their business idea in the light of its benefits to the open source or catalyst or cardano ecosystems. While the milestones have wording that suggest research is done for impact business in general, DAOs in general etc. these projects have already been done successfully (i.e. Littlefish, C4C proposals) and that the proposers plan to obtain a business license and launch their own token and impact business seems business-like and not open standard-centered. \nTherefore, I see relatively low alignment with the goals of the challenge", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The problem with this proposal mentioned under Impact, that it seems to be unsure whether to be a business or a template, has also created problems for its Feasibility.

This suggests to me that neither is likely to succeed: for a template creating exercise, not enough web3 knowledge exists, and for a business, too much time and resources will be spent on the open standard research.
