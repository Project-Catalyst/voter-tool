The mentorship incentivization DAO idea is a great way to reward these mentors for all they do and in such a seamless way, by incentivizing mentors with native tokens and NFTs. One of the key objectives is to build value within a network through a Mentorship DAO. This would also encourage them to mentor more as it means they can justify the time spent even more. To that end, this proposal aligns well with the \u2018Open Standards & Interoperability\u2019 challenge in a way that empowers those who are fundamental to the ecosystem. Hence, enabling equal opportunities to all via the mentees, this notion is key to the challenge. It may even be the case that one day the mentees could become mentors and be rewarded in the same way, this growth would be great for the ecosystem. Notably, mentor-mentee matches will be presented as a block with its own NFTs and both, and stored on the blockchain.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team is very capable of delivering the stated outcomes of their proposal as the founders are experienced in an existing global mentorship program which uses an AI matchmaking engine to deliver predictions of the \u2018perfect match\u2019. Additionally, they have a blockchain architect and university researcher joining their team. One of their plans is to present a white paper so the team combination is fitting for this task. However, there are no details on the blockchain architect nor the university researcher yet in the proposal. Nonetheless, the 3 main team members all have experience working within the same start-up so this indicates that they work well in a team.\n \nThey have plans to utilise Cardano in many ways including their \u200b\u200bIdentity Solution using ATALA Prism implementation. Their technical lead and software engineer have strong skills and experiences, a lot of which would be beneficial to their project. They have also conducted previous research which has identified that over 90% of our users joined through a reference from a friend, and they also found that their platform aids in reducing the stress of selecting a mentor. Notably, their program design expert has relevant business-related skills which would be useful for market research and the two-sided nature of their idea (mentor and mentee). \n\nIf more detail on the university teacher and blockchain architect were provided, they would have ranked higher as these team members would provide specific skills which would be useful for the development of the white paper. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Their first stated step is to scope the viability of building a mentorship DAO on Cardano and subsequently writing a white paper. The team have already thought about a roadmap including future funding roads, this shows their long-term vision for the project, to continue the development of their decentralized mentorship platforms. They clearly outlined the stages at which each task would be carried out in correspondence to the relevant fund with fund 8 relating to \u2018research and scoping of mentorship DAO\u2019 and, for example, fund 9 relating to building the reimbursement infrastructure for the mentors-mentees. To that end, they have a great idea of their overall mission and long-term plans, however, I suggest that they thoroughly explain each stage and the individual steps needed to achieve their goals, even for the whitepaper in this instance. As of now, their plan is less detailed but it would be useful to break everything down. The costs could also be broken down even further too. Overall, a good idea for the ecosystem which rewards the most productive members of the community with increased ownership of the DAO, the proposal needs to be broken down further to individual steps and costs.

Mentors can potentially increase interoperability through concurrently working on several projects, applying the same standards to all projects.\nHowever, every mentor is different.

(https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/399243) This proposal would receive a higher rating if it was more clear to the voter through the problem statement and summarized solution that this proposal and funding budget is for a white paper only, and not the completed platform.

The proposal includes the entire project roadmap that spans 12 months, but does not provide what the entire project budget would be when completed. I have determined from the included linked proposal that it would be at least $38,500 with the two current proposals funded, however they also mentioned applying for more funding in future funding rounds, so it is not clear what the total cost may be to deliver this entire project.

However the timeline for this white paper alone is 3-6 months, which in my opinion could include a more specific deadline, such as 6 months. That said, I believe this team is very capable of delivering this whitepaper, with this budget, within a 6 month timeframe.

They planned to continue to Stage 2, Stage 3, and Stage 4 in future Fund 9, Fund 10, and Fund 11.
