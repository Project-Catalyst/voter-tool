Centralizing Marlowe resources on a convenient website has the potential to decrease frustrating amounts of fragmentation within the community. The focus on JavaScript, a commonly used language, can potentially help gate developers into the ecosystem without having to immediately wrestle with Haskell or Plutus. There will, however, likely be competitors trying to do similar things. To that end, cooperation with the Marlowe team seems key here. The proposer's prospective involvement with the planned Marlowe Pioneers program should put him in an advantageous position to learn and get access to the necessary information.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer's professional background and engagement with the Marlowe team should put him in a good position to lead a project of this type. With the amount of content this project might require, however, I have concerns about the proposer's plan to take on the majority of the production, in addition to managing social media accounts and Q&As, with only a modest amount of freelance help. That's not to say that he couldn't pull it off in the prospective 10 hours per week stated, only that it's difficult to tell from what's here. A more itemized description how his time will be spent could alleviate concerns about the scope of this project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As an outwardly facing project, this proposal should be quite easy to audit. The proposer provides clear targets for both quantity of content and community engagement, which are solid KPIs with which to measure the project's progress. Since it was mentioned, I'd like to see a target for average response time to community/social media questions, and how the proposer might go about scaling the project should community response exceed the expectations he's laid out in his milestones.

Without using the complicated words from the challenge setting like discoverability, identity, cohesive knowledge base let me try to put it simply: I wanted to learn Marlowe since the Cardano summit and have failed to do so because the videos on the internet are by math PhD talking about the code to create Marlowe, the Telegram has a lot of followers but no discussion, the playground cannot be used for my projects and the IOHK documentation is too wordy and does not have examples or tests. If this kind of typical IOHK-product which is sound and strongly built but nobody understands, what good is it without some member of the community make a tutorial and a discord and even to offer to mentor me? I think this is what Open Standard is all about. To have the community create in one place instead of many practical content. As the project is trying to do just that I assess 5/5 as I strongly agree it serves the task well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer was previously funded and is building other projects on Cardano with Plutus but is not a developer by training so I think it should be possible from him to explain Marlowe to people like me who want to use it for their business without having a Math degree or developer background. Doing this over one year with piecemeal contributions per month, per catalyst fund and biweekly is good delivery and I think the success of the project to help people who are keen to learn about Marlowe is very likely. Maybe attribute more detail into different parts of the timeline: months 1-3 cover this area, 4-6 that area, would have boosted my confidence about the content even more. Just nitpicking though.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is a clear plan to compare the progress of time with assessment metrics and deduct success or not, so what can I ask for more? Maybe writing more detail. How many people view the videos comes to mind. Number of people mentored or coached inside project Catalyst. Articles published outside of the proposer's own social media and website. Zoom meetings held with Marlowe team at IOHK. Just some examples of possible metrics to be added. But compared to other proposals I have assessed this is quite good and not giving 5/5 would be stingy as I think for the budget requested and the reasonable description of the contribution offered this is quite good in terms of the accountability and audit function.

One of them is to ensure the existence of a cohesive knowledge base. I believe that this proposer is trying to go down that route and that it is the reason to put the proposal into this category. Looking at other categories I agree that there is no one category that seems more suitable. It can also be noted positively that project synergies and inter-project communication, knowledge sharing, and re-use of existing components/services are all a part of the proposal - not only creating the content for videos, but also mentoring and actively sharing the knowledge on social media and for open source collaboration. While I prefer personally to see developers building things, and believe that the majority of funded proposals in this category should result in \"lines of codes\" as output, I can see how this proposal can be responsible to multiply development and attract developers, so I rate it 5 out of 5 for impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The single proposer demonstrates well how his background in financial services and using software for finance makes him a typical user targeted by \"domain specific\" smart contract language Marlowe. The dev knowledge of the proposer could have been deeper, especially as Marlowe also uses Haskell, but as the proposer will be similar to the users targeted by IOHK for Marlowe this is not necessarily bad. \nThe timeline and budget breakdown is simple, but not too simple, as I can imagine that charging a relatively low fee for mentoring and creating content equally distributed over a year does align well with the rollout of Marlowe which is not fully happening at the time of Fund-8 I believe. So I am happy with the match between skill and project outline.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It is relatively rare to find proposals that provide quantitative targets where the project can be judged a success or failure, with intervention by IOG/Catalyst/reviewers/auditors to address the blocking factors or withhold funding. So the auditing part is good and I do not see how such a simple proposal can do more for auditing sake. As the proposer introduces response time on social media, this could easily have been quantified as well, which is a pity. In general, although brief, I like the discussion of auditability and it is better than other proposals I have assessed today where I see only the list of goals but no numbers.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1357", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 1, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1701, "q0": "I am going through the challenge criteria one by one to discuss how this proposal can address the challenge (or not).\n\n\nHow can we guide the growth of a vendor neutral ecosystem?\nThe proposer wants to mentor other proposers and create a central hub for Marlowe smart contracts language. It is mentioned that this may be offered against a fee by IOHK or others in the future and allowing an open exchange of content fully fits with the idea of the challenge.\n\n\nHow can we build a common identity and increase awareness on Cardano projects?\nIf educational content about Cardano does not only come from IOHK/IOG but is spread by the community and grassroots, this is in the spirit of the challenge, and the proposal does have this goal in mind by creating 2 Youtube videos and per month and giving feedback on social media channels about how to use Marlowe, so that is appropriate.\n\n\nHow can we increase the discoverability and the commercial adoption of our projects?\n\"Publicity\" and social media exposure of products in the Cardano ecosystem is very important for this aspect of the challenge and even if no new development is offered by the proposer, teaching others and creating a community space is fully in line with the challenge.\n\n\nHow can we increase the degree of collaboration across different projects?\nBy offering to be \"friendly, informative and high-quality source of all things Marlowe\", the proposal's aim of creating an educational service / community will probably have all sorts of people interested in using Marlowe contracts come to the same website or Telegram and meet each other there, so this is a good way of making the challenge happen.\n\n\nHow can we lower the barriers and increase open participation to our ecosystem?\n\"Free mentoring and education\" for the people who cannot use Plutus and want to learn Marlowe definitely helps to lower the barriers.\n\nHow can we provide equal opportunities to all projects no matter the size?\nThe proposal says that those project on Catalyst that cannot afford their own developer can come to the \"hub\" and learn about Marlowe from the proposer. This is perfect to give equal opportunity.\n\n\nThe challenge direction that is the best fit for this proposal is \"Ensure the existence of a cohesive knowledge base\" and \"Support a network of professional technology ambassadors\" which I can get the feeling that the proposer is very passionate about. It is a 5 out of 5 fit for this category of the challenge settings.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer does not say or prove he has a very strong grasp of Haskell or Plutus which is probably useful for using Marlowe as well. By being so experienced and passionate about financial markets and trading and able to use JavaScript it is okay as the user will find someone like themselves to learn from who has already used Marlowe and can attend the Pioneer Program \"for them\" - that is how I understand it. So it is not a really solid developer education but more from practical background to other practical background - someone who has bought the product \"out of the box\" if you like and used and reviewed it a lot, so even though they cannot build the product themselves it will be a good learning time. I am okay and happy with it.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I like that there is a straight line of 12 months with costs, videos to be created, mentoring to be done and many more so I got the feeling that whoever is doing the audit for this project will have an easy time to see if it takes off and use the breaks or give out the money as they can see things happening or not. This is not always the case in the proposal that I see so I have to say it is better than many proposals in that sense. Good job. The proposer has also said he has done Catalyst project before so we know that this is a known person and does not run away with the money. All in all I have no reason not to agree strongly with the statement that information is sufficient to audit this in terms of progress and success.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1405", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 4, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8135, "q0": "There are many Catalyst projects that await the launch of Marlowe Financial markets. Some proposers deem Plutus and Haskell too technical while Marlowe is perceived to be more suitable for financial projects. The proposal aims to boost Marlowe implementation and pioneer program with the community of traders and DeFi. The proposal addresses the challenge of open standards & Interoperability very well as the solution will be used across different Catalyst projects that seek Marlowe implementation. This will boost the degree of collaboration across projects. The proposer has also pointed out that the project success relies on the successful implementation on mainnet of Marlowe. As the education website contains a lot of information and to avoid duplication of effort, the proposer is open for collaboration and community input.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer budget is very competitive at $25 per hour and his contribution of 52 weeks (1 year) for 10 hours per week is reasonable. It is important to make sure that the structure of the project is right and accommodative to various project needs. The proposer has strong background in TradFi and should be able to carry out the project successfully. However, the proposer has no direct background in education and it could prove as an extra challenge. However, this could be mitigated by bringing more people into his team or allow the community to take stewardship to contribute to the standards and structures of the program. It is feasible that the project will be completed successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project has listed how the project success looks like by providing the number of active users and the number of proposals that would be mentored as the key indicators.

The idea of creating content for Marlowe before it is launched on testnet to have enough content when it is \"live\" is a good idea. In my opinion this can have high impact for Cardano and for Marlowe. I am addressing a few improvements and concerns in other sections but the match between challenge and proposal is 100% there.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "When I follow the link for the proposer and google his previous projects and social media presence I do not get the impression that he is \"out there\" doing similar things at the moment. There are a lot of Youtube influencers and I may have missed something, but if I am right, this is a financial trader who wants to start a Youtube channel about Marlowe. My advice is partner up with someone who is already on Youtube! Split the funds! It is very important that we move away from the IOHK education style, which is just brutal. Sorry that I give a low score for feasibility, but I believe you have to bring some energy, engage people - it is not easy to learn coding. This is where Khan Academy was so successful, all the instructors were really engaging, made it super simple. They have good equipment to record and show examples. Team up with a Youtuber and you will have a much better proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The audit part is simple but honest. The proposal does not want to change the world, but deliver quantity of content so people can come together and learn. I get it. I like to see some way how the success can be measured other than \"number of videos created\" I see all the time (NFTs minted, words translated, members onboarded - I am reading it all the time, really!). I think auditing is possible, easy, for this proposal, and the timeline and targets are good. But why not make it better? Upvotes vs downvotes on Youtube, number of upvotes, number of Twitter shares? Something that is not as easy to hit as videos created. Anyone can create a video, and we have seen a lot of proposals make videos that are then watched by 50-odd people. Can I get my money back?
