The proposal aims to undertake a series of workshops with projects working on ideation to agree on protocol level implementations. I find a very poor fit between the challenge and the proposal, although the problem identification touches slightly a correct problem, albeit vague as well. Somehow the overall level of detail is simply not sufficient for me to deem this proposal worthy. I highly suggest against voting for it. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Note: this proposal is very similar to another one, therefore the feasibility assessments are also very similar in terms of language and overall assessment. \n\nThere are very vague descriptions of \u201croles\u201d to participate in the project, like for instance facilitator, organizer, treasurer, maintainers. For future iterations I highly recommend that at least the core team behind the projects comes out to light with names and even Linkedin profiles available. \n\nIn terms of budget there are many questions to be asked and the logic behind it is not very clear. For instance, participant fees are an important part - will they be industry experts, general audience, or whom exactly? It is not clear at all. Every other budget caption is also vague and / or out of logic - i shall spare you the details here. I highly advise that future iterations make a much more clear budget, perhaps employ some outside help in order to structure the information better. \n\nTimewise, the project would take 6 months. In the first month we would have built the coalition of participants, drafting the process and research of participants. The next months would see the meetings taking place, closing meetings and a closing meeting. Again a very clear lack of structure in the timeline. \n\nAgain, a very poor feasibility for this proposal. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Note: this proposal is very similar to another one, therefore the auditability assessments are also very similar in terms of language and overall assessment. \n\nThe proposed solution is to organize 6 meetings to be held, but it is not very clear between whom, and at the end the meetings a protocol would emerge, but it is not clear for what purpose other than \u201cauthentication\u201d. The overall vagueness leaves a lot to be desired and there is no clear way to link the proposal to the challenge.

Let me explain why. The challenge asks us to \"build an open ecosystem to drive growth, give equal opportunities to all, and increase the synergies across Cardano projects\". On the outset this incentivized approach is a nice way of guaranteeing participation and the plan is well thought out. When it comes to ideation use case, however, I disagree that there even is much of an issue here. If there is, it should have been brought up more clealry. There are plenty of ideas out there, only execution matters. And there are different ways to do ideation, whether they are interoperable or not, doesn't matter. Different people prefer different approaches.\n\n(*Dear VCAs and similarity-assessing bots, I have utilized some of the same wordings in both of my assessments because the proposals really are almost identical).", "q0r": 3, "q1": "If this gets funding, it's 100% clear that Philip will deliver what he has promised.

While the intention of this project seems to be in tandem with the objective of the challenge.

It is unlikely that the summit itself will yield result by the time of next proposal submission. The impact of this proposal is also not scalable to achieve the desired result. Besides it is not a one solution fits all (the authentication systems in different projects will likely have distinctive characteristics and not being able to be understood by every participants coupled with the time constraint as mentioned earlier).

It is quite unlikely one will give away time and be charged to attend the summits. There is no list of team members making this challenging project a solo effort which would make the project a struggle as the proposal lists many different functions to make a project feasible ie. facilitator, organiser, administrator, treasurer, maintainers etc. Until the project can disclose this behind-the-scene working group, it is very unlikely that various teams will commit their time and resources to participate in the summits.

Suppose that the draft protocol is the final output aimed by this proposal, what would be the outcome if it is not agreeable by the proposers.

Although the project comes with the good intention of fostering the collaboration, the plan needs to be well thought out for the undesirable side impact. The project needs to define more on several terms and be more transparent in its goal and the team behind the work group.
