Tenant matching isn't a glamorous solution to housing issues, but it addresses the reality of finding shelter for individuals living in poverty, particularly in areas with limited housing stock. With cities like San Francisco struggling to find homes for their homeless population, this could be a very timely project. \n\nOf course, the effectiveness of this solution will depend greatly on the quality of the information used to create the tenant profiles. Psychometrics is a slippery discipline. Loxe Inc.'s background in conflict mediation should go a long way in this regard, but if dating apps are any indication, the team may have their work cut out for them when it comes to effective matchmaking.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I have little doubt that the experienced development team, three of whom have experience in a shared housing matchmaking project (AROYO), can deliver a tenant standard draft by September 2022. AROYO uses a 27-point questionnaire to build tenant profiles that can be used across agencies in the LA area. The survey queries applicants on subjects ranging from race, to mobility needs, to hobbies. This experience should transfer directly to this project. \n\nAs a minor gripe, I'd like to hear more about the bottlenecks the team encountered at AROYO, as I think this can provide voters a better sense of the project's potential impact.

I believe the proposal's transparency could be improved, however, by presenting highlights from the June 2022 focus groups and general reactions from stakeholders in July 2022.

The proposal is trying to solve it by having a standard that allows for compatibility matching between tenants and these tenants to housing units. Here the high rent issue is being resolved by sharing the rent between two or more tenants and housing crisis is being resolved by providing suitable housing units to rent. this tenant standard allows another related projects to be built on it which help add new project hence adding value to cardano ecosystem. The goals of the proposal somewhat align with the challenge not fully as there is need for another project to be built to resolve the issue and this tenant standard act as a base for others projects. The proposal can be scaled for future issues as this will help more projects to be built on it\nAfter the above observation this proposal does addresses the problem but not fully", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As per their proposal and after visiting their website provided in the proposal I was able to find that the proposer and their team are already working on wide range of projects which requires various skillset. Based on these observation the proposer and their team has required experience and skill to carry out this proposal. The proposal does contain a complete budget breakdown and the budget seems reasonable to achieve the set targets as there is requirement to hire Data Modeling Experts. The proposer has provided a clear timeline with goals to be reached which seems practical. The proposal does provide a sensible plan for implementation of the proposal.

They have a good expertise in development and in the Cardano space specifically as well. The time frame seems to be not very specific but that is understandable due to the complexity of the solution. On the other hand, the budget seems to be on the high side, especially when seeing where the funds are directed towards.
