OPEN ISPO is a great way to balance this. Ensuring small pools will operate more efficiently thereby increasing the sustainability of the Cardano network. In addition, the successful proposal also helps project owners a lot, they just need to focus on product development, the distribution of tokens will be distributed fairly to everyone through OPEN ISPO.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team are all members with a lot of experience and passion for the Cardano ecosystem.

We have a fair level of description of how the project would unfold. Labor cost estimation are rather unclear, with a list of 15 items not very easy to go through or understand quickly, so I definitely suggest that future updates take into account onboarding some budget-oriented colleagues to help out with these tasks, and possibly with organizing admin / financial tasks since there is definitely a lack of competence on this level.  \n\nOverall a good impression, with a few worries in terms of budget and internal organization.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Proposers state that the project shall be trackable on github where they shall create a specific branch to document progress made and weekly meetings. Perhaps a very small point of improvement, only to play devil\u2019s advocate here, is to ask the prospers to consider issuing a policy document targeted towards the Cardano community, something down the lines of: here is our proposal, and here are our guidelines for pool operators, who, in order to be granted a high score on our platform, have to put in practice points a,b,c, and need to have the minimum requirements x,y,z.

I understand the issues which have arisen over the last few months in terms of the impacts of ISPOs on small, or unknown, or single pools, which would have detrimental effects to Cardano's decentralisation, but to create a a grouping of small pools to be the main participants in a project's ISPO is in itself restrictive and antithesis to openness. Medium sized or large but single pools would likely feel left out and feel victimised by their own successes and hard work, and that outcome is just as damaging to our ecosystem as small pools missing out on ISPO participation. If I am indeed wrong and this is not at all what is presented, then I apologise. As a former assessor of tenders for a university, I have learnt to read between the lines and see past imperfect submissions and grasp the general ideas but in this instance, this was the primary assessment I have made. Should this be resubmitted in the future, I highly recommend for the proposer to take their time and writing the proposal in a very clear and simple way that would not confuse the audience.

From this perspective, this proposer and the team clearly have the credentials and the background needed to progress this project to success. The team members have not only provided their linkedin profiles but also added descriptions of qualifications & other personal details such as Facebook accounts, which does lead to trust. The qualifications of each team member shouts of experiences in the Cardano space and the fact two are SPOs adds to the confidence that they know what they are doing. These qualifications make it easy to believe that their June to Oct road map is realistic and highly achievable. The labour costimation is very detailed however, where this proposal could be improved is in stating in more granular detail how much each different role would cost. A blanket $50/hour is presented but surely, each of the four team members will not receive the same amount for different responsibilities and skillset? If this is the case, it may benefit the reader to know that this will be jointly built with essentially every member having the same responsibilities.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There's quite a number of details in this proposal that's auditable. The month by month milestone could itself be tracked but the proposer has added KPIs which would determine the success of the Open ISPO when it starts running. There are personal githubs, telegram addresses and Facebook profiles added for team members. I highly recommend the team creates specific 'Open ISPO' channels as a way to generally communicate with the community. There's a site shared for any enquiries but this is in Vietnamese.

This proposal are proposing an open standard for how to conduct this ISPO so it become seamless, interoperable, and helps decentralization.

This proposal also able to explain clearly how it solve it, by allowing smaller stake pool to take part in this ISPO instead of the project\u2019s centralized pool.

From the experience of the team, this proposal knows what are needed for this project to succeed; plutus developer, engineer, etc. The budget is reasonable and explained clearly in detail, from hour of work, role, budget allocation, etc. Although they\u2019ve explained what their plans are, I\u2019ve yet to see at least one example of such ISPO scheme or mechanism in this proposal. Having an initial idea of how the ISPO mechanism would work with the smaller Stake Pool will help the community to see \u201chow will this standard could help projects and smaller Stake Pools\u201d, other than the decentralization aspect of it, or the reduced labor or setting up cost for the projects to distribute their token. In some ISPO (Like Genius Yield) they have a pool margin of 99%, meaning that all the delegators reward will go towards the Stake Pool Operator. Now, if a project wanted to do something similar but with the help of smaller SPO (Stake Pool Operator), what will the margin rate be? Will it be 99% and all goes to the operator, then give it to the project owner? OR will there be a split margin mechanism, e.g 50% goes to the project, 5% the SPO fees, and 45% will go to delegators reward as normal. These early overview of implementation could at least indicate that the team have the idea on what they\u2019ll work on. BUT, they actually did mention about this scheme model, and it will be called \u201cISPO as a Service\u201d, described in another proposal. So this ISPO model only works for the \u201cOpen ISPO\u201d model, which is an ISPO model without the project owner received any ADA in return, so it will be just free token distribution to the community, through smaller stake pool.
