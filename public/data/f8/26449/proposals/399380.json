I agree that we as a community might need a unified standard authentication protocol and mechanism going ahead, but I wouldn't agree with the approach the proposer tries here. The main challenge, as the proposer himself mentions is making sure the existing application teams reserve a part of themselves to be in the workgroup which decides and formulates the protocol agreed upon. That would be a tough one to tackle. And many have found their comfort in their own authentication mechanisms ready and asking them all to switch is not gonna be an easy task. Even though the idea is fresh and springy, the proposer needs to provide more research or do more spadework before going ahead and implementing this idea. The challenges are plenty and the approach is fuzzy with a lot of dependency on other projects making it look weak.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The detailed plan is kept very simple and to the point. The proposer mentions the two phases that will make up the entire proposal. Most of the work here is done by the participants who are a part of other teams already working on projects with far superior goals. The feasibility of getting them on board is something to be concerned about. The few roles such as administrator, maintainers are defined with clear roles but there are no names mentioned who might be filling these shoes and hence making the integrity and credibility of the proposal take a hit. The fund requested do not feel justified after taking a closer look at the breakdown. There are several projects in the same proposal asking for much less and doing much more (P.S: It's a personal opinion), and it looks like a lot of roles have been overemphasized and the retainer for those roles seems a little overestimated with no idea about the kind of experienced people who might be taking up those roles. Hence, I am in a fix regarding the feasibility of the proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "With most part of the proposal being meetings and communication of the minutes of meetings to the community, there is not much to track in the proposal. Moreover, the implementation of the agreed-upon protocol will not be undertaken but will instead be encouraged to be taken up by future application developers. To be honest, I don't see the necessity of a workgroup for this. A group of enthusiastic developers who are willing to work on something of the sort could all make use of some community hub and come to a conclusion. However, the only positive outcome would be the formal documentation of the meetings which might not happen in the other case. And the success outcome defined by the proposer is somewhat the same. The team also makes a mention about the need for funds to maintain the protocol which they probably won't be developing themselves. I find it hard to assess the exact implementation and the success of this proposal and I personally feel the community should be cautious provided they fund the proposal.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 4, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2028, "q0": "Interoperability is one of the key ideas of Cardano. We know that this is important for supporting decentralization and even scalability in the Cardano ecosystem.

However, I enjoy reading through these different ideas. I like that this proposal gives a clear statement on their potential risks/challenges with this proposal. It may be hard to find the dedicated members that will be willing to bring these parties together, but if done correctly, this idea will promote the idea of interoperability and help educate newer users on why that is important in Cardano.

It is clearly explained where the funds are going to be used. This also helps the community to keep the team accountable to be successful with their proposal if funded.

Of course, this is in general a valid statement, however it does not shed light on a very specific topic and is rather broad in my opinion. The proposed solution is to organize 6 meetings to be held, but it is not very clear between whom, and at the end the meetings a protocol would emerge, but it is not clear for what purpose other than \u201cauthentication\u201d. The overall vagueness leaves a lot to be desired and there is no clear way to link the proposal to the challenge.

For future iterations I highly recommend that at least the core team behind the projects comes out to light with names and even Linkedin profiles available. \n\nIn terms of budget there are many questions to be asked and the logic behind it is not very clear. For instance, participant fees are an important part - will they be industry experts, general audience, or whom exactly? It is not clear at all. Every other budget caption is also vague and / or out of logic - i shall spare you the details here. I highly advise that future iterations make a much more clear budget, perhaps employ some outside help in order to structure the information better. \n\nTimewise, the project would take 6 months. In the first month we would have built the coalition of participants, drafting the process and research of participants. The next months would see the meetings taking place, closing meetings and a closing meeting. Again a very clear lack of structure in the timeline. \n\nIn a nutshell, poor feasibility across the board.

This structured and incentivized approach is well thought out and it will make it easy for any authentication-related project to follow. Although a bit pricey, this can, on the other hand, cut costs down the line when others don't have to figure out what standards to follow. It is also very important that authentication solutions are mutually interoperable.

There are two points that I would like to see improved, however. First, I would have enjoyed seeing at least some inclination what those participating projects could be, to understand whether the formation is starting from the scratch or if efforts have been taken to get things going already. Second, when discussing the risks, I have a feeling Philip didn't dig deep enough. Rather than just saying \"people might not come\", it's important to ask \"why they wouldn't come\".
