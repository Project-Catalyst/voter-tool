The progress is not clear in terms of numbers. About the group here, there is only one author and I don't see what the author lists his experiences. Identity is difficult to determine, I think the author should cite his related documents in the proposal such as what he is currently doing, years of experience, links to personal pages such as LinkedIn, Twitter...
