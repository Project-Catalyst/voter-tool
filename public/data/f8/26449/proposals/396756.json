More than 30% of the total challenge budget, but a fairly brief explanation of what needs to be allocated. The proposal will be sustainable if there is a division of the budget table for each implementation budget in the project. Another aspect would be beneficial to have more relevant profile information or a short presentation of the core team members. Include working time and budget allotted to them.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal provides a plan for each work to be done in the project, but without a clear timetable and KPI figures.

In addition, no details on the team's experience and competence. The budget breakdown and cost analysis is superficial and there is no basis to relate the estimates to the task to be done.

Also, the percentages presented don't add up and the wrong currency is used for the budget. It's nice that you think in ADA though ;-) Technical details are only explained coarsely. Feedback: I think your proposal has a lot of merit, but it seems as if it has been written in a bit of a haste. It would be a shame if that idea got lost by lack of planning.
