The process is highly technical as it includes knowing the storage technology as well as some implementation details of native tokens on Cardano. For the layperson, it is very difficult to verify authenticity of NFTs without using some kind of tool. \n\nOne scenario is that an NFT by a legitimate source is copied one to one by a fraudster. They copy the metadata and create a new NFT. In this case, the only identifier within the two NFTs that will help distinguish between the legitimate and the fraud is the policy id. This ID will likely be on the website of the legitimate publishers of the NFT. Anyone who want to verify must find it and check the website. Needless to say, it's a complicated and effortful process. One that is completely untenable for an end user who just wants to browse and buy an NFT without having to worry about its authenticity.\n\nThe problem is entirely in line with the challenge. It aims to study this problem; gathering information from the stakeholders (marketplaces, wallets, minting tools, NFT creators) facilitating discussion and working on a unified solution. The proposal aligns with the challenge in many ways:\n1 - incentivize collaboration across the NFT space to solve the verification problem\n2 - introduce common standards on the verification problem\n3 - ensure the existence of a cohesive knowledge base - the outcome of the proposal will be designs for a new standard tool\n4 - support a network of technology ambassadors - the stakeholders will be connected through the efforts of the proposers", "q0r": 5, "q1": "NFT Guild is the proposing group behind the proposal. They are a strong group with well known figures from the Catalyst community. Felix Weber is a Swarm Founder. Peter Wolcott is a Swarm Veteran. Their experience running Catalyst Swarm has surely provided them with a large network. They can easily perform the outreach necessary to collect information from the various stakeholders of the project. The rest of the team also bring in relevant and extensive experience. They are active in various NFT projects and are themselves stakeholders who want this problem solved. I have full trust this team is fully capable of delivering on this proposal. \n\nThe plan has two parts: In the first two months, the proposers will gather information from the stakeholders. They will bring new guild members to NFT Guild, create and send surveys to stakeholders, conduct workshops with partners and hold discussions. In month 3, the gathered data will be used to design standards and possible solutions. The design will be published and reviewed by guild members. It is a detailed plan outlining the critical steps need to be taken to accomplish the goals.\n\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The aims of the proposal are entirely clear. The plan provides details for both phases. For auditability, all progress on standards will be made available on a public github repository. This will allow any observer to immediately see progress. There will also be weekly calls where progress is shared and discussed. Their Discord server is open for anyone who wants to participate. \n\nThe proposers also provide a list of KPIs/OKRs that will help track the success of the proposal and NFT Guild in general. These are good to keep in mind for any future auditors. \n\nOverall this is a clear, auditable proposal that outlines the deliverables, the steps to get there and the place where information will be available. Great work!", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1323", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 4, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you for supporting our proposal!"}, {"id": 1605, "q0": "The proposal introduces the idea of having a set of standards for encrypting NFTs and validating minted NFTs. This idea will be realized by bringing together a group of communities, NFT marketplaces to discuss together, gather insights to better define the problem. I think this idea is good because it helps standardize current NFTs so that owners can validate them as valuable. However, the challenge here is how will you standardize and verify NFT when encoding real-life assets into NFT?\n\nI think it's all about the idea, but there is not really a specific solution to standardize this. I think it would be more feasible for you to add a sketch of the process to standardize the NFT", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Your budget breakdown is too general. Voters will have a hard time understanding how much you spend on each specific job. For example, what kind of work does a workshop to develop standards include that costs $15,000? The more details, the more voters will understand your project. Help increase success when funding.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "KPIs are essential to measure the success of a project. The criteria for success you have mentioned but need to be quantified into specific numbers. This helps you determine what needs to be done, keeping track of the progress of the work to complete it better.\nIn addition, you just have a plan to make a website to publish information, but not yet. It will be difficult for the project to gain credibility from the voter.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1394", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "The requested funds are ment to be used as a treasury for the proposal work. The usage will be fully transparent for the community. Who did what, how much it cost. When payment was done. \nThe unknown number of tools we need to connect with, the unknown number of marketplaces we will connect with adds up to an uncetainty that makes it difficult for us to estimate a clear budget. We therefore ended with asking for funds to a treasury to be able to pay for contributions."}, {"id": 2100, "q0": "There seems to be no existing standard for NFT tokens and there is a strong need for a robust standard that is able to accommodate more complex use cases, such as Certification of authenticity, public keys, legal issues, copyright, transferability or identity links. The goals of this proposal are (1) to define and establish standards in the NFT space and (2) to create a public roadmap for a NFT Verification Tool to determine additional features and applications necessary in the future. \n\nI think the proposal is very closely aligned with the challenge and the NFT ecosystem would benefit tremendously from an existing standard that can be adopted by developers. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind the proposal is called The NFT Guild and it is a network of NFT / blockchain stakeholders that have come together to promote certain projects of benefit for the ecosystem. It consists of stake pool operators, Catalyst Circle members, artists, entrepreneurs, with a wide range of competencies. Their Discord group already has 175 members - very promising numbers. They plan on inviting all NFT stakeholders to contribute to identification of problems, proposing solutions and defining the scope of standards / projects to endorse. \n\nThe project should take three months to complete. The first phase (2 months) would focus on bringing new guild members and creating surveys to NFT stakeholders for information gathering, processing, and ultimately holding workshops. Last phase (1 month) would focus on using the available data for designing NFT standards. \n\nThe budget is unfortunately a weak spot of the proposal, with a very vague split between captions. Workshops to develop standards would consume most of the money, which actually makes sense. Perhaps they can employ the services of another product funded by Catalyst - Consenz in order to increase their efficiency and help to cross-promote viable projects amongst themselves. \n\nIn conclusion, a solid team with a good plan, but definitely needs to do a better job in the future at detailing its budget requirements. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The first version of the standards should be published in a public github site and reviewed by the NFT Guild members and partners. The team would also host a weekly call where progress would be shared with the community. The compensation of contributions from the project treasury will be fully transparent. They also plan to set up a website early this year. \n\nA very solid plan, I really value their attitude towards openness.
