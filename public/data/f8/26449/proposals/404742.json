We are in the social network era now, so we need to approach with user-generation direction because that way can create huge, diversified content and I can make users stay longer in any channel. \n\nYour idea is to create a content platform like Wiki for Cardano in Vietnamese, I feel very interesting because it helps me a lot when I want to get knowledge about Cardano, and also I can introduce my friends to use this platform if they want to learn about Blockchain technology.  \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I see your team already have the demo website for this project, it is so nice for the proposal because we truly believe that your team is so serious and give a lot of effort to this project, and this is a reason can make your project successful (maybe without funded in this round).\n\nLike any content platform, the quantity of content is important but the quality of content is more important. So in the early period of this project, your team can take a lot of time to manage content to make sure it can make impressive for users when they go to your website.

The proposal fits the Open Standards & Interoperability challenge. I completely agree. I agree with this suggestion. I have been experienced as a project researcher in the crypto market for 2 years. It reminds me of my early days in this blockchain space. It is difficult for newbies start learning about a knowledge that is only written in academics and mathematical equations, and the major cryptocurrency websites nowadays mostly only provide articles but don't really organize resources, knowledge in a scientific way for readers. Most of all, a point that I really like is relying on the power of contributions from the community. With a community, we will go further and be more sustainable.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I agree with the challenge you face, I have an additional idea to help you prepare better. We need to reward contributors commensurate with their understanding. A mechanism to give NFT to contributors to participate in Private sale rounds is also an attractive reward, but I think it will be more encouraging to the community if you can give them shares of your project. I mean the project where you issue tokens and one of them goes to the biggest contributors. It's also worth thinking about.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I strongly agree with the milestone you set to measure the success of the project.

However, in phase 2 building a topic and posting 200 posts, but in phase 3 just starting to build a moderation group, is there any confusion here? Or maybe I don't understand what you mean, please discuss to clarify. Also, does the site look up word definitions like it does on the wiki?

Another bonus point for this is the team event creates a test interface for the community to have a clear picture of what will be done. This idea is also easy to scale up to other languages like Wikipedia. The proposal has also mentioned the rewarding mechanism for the valued contributors.

There is a great summary of the team's information and references on Facebook and Linked. The community could understand the responsibilities of each team member and check for their relevant experience. There is only one minor comment. Since the graphic designer is also 1 in 3 key members of the project, they should mention the criteria for hiring him/her. The team has a very high level of risk control.

Another metrics to measure the quality of the content should be added, like user rating for each content. By tracking it, the community could easily evaluate  the quality of the website.

A number of posts were posted. A number of edited articles. A number of visitors to the website. The success of this proposal has described the results achieved. However, for the proposal, I am still wondering how to reach 20,000 visits per month from Vietnam and 500,000 internationals.
