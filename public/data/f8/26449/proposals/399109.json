That they have already assembled a dev team further enhances the feasibility of completion.\n\n\"At the moment, we have a brilliant team of three backend developers, two frontend developers, one designer, and one system administrator. They all have experience and understanding of the Cardano blockchain since we already built ADAPlus blockchain explorer and currently working on an open-source mass-payment solution.\"\n\nAll together - one of the few 5-5 Stars proposals, in my book ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is a bit light on auditability, simply saying they will launch their solution on two websites as a test, then seek others.
