For a proposal of this size, I need to be seeing market research on what level of interest exists for this kind of thing, how many digital tickets are being distributed currently, and maybe appeal for event organizers to adopt such a thing (cost, ease of use, verifiability, etc.). The impacts need to be more tangible as an evidence-backed argument that clearly paints the picture of what a post-proposal world looks like. There also needs to be an explanation of the logistical practicality of such a project. There needs to be information on how this project will work and DEFINITELY what uniqueness this project brings to the table. Why is this project innovative (the core tenet of Catalyst). Why can't event organizers go to NFTmaker.io or some other NFT minting service, so that Catalyst doesn't have to lose $175k of funding for other (potentially more efficient) projects? Especially with the lacking of these details, I am not convinced that this project deserves 35% of the entire fund with impact statements like \"possibly mainstream adoption.\"  I might have voted this project up a star if I could see some specific reference to what entertainment professionals are being talked with. References to reputable names can help add a lot of credibility to the proposal. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "I almost bump this proposal up a star because of the reference to specific event organizers with links. However, the language used to describe the relationship seems loose and not reliable. I don't end up giving any weight to it because the proposal is far too expensive. The roadmap is not much of a roadmap without specific information about timelines/dates, actions, technical steps, marketing strategies, and not in the hypothetical fashion that it is presented here. The roadmap is a necessary stock issue that has to be much cleaner, with more detail and concrete planning. There is also no resume provided for the proposer. The reference to cardanogoat.io is not a comprehensive view of the professional experience that is brought to the table, which is absolutely essential for a proposal of this cost. I need a LinkedIn profile. I have no idea of the technical capability for the proposer to produce a high-level professional product that appeals to entertainment professionals. I have no clue if the proposer has any experience in the entertainment industry that qualifies the successful negotiation with event organizers. A lot of professionals won't work with anyone that doesn't know the business, which casts serious doubts on any hope of potential mass adoption. Lastly, the budget gives no detail. The budget doesn't actually add up to $175k concretely. The budget can go as high as $189,400, for developers working a full 5 months OR it can go as low as $147,800 (leaving $27,200 unaccounted for). It also doesn't make sense to me that $75k is allocated to on-site event staffing when that is entirely the responsibility of the vent organizers to pay for. As you can already tell, the budget is not very specific at all. It only gives 2 broad categories of where money is going to and it gives no information on why it would cost that much. There's no breakdown of hourly rates for labor, what type of labor, hardware costs, electricity, server maintenance, marketing, or anything. This is necessary information to determine if money is being spent efficiently and appropriately, for which this proposal has much more pressure to prove. If I had to sum it up with one bit of advice for improvement, it would be that this proposal needs so much more detail. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "These are not auditabilty goals or measures of success. These are points for things that the proposal wants to get done. There's a big difference. Measures of success need to be quantified with specific metrics that display the true impact of the product. Such as how many event ticket NFTs were distributed or how many clients have been obtained for this platform. I tend to look for specific target numbers that the project is aiming for that demonstrate a true concrete goal that the project is aiming for. It tells me that the proposer has an acute sense of the tangible impact that could be made as a result of proposal approval. For a proposal of this cost, I want to be seeing milestone-based metrics, specific social media targets, a specific number of events solicited on the platform, and a target number of clients that are organizing these events. The offer of Github updates is good but there's nothing to hold the proposer to if there aren't metrics to measure success by. I also think there need to be more avenues of accountability to ensure success. More detail needed.

I'm not 100% convinced but would like to be persuaded by a later iteration of this impact statement. \n\nA reusable, open-source package could have wide application across many dApps should event tickets prove to be a good candidate for NFTs. The proposer could probably go a bit farther in laying out the value proposition for the project, however. What are currently the major pain points for event ticketing, and how does this solve them? What kind of demand has the proposer encountered for event ticketing NFTs in speaking with contacts in the entertainment and event industries?\n\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer presents a completed project of similar scope as a demonstration of technical ability and is adequately convincing in that regard. The project is, additionally, dependent on relationship-building with individuals in the event-planning industry, which presents some possible points of failure. The proposer is in talks with some individuals in the industry, but I don't have a sense of how much experience they have in forging successful relationships of this type. \n\nAdditionally, the proposer could be a lot clearer about how the requested $175,000 will be spent. As it stands, the majority will be going to an uncertain number of developers, and possibly just to the proposer. $75,000 is flagged for event-related expenses, which needs a lot of elaboration.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Despite my aforementioned concerns under Feasibility, I think the proposer lays out a solid roadmap for accountability and transparency for this project.  As this project is ultimately intended to be an open-source resource, however, I'd like to see some milestones addressing how and when the proposer plans to make the tool available to other developers, and how the proposer plans to go about raising the tool's visibility to the Cardano developer community.

Requiring it just in case events to integrate into are not found is not acceptable in my opinion. \n\nThe rest of the budget is 100K USD but there is an issue there as well. 5,200 USD is reserved as a weekly wage for 2 developers for 14 weeks. That is a monthly wage of 10K USD+ per developer.

On your next attempt on submitting a proposal, try to include with details of what type of employee that you need in order to successfully implement the project such as UI/UX designer, marketing, event coordinator etc. Furthermore, the budget requested are not clearly broken down. Include detailed budget breakdown of the requested funds on what are the cost of each of the individual items that you required and also the cost of hiring staff per monthly or hourly basis. Moreover, there is no timeline given for every phase of the plan. On your next proposal, provide a timeline for each execution of your plan. For example, how long will it takes for you to setup the policy, is it 1 month? 2 months? What about the phone ticketing app, what is the timeframe to deliver the app? In addition, the plan presented on how you would implement the project are also unclear. Explain how a normal person who never had an experience of cryptocurrency pay for the ticket? Is there a payment processor that has already created by you? Also what is the method of authentication? If the authentication is simply by scanning the image of the ticket, it will raise a concern of forgery. The proposer identifies the risks and challenges that he might face during the implementation. There is another point to note on the risks which is ticket forgery. Some users usually post their ticket online as they are excited to attend the event. If someone would copy the image and use it for himself, how do you mitigate this?

The proposal does not include information about the roadmap, milestones, or timescales for achieving the desired results. I'd also like to see a deeper level of budget allocation included in the output.

You say the project needs 2-3 developers but if you can afford it you will do it automatically. I have no doubts about the author's ability, however, if the author has to work alone, will this project take the time and the amount required by the budget is appropriate?
