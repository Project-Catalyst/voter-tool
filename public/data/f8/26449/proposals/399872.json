The project aims to provide up-to-date information and data on the governance environment, (developing toward the intention of a subscription model), however in terms of specifically addressing the challenge to create either standards or common infrastructure to be used by projects in the community to 'collaborate, discover, understand, test, and contribute to existing O.S. projects' it appears to sadly fall short. \n\nIt seems that the project was trying to sub-divide their larger scale activity into different challenges, but the challenge here is not addressed, and while KPIs are given they are not specific to the challenge.
