Leading with this, the proposal aims to create a minting NFT platform for real asset movement certification. I find a very poor fit between the challenge and the proposal, although the problem identification touches the right chords. Somehow the overall level of detail is simply not sufficient for me to deem this proposal worthy of consideration as a viable solution. A few words and a catch-phrase are not sufficient in this case, sadly. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I am afraid there is not much good news here. There is next to no information regarding the team, other than it comprises specialists in the supply chain and a website developer, possibly the same person. The project would take 6 months to deliver, and regarding the budget there are no figures, just word explanations that the budget will be broken down in three parts. Given the small amount it is rather understanding. \n\nAgain, a very poor feasibility assessment across the board. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The team proposes the following metrics: number of partnerships with developers, number of brands that want to work with the project, number of NFT transactions and active users. I find an overall lack of interest in detailing the project further, for instance how do you measure \u201cwanting to work\u201d? \n\nI urge the proposers to come back with a much more comprehensive proposal.

The solution is structured with details and an easy visualization. \nThe idea of using the benefits of traceability to another industry sector is incredible and has a sense of collaboration that go beyond of Cardano\u2019s ecosystem. It can be a revolutionary solution for small and medium companies. Choosing food industry and pharma supply prove mindfulness and commitment of the team with this project proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Despite of having no mention of the team members details, the plan has integrity giving the idea that the team has an array of experience and are looking for increasing power with partnerships.\nBesides that, the goal of improving supply chain sustainability gives the idea of an intangible project. So, to be reasonable I recommend exploring the goal\u2019s explanation with small objectives or concrete results.\nThe budget breakdown describes 3 parts however it has no details on how the money will be spent. \nIn summary, the timeframe, budget and overall program were not so clearly detailed.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The success description is well written and clear but not in a tangible way. The metrics were listed appearing to fit in the project context, but also with no objectives setting. All these gaps make the auditability very hard to be done during the monitoring phase.\nThe intangibility makes even more difficult for the team executing the project and achieving success.

This proposal is creating a standard for how these certification and traceability should work, so it will become interoperable with other supply chain projects in Cardano. The solution will be open source and allow for the development of NFT standards and to provide a complete traceability solution in different sector, which will increase the adoption of using Cardano as supply chain traceability solution. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The impact that this could bring is great, however it doesn\u2019t seems like the team have sufficient number of people needed for this project, at least yet. The team consists only of two people, and we can\u2019t verify their profile as they don\u2019t include their profile link. Including the team LinkedIn profile would help the community to verify their previous work and experience. They did include the working code (codepen.io link) and they have a simple working prototype for TeaOnChain, which is to track particular tea supply chain. However, a working product without proper marketing or business relation people would make this project under the radar. I would suggest to include people with business development experience, or a community manager to spread the words about this new idea. Judging from the budget requested, it is relatively small compared to other project. If the intention for creating this technology is to onboard other project to use this standard, then it needs additional people with project management experience. Hence, asking for more fund in this area could help a lot, considering this industry is growing fast and good technology or ideas could slip pass without anyone knowing. So my suggestion would be: bring more people into the team to handle the business or project, in order to spread the words and collaborate with other project. Secondly, I don\u2019t see any roadmap or timeline, which is important for the community to expect when will this project finished. Finally, a $3000 is considered too small, but I can\u2019t further judge this since I don\u2019t know the time of deliveries (timeline).
