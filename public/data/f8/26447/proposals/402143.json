And while such tooling in the hands of experienced PMs would no doubt help us track projects, and support the teams executing the projects, there are immediate concerns with this implementation.  The most concerning is the use of an enterprise level solution for what are usually boot-strapping type projects.  The enterprise pricing suggested is hefty at $8k/10-20 projects...  to distribute throughout Catalyst could be on the order of a couple hundred thousand, which isn't good scaling.  At those price points we are reminded of what usually accompanies these third party solutions, such as ideascale: inflexible APIs that fail to scale in ways that keep up with the emergent nature of the projects on Catalyst.  Furthermore, despite often falling back on free versions of Kanban and Miro and Trello, the Community, as a general rule, is trying to move away from these centralized third party providers with their Web2 privacy and data models.  The ability of teams to adopt free versions of Kanban as and where needed, with individual subscriptions when more functionality is needed, obviates the need to pursue a major funding protocol for implementing it on a wider scale.  To the degree that Kanban is a good idea moving forward, GitHub has a more versatile model that is opensource, and community built tooling would probably be a better path forward.  If this proposal were executed as a training protocol for educating \"self-auditing\" PMs I would see more potential here.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer seems perfectly suited to following through on the implementation of such a proposal, especially the onboarding part where more PMs are trained to train even more PMs, with the ability to organize PMOs outside the context of this proposal.  Beyond that, the onboarding of participants to Kanban boards seems like it wouldn't require many qualifications.  Because of the high cost of the enterprise solution, a third of the project budget is gobbled up right out of the gate.  The remaining funds seem to be disbursed fairly though, keeping a 5 person team in play for 6 months to conduct training and creating educational material, as well as presenting the findings.  The team itself will likely be the two team leads plus undisclosed others, either employess of the Kanban technology provider, or trainees from the community.  The tasks to be finished are not very detailed, but simple enough to understand:  obtain the license, develop a template/protocol, training and demonstration of the protocol, track assistance provided to trainees.  The final phase, where assistance is provided could be hashed out more, as it isn't clear if this is an ongoing support provided by the funding, or if it is part of the license (and whether that benefit, or the license, expires...and then what?).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The deliverables amount to a template/protocol for managing projects with Kanban boards (though it isn't clear how platform specific this template will be.  Hopefully it is transferable between Kanban platforms and especially with GitHub kanban boards), and an indefinite number of training/demonstration presentations, mostly by live video through townhalls and ATHs.  The critical deliverable is probably the post-training assistance, though the nature of it isn't made clear.  It can be expected that the team will make itself available at this time with dedicated channels for proposers and challenge teams to follow up with questions and receive support in implementing the protocols.  If so, it should be easy enough for the community to follow along.  The progress reports for this project will amount to reporting on the delivery of the required templates and training sessions over the first month or so, and after that tracking the total number of instances where the protocols and kanban platform are in use, as well as the amount of assistance/ support calls received and solved.

Finding an open source product that has all the PMO etc capabilities is a real challenge. Also, we will be mitigating the cost by providing one license for each project that the project lead can assign to one or many. The same with the 8 person Audit Committee and Challenge Teams. We have many project leaders in Catalyst and the Stipend is for them to do hands on training and project management advise for the funded projects. We have millions of dollars going out and only a few hundred thousand dollars of completed projects. It would be a lot of effort to see where these projects are because the monthly sheets are basically just to see that folks are still living. The Top down look from the PMO view would allow Challenge Teams and Auditors to see moving projects and reach out to projects that have stalled and maybe help. eg. Help find resources to create NFT etc."}, {"id": 7436, "q0": "The idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal aligns well with the objectives of the challenge. In this challenge, what we are looking for are faster, more practical and efficient ways to audit proposals funded on Catalyst. This need arose because the number of funded proposals grows significantly from one fund to another, making it very difficult for the Cardano community and the IOHK itself to manage well each of these new ideas in execution. This proposal is in line with the solution to this problem as it suggests making auditability in a more standardized way. The idea is, in the words of the proponent, \u201cto provide training in project management using Kanban methods and tools\u201d. Since these methods and tools would come from software and management training offered by the Kanban Zone company. The problem that I identify here is that little is explained about this method and this software. We know, for example, that one of the ways they work is through consultancies, and in this way the support is done more as an advice, not as an order in itself, that is, the official project team would still be free to comply or not certain decisions as the Kanban team's influence would not be the only option. Some things that would be covered in this audit are also described: \u201cManaging project growth / cost benefit / global reach and hosted online / adaptable and simple methods of tracking projects. However, this is still not enough for us to clearly understand how this audit would take place. The proponent also claims that their analysis would be \u201ctop-down\u201d, however, he does not explain in detail what, exactly, he means by that. Therefore, I think the idea is good, but it lacks details on how this service provided by Kanban Zone professionals would be in practice. One suggestion I can make is that they cite an example of a consultancy they have already done, so that we could understand exactly how they work, what is the difference between the audit model they propose and those currently used by teams funded by Catalyst. Therefore, I will give 4 stars for the impact of the proposal, because I believe that yes, it is a relevant idea and that it can generate good results, but there was a lack of explanations about how this would happen in practice, if they had been included, I would certainly have more confidence about the positive impact that the proposal would have on our ecosystem. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is average, because we know the basic information needed to understand the process, budget and team members, however, this information is not detailed enough. Starting with the script. First, it states what would happen in the first month, and then what would be done in the interval between month two and six. The activities are described here in a very superficial way, in addition to the fact that I consider it inappropriate that the proponent has made such a temporal division, from month two to six is \u200b\u200bfour months, this is a very long time, for us to analyze the script carefully it would be more appropriate that this division of tasks be monthly. And regarding the details of the activities, each month should not only contain what would be done, but how it would be done, by whom and how long it would last. Let's take an example: in the first month, one of the activities is \u201cset up a proposal/funded project and audit model for everyone to follow\u201d. As well? What would it be like to configure the proposal and the financed project, would it be in this case to detail the audit model that would be used here? Because if that's the case, in my opinion it would be more interesting if this model was already well detailed and presented in the proposal itself, even before funding. During months two and six, training sessions would be held to talk about the Kanban Zone audit model; where would that happen? Would it be after Town Hall? Who would present these sessions? How would this knowledge be passed on? How many people are expected to attend each session? In my view, from the way activities are described, it is not possible to have a solid understanding of the process. Regarding the budget, I think something similar happens, we know how the total amount requested of 24k USF would be divided, but each of these parts should have been better argued. For example, the team to help the proponents of financed projects and that would receive this consultancy would cost 2 thousand dollars per month, which may or may not be a fair value, depending on how many people would compose this team of consultants, how many hours per week they would work and so on. And finally, speaking of the team, it's about 3 people. About Joey Chesser, all we know is that he is a project management professional. However, we are not presented with a curriculum with examples of previous work, nor do we know how it relates to the Cardano ecosystem, we do not have a social network of yours (such as linkedin) that could prove the said information... We also do not have good information about Sean Sheikholeslam, just his linkedin profile. With Dimitri Ponomateff, we know that he is the CEO of Kanban Zone, and a lot of other information. It would be better if we had the same level of detail for both. They claim that more people from their company or from the Cardano community would be part of the team, but it would be necessary to know who they are and, again, the details I quoted. So I think feasibility is not enough to convey much confidence. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The ways of auditing on purpose suggested by the proponent are also basic, we know that, to accompany the process, the following indicators would be used: number of training sessions and how many participants each subject, the audit methods proposed by the Kanban Zone model We will adapt to the proposals and accompaniment of the tools and reports used by the audit team. I agree that these are the best ways to accompany the development process of the proposal, but one thing that will give me life is how everything will be known by the Cardano community. Could it be that they will prepare monthly reports, with all this information, and make them available to us, through discord, or telegram, or online tools such as notion, look, or google docs? How will essa ponte be given? Now that it would be necessary to clarify this question, because it is so important how much to collect these data and make them easily accessible to all Cardano communities. And finally, in relation to the final results, the success indicators are similar to those chosen to monitor the progress of the proposal, the community would be adapted to the consulting method offered and the company's equipment would also be able to adapt to the needs two proponents and their projects. Therefore, since we should go there, it would be necessary to understand the impact of this consultancy on the process of auditing the proposals. I would like to see the difference in results before and after the team enters the action. It would be interesting to have two of our own proponents who foram the perceived improvements, if the work flowed, if the goals that they pursued were more easily achieved with the guidance of the company's team, and so on. I now have a lot of information to be described in a report, being more appropriate than a meeting in video fosse feita. It could also happen after Town Hall, in a specific room, where the team of the Kanban Zone, some project leaders who will receive consultancy and some members of the Cardano community, who will not participate in the project, could discuss together in a qualitative manner the final results obtained. Therefore, I think auditability is ok, but I still have a lot to improve. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 8, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 5910, "q0": "As the number of funded proposals grows in catalyst, it is essential to have project management tools to help proposers to track, audit and communicate their project in a standarized way. Kanban is a simple but useful framework that defintely can help with that. The proposal is aligned with challenge specially considering challenge kpi \"Number of funded proposals audited\".\nGoing though the website of kanban zone, it is possible to see that the tool provides much more than just a kanban board. it also has several proejct management features (and custom fields) that can help proposers not only to track progress and be audited but do their management, which different levels of privacy.  I also liked a lot that project management trainings will be provided. That is very useful and can certainly help proposers to better lead their projects. it is also nice to see the role of a PMO is taken into account, it is very imporant for a project that is implementing a proj management tool.\nThe main problem I see with this solution is that, as it is a solution provided by a 3rd party, licences need to be purchased and that can limit the number of proposers who can use the tool (or make it really expensive for everyone to have access). For a project management tool, to be used by everyone, in a standard way and in a not so expensive price, maybe a solution developed in-house could work better. For instance, it is said that 50 licences will be bought. what if we have more than 50 adopters/auditors, who need access? Each fund gets more than 200 funded projects, more licences would be needed.\nThat hinders the tool to have a wide adoption from whole community and be the standard tool for tracking project in catalyst and limits the impact of the proposal. Maybe a scale up plan could be mentioned, even if for future challenges.\nRegarding the risk mapped, it makes sense but there's no mitigation strategy mentioned.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In general, project seems highly feasible.\nThere's a time-framed plan with sensible activitiesd involving the development and monitoring after tool is launched for the community.
