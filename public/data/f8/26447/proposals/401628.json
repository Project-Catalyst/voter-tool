His idea is good and he knows that he can find a solution to transparency in politics via better auditing but it still lacks some points that I believe are pillars for him to be able to run a project. At the moment, the author is still in the process of studying and learning about what is a blockchain, how does it work, what are the most important and developed blockchains, what kind of solutions blockchains can support the world, etc. Summed with that, he does not present the proper answers to the questions that would confirm the impact of his proposal.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The author does not propose cost or time feasibility for this proposal. As a suggestion, I would recommend he reinforce the impact session and then come up with timelines, milestones, and costs for him to achieve his objectives.\n\nThe author stands that he is in a solo team at the moment and he does not have knowledge regarding project implementation. Therefore, I would recommend he to search for a leadership and project management library.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Although the author describes with good fundamentals how does success looks like, he does not present any kind of performance measurement methods for his project. He stands that he would defer this role to the experts.

That being said, I'm going to take the proposer's broad request for advice in good faith and see if there's anything useful I can offer him in the sections below. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "This CA would humbly suggest to the proposer that he seek out a team with the expertise needed to provide a modern political campaign with the tools needed to accept donations in ADA. There are a few avenues where he could begin his research. The Cardano partner COTI has developed an ADA payment mechanism called ADApay, for example, that he could look into. Atala Prism provides a basic decentralized identity system that has some promise that could help aid transparency. And many more tools may yet be developed that leverage these innovations or others. \n\nIt would likely require a collection of tools as well as a long-term political action campaign complete with events, marketing and organizing efforts to eventually make it feasible for political candidates to want to pledge to only take donations in cryptocurrency, and do so in the interest of full transparency. I should note that politicians in America can *already* commit to transparency, in a sense, by swearing off dark money sources like CPACs. But this is currently not a big enough priority for voters to make a dent in our corrupt campaign system. However, who knows, perhaps an alternative kind of commitment around ADA might some day generate more attention as crypto adoption becomes more commonplace.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proposer should put time into assembling his team, including marketers and developers, and he should accept that they will want to be (and should be) paid for their work. Which means complete voluntarism should be off the table. When the team is assembled, they should all be open about who they are and detail the kind of work they wish to perform for and through Cardano right here in Catalyst. If they are funded, and they should regularly provide updates on their progress. \n\nThis last part will become increasingly important, we hope, as other proposers meet the goals of this very challenge. To be transparent is to be open to being checked, criticized and accountable to something greater than oneself. That's not usually easy, if it's done right. But it is worth it. Cheers.
