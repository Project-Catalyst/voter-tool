The proposer is calling for ALL auditability and measure of auditability to be done by them. I would suggest the proposer expands his research to look at ways to still audit past funded projects, but in a decentralized manner. By adding NFTs for the Proof of Accomplishment does not make this project decentralized, it create ownership of a subjective evaluation of accomplishment which itself does not solve any problems.\n\nI can therefore neither agree or disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team seems to be very competent in all aspect except software development. None of the team members\u2019 specific skills includes any kind of software development which does not speak well to the feasibility of a project in which an app needs to be created. The team also included very few risks that could derail the project.\n\nOn a more technical note, measures of auditability are not always clear. The team makes a lot of reference to auditable information, and various subjective measures of accomplishment however there is no mention of the creation of a set of assessment guidelines, or how these guidelines can themselves be independently audited.\n\nWhile I think the team is competent, I do not think this proposal is complete in terms of feasibility. Before attempting a project as big as this, I would suggest the team starts with a collation of all previous proposals that were funded and present them in a manner whereby community members themselves can go and audit as well (and put this into a proposal).", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team provides plenty in terms of KPI and project plan measures of success, however the actual information pertaining to internal and external auditability is very sparse. In a proposal such as this, internal auditing mechanisms are critical to the success of a proposal. These measures provide the means by which the team can ensure they themselves are operating correctly. If implemented, this proposal would establish itself as a trust authority, the potential reputational damage that could be inflicted on future proposals if this store of trust makes a mistake could be huge. \n\nI therefore do not think the presented auditability metrics are enough to provide surety in the sustainability of the proposal.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1248", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 4, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 535, "q0": "In addition to the currently existing audits by the Challenge teams, the proposer would like to establish his own audit. Additional ways of auditing projects are in principal a good idea, but I see the auditing by a single person quite problematic (\u201cCreate a system by which I would contact, discuss with and audit projects\u201d). This opens the door for all kinds of potential corruption. I don\u2019t want to imply that the proposer may fall for this, but I believe it is a systematic problem. Auditing should be done by the community and not by a single person. To improve the idea, it would be better if the proposer would try to improve the existing tool of the community and not try to establish a third-party rating agency. In the end I believe that this kind of work could very likely have a negative impact to the community and therefor the challenge setting.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "While the proposer outlines a rough timeline, further technical information about the app are missing. The claim that \u201cThe tool [\u2026] can store and analyze submitted documents against the listed KPIs and metrics\u201d is very vague. Also, the timeline for build this app is non-existing, apart from \u201cMonth 2 - Completion of App and Proof of Accomplishment meter\u201d. The amount requested is reasonable considering the amount of work to be done.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The criteria for auditability are clear and progress should very well be trackable by the community. The proposer is also involved in a lot of other proposal \u2013 which is in general a good thing, but to an extent, that makes it questionable if he could complete all the proposals if funded. This is not a critique on this proposal, but it raises questions: If more than a few proposals get funded, his own credentials get worthless, because he is not able to complete the role by himself. The credibility and feasibility of this proposal is to some degree dependent on the proposers past experience, but If he doesn\u2019t have the time to be involved he should no make statements like \u201cI would contact each of the funded proposers. I would have to have discussions with them over time .. I would talk to each project...\u201c.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1184", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1071, "q0": "This proposal basically provides exactly what the challenge is requesting: A team willing to do the hard work of auditing Catalyst proposals. There are some interesting questions about systematizing auditing processes that the challenge doesn't really call for strongly but this team seems prepared to work on regardless, to their credit. Ultimately, we need tools and systems through which Catalyst auditing can be done and incentivized, instead of individual teams offering their competencies-for-hire fund by fund. It's good that this team seems to recognize the need, at the moment, for both.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Talking to at least ten projects a week is pretty ambitious but reasonable. The team has the relevant experience and software development chops to pull off something like this task and development of their app combined. The team also benefits from Mr. Fernando's extensive experience and devotion to Catalyst. \n\nThat being said, Mr. Fernando's LinkedIn page is very much in need of an update. \n\nAlso, there is some interesting room for further development that the proposal doesn't really address: The team will be focusing on projects from Fund1-4 for now, as they are most likely to be complete. However most successful projects rightly list milestones for the months immediately following their approval, well before their work is finalized. They should be reporting their progress on these milestones to the community as they are reached, in addition to providing verification of accomplishment after it's all done. \n\nWill the app offer proof of accomplishment for these roadmap milestones? Arguably, something like this would be useful. Sometimes to consider in future proposals, or adding to this proposal if it doesn't get approved.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The KPIs are what we should expect. But to me, this is the big success metric: \"Standardizing [the Proof of Accomplishment App] and making it Open Source so we can offer it as a tool for other Auditing projects as well as Funding Organizations to use with some percentage of revenue share.\"\n\nThe important thing is for this team to build a useful tool, not just for them to use, but for other auditors to leverage in their own proposals, and for other developers to potentially develop further. The ultimate success of this proposal is their systematic impact that could influence Catalyst projects for years to come.

The proposal has not identified what the system would be although it explains what the system aims to achieve. The proposal would receive the higher score if it clearly explains how the funded proposers can accumulate proof of accomplishment over time (collection of NFT based on KPIs is not viable as each projects has different number of KPIs and some KPIs are also qualitative). Also the NFT is non-fungible in nature and hence each piece of NFT is unique and might not be able to accumulate as such unless you can align different projects with similar set of KPIs.

The proposed solution is coherent, strongly correlated with the problem and with the potential to achieve one of the objectives of the challenge, which is to monitor the evolution of the funded proposals without demanding too much effort from the IOG.\n\nTalking more about the correlation with the challenge, one issue was still unclear. Apparently, the proposal seeks to execute two actions in parallel (1) trigger project leaders to collect information for the audit and (2) develop a Proof of Accomplishment System.\n\nThis being the case, I am concerned that it depends on the really intense effort to cover the individualized audit for all proposals from fund 1 to 4. In this way, we would end up returning to a scenario of hard work to monitor the proposals that received funding.\n\nIn the comments section, the author justified that this would be temporary, until the system is finished and, in fund 9, the work can be more fluid.\n\nFollowing this premise, I think that the focus of the proposal should be to develop and implement the system, after validation as an MVP of a sample of projects. Thus, we focus our efforts on what can really be scalable and leave the individualized work for just the execution of a pilot.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The authors of the proposal, as well as the team, have solid experience and training necessary for the development of the project. In addition to the aforementioned certifications and decades of experience, they provided references on their experiences with blockchain applications.\n\nRegarding the plan, considering the assumptions I mentioned earlier, the proposal does not clarify how the initiatives will be developed and the detailing by stages. Apparently, the plan has been reduced to a specific part of the process, which is to receive the information and enter it into the system. I have two thoughts on this:\n\n1. As a detailed schedule was not presented, I understand that the system has not yet started to be developed, therefore, it cannot be used for data entry. It would be important to clarify this.\n\n2. This part of the process is not enough to convey a clear idea of the schedule. In this case, it is important to detail the plan and its timeline in more detail.\n\nAs for the budget, this is another part that lacks information. We basically have 2 pieces of information, the hourly cost for collecting information and the closed cost for system development. The proposal can be better elaborated detailing this calculation.
