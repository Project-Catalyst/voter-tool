The problem here is that the explanation on how this Dapp would work is quite insufficient, we don't know exactly how this technology would work. Indeed, the issue of how winning teams manage the funding they receive is a real one, and I believe it is one of the most important things to be audited by the Cardano community. If the proposer had explained in detail how this technology would work, in a way that was accessible to others (ie, in not-so-technical language), I would certainly have given full marks to the impact of this proposal. However, unfortunately, the way the idea is explained, we couldn't see how this Dapp would fulfill the objective of auditing the teams' financial expenses. The excerpt \u201cWallets linked to the token are not used for expenses. That means we would have to have a catalyst requirement to use the wallet that owns the token\u201d is quite confusing, I really didn't understand what the proposer meant by that. So I think the idea is good in theory, but we don't have a solid understanding of how the application would work so we can't trust its impact. I suggest the proponent stick to their idea (the design intent is great) and fill the proposal with details, explanations, and examples of how this Dapp would work in practice. Therefore, I will give it 2 stars, I think it is not valid for an idea to be presented (as much as it is very consistent with the objectives of the challenge) but not adequately explained. \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal roadmap is not adequate because the proposer only informs what would have to be done, but does not detail how and also tells us when. He would need to determine how long each of these activities would take, for example: \u201cWin \u200b\u200bthe tokens, decide what properties they have (single fungible token for each round of catalyst)\u201d. This is work for how long, 3 weeks, 2 months? It is difficult to visualize the project development process, especially if we are not from the technological professional environment. The minimum that should be done here is a division into months, that is, in which months the activities mentioned would be carried out. That way, we would have a much better understanding of what was about to happen. The ideal would be for the proponent to explain more details about the activity, to have divided the time period into months (and they into weeks) and also to indicate who would be responsible for each thing. About funding, I thought this part was much better than the script, as we know how the total amount would be divided into \u201csmall\u201d parts (actually, the asking amount is quite high). The money would basically be used to pay the salaries of the professionals involved, and we also know how many hours per month each one would work, that is, about this part, we understand what is being said very specifically. Now, speaking of the team, this part is not described the way it should, because we have little information about those involved, so we cannot know them so well and so we cannot develop as much confidence in relation to the team's preparation to execute the proposal. All that is said are the names and professional functions of each member, the experiences are presented very briefly, it would be necessary for a more elaborate curriculum to be informed as well. Also, it is always critical, in my opinion, that linkedin profiles, or github, or portfolios (in the case of those who work with design) are provided; in other words, some way of verifying the information that was said. Therefore, I think the feasibility of this proposal still has a lot to improve. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I think auditability is pretty superficial. Starting with the analysis of progress, two forms of auditability are suggested, but neither is well explained. What would \u201cscrum\u201d be in \u201cWeekly SCRUM Meetings (Agile Practices, CI/CD)\u201d? I believe the proponent has tried to explain in parentheses, however it still remains inaccessible to me. What purpose would these meetings have? Who would be meeting? The whole team, or just a few participants? The proponent claims that it would be possible to \u201cTrack the expenses of our own project in a public and transparent way\u201d, however, what form is this? How does he intend to make this information accessible to everyone? I think it would be very important to clarify this, mainly because the proposal addresses exactly this factor (budget auditability). Speaking of the bottom line, the goal cited by the proponent of \u201cHaving a dashboard that tracks spend/motives for each Catalyst project in one place\u201d is basically a repeat of what is said in impact. He doesn't outline a scenario of success, what he does is restate what would be done here. It is necessary that the author of the proposal and his team study ways to safely perceive the consequences of this project for the Cardano community. Has auditability really benefited? And if so, how can we prove it? How will this information reach the members of our ecosystem? Unfortunately, I don't think there are any objective and valid ways to monitor this project, and this part needs a good improvement. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 4, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1888, "q0": "The proposal problem statement is not very clear, by catalyst project, does it mean Project Catalyst, Catalyst funded proposal, spending from the Project catalyst to the funded proposals or spending of the funded project to their team members etc.\nThe solution likewise is unclear, who is keeping track of who spending funds in a Dapp?

This is something that you seldom see in a proposal these days. An excellent one-phrase-pitch to a real problem, with a real solution easy to imagine. So, the proposer correctly highlights a big Catalyst pain point - there is no way of tracking the spendings of each catalyst project. The solution identified is again simple and powerful: \ndistribute 1 token to each winner of Catalyst, which would tag their wallet and keep track of how they're spending funds in a Dapp. A simple and elegant solution, perfectly aligned with the challenge I say, and an excellent potential to scale future auditing efforts.

This is a huge plus knowing that there is a track record behind it, especially with a product specific to the community. \n\nUnfortunately there is a huge missed opportunity for the team to dive into the project and explain how it would work in detail. While not trying to take away any of their competence, especially in terms of web / app development, I think the project should also comprise a very important analysis with regards to tokenomics, flow of funds, potentially KYC issues, gate-keepers but also an open discussion with the Catalyst treasury in terms of token redeemability, potentially pegging it to a stablecoin.\n\nI am highly skeptical that without a careful analysis of the above mentioned items it is likely to fail its mission.

I think this is a massive undertaking and the volume of that work must be taken into account and the correct processed be put in place in order for this to work smoothly, and I am not sure that at this point the team has sufficient manpower / expertise within in order to act as \u201cauditors'' of each and every funded project.

Its goal is to use a dapp and NFTs to track proposals\u2019 expenditures. I think that this proposal can provide some good value to the community because it will help bring some more transparency to the auditing process. I think that this proposal ties into the \u201cfinancials\u201d aspect of the challenge setting. However, I am a bit confused about the application of the proposal, which could lead to a lower impact. The proposers say that they will create this dapp, but I am wondering how it will actually function to track the expenditures of funded teams? While it seems like a great idea in theory, I could imagine that it would be very difficult to track expenditures from proposers\u2019 ada wallets via only an NFT. For example, what happens when a proposer sells their ada for fiat? I think the proposers touched on this slightly when they mentioned potential challenges, but they did not really provide a strong solution to the challenge, only saying that catalyst needs to have a \u201crequirement to use the wallet which has the token.\u201d If the proposer could clarify this statement, it would greatly improve the proposal.

The proposers have listed some of their qualifications, but there is no way to verify their credentials since there are no external links to something like linkedin. The proposers say that the project can be completed in 8 weeks with the proper planning. What kind of planning? Additionally, there is no roadmap provided for this proposal, so I have no idea what tasks they will be completing when. The proposers also did not provide any technical information about the dapp, so I don\u2019t know exactly how it will function in practice. How will the app use a token to track the expenditures of proposals? Also, I am fairly confident that the majority of funds for some proposals go to paying their developers, so how can this dapp account for that? How can the dapp track these payments? With regards to the budget, the proposers have provided a broken down budget that indicates how the requested funds will be delegated. I can clearly see how they will spend the funds should they get funded. I don\u2019t have experience as a developer, but the funds seem reasonable given the scope of the proposal. In the future, I recommend that the proposers include more information about how they plan to achieve their goal and also create a roadmap.

Also, there are no other metrics of success included, except for the dashboard to track the spending of proposals. There are no KPIs included that the cardano community can use to track the success of this proposal. I think the proposers could include much more. For example, is there a degree of accuracy that the proposers are hoping for? I would imagine that not all funds would be able to be accounted for using this system, so could there be a degree of accuracy KPI?
