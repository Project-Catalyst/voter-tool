Also the proposal discussed here is just one of four submitted by WBL in different challenges. The proposing team tries to make the data on the previous funds computable. This includes mainly the extraction of data from idealscale (via the API), as well as getting a view into Github Repos of existing projects and the impact of projects on social media. The impact of collecting all the data, analyze it and make it publicly available to the community would be great and helpful for the Catalyst-Community and therefor also fits the challenge. The proposers deliver a clear roadmap and also try to integrate the community in the progress. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers are aware of the problem collecting the data, especially getting the data from idealscale. The idealscale API is not completely publicly available and different attempts from different team/proposals already tried to get the data or at least find a workaround \u2013 seemingly with very limited success so far. Maybe being a subsidiary to a very known company like Wolfram, makes it easier to come up with a solution, but nonetheless, the core problem lies in getting the data from idealscale. Everything else (getting data from Github/social media) is just an optional add-on and will likely deliver by itself not much value. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal is well written and good to understand. I hoped for more transparency regarding the other proposals in other challenges and how they are related or even depend on this proposal to be successfully voted on (e.g. Dashboard).

That would detract from the value of a open governance ecosystem such as Catalyst.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is enough information to say that the group has provided a detailed consideration of the feasibility of this project.

I would want to see more detail about what that 5k looks like.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team provides ample audit opportunities that can be tracked.

That's what makes this proposal stand out: It's offering to build tools for the community to make auditing work better and faster. And even though that's not technically what the challenge requests, which is direct work auditing proposals, it is something that definitely serves that purpose and serves it in a systematic way, which is arguably of higher importance for the long term. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The experience of the team presented here is very impressive, and the plan is solid. The amount requested is substantive, 25% of the fund, but appropriate for a team of seven with strong backgrounds in their fields wishing to conduct six months of work that should, if successful, make everyone else's work better and easier. \n\nI do have one question: If they're going to begin by creating curated data sets from Fund1-7, it would be good to see some detail on how they will manage info from this (fund 8) and future funds. After all, by the time their project is complete in six months, we'll probably be in the thick of Fund 10. How will their project manage developments in real time? Some food for thought, I hope.\n\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPIs presented are reasonable. I would have liked to see a bit more information on exactly how they're going to take part in ongoing communication with community members who will use this information. For example, one KPI is \"number of community advisors educated on tools.\" There is also a plan for a communication phase, six months from now, that includes town hall breakout rooms, video conference reports and reports on social media. Great, but where and how will this education of CAs be taking place? Will there be instructional videos? Will it be part of these zoom meetings? Discussions in Telegram or Discord? All viable options but the important education aspect of this project could stand to be a little more fleshed out. We want people to use this product, after all.\n\nOtherwise, I see no other real flaws to pick at.
