An auditing platform that organizes information about funded projects and the KPIs could be exactly what the auditing system needs.

A newsletter and brand new platform may be a nice step, but it also may not be enough.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "On this category it seems like a coin flip to me. Drawing on my own comms expertise, here's why: Cardano Feed looks like it's the beginning of something nice, but its Twitter feed doesn't get anywhere near the amount of engagement from its audience you might expect. And its Facebook feed is barely anything at all with just 348 followers at the time of this assessment and basically no engagement to speak of. Aggregating news is nice but impact depends on consistent and active audience engagement, so there's still a way to go here before the leadership of this team can really think of it as a significant accomplishment. \n\nFurthermore, I'd like to see more info on their software engineer's accomplishments. Mr. Barcelos may indeed be a magnificent talent, but it's hard to be sure without any past accomplishments listed, and a platform like this will rely heavily on his ability. So some examples of achievements would help reassure doubts. Even if he's relatively new, it would be fine to say that openly, so long as it's paired with an example or two of what he can do.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The calendar presented for accomplshments is thorough and well-presented. The ask (about 1/9th the total fund) is reasonable and the funding distribution is sensible. \"Number of registrations\" and \"number of evaluations\" are the two key metrics they provide to keep in mind in the future, for anyone interested in auditing the auditing system.

The plan is divided in tasks by month and we can see that the official launch of the platform will be in 6 months after funding.\nThe budget of the proposal is somewhat broken down by specialist, but it does not show the number of hours and the hourly rate for each position. However this is a large scope project and the budget is on the very low side of the possible IMO.\nThe team is formed by young diverse specialists, maybe that explains the low pricetag.

The milestones are necessary in order to have gradual release of the funds of the proposal to the proposer. Therefore one should take a step by step approach in creating the auditability section of a proposal.

It would be interesting to understand the path that led the authors to this question. What information was considered in this analysis, eg.\n\nRegarding the correlation with the challenge, I believe the proposal partially meets. In a way, the idealized tool contributes to transparency, monitoring and evaluation of the data entered.\n\nHowever, there is a crucial concern of the challenge that remains without coverage. Dependence on the availability, updating and accountability of data can produce a project management platform with low reliability, compromising the need for auditing required in the challenge.\n\nIn a way, this consideration was included among the risks of the proposal.\n\nIn addition to these points, the authors clarify other complementary ways to generate value for the ecosystem.

According to the management methodologies that I was trained in, I think a validation step in this plan would be interesting.\n\nWe already know one of the risks is in the behavior of the use of the platform by the project teams. Before starting to develop the architecture of a platform, a task that will require 6 months of construction and financial resources for implementation, I would like to validate this hypothesis in an MVP pilot, perhaps with a smaller number of features or even contracting an existing solution. on the market for a small audience.\n\nThis will help with planning and avoid wasting time and money.\n\nA final consideration would be about the risks described. Those that have been informed make sense, but there is another potential risk that is worth considering. Authors should think about data standardization. This transparency and audit effort needs to be accompanied by an alignment on what information needs to be collected by project managers, made available and with reliable sources of calculation.

It's a good project to apply an agile methodology and develop the project with stakeholders, as many features could be developed sprint by sprint and it essential to have only what is really imporant.\nTalking about features, I'd consider including in the tool, features that allow for schedule (like gantt diagram) and WBS construction, budget, resources and risk management, at least. An online place/directory to keep files as spreadsheets and presentation in each project would be awesome too. Essential also that the tool is easily and quickly adjustable/customizable.\n\nFinally, having this tool ready, some dashboards can be buiilt, and maybe a PMO role in Catalyst could be considered, to manage the pipeline, treat data and create visualizations.\n\nMoreover, it is imporant to align with the responsible people after tool deliverable that, if this is indeed a good tool, to make it mandatory for use by funded proposers, in order to have everything updated.\n\nAll in all, a tool like this is essential in catalyst so proposal is very useful.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Scheule is clear and well structured.
