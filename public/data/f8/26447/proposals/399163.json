As it is understood that cardano funding is a means of funding useful and impactful products built on cardano ecosystem and the proposers can be requesting considerably high amount of funds to full fill their requirement to achieve their goal/develop proposed solution to the problem, and so this amount funded is to be well accounted for hence the funds proper usage must be monitored. So the solution proposed here being creation of a specific group of individuals (Audit circle) \"The Audit Circle will consist of members from the Catalyst Audit Community. \". This user group will closely be connected with the community and hence will be responsible for its functionality as defined \"The Catalyst Circle has been an effective way to help problem-sense and prioritize problems that can be solved by the community.

These are well defined functions that any Auditing community(circle) should have and for serving this purpose the members are to be closely associated with the cardano community. So as the proposal states the members of this proposing team are well known active community members who have been closely working with cardano organization and fund Auditing process and are well aware of the process being followed by catalyst to fund the proposed projects. Also the members of the team have very well defined the roadmap of hoew they will be bring the  proposed solution to reality with well defined timeline accounting to known risks and challenges and how the will mtigate them.

This directly ties into the \u201cfinancials\u201d part of the challenge setting. Additionally, the Catalyst Audit Circle is tasked with listening to problems related to the reporting system and helping people identify bad actors, prioritizing proposal audit issues, and collaborating with the community to work on solving any issues related to auditing. While this proposal has not specifically addressed any one single issue that they will tackle, I do believe that they will serve as a general purpose group that can be a resource for the cardano community with regards to auditing. The proposers mentioned some potential challenges, but they also added ways to mitigate those challenges, such as working with the IOG team and presenting biweekly slides at the Catalyst Town Hall.

The proposer team has many years of experience in many different fields, ranging from DAOs to accountants to community engagement, so they have the knowledge and skills to make this proposal a reality. They also have a treasury guild that has two members who are very knowledgeable and can provide financial services for funded proposals. The proposers have listed a very good roadmap that is easy to follow. There are key dates, such as when the project will run through, and the different tasks that will be completed during that time. The budget requested is very well laid out, with exactly how much money will be delegated to which tasks, as well as the work hours associated with that funding.

The proposers also included some end goals of the group, which can be used as metrics of success, albeit a bit more subjectively. For example, they aim to ensure that the auditing process remains decentralized and equitable, as well as stable, legitimate, and lively. Although there are no quantitative KPIs given, I don\u2019t think they are necessary for this proposal because the group created has many roles that can\u2019t necessarily be predetermined.

We have seen other sub groups start to form and add value (eg in the CA and vCA space). Telegram and Discord are great 'talking shops' but drilling down to actions and owners takes a bit more coordination. In terms or sustainability and growth i would like to have seen how the proposers envisages the long term need for this circle and possibly more importantly how/if they intend to make it more inclusive and representative of the Catalyst community.

According to what has been said, this group is already active, but with this challenge some improvements will be proposed in its performance, so that they will form a new way of organization (The Catalyst Audit Circle). We can directly understand the activities that will be developed in the part of the proposal \u201cThe Catalyst Audit Circle is tasked with\u201d. Following this sentence, the proponents explain that they will be the ombudsman for issues related to auditability, emphasizing the issue of reports, and will also \u201cCoordinate and collaborate with the community to investigate and develop potential solutions to audit issues\u201d. In other words, the proposal is fully focused on what we are looking for in this challenge, which are faster, more reliable and transparent ways to audit Catalyst-funded proposals. I think it's essential that we have a group of experienced members who deal with this problem exactly, because in my opinion, it's no use funding projects that won't be executed in the way that was promised. So I think this proposal will have maximum impact if done properly. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The description of the activities is good, but it would be more interesting if the proponents, instead of talking about a series of tasks that will be carried out from June to September 2022, explained exactly what would happen in each month within that time frame. I think the way it's been handed down to us, the script conveys a good idea of \u200b\u200bwhat's to come, but it's not the most ideal possible. A very positive point in this proposal is how the authors explain in detail how the parts of the project would be, that is, meetings, research, reports, etc. This allows us to understand not only what would be done but also how it would be done. Therefore, we have a very clear vision of future activities, the only problem is that they are not so well situated in relation to time. Now going to analyze the budget, the explanation of the financing is done together with the activities, I think this is very interesting because we can understand very well the relationship between things and prices. Generally, bidders take the total amount and break it down into parts like development, marketing, etc., but they don't make the link between script and budget that clear. Therefore, in this bias, the explanations are perfect. I also think that the asking price is very fair for the work that will be performed and the benefits that this proposal is likely to generate. Finally, speaking of the team, the team is very strong, we know their names, professional roles and how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem (and they are active members, this is really one of the most experienced teams I've seen in the background). Full confidence in your ability to successfully execute the proposal is conveyed, so I have no criticisms to make on this part. Anyway, the feasibility here is very high, I will give it a maximum score because I think the information given was very enriching and makes us understand solidity all the instances of the project, but I still maintain my suggestion to better define the time of each activity. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability of progress is perfect. Proponents state that reports will be made including the following questions: \u201cMeeting recordings and summaries + Analysis of audit processes of funded proposals + Research design, execution and results + Workshop recordings and summaries + Retrospectives and Final Reports + Community Research \u201d. In this way, we will have a wide range of information available on the progress of the phases, so that we can fully monitor the development process. In fact, there is no criticism to be made here, the proponents have already committed to giving very complete gradual feedback to the Cardano community, in addition to a final report, through which we can verify everything that has been done in this project. Regarding the final results, the proponents explain at length and in rich detail what the Audotira Circle will be aiming at, that is, the specific objectives of the group. With this, we have enough data to monitor if the project has reached its goals, making the auditability of the success scenario fully possible. It is enough for a member of the Cardano community to establish contact with the team in order to investigate these issues, or perhaps this is not even necessary, since they said that they will provide a final report where all this data should already be included. Therefore, both the auditability of the process and the results are perfectly contemplated, with the maximum score being more than deserved in this part of the proposal. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 5, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "It is clear that to tackle a problem, we must first find its weak points.
