The difference is that the previous cohort is a collection of challenge settings roughly framed as \"Community Development\" while this proposal aims to focus on the F8 category for GameFi. (note they also have one for Miscellaneous). While the \"Community Development\" cohort was chosen because it did not require deep technical expertise to audit, this cohort seems to have been chosen because of the teams explicit knowledge and interest in this field.  As a contrast between two potential levels of expertise and how it informs the auditing process being prototyped, this proposal has some interesting possibilities, but I am downgrading the impact on this version on the grounds that the community doesn't need multiple protoypes of the same protocol, but numerous protocols to choose between.  I will be choosing only one of these two proposals to vote yes on myself, in order to leave room for other auditing teams and possibilities to attempt to achieve solutions.  However it is worth noting that much of what I had to say regarding the importance of this type of prototype to Catalyst in their \"P.I.E. for COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT\" proposal also applies to this proposal, and I encourage the voter to read my assessment there as well.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team and its backers are eminently qualified to handle the data side of this equation, including rolling out sites, communication channels, databases and apps in the service of this project, however where the team needs to truly have strengths is in collaborating with funded projects, designing protocols for the audits and writing clear reports.  The team leads have some background in this area, but I still have concerns about the ability to bridge the gap with the funded proposals, as they have a real challenge to develop their projects and submit required auditing documents, without also having to collaborate with another auditing team from this project.  The ability to make that process easy and potentially rewarding for funded projects (perhaps by making contact monthly to collect and use this data to help other teams meet their monthly reporting requirements to IOG) will be a critical achievement for this team.  The budget included here is quite reasonable when factored out over the entire 12 months covered by this proposal, however, much like this team's other proposal, the 1/4 of the budget dedicated to \"price slippage\" for ADA over that time frame may prove to be an unneccesary line item that reduces the project's competitiveness in this challenge.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The provided roadmap and milestones are plenty descriptive and are well paced to deliver 4 reports at a rate of one per quarter, with the first report focusing on onboarding half of the funded proposers from the F8: Gamers ON-Chained challenge setting.  This should  end up being significantly fewer by as much as half from the cohort in this team's other similar proposal.  Though the intent isn't included here, the team should probably include in their roadmap and deliverables monthly contact with the onboarded proposers, certainly as a relevant KPI to be tracking but also as something to note on Monthly progress reports.  It could also serve the needs of the collaborating proposers as well, so if it isn't already part of the reporting plan, I encourage the proposer to consider adding it.  They indicate here the creation of dedicated communication channels for their onboarded projects, and if these channels are open to the public, it could aid in accountability and transparency for everyone, not to mention a source of support.

The idea in the 2 proposals is to audit the proposals funded by Catalyst, starting from the assumption that the number of proposals being funded is growing very fast and it is difficult for IOG to track and monitor the progress and results of all of them. This is a real situation that really needs to be resolved, so much so that the present challenge aims to outline faster, more practical and safer strategies to promote the audit of proposals. However, the problem that I find here is that it is basically: what is the difference between the way to audit this challenge of the games in relation to the monitoring that they will do in the challenges classified as \u201ccommunity development\u201d? I believe that each challenge has a unique nature, specific objectives that are very different from each other, their proposals act in different sectors (more focused on business, or technology or humanities, etc.) the way of auditing them also needs to be unique. However, this is not clarified here, in short it is not clear the difference between the auditability of the challenges present in the link I attached and in this one. Isn't it described how the P.I.E analysis framework would uniquely monitor game challenge proposals, how to differentiate and treat them in relation to others? Anyway, as much as it is a good idea, unfortunately I didn't understand very well why the same team and the same idea was launched twice and without clarifying why, exactly, the tool would be different for the challenge of games. In order for these issues to be resolved, the team would need to explain, in detail, how this proposal would differ from the other one and how the game challenge audit would be more specific than the others. Therefore, I will give it 4 stars, I believe that the idea here deserves this review in order to have its most assured impact. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Again, the proposal says nothing special about the gaming challenge. We know important details about script, team and budget. In that regard, there really isn't much to complain about. In the script, they divide some objectives that need to be accomplished in a period of a few months, and it would be better to specify what would happen each month in the process as a whole, since in the first three months they don't do that and in the others they do, and details of each of the activities individually. It is possible to have a good perception of the process as it is described to us. Regarding the schedule planning, this part is not lacking, as it is quite rich in details. The money requested is also well explained, along with the description of the activities, we know how much would be spent each month and exactly with what, including the value of the hours worked in each activity. So, about the financing, I also think that this part is very adequate and satisfactory. Finally, as far as the team is concerned, it is one of the best parts of the proposal, because we know the name of each professional involved, their main function, social network links, including linkedin (this way we can have proof of what is said in the experience part) and finally a small resume of what each one has done so far. The team conveys a lot of confidence in its potential to successfully execute the proposal, the problem is, really, we don't understand what special would be done here regarding the games. If this doubt were resolved, I would certainly have given an excellent score for the feasibility of the proposal, but I cannot do that because the script itself does not explain what will happen differently here in relation to another proposal in them. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability of this proposal is good, but not perfect. As with their other proposal, the team informs us of metrics, KPIs and information that would serve as content to be monitored, both in the process part and in the final results. However, as I suggested before, some bridge needs to be established with the Cardano community. We cannot expect people to go after information without it being grouped and available in a practical and organized way. With that, I suggest that they make available the data that would serve to measure progress, such as \u201c01 video uploaded for summarizing the Final P.I.E Report\u201d, on some online platform that can be accessed by everyone. I suggest notion, because there you can put text, images, videos and etc. And so, some members more engaged by the project could be responsible for doing this follow-up. And regarding the final results, my suggestion is that the team come up with a presentation and meet with the rest of the community sometime in Town Hall, for example, or in some specific room to debate funded proposals after the general meeting. In this meeting, important points would be exposed about whether the scenario that was imagined became reality, if the more macro objectives of the whole thing were achieved, that is: if the proposals of the games challenge were being particularly targeted and audited. With this, auditability would be better performed, we would know if both the process (partial results) and the final scenario (final results) were successfully and clearly achieved. The grade is 4 because they already provide us with part of what would be needed to audit proposals, but not the entire analysis (the bridge with the Cardano community was missing). \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2, "q0": "The proposal should include audibility improvements more broadly, across all challenge settings, to more closely fit the challenge setting goals. The \u201cGamers on-Chained\u201d setting is just one of twenty-three other settings. If time an energy is to be spent auditing projects, it would be more efficient if a universal approach is applied to all challenge settings, of course with any challenge setting peculiarities considered in the approach to that particular challenge setting. Tracking projects across all challenge settings will be difficult to manage, but by installing disparate auditing frameworks across each challenge setting, it will make the process unnecessarily confusing. \n\nAudit reports for each of the funded proposals should reach as many members in the community as possible. Perhaps working with IOG or Project Catalyst, to broadcast your updates would be more beneficial than using channel specific routes. There are many YouTube channels and personalities in the space, and providing updates from just one lesser known channel would silo the reports. This approach would almost require an auditor for the auditor. \n\nIn regards to your framework, the use of conformance values is a good option. Often time projects are too ambitious in their timelines, when considering their resource availability and experience. Providing conformance updates in both project completion rates and project budget has a two-fold advantage, on one hand it allows the community to know if a project is not meeting its proposed timeline, and on the other, it gives the proposer an opportunity to justify coming back for another round of funding. Albeit, assuming that the funded proposal team is transparent and demonstrating competence. I also appreciate the framework's design to track and report on projects post completion. It would be great to know that not the funded proposals completed the project, but that it actually has value in the Cardano ecosystem. \nAll in all this proposal presents a framework that has value, and I believe if you rework your proposal to more broadly audit funded proposals across all settings, and more broadly communicate the findings, this project would more closely fit the challenge setting goals.

The proposal is aimed at the \u201cGamers on-chained\u201d challenge setting, but numerous times throughout the \u201cFeasibility\u201d section, it is worded like the framework is to be applied more broadly. The proposer should clarify the intentions of this funding round. The budget breakdown is very specific with clear and concise descriptions for each section. There is even planning for price slippage of Ada, to affirm adequate value in the funding. Good work. Given in the team, planning, and funding requested, I believe the project could deliver on the proposal. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes the project is easy enough to audit, if one follows the proposers video project. As mentioned previously it might be better for the project to report via official IOG channels, such as Project Catalyst, in addition to their own channels. It shouldn't be difficult to have a team report to Catalyst in parallel to their own channels, to give high summary overviews of funded proposal progress. This project it self is a project, and in many requests an experiment. If the team finds success in the work, it should be shared with the community and applied across all challenge settings.

The proposed solution is to apply the PIE framework to evaluate the results of the proposals sponsored by Gamers-On-Chained (F7 + F8). Based on the PIE framework, funded proposals will be evaluated against 2 criteria based on relevance (in terms of time and finance to assess the level of achievement of objectives, commitments, KPIs/measures). measures in the proposal) and performance-based criteria (used to assess the extent to which the proposed performance has been achieved in supporting the challenge). This idea is great because with the growing number of sponsored proposals today, it is a challenge for IOG to assess the performance and progress of these funded proposals. Therefore, if this concept of PIE framework is successfully applied, it will partly solve the challenge of\n1.Reduce the increasing load on IOG; 2.Helps identify the performance status, issues of the entire Catalyst funding process in Fund 8, and therefore, may generate implications for solutions in subsequent funds; 3. The reports published through this proposal can be a reliable document for decentralized representatives (dREP) as well as other organizations in decision making.\nOne good thing about this proposal is that the proposal team listed 5 risks that can be encountered during project implementation and it is great that they provide all the solutions for those risks so effectively.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Looking at the plan shows that the proponent has a long-term vision, showing the community the author's plans for the next 3 years.
