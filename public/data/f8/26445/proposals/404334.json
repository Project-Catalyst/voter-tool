It creates also a financial product that collects environmental information that can be shared publicly. The project team explains with different communication channels their goals and  the solutions it could bring along. The project tries to solve inefficiencies in the addressed markets and the team clearly states how they want to do it. Another great thing is that more transparency can be achived through the success of the proposal.  All processes are described detailed and show a project plan that is professionally created.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan presented is written really detailed and shows confidence in taking the challenge. Professional work was done to create the proposal and show the voter and me enough information to understand the topic and the impact it has on the community and businesses. It is also supported not only by this proposal but also by other sources of income as stated in the prposal. The timeline seems realistic. Given that the team presented has the experience that is stated, it shows that this project has a proffessional approach that clearly sets ist goals and will achieve them. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "All KPIs shown and milestones set are clear and show a structured approach. There is a mix of quantitative and qualitative meazures which diversify the needs of auditing by community.

I must commend the detail put into this proposal as the team state the remaining problems clearly with solution to each of them. In my opinion, the propsal has elements for success such as:\n- a good foundation: most reliable carbon credits and a network of partners in the industry. After a quick search, I can verify that the team's credit system does have a reputable position in the industry\n- an upgraded solution that deals with previous failure of similar projects which is securing stability.\nThe proposal's success is well aligned the challenge success metrics.\nFor those reasons, combined with the fact that the carbon-credit industry is rapidly growing, I believe this proposal has a high potential.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I'm impressed by the background and experience of all members in the team. Although no link is provided, these information can be verified with websearch.\nThe total budget is cut down significantly thanks to the initial investment of the team, otherwise it would look quite insufficient with the project of this scale. The majority of budget will be spent on business development and marketing. They also stated that CarbonNo already has a functioning prototype as the result of 700 engineering hours which indicates the level of motivation and commitment the team has.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Regarding auditability, the team showcased excellent results. They listed separately the metrics for (1) Business development and (2) Product development which make it very clear for the community to follow up. There is a 3 stages timeline with deliverables described clearly, which I find to be convinced. The functioning prototype also enhances the auditability of the proposal. For those reasons, I strongly believe that the community will have the neccessary elements for auditing", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1685", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10838, "q0": "This proposal is admittedly very hard to assess, because there are a lot of intricate details regarding how the proposer structures the proposed business. The proposer goes into some details of the way his CNFTs and token would function (and much more details are present in the whitepaper) and explains how it improve on the shortcomings of previous attempts of carbon credit programs on the blockchain. The proposed concept is interesting and novel, and would be a great use case for Cardano, if the team manages to deliver and their system works as explained.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "My main contention point is the complexity of the proposed solution as well as the scope of the actual proposal. The proposal goes in some details regarding the business as a whole, list success metrics for the business as a whole, but quickly mentions that the funds requests are for funding business development only. The bizdev process only makes sense once you have a product, but funding of the actual product development is part of another proposal in fund8 (which may or may not get funded). It is not clear what will happen to the project if the funding of either proposal doesn't get approved. My suggestion to the proposer would be to come up with more succint proposal, a very specific sub-project that doesn't encompass the whole business and could be successful on its own.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "While some of the metrics and KPIs make sense with regards to the points being funded (business development), many metrics apply to the business as a whole, not just the proposal.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_318", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10919, "q0": "I don't need to rely on my background as an assessor of tenders for a university to give my full agreement this proposal fits the challenge perfectly. The Carbon Credits on Cardano system they are proposing to build satisfies so many aspects aligned with Cardano's mission, namely, improve efficiency, contribute positively to the environment, tackle one of the major issues of our time, all with the intention of building the platform on the Cardano blockchain which then should drive up participation, demand and adoption. It's a no-brainer positive feedback loop, which coincidentally is exactly how the proposer craftily and effectively presented their project. I admire the fact they have acknowledged the known issues which plagues the carbon credit reputation and have proposed a novel way to approach it, which up-ends conventional thinking; base the carbon credits on energy-saving technology adopted by businesses and projects. It will surely make auditing the sources of the carbon-credits easier and more reliable and as the proposer themselves mentioned, creates a positive feedback loop. Actually they used the word 'virtuous' and it is that indeed. Congratulations and good luck.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "For a very comprehensive proposal, it is so well-crafted that you only need a modicum of understanding of the processes involved in Carbon Credit trading to see the vision of what's being presented. For the professionalism and exactness of the proposal alone gives confidence that their goals are achievable and can potentially lead to success. As a former assessor of projects for a university, I note they've left no stone unturned. Well, at least one and that's to provide links to the credentials each team member claims to possess. Despite this, I still provide my complete agreement that this is highly feasible and have returned the effort given by the proposers to this proposal by myself researching the bona fides of the team on my own accord. And sure enough, they have put together a group of people with the skills and credentials from academia, in technical development and in business management. Should this miss out on funding this round, these direct links to what I found myself on the internet should be provided so voters can easily verify their credentials. In further supporting my assessment that this is a winning proposal, I note that the small fund they seek is to provide funding for the business development side of the equation, whilst a corresponding proposal attends to the development of the DApp itself. This split of different aspects of the full picture is quite smart as it enhances the chances of gaining funding and winning people's confidence. That they also claim additional funding will be coming from other areas and Catalyst is merely a contributor suggests they don't really need to rely on the Catalyst funding to progress their goals. But we are glad they are here and ensuring foothold in Cardano from the very beginning. Good luck.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal is one of the few I've read (and I had to read their corresponding DApp proposal too in another Challenge to get a clear picture) whose KPIs do not solely focus on the metrics post-release. They also provided audit points of the development milestone of the DApp platform and also of the business structures and process for which this proposal seeks funding. They have provided a website and a youtube channel from where updates can be provided. Where this proposal can improve is in providing the community more channels from where to follow their journey and perform audits. This is where twitter, discord or TG could be useful to include. And despite this proposal being focussed on the business development side of their mission, a GitHub repo should also be included since they are building the DApp anyway. This would make the proposal seem more open to Catalyst and to the community especially if they claim to already have a DApp PoC with Cardano testnet results. The Cardano community are always keen to follow and support novel projects and this team's goals fit that category well. It doesn't hurt gaining traction and friends who will support you until the project is live.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_42", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10997, "q0": "The project aims to create a marketplace for industry carbon offsets via a dual token system (one NFT and one utility token). There seems to be an inherent US bias in the proposal, but they are stating that they have a global ambition, so nothing wrong with starting with one market. The idea aligns very well with Cardano ethos and the challenge metrics as it uses Cardano to steer the world towards carbon neutrality. The plan with the Catalyst proposal is the create a beta version and have a number of users, both sellers and buyers.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is very well staffed and has the appropriate experience both in terms of the subject matter as well as technical know-how. The team has a well thought out plan and a detailed white paper describing both the business model and the technical overview.
