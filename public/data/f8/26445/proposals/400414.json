This solution is aligned with some objectives of the given challenge as it comes up with a Cardano-based solution to meet the needs of publishers. Having said that, the description of the solution was not clearly mentioned. Instead, it should provide more detail about what the solution is all about, its features, functions, and how it works to help publishers and authors to get revenues from selling book NFTs. It mentioned NFT books would provide digital ownership to books that last permanently, create verifiable scarcity, and release royalties. However, it seems unclear in this part, more explanations including an emphasis on technical prospects of how it could do that should be provided. From that, it could better point out how this solution impacts its target audience. The proposal listed what publishers need, but did not explain in great detail on how this solution will meet all those needs. If more detail were provided in this part, then it would be more persuasive to see how impactful this solution is to publishers along with some benefits it offers. It did mention how this solution impacts the adoption of Cardano, but again more detailed information should be provided to clarify. Not having enough time for delivering a prototype in 60 days would be a challenge when delivering this project. It should add the plan to prepare and get over this challenge.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The plan given was quite detailed. The description of each step was mentioned. However, it lacked a specific timeline to complete this plan over the next 120 days. The budget breakdown was general. It should separate the cost into smaller parts. The way to calculate the cost should be stated as well. For example, the budget for development and dev resources, it should mention how it paid for how many devs, the salary paid for them is calculated by hours, weeks, or months. Regarding human resources, it did a great job in providing the profile of staff. Furthermore, this proposal mentioned at the beginning that the leading team of this project built an eBook company with 6 millions readers and over 2 millions eBook titles and they also worked with several publishers and imprints including all Big 5 publishers, delivering ebooks in bulk deals to Google, Apple, IBM, T-Mobile, Wall Street Journal, and General Mills. These points show that the team is so talented and experienced. In fact, it mentioned The CEO & Co-founder, Joshua Stone, has experience in publishing tech since 2009,  Regenold with over 20 years of software engineering. One point that was mentioned on the auditability section is that currently this project has 8 publishers and thousands of titles that are ready to go live to sell NFT Books. This is a good signal to prove its high feasibility.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "With the given information, it seems difficult to measure the progress and the development of the project. Instead, it should mention indicators, criteria in accordance with the timeline in the plan. This will let sponsors track what phase the project is in, what should be achieved next, how the project is going on. It described the success of this project is to build up a marketplace for creating, selling, and reading book NFTs for publishers. However, it should add KPIs with specific figures to make it clearer. For example, the number of publishers or readers joining this platform,  the number of book NFTs created, read, and sold.
