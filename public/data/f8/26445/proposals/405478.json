Voters may be confused as to whether the proposal is suggesting it provides synthetic stock trading at a quick glance, when it appears, I think, to be specifically selling shares in its own network. In other words, the lead is buried under the details of having built a Cardano-compatible sidechain. Put the premise upfront, then lead into how you plan to realize it.\n\nThe premise comes across as an evolved form of equity-based crowdfunding. Though promising, it's a model that's struggled to find investor adoption in the fiat world. It's quite possible that the concept is a better fit for crypto, but it's difficult to assess from what's been laid out here. The proposal links out to the project's site for details rather than listing them here, which is unfortunate because at the time of assessment the proposer's site was throwing a 522 error.

Unfortunately, at the time of assessment, the website was throwing a 522 error and was therefore unreachable. With no way of verifying or investigating the proposer's credentials or roadmap, it's impossible to evaluate the feasibility of the project.\n\nTo avoid this problem in the future, I would suggest that the proposer provide at least an outline of the project's roadmap and a basic overview of the team in case the site is down in the future.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Here, as with Feasibility, the proposal relies on the CA/voter being both curious enough to access the linked project website and to be able to access it. It's quite possible that the project is as far along as the proposal suggests, but I was unable to access the linked website due to a 522 error. \n\nI, other CAs, and voters can only assess the information provided, and what's available this side of the hyperlink doesn't give much detail about the team, the lead, or what the money requested will be used for, or a timeline for development.

It's a very novel concept that has allows both general ADA holders and more traditional businesses to combine using the power of blockchain to shift the way stocks and shares are provided/invested. A an ADA holder converts x amount into Shareslake redeemable token and in-turn is used to invest in traditional stocks and shares of listed companies. They are have presented a detailed and long-term roadmap, and are already well underway with their development. It certainly has the potential for large adoption, not just one or two partnerships but hundreds of businesses that want to harness some of the power of blockchain (and its user base) to raise new capital and general awareness.

It would help to have a breakdown of how $100,000 will be used. Additionally, whilst I believe Shareslake address the challenge excellently, I have reservations to the success of the project in the longer-term. As they openly callout, there are regulation concerns, and whilst that is not necessarily impending, it's certainly not far off and puts the project in unchartered water. Now, that could be overly harsh as many DeFi and blockchain commercial solutions are at risk of new regulation and operating in rapidly changing landscapes, however I do have some concerns that by partnering with traditional listed companies under the issuance of stocks and shares potentially has the additional exposure to risk from SEC/FCA regulators (naming only two national regulators). I have also not seen enough clarity on what the relationship of ownership will be between token holders, Shareslake and the potential listed company will be in relation to the shares themselves. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Shareslake roadmap is very clear and detailed. It looks into the mid-term on rollout and I have limited concerns to how the community can audit progress given the public facing nature of their roadmap. It's measurable over the next 9 months and can be relatively easy to review based on their upfront commitments. Whilst I agree with that the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal, I held back on \"strongly agreeing\" due to lack of clarity to how the funds requested will be used and over how long (if required for 2022 roadmap or for a select purpose) which can make auditing a challenge.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1304", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5261, "q0": "Good idea with agreeable analysis on adoption, but there are a lot of risks for a BIG task. I am more overwhelmed by the scale and ambition of the project than I am impressed with the proposal. Plus, it's a very big price tag. The first impression I get from the proposal and the website is that there's a decent concept and good impact, in theory. However, there doesn't seem to be enough reliable evidence for success and an asking price like this needs to be extraordinarily thorough and airtight. For a project like this to work, it will need more than 2 team members, a list of multiple reputable/strategic partnerships (not just to add legitimacy), and a MUCH more trustworthy evaluation of their token. I was able to track down the token policy ID (https://pool.pm/addr1vxwddqm8lvaeujwt79t5zq20wnymt7fckwueuuj8wflmq5sl5w3nz), which would have been nice to find publicly displayed on their website. There are a lot of things that don't quite add up, but the most concerning is the evaluation of the token at 2.34 ADA per 1 RED token. At this evaluation, with an initial supply of 2.6m RED tokens, that would put them at a 6.08m ADA market cap. However, based on the wallet addresses that I could find, they only control about 8000 ADA to back their treasury. It's entirely possible that I'm missing information that they haven't publicly released, but then that would be another issue of lack of transparency. Overall, I appreciate the ambition and idea but I just need more information, evidence, and tangible development to believe this project has a legitimate shot at making this impact. I think this project needs to go through some risk-reducing development. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "This feasibility section is not $100k presentation material. I shouldn't have to do the work of digging for information about how this project intends to spend this money or what the team's credentials are, but I will. In short, they don't actually say how they will spend catalyst funding money. They provide a link to their token distribution plan (which I think is a little oversimplistic), but they don't mention anything about how they intend to use the catalyst funding. I'm left to assume it will go entirely into their treasury (which would still leave their token vastly overvalued). They also leave a link to their roadmap, but again not specific to the catalyst funding. Lastly, it does not appear to me that they have the necessary experience or education to make this project work. They have some experience in software engineering (but there's only 2 of them) and they have nobody with experience in marketing or stock exchange investing (which is the entire center focus of their platform). Overall, I think this project needs some serious development in the expansion of their core team members to start. The proposal needs some work in directly laying out how catalyst funds are spent (it should not be Catalyst funding that is responsible for building a project's treasury) and what steps will be taken to achieve the goal of the Catalyst funding.

Of course, this section is often very directly connected to the roadmap/implementation section, which is lacking in this case. This proposal seems to assume that the purpose of Catalyst funding is to develop projects on Cardano, which isn't exactly correct. We are not in the business of funding people's businesses. According to the first page of the Catalyst website \"Project Catalyst is a series of experiments which seeks to generate the highest levels of community innovation.\" While tokenizing stocks is something that has yet to be done, it's not necessarily a new idea. This sort service is already being developed by the likes of Maladex, Polymath, Valour, and a variety of reputable projects. My point is, in these proposals, I want to know what is it about requested Catalyst funding that directly contributes to that innovation AND how does that proportionally impact the greater Cardano ecosystem.

Their main differentiation is to build into the tokens a form of royalty that gives the company a percentage of the funds traded, somewhat similar to royalties when NFTs are traded.\nThis could have huge implications if implemented well and would be an innovation as far as exchanges are concerned. Many companies could be attracted to this solution as it gives them a continuous stream of income without having to issue new shares.\nBut it isn\u2019t very clear how sustainable the model is as the team also mentioned that it would be free for investors to trade.

But that is still quite far from implementing a fully fledged stock exchange. The proposers do not provide any technical details on the implementation in the white paper, and the team seems to only consist of 2 people (quite talented though they appear), which seems to be too few to pull off a project which would need legal, business and engineering expertise and experience from the current stock market.\nThus, while the idea is great, I cannot find any plan to aquire the needed expertise, and without expertise in IPOs the chance of a successful launch are slim (although I do not have IPO experience, only experience from complex projects spanning business, legal and engineering).", "q1r": 2, "q2": "If the plan is to execute the roadmap on the homepage (which lasts until end of 2022) with the funds from Fund 8, then there are milestones to measure.
