Before going further into my breakdown. My first question would be, how will this dApp incentivize users to utilize their dApp when people can already go and learn things on their own. Or ask someone in a chat such as discord. With that taken care of, I find education in the ecosystem to be one of the most important things. Especially in the early stages of Cardano defi. I would love to hear more from this proposal with an answer to my question. For now, I give this section 4 out of 5 stars. I find the idea to be very exciting and could have a lot of impact on the community members given the opportunity to help others and to be rewarded for their time. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I love seeing the names of team members when assessing proposals. I am able to verify the team members and look into the experience/skills that each member has. After reading through and reading through the different experience with Haskell and even Plutus. This gives the readers a greater understanding on if this proposal has the ability to be implemented successfully. Having 20+ years of software engineering experience could be the difference between receiving funds or not. I find that the proposed plan will be successful if the team realizes that they can be held accountable for carrying-out their plan to create this educational app that rewards people for their time. For these reasons, I give this section 4 out of 5 stars. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I like to see information that is focused on the roadmap and the budget breakdown. For me, these are two indicators that help determine the success of the proposal. Starting off with the roadmap. This proposal gives a detailed description of their roadmap with different time frames for each of them. Starting in Q2 and ending in Q4. This is great because it will give them a schedule that they are on so that the team can make sure that they are completing these details within the given timeframe. As far as the budget breakdown goes, it was also written very well. There is a clear description of where all of the potential funds will be allocated and who is going to receive the funds. I find this section of the proposal to be very promising when it comes to the overall success and completion of this proposal. For these reasons, this section receives 4 out of 5 stars.

The demand for remote or freelance work from all over the world is constantly increasing, especially in the current situation of the pandemic. By paying in crypto currency, we can remove the barrier of complexity brought about by the banking system of money exchange and build a convenient platform for people in need.
