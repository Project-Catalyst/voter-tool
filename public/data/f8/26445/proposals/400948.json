The project concentrate on using smart contract blockchain tools to engage a company's community of interest by recognizing and bridging the gap between technological capacity and business requirements then exploring of how the Cardano blockchain could assist the founders achieve their impact goals. Not only for the proposed financial value but also for the whole project proposal, I liked the general idea, the research project, and the overall outlined tasks need to be completed seemed like a sensible notion to me. Also, the project's idea and constructions appear well-designed, and I'd be ready as a subject matter expert to embrace the idea and project performance.The concept itself is in line with the challenge's goals and it explains in full how and why the work will be carried out. Several activities that could be conducted are listed in the proposal. Aspects related to future scalability challenges that the project may face are addressed. Though I agree that this idea is aligned with the challenge aim in general, there are no impact measurements supplied that would help us make an informed judgment. Speech information transactions will be recorded in a traditional database for the time being, and I don't believe it will have a quick and significant influence on the Cardano ecosystem. I feel that a survey of the general public, citing the need to promote such an organization, would add additional value to the plan and I suggest you should visualize how well the company will work in the long run as then your users or prospective partners may better comprehend your future execution strategy. How will this solution clearly correspond to and assist our blockchain? ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "That would have been beneficial to establish a schedule, especially because these challenge ideas are expected to be completed in seven weeks. The writers offer us with certain key performance indicators (KPIs) that may be used to track the project's progress, however, I am looking forward some more data such as the platform's audience reach and whether this is resulting in newcomers joining the Cardano community. The proposal specified a time frame for achieving the suggested goal, and checkpoints for the community to monitor progress. The plan merely acknowledges its need for finances to launch the project, and there is specific game plan or breakdown how and when the monies will be spent. It makes this proposal might have been easily audited as certain timelines and an implementation strategy had been included. However, I think it is both costly and difficult to acquire consistent support for these initiatives. So, it would have been preferable to demand a sizeable amount that leaves no room for debate. The team is made up of numerous members that their approaches have been applied on other projects and programs. Their talents and knowledge combine to build a diversified and well-prepared team that is up to the task.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This section of the study is incredibly detailed; we have all of the KPIs we need to determine if the project is on track, and we assess what the player's goals are. I thought it was fascinating how they built up the ideal situation, that is, a circumstance where almost everything happens in the greatest conceivable manner, including consciousness and other factors. In addition to the subject designed specifically to comprehend the metrics, we might go even more in the monitoring because they describe whatever the segments will look like, so we know what will happen and when, so we can verify if things are going as promised. As stated, I trust the program's auditability is well along; all that remains is for the community to test it.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1672", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3382, "q0": "Their proposal has clearly described their solution.

The actions deployed for each use case are also well presented, allowing the community to see that they fully understand what they are doing and its impacts on the Cardano ecosystem in general. Two related proposals are additionally attached for further information. \nThe main features, functions and outcomes of their solution are well described in a logical order, helping the community have a broad overview of their project. Their promising outcomes are projected to effectively tackle the posed challenge. \nThe team has well predicted the main difficulties during the implementation process.

The community can clearly see that in their total anticipated expenditure, mostly the costs are spent on staffing, shown as the salaries. \nAll the team members required in the project are properly mentioned.

It listed two use cases to investigate and convince how the Cardano blockchain is capable of pointing out issues and providing new ways to get through them. Besides, it is highly evaluated that this proposal provided what it would achieve. Especially, it mentioned how this solution has had a direct influence on the Cardano Ecosystem. It said the community which has a high interest in this problem is business leaders, and this solution will serve them well and ultimately increase the number of firms choosing and joining Cardano solutions.

However, another timeline was given after that with a totally different timeframe, which makes it confusing. Therefore, there should be an explanation here about the second timeline. Whether it is the detail of which phase in the overall project roadmap or what purpose of mentioning this second timeline. Besides, at the end of the section describing the timeline and plan, the proposal stated that this project would last for about 7 weeks, but in the roadmap, it is designed for even 14 weeks. The cost breakdown was well-written. It listed details of each cost along with how those costs were calculated. About the human resources, it mentioned full information of people involved in this project including their role in the project, their background, skill, and related experience. They are all talented people. For example, Harry, a NED, chairman, executive, and business coach specializing in innovation programs for enterprises. He got a lot of outstanding achievements as well.

The proposal is well-written and planned, with a clear goal and transparent process. Aside from that, it's fantastic to have a case study in the proposal, which is something that most of the others lack. I'd just like to know if it's feasible to refer to the number of proposals under the KPI and Metrics section using real figures rather than terms like \"rise.\" Although I expect this will be difficult.

The concise summary of the contents of the many modules that this course will feature, not simply the labor put into putting up the proposal, is a portion that makes this proposal stand out.

For the proposed project, the detailing makes sense and we have enough information for the analysis.\n\nAs for the risks of the project, 2 risks were pointed out regarding the technical team and the consolidation of information for the production of the report. In addition to these, it would be interesting to see possible risks related to the collection of information, selection of research participants, among other issues related to the execution of the study.\n\nDue to my experience as a marketing manager and leading research projects using different methodologies, such as quantitative research, focus groups and usability tests, I strongly believe that this stage of data collection and processing is essential for the quality of the study.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Project progress monitoring was clarified and presented with a detailed Gantt chart, a common tool for managing projects of this type.\n\nThe success of the project is clear to the author and has been well described.
