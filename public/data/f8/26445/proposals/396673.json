In accordance with the problems in challenge, the evidence presented by the team is quite reasonable, besides, the team also points out certain potential risks such as Fait Deposit and Withdrawal Gateway. The regulations of some countries are friendly with cryptocurrencies and difficulties in language communication, but I see that the group has not yet outlined options to deal with those risks. I want the group to come up with solutions to solve these problems.

It is reasonable to complete the tasks set out as Expansion and market penetration in 2025. The progress of the project is also very easy to check and track by the community. with great deals as mentioned. With a budget of about 5% of the full challenge budget and divided into five topics, I think it is very reasonable, but it is advisable to have a contingency plan in case of additional budget when needed for the presentation of the members. The team I saw that the group has listed four members and has assigned specific tasks to each member, all members are highly qualified people with many years of experience and especially their identities have been confirmed. Verification with reference documents below the link I see with this team will definitely complete the work that has been done.\nsuggest", "q1r": 4, "q2": "in the progress measurement and project development section, I see the team has given the figures but only generally step the progress will be communicated to the public for each speaking each case. I would like the team to have a more detailed report on the progress measurement. In the success description, the team listed several successes and divided them into three phases with certain goals to be achieved, namely Ennarea Finance services in action and Full Fundraising. The $10 million startup uses the platform.\n  Success is also related to future challenges, but the project seems to be in the concept of an idea and has not been tested in practice. as this is a brand new project that has never been funded but I think this is a good project i hope the team will get a lot of support from the community", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1486", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6206, "q0": "Impact\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This review might be susbstantially similar to the reviews of two other proposals by the same team as the other two proposals differ in name, but are proposing the delivery of the same *The Ennarea Exchange*, with the same Roadmap, with the same Financial Plan and the same definition of success.\nThis proposal has attracted some considerable effort from the proposing team, which gives it a serious note. It is also aligned in general terms with the Challenge, although its impact may be not as large as the scope of the proposal may indicate. \nI like the fact that the proposers are focused on providing services, however at the very beginning and then reading through the proposal, I wasn't able to precisely pinpoint what was the real focus (it kept shifting as I read through). Let me explain. The proposal's name is \"Crypto banking\", - which I understand as managing of digital currency at a financial service or banking provider.\nHowever, moving on to the Problem Statement, the proposer mentions that the problem is a general \"Lack of ADA payment processors\" - which I understood as a global payments issue. Effectively, how to pay for services and goods around the world, by utilizing ADA. \nThe proposed solution is \"A blockchain-powered banking and payment processing system,\" which reintroduces the word \"banking\". I mention this as \"banking\" has a lot of legal implications in all jurisdictions, requires central bank licenses and is highly regulated. \nFinally, as far as I was able to discern - the proposal is really for a pan-African crypto exchange, effectively a cryptocurrency trading platform. Hence, if the proposal is not acepted now, I would advise to reformulate the problem statement and solution. \nWhile the problem statement was global in nature, the proposed solution is Africa-focused, although it may turn out to be country-specific (not sure after reading the proposal). The proposers suggest a service \"available in all African countries that will enable users to invest and trade digital assets using their native fiat currencies\". That is 54 countries and many native fiat currencies. The scope of the project is massive, as it involves fiat currencies in all of Africa. My advice would be to narrow down the proposal to specific markets, even if it is only one initially. \nSo, if Ennerea does have larger ambitions, that is normal and welcome. However, the proposal itself must have a more limited focus if it is to succeed with the limited funding. The specific impact on Cardano remains to be seen, as the proposers have not documented the available market alternatives and competition in their key markets and how will their own project compete with the existing players and why would consumers choose Ennarea to buy ADA, over other specific options. \nThe team does specify that it foresees several risks to deliver this project successfully, including a (1) Fiat currency deposit and withdrawal gateway. (2) Regulatory approval in some countries. These (especially, the second one) seem to me to be big risks and the project will not be able to get off the ground without resolving them. I would like to know the basis for the following claim: \"some of the destinations our exchange can start its operations without regulatory challenges. 1. Ethiopia 2. Gahanna 3. Nigeria 4. South Africa 5. Angola 6. Egypt.\" . Do these markets have regulations? How will the regulation issues be addressed? Why are there no regulatory challenges? Seems like a sweeping statement, but it would be good to back it up with a rationale. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposed Ennarea digital asset exchange and management platform seems to be very expansive in its scope. The team sees it as a one-stop financial solution for blockchain-powered products such as cryptocurrencies, NFTs, Central bank digital currencies (CBDC), tokenized security, stocks, and other traded commodities. This is a large project and does seem somewhat tangential to the \"Crypto Banking and Payment processing service\" mentioned earlier in the proposal. It seems that the proposal's feasibility may suffer from the enormous scope. The team mentions that the architectural and application design of Ennarea is being finalized, however I visited the ennarea.com domain and was not overly impressed. The site named Ennarea Finance seems very early in development. As regards the demo, available at https://pilot.ennarea.com , it seems like a template demo, not a work in progress (not a criticism, just an observation). This same project has been in different forms submitted for funding in the F6 and F7 funds, which means that the team is persistent. It would have been good if the team could have reported on any specific progress since then. Then we come to the budget. According to the proposers, Ennarea Finance requires $350,000 for the first year of project development and management. Apparently, no other sources of financing (outside Catalyst) have been secured - or this has not been documented in the proposal. The team is requesting roughly $150,000 (less than half of the money) in this funding round and the remaining budget will be requested in another funding challenge. The initial roughly $150,000 budget will be disbursed among 3 different proposals in Fund 8. This proposal being reviewed here - is just one of the three. However, if only one proposal is accepted in this fund 8 -what happens to the project? The team has not addressed this clearly and it seems that the risk of partial funding is a real danger. Does the team intend to return the funds if only 1 or 2 (out of 3) proposals are funded in Fund 8? This needs to be addressed, if Feasibility is to be assessed properly. If the team secured additional funding from other sources, it would be good to list them in the proposal. Tentatively, the team members do seem to have the qualifications to pursue a software project of this type from the links to their Linkedin URLs. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The auditability of the project seems to be relatively straightforward in general terms with some general specific commitments listed and deadlines. There is a big weakness though, which undermines auditability. The budget for this proposal $50,000 is not broken down into components, while a breakdown is available for $138,500 worth of expenses for the entire project - to be funded from three Fund 8 proposals. Hence, it will be almost impossible to audit the implementation of this specific proposal as it does not have a budget breakdown - on its own. This proposal is part of a larger budget breakdown - and individual components cannot be attributed to this single proposal. \nSome deliverables still seem to be too vague. It is good that the team intends to use its social media platforms as well as webpage blog posts to announced progress. I would advise the team to commit to deeper weekly progress reports (on a regular schedule) - due to the amounts of funding involved from Catalyst. Also, I think that the expenses and engagement of personnel and payments should also be easily auditable. \nThe three month goal includes a commitment to \"enable users to buy and sell ADA in our exchange\". This is not sufficiently clear. Users from which jurisdictions? From Africa? From Ethiopia? Which payment methods will they be able to use? WHo will be performing KYC? The goal of having 10,000 active users on the platform after three months, seems optimistic to me as an outsider. But great. However, to make it clearer it would be good also to provide insight into the definition of an \"active user\" - a user with an account or a user that has performed a trade? Also, how will the auditability of this project be impacted if the other two Fund 8 proposals for the Ennarea exchange are NOT funded? Will this proposal - on its own - be auditable - if the team misses out on obtaining funding from its other two proposals? We are left to ponder about this, so it would be best if the team addressed these funding issues and also if the team were to reveal why are other sources of funding not available for a project that seems so promising? The project expects at least 50 thousand active users in 12 months, there must be other potential sources of capital. If these have been approached, what was the response? \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_35", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7894, "q0": "This is an ambitious project when developing a crypto and fiat currency conversion channel in Africa.

They note that most African countries lack crypto payment processing services. The proposal also addresses the need for more trading pairs that involve Afrian currencies, the need for a better UX for cryptocurrency exchanges, and the need for blockchain crowdfunding/ICO platforms in Africa. Providing a solid response to even one of these challenges would add value to the Cardano ecosystem by promoting broader adoption. It is hard to tell how scalable their existing platform is based on the demo, but presumably the back-end systems are designed to handle the large volumes the team predicts and desires. The only reservation regarding the project is that the team seems to be tackling a huge set of problems spread across a huge geography. They might increase their impact if they narrow their focus, particularly in the early stages. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal provides a video and demo demonstrating that construction of their trading platform MVP is well underway. The five team members have a variety of skills including software engineering, media management, and general business leadership experience.  Given the wide array of financial products the team plans to offer, they seem to have underestimated their legal and regulatory costs. I suspect that hiring one lawyer at the cost of $7,500 will not be sufficient to secure the necessary licenses to allow the company to transact with other people\u2019s funds. Particularly if the platform will allow users to trade fiat for crypto, any bank providing the platform will access to fiat funds will want to see evidence of solid KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance practices and policies. These are requirements from the global FATF organization, whose requirements are translated into national laws and regulations by each country\u2019s separate financial regulatory authority. While the specifics will differ from country to country, each jurisdiction will have some method of complying with FATF requirements (otherwise that country will be placed on the high-risk list, which causes significant international banking complications). \n\nSeparately, one of the comments suggested that the team explain how their merchant payment processing gateway differs from the COTI solution, given that COTI is Cardano\u2019s preferred partner.  It would have strengthened the proposal to address this question. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The KPIs are specific and measurable. The first three months are focused exclusively on the trading platform and nothing is measured regarding the merchant payments functionality. The six month metrics are vague, so it isn\u2019t clear which capabilities are being targed. For example, the metric is an \u201cintensive marketing campaign to reach 25 thousand users,\u201d but it isn\u2019t clear which functionalities those users are accessing. Similarly the \u201caffiliate and referral program launch\u201d could refer to the trading platform, the merchant payment services, the ICO capabilities, or all of the above. I think it would increase the team\u2019s likelihood for success if they break the milestones into much more concrete and specific KPIs, which will also increase the auditability.

I am listing the two red flags here first, and then move on to assess the rest of the proposal in good faith.\nRed flag one: there is no risk assessment and the targets, extremely high and \"easy\" customer onboarding and no mention of local competitors and bank regulations make the project look \"too good to be true\".\nRed flag two: the website is a placeholder and the LinkedIn profile belongs to a single individual in the US, not in Ethiopia. So this project may or may not be legit.\nNow I continue with the assessment on face value:\nThe project is incredibly ambitious: launch a crypto exchange in Ethiopia for local currency pairs and the 6 top crypto pairs (including ADA, obviously). The team is experienced and has a test version / prototype / mockup of their exchange up and running and very detailed ideas about the team required to run this operation with a physical presence and a sales and legal team.

Gladly, there are several milestones along the way that allow the proposal if funded to be audited and potential blockers addressed or removed. After 1 year, it is targeted that Ennarea Finance is fully operational and 50000 active users have been onboarded. The company then plans to raise a substantial amount in external funding to expand further, but for the relatively modest Catalyst funding requested, it will be possible to tell by the first milestone, after 3 months, if 10000 users have indeed been onboarded and trading does occur, which in my view is very bold and would be an amazing feat for a Catalyst funded exchange.
