It meets the demand of these businesses in terms of the privacy and security of data, especially in Germany. It did a great job to show its impact on the targeted audience. In fact, it described how beneficial it is to the fleet management platform. User data would be protected well and mitigate the risk of being hacked or stolen by a third party, which is a competitive edge of this project compared to centralized management services. It also mentioned this solution also has an influence on the Cardano blockchain as it will boost the number of firms joining Cardano and this service of the Cardano platform will gradually create a standard for the security and privacy of data. Besides, the challenges when delivering this project were mentioned including 3 main ones. It is highly evaluated that it provided a clear strategy to mitigate all those aforementioned risks.

According to the author, companies are acutely aware of the necessity of data privacy and security, particularly in Germany, and I partially agree with this. However, I would expect this kind of proposal to provide relevant information to back up their claim. To address the problem, the team proposes to develop and implement a Fleet Management platform on Cardano. When the implementation of the platform is finished, they will cooperate with a fleet company in Germany to carry out the pilot project. The first good point is a firm statement of the proposer's mission and vision, which I rarely see in other reports. There is a detailed explanation of how to accomplish the stated goals. The solution ensures that the platform will guarantee and improve data privacy, which I believe is perfectly in line with what the challenge is seeking.

About the budget breakdown, the fund is to pay for the team member\u2019s efforts on developing the platform the next 3 months. According to the author of this proposal, employer costs in Germany are relatively high compared to other countries so they calculate conservative costs in comparison to actual employer costs with comparable experience in Germany, which demonstrates the team\u2019s meticulousness. There is a monthly estimate of the total budget in both euros and dollars, as well as a detailed breakdown of how much each position received.

However, it would be preferable if there was a clear timeline or specific intervals of each stage. About the budget breakdown, the fund is to pay for the team member\u2019s efforts on developing the platform the next 3 months. \" \n\nMy Answer:\n- In the feasibility spreadsheet mentioned in the feasibility section of the proposal, we have very detailed activities, acceptance criteria, duration of activities and the salaries of each needed employee and the workload. It is a very detailed and transparent budget breakdown.\n\n\n\nAuditability\n------------\n- The CA said: \"Nonetheless, certain KPIs addressing the proposal's development and impact after it's developed and running should be provided, so that the community can keep track of both the proposal's progress and its success after development. Therefore, the proposal does not provide me with sufficient information to assess the progress toward its stated aims\"\n\nMy Answer:\n- In the spreadsheet mentioned in the Feasibility Section, we have mentioned all activities and detailed acceptance criteria (project delivery). Of course, the most important KPI to check is the accomplishment of all acceptance criteria. I think also the detailed acceptance criteria are not very technical, anyone with basic understanding of the blockchain can assesses if an acceptance criteria is meat or not. \n\nWith Agile Software Method, especially scrum, which will be used in the project, everyone can assess the improvement of the project by checking the scrum board and the product backlog. So, it will be clear which requirements are implemented and which acceptance criteria are meat and the timeline.\n\nIf at the end of the project all acceptance criteria are meat, so the project is fully successful. \nEvery project in the world is successful if all acceptance criteria are meat within the planned budget and time. We have delivered the budget, time and detailed acceptance criteria in the spreadsheet.\n"}, {"q0": "The solution in this proposal focuses on building connected car platforms and DApps on Cardano. First Step towards establishing Cardano as a standard for the automobile industry. To solve this challenge, the authors have the following solutions:\n\u2022 After some iterations of the project, and once we implement the platform and it is ready for launch, we will cooperate with a fleet company in Germany to implement the pilot project.\n\n\u2022 Typically, today, companies are very aware of the importance of data privacy and data security, especially in Germany. This solution will assure the privacy and security of the companies and drivers' data who are utilizing fleet management services\u2014especially when compared with fleet management services communicating with centralized services.\n\n\u2022 Consequently, increasing numbers of companies will want to use Cardano blockchain as a platform for fleet management services. Cardano, as a result, could be established as a standard for data privacy and security.\nPositive impacts: The proposal details how and the implementation steps of the project. I see the enthusiasm of the author group through this proposal. It is proposed to provide a data management solution on Cardano that enhances privacy and security - this is very important in this day and age. The field that the author wants to focus on is the automobile industry, this is the industry that creates value in the world. Cardano also has scalability benefits, and more specifically, for this proposal, Cardano sees potential in the market through being established as a standard for data privacy and security. Thereby, I see the potential and feasibility of the author's proposal.\nWhat benefits does Cardano have from this proposal? The benefit of Cardano lies in the increase in scale along with the competition in the market.\nHow beneficial is Cardano through the proposal? This process is involved directly retrieving car data from the CAN Bus System through dedicated hardware, decoding, data processing, as well as submitting the transaction to the Cardano mainnet, including the calculated car driver behavior.
