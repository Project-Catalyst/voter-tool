I think this proposal is missing an articulation of what the post-product world looks like. They do say that it's meant to expand the functionality for delegators to see live data but I want to know why that matters. I assume this is a tool that is meant to increase Cardano user experience but there could be arguments for adoption or other ecosystem impacts that I'm not able to come up with. Is there an economic impact that leads people to make decisions that they otherwise would not have? Maybe this could help to keep delegators away from SPOs with poor performance so that those delegators could move to better performing SPOs? I love this idea for myself but I feel like I need to be convinced of the greater impact that will result.

There does appear to be action/budgeting missing from the marketing side of the project (both from this proposal and last proposal), which may be a logistical misstep that could mitigate the potential impact that this project could have. What's the point of developing the project if hardly anyone knows about it? I also have some criticisms on the budget. The labor cost is expensive. The going rate competes with the higher end of salaries from high-end tech companies, which seems rather inappropriate for Catalyst funding. This proposal gives a rate that is equivalent to $135k/year when the highest paying average in California is $137k (the national US average is $115k). A similar overvaluation is made for the REACT/WEB dev salary at a $135k evaluation for a $117k national average. The UI/UX designer rate is not as bad but still competitive at an equivalent rate of $93k/yr (the national average is $93-$97k). I'm sure there may be split opinions on how Catalyst funded developers ought to be paid but it's certainly not disagreeable that it has a different economic model than the corporate world. The corporate world pays an amount that is evaluated based on how much the company can make from their work, while Catalyst funding is much more like a grant (in which spending efficiency should be taken into account).

The section inappropriately assumes the successful completion of the product is a measure of success. However, a completed product alone does not harbor any impact on the greater Cardano ecosystem. Usage is a much more appropriate measure of success because it is what actually translates to impact. In that, I find it important to provide quantifiable KPIs to produce a more objective measure of what degree of impact is being aimed for (bonus points for different metrics at different milestones).
