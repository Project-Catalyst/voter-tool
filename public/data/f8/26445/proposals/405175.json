HUGE potential for impact ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has a mix of several Cardano community builders which have proven the value they bring to Cardano, no doubt they have the right tools and experience for delivering, LinkedIn links are always appreciate it though. \nBudget is well explained and clearly broken down, my doubt comes on why doing the website first and then check with the UX, wouldn\u00b4t you save time by first doing the prototype with the UX and then creating the platform?\nRisks/challenge are properly analyzed and give action plans to mitigate them. Timelines are well explained and completely feasible.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project is clearly visible and the community will be able to easily audit them.

But after reading the whole proposal I agree that a platform to explain your products and services and interact with the community are crucial for every business. Similar to multinational corporations that need their consumers to like them and interact with them on Twitter, Facebook etc. adacafe is an excellent platform for Cardano-specific businesses (such as but not limited to Catalyst startups and even impact projects) to communicate their products, services, activities etc. Even hiring or advertising could in future be done through a channel like this. So I think although we need to think a bit about ethics and data and paywalls to not \"end up like Facebook\", this is a very valuable part of the current B2C and B2B ecosystem on Cardano and without raising outside funding, Catalyst is a great place for funding. Therefore, I agree that the challenge and the proposal share the same goals and the setting of the challenge is met fully.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The realistic timeline of 12 months, the traction of Adacafe and the diverse and creative mix of individuals and SPOs involved is very encouraging. The budget seems right and is broken down into its most important components without providing too much detail where contingencies may be necessary. I find this overall very credible and level-headed and think that the team has spent a lot of time discussing this proposal and envisioning the goals they want to achieve. I consider it very likely that we will see the targets delivered by this team. \n\nDisclaimer: I do not know the team personally and have verified the links on Twitter etc. I had heard of the project before.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is solid in giving auditable targets. We are presented with requirements in terms of % growth, total users, totals views, standards like having a dashboard, and a timeline is given for all goals. Given the long period of implementation (12 months) more milestones would have been better, but at least there are a lot of goals and we get a good idea what success will look like.\nThere is one sentence that I do not like in the section, and that is \"The value of ADA Cafe\u2019s services are validate by the market who begin paying the ADA Cafe for some, if not all, of the products & services\" - this is obviously not a qualitative KPI but a threat to charge for services in the future.
