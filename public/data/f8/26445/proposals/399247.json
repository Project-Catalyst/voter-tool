There is a problem mentioned in the proposal that most people consider traditional culture tourism to be expensive. By clearly identifying the main problem, the team has come up with a solution and added exhaustive explanations of the value it will bring to the ecosystem, by bringing benefit for people who want to have cultural tourism but do not have opportunities to do so ( known as visitors) and for investors who want to earn profit from this field ( known as citizens). The goals of this proposal align with the challenge setting. I have read quite a few proposals now and I do not see any key items missing from this one. The proposal also includes that joyfulness is the key reason why KemiLand is unique compared to other digital restoration initiatives and I think the given explanations are quite convincing and fascinating. I have no concern about the proposal and I strongly believe that this project will impact the community greatly if it gets funded.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In terms of feasibility, I have nothing but praise for the team. Each point is addressed in detail. The project is led by a committed team with much experience in multiple knowledge areas, which is necessary and will bring the project to its advance. There are reference links to verify the information. The time frame is solid and the team also gives detailed explanations for each stage of their project, which is very good. There is a sensible budget breakdown but I suggest that some more detail should be included. For example, what kind of promotion method would be taken? and what is included in \u201cmanagement\u201d? It\u2019s not very clear what it means here. However, I think that the proposal still deverse a 5 for feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There are clear time-framed KPIs with targets which help to evaluate the progress as it evolves and have a reference whether the success is achieved or not.

Most people are afraid of blockchain technology because it is difficult to grasp, overly technical, and overwhelming. Removing this aspect of blockchain technology while maximizing user experience is exactly the type of action that will accelerate mass adoption. I believe there is significant value in providing a metaverse model of civilization restoration that can assist cultural tourists in learning, discovering, and experiencing a civilization. This proposal is extremely beneficial to the Carnado ecosystem. It is a plus point since the proposer presented some remarkable benefits for the Carnado community. The Egypt concept is a good idea. The proposers may be introducing a paradigm shift for the cultural tourism industry by developing a tool that allows non-developers (visitors and citizens) to leverage what the blockchain offers (secure, self-sovereign data) via a web-based application.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal outlines exactly what has to be done at each milestone, as well as the timeframes and deliverables for each step. The deliverables are all appropriate for the solution's development. The team then divides the budget into five distinct components and it is reasonable in order to meet the established goals. They did an excellent job in terms of budget description, as well as identifying future risks that could jeopardize a successful implementation. Team members have managed to assemble a very diverse set of skills and experience across a wide range of disciplines. Referrals on LinkedIn were provided, so experience can be verified from that perspective. Because a large portion of the budget is allocated to promotion, groundwork, and research, it is difficult to determine whether the values are reasonable because they are heavily influenced by the local context. There is a timeline that presents the details of the actions that will be carried out, which I find to be reasonable.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In terms of auditability, the team delivered outstanding results. There has been a clear explanation of the key milestones, indicating two milestones with brief descriptions, so that the community understands both what will happen and when it will happen. The success criteria are appropriate and relevant for the next round of funding; however, the suggested metrics are difficult to measure in my opinion. To avoid confusion among future proposers, I recommend, if possible, reviewing the metrics prior to the launch.
