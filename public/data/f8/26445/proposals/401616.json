First, they provide the background of their solution (the Bridge Builders), showing the necessity and the driving force behind their project. They clearly point out the problem that their targeted audiences (the funded project, startups, entrepreneurs through Catalyst community) are encountering and therefore, offer a reasonable solution. Some of the main functions and main features of the Bridge Builders are well presented in the proposal. They effectively illustrate their desired results, how they gonna operate their mentoring, and its positive impacts on their targeted audiences and the Catalyst Community. All information is written adequately in a logical order, enabling the community to easily follow and understand.\nThere is a slight concern mentioned related to the commitment of the team, but they ensure that they can keep everything under control since the team member\u2019s engagement has been proven through their past work. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "They have provided a road map from may 2022 to july 2022 including 4 main activities (project mentoring, group experience facilitation, public meetings/events, and content creation) and the subtask for each activity. The community can use this roadmap to monitor the progress and detect any delay that may happen in the execution process.\nTheir spending plan is also included in the proposal. This detailed budgeting plan is linked to their action plan and broken down into 3 main sections with specific numbers. This allows the community to oversee and understand whether their spending is effective or not. \nThey make a strong team with highly experienced members. Their positions, past work, and LinkedIn accounts are provided in the proposal. As they mentioned, they are committed members proven through their past work, they have a huge capacity to ensure smooth workflows and high productivity.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They assure that their services, actions, operations, and constant updates will be published via Bridge Builders website. Their achievements and failures are also reported monthly. This can help the community get the clarity of the project and easily track down the process. The specific KPI and metrics are also provided to measure the progress and the development of Bridge Builders, maybe they can add the required numbers for each metric to be defined as successful. The success of the project is also clearly visualized through specific deliverables presented.

They have also specifically indicated the challenges they will face when supported and what they will do to address the challenges, in my opinion, the activities they will undertake will address the challenge.Some of the activities they will undertake are forming and developing a team with experts in specific fields to provide tailored services to sponsored proponents. Build bridges working with diverse community groups to mentor them in a variety of business and leadership areas. Improve the architecture of the community network by suggesting new ways to benefit Project Catalyst and the wider community network...

However, there is no proof of need of this type of action, there is no mention of an analysis of funded proposals facing this type of issue. If there is no information about such a need arising in the Catalyst community, why not wait until it is visible and then start such a project.

How many of the team members are community architects, how many hours for that function are being allocated to it etc.\n The team description is comprehensive, the proposers have offered detailed descriptions together with links to their social profiles (LinkedIn).\nI am confident the team can successfully implement the proposal and deliver good results, however, some of the gaps in the budget description raise questions that compel me to draw at least 1 point from the feasibility section.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team has a reliable plan to demonstrate the progress of the project, they will be offering constant updates on their website, After Town Halls etc.\nThe success definition, however, is not complete, there are no numbers or intervals/allocated timeframes that could paint a complete picture as identifiable measures of success.

In the 1:1 Accompaniments, we build close relations with the teams and their projects.

However breaking the budget down according to general metrics\n we can see a 3 month effort that costs $75,000 covering the expenses of 4 team members working part time results in an approximate hourly rate of $50 - $75 per hour.
