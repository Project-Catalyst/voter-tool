This main objective of the project even fits the premises of the challenge in which it finds itself, since it can increase Cardano's scope by facilitating operations involving businesses. However, as described in the proposal we do not have more in-depth information that convinces why this implementation will cost the large budget of $100,000. For amounts in this range, we expect a greater level of detail about the possible positive impacts when implementing the idea, more detailed motivations that justify the use of Cardano technologies and in this case it would even be possible to demonstrate an example that shows a more beneficial tangible form of the planned integration.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Regarding the action plan, we also noticed that there is a little more clarity about the activities that will be carried out. We note that in the initial months of the project, a planning will be carried out. But as described, some doubts arise, for example: Which professionals will be involved in this planning stage? What are the main points that will be focused to carry out this initial integration? Will any tool be used to build these stages, such as Miro? What functionality will be verified during the planned test? It would be important if some of these questions were better answered in order to have a better clarity on the execution of the project. And regarding the budget details, we also noticed that it was not indicated how the amount of $100,000 will be distributed among the listed actions. The backend development stage to be able to write for Cardano would be one of the central points of the project, but we don't know how much will be allocated for this. Taking this action as an example, it would be important for us to know this value, as well as the characteristics of the responsible developers, which languages \u200b\u200bare intended to be used, how many hours of work per week are planned or what the value of the work hour is. It seems interesting that some of these points mentioned were implemented to better understand the progress as a whole.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The stated ways to follow the project's evolution are also not very well detailed. As one of these ways, the very success of the integration was indicated. But this indication by itself only refers to the final result and does not provide further information throughout the process. For this, it would be interesting to define, for example, sprints with a constant duration (like weekly) and the publication of the results being achieved in something like a public board where the community could better observe the goals being achieved. Perhaps the lack of this information would be alleviated by more detailed ideas about the perception of success, but we noticed that in this topic the same things were indicated as before.\n\nThus, it seems cool that the proposal seeks to answer some of the questions raised so that the general idea around the project is more complete.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 3, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1879, "q0": "This proposal is for the integration of the Cotalker backend records on the Cardano blockchain. This is a B2B and will drive all the proper objectives for this challenge.

It looks like it was made in 10 minutes and that was it, but it was posted on 03.03.2022 , so there was plenty of time to ad detail and expand.\nThe proposer does not provide any meaningful action plan or road map. \nThe budget is not broken down, at all, it is not even mentioned anywhere else but the \u201crequested funds\u201d section. One could think that this is a typo, and $100 000 is actually $10 000 because there I no mention of that number anywhere else in the proposal.\nThe proposer describes the team the following way: \u201cdcSpark and Cotalker\u201d.  That is not enough. Voters don\u2019t know, they don\u2019t have to know. It is the proposer\u2019s job to make a good and informative proposal.\nThe proposer didn\u2019t outline any risks. \nI strongly disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully, not because I don\u2019t believe in the companies, but because this proposal is out of line and does not provide enough information for the voter to decide if he wants to support it.\n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The auditability section is of two components \u201csuccess integration and pilot with at least two well known companies\u201d the same thing repeats for success. The question is how an auditor to decide if and when and how much funds to send to the proposer\u2019s wallet and how to check the progress of the project?\nThe answer is there is no way. Therefore I strongly disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\nDear proposers, I really think that your idea is great and I want to support it, but the proposal you have made does not allow me to do so. Please next time, spend a little more time and explain your proposal in detail for the voter to understand and support.
