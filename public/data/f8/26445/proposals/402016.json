It also explains the core functionality, the possible risk or challenges down the road and its potential to scale the project. The proposal could however tries to focus on one area of application which is urban farming and make a solid user case for that area instead of explaining in the proposal as finance and payment solutions which makes the feasibility of products questionable. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The budget is clearly outlined and have detail breakdown along with both timelines in development and deployment phase. However, there is no evidence of proposers and team profile (any reference sites would be useful) to ensure that the project can be carried out and implemented successfully. The team mentioned that they have already received the positive feedback of the core functionality of their smart contract yet there is no link of evidences in the proposal except their main website.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal has provided the clear KPIs for development phase and deployment phase in the form of new users acquired that would be acquired by the platform along with respective timeline. However, it doesn't state how the progress will be communicated to the community.

It did a great job in defining some of the technical terms to help readers easily understand even for people without knowledge in the field of blockchain technology. It is highly evaluated that the proposal provided a very detailed and full of information about the problem. It pointed out the problem of each target audience mentioned earlier, and based on that it suggested the solution for each before coming to a common solution that will solve all issues of both businesses and private users. Its solution for both businesses and private users is to build an alternative web3 platform that helps provide a model with a low selling fee, no payment processing fee, several free tools to build smart contracts, a high yield compound interest, and many benefits that blockchain tech offer (security, transparency,..). So it could be said that this proposal is aligned with the given challenge as it gives a solution that focuses on solving businesses\u2019 problems. The core functions of this solution's products were also clearly stated. This part helps clarify more on how businesses and private users benefit from these functions and show the impact on them. It did mention the contribution of this solution to the whole development of the Cardano ecosystem but in the feasibility section. Instead, it should be mentioned in this Impact section. It presented statistics to highlight the prospective growth of digital currencies in the near future.  And it is the perfect time to develop web3 and a decentralized trading and finance platform for global commerce, which ultimately helps the Cardano network thrive. Some challenges related to each target audience were also given in great detail. It also gave an explanation that these challenges will be incrementally overcome.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It did a great job in narrowing down the scope of this project to just two user profiles, not the entire global market, focusing on the agricultural product market and a web 3 market. This better secures the possibility of success of this project as it just puts their resources in scope and markets that they have experience and evidence to manage well. Besides, it proved the potential and feasibility of this project by emphasizing the impact of this solution on the Cardano ecosystem with the growing trend of employing digital currencies.  \nA roadmap that could be seen as a plan with a timeline was given in combination with a cost distribution explanation. This is also a great way to make it easier to follow how the project will take place and the cost for each phase simultaneously. All costs were given in so great detail and with some notes to explain more about them. Everything is so transparent and clear.\nAbout human resources, the founder of this project has a background in organic farming and this is totally suitable and beneficial for this project as it targeted agricultural products. Besides developers have experience in web3 and blockchain tech, which is another trustful factor for the feasibility of this project. Another positive signal showing the high feasibility of this project is that Web3 tech has already operated major functions needed for the project's platform and the team has also coded some smart contracts, tested core functions, and built up demos to receive feedback from the developers' community", "q1r": 5, "q2": "About the way to measure the progress and the development of the project, it provided the KPIs in accordance with the two phases mentioned in the plan, which is a great point to show the synchronization of the proposal. From that, it is totally auditable and evaluates the proceeding process.Another highlight here is that it clearly describes what success looks like. The success of this project is defined as reaching two milestones and meeting all KPIs with specific figures. It is extremely clear to see the criteria of each milestone that is expected to achieve and the easy-to-follow KPIs for a lot of factors with specific figures. In conclusion, this part of the proposal was well-written to help measure the proceeding process and evaluate the completion level of the project and how to conclude whether the project is launched successfully or not.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1665", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4815, "q0": "The team attempts to help readers understand their concept by providing a well-crafted description of the project. They acknowledge the problems of their target users and emphasize their mission to solve these problems.

To be more convincing, they can support their solutions with market research results or statistics from open sources. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal didn\u2019t provide any detailed plan to acquire their mission. It only gives us information about the scope of the project, their focused market, and the project\u2019s impact on the Cardano ecosystem which has already been mentioned in the Impact part. From what I can see in the budget breakdown part, the project will have 2 phases: development and deployment/operation. The team can at least specify what they will do in these 2 phases plus how they will do it. Take an example of the business development step, they could clarify how they intend to attract businesses and users. \nThe budget breakdown, contradictory to the timeline, is very detailed with the expenditure for each phase of the project. \nThe introduction of the team could be better, the only member mentioned was the principal founder with a background in organic farming. My suggestion for improving this is to add more information about the members like their roles, their expertise level, their prior achievements and experiences that make them suitable for this role. Because the purpose of this question is to decide if the team is capable of accomplishing their plan or not so in-depth understanding of each member is important.

The proposer should have included a short description, containing skills and previous work for each team member, adding also a (professional) social profile link for verification.
