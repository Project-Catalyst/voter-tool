This in itself makes this proposal aligned with the challenge. However, as a former assessor of tenders for a university, there are salient details the proposers could have added to make their case more compelling, which they needed to do because our ecosystem is not short of real community-driven & self-funded business intelligence tools and sites; pool.pm, cardanoscan.io, pool tool.io, Cardano Data Studio, to name but a few. The types of data and analytics this proposal intends to provide would have been very useful to mention on this proposal as they could have been used as a measuring stick against what we already currently have and would have supported claims that the platform could bring about \"new and hidden opportunities\". On multiple occasions the proposal mentions, \"restoring trust to the Cardano blockchain\" but I would argue that the Cardano Community never lost trust in the Cardano blockchain to begin with so this somewhat added confusion. It is a high-level proposal so there is a possibility the wrong words/phrases were used and should this proposal miss out on this round and is resubmitted, I strongly suggest painting a more cohesive picture with the right details and the right language as these matter in the end. In addition, there are also mentions of 'increased transparency' which is a must in our open industry but the business model to be established is as a 'stake-to-subscribe' which places the platform behind a paywall (for want of a better word) to most members of the community. This could well restrict the potential for full and open adoption of Cardano if potential users and business partners will firstly need to be a delegator to the proposed ADAG Stakepool before benefitting from the service. Since ITN, stakepools have proliferated across our ecosystem and blossomed but in reverse of this proposal's model, i.e. the pools were firstly created then delegators were enticed by SPOs by providing data analytics and similar services for free, which to me is more the definition of 'community-driven' growth. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team seems to posses relevant qualifications necessary for this project in their descriptions and on their linkedin profiles. As a former business partner of a recently-retired pool, I can attest how nitty-gritty it is to build and maintain a pool as it requires a particular skillset of hard configuration and more often these days, almost a full-stack dev experience, which is why I relied on technical partners who are hardcoders first and foremost. I didn't give this proposal full marks simply because I did not see the specific skillsets needed to build the pool on their profiles. The experiences of the proposers seems to align more with managing projects, cloud configurations and overview management which would still be useful in guiding this endeavour but not likely in building the pool themselves, much less the CSA. There are no mentions of securing external assistance so it is possible they do possess the skills but were simply not mentioned on linkedin. I highly recommend adding these in the profile to paint a clearer picture of the qualifications. That aside, the month-by-month activities are clearly described and seems achievable if tackled full-time. The team is following standard dev pathways and practices and the matching budget allocation aligns with each aspect of the build. If followed there is a chance this project will meet its goals. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There's quite a lot to track on this proposal should it be granted funding. Aside from the month-by-month project plan which in itself can be audited as each step is completed, the deliverables are expansive and almost provides a functionality overview of the CSA. In addition, the establishment of the Stakepool would mean success when they become searchable on resources where pools appear. As mentioned, comms and updates will be published on a blog platform, on telegram, on medium & on twitter which are the standard channels with which to communicate with the community. I would however suggest that the team does not wait for the results of this proposal prior to establishing those channels as a quick search of each platform did not turn up any results. They may be missing out on the opportunity for the voters to engage with them during the voting process, which is a highly valued interaction especially if you desire to establish trust in the ecosystem.

We don\u2019t intent to replace any other solutions, instead, we will look initially at integrating existing data feeds, building correlated and aggregated jobs, meticulously setting multi-KPI alerts, focusing on charts and views, and providing drilldown capabilities to our sourcing data and content services for more detailed analysis. We will act as a front-door service capturing user intent, answering questions and redirecting to the next best destination. This responds to our clunky experience when navigating the ecosystem, and looking for insights, and watching influencers showcasing services, that have highlighted:\n\u2022\tA growing and fragmented set of niche analysis tools built by the community, which is hard to navigate and follow, focuses on infrastructure, financial or social metrics, and shows data in silos\n\u2022\tA common lack of unified, service-oriented, engaging and tailored view to support the needs of the community.\n\nFurther down the line, in a later phase, we will start the build of the Service Scorecard and Deep Dive tools that we have briefly outlined on the screenshot attached to the proposal. Those are unique analytics\u2019 tools in the industry that will help highlight, investigate, compare and correlate KPIs in a self-service mode.\n\nRisk that the stake-to-subscribe model becomes a barrier to entry and reduce adoption:\n\nThis is something we are conscious of and that we will revisit regularly. We have a challenging multi-year roadmap in front of us and we foresee our operating expenses to grow at a rapid pace. As such and as a core value we want to become self-sustainable financially early; and while considering various revenue streams we have taken the direction to follow a stake-to-subscribe model. The final detail of each plan is yet to be defined and we are considering a free tier that would provide our future and expected to become blue chip single pane of glass. Having said that to maximize adoption we want to provide as much free value to the community and beyond as possible and will be looking at bringing more and more feature in the free tier over time. The pace of this will depend on the success of the service.\n\nPost release of this initial phase, early-bird adopters will only require delegating to our stake pool to access the service, with no minimum limit of ADAs.\n\nCommunity-driven vs SPO common-journey:\n\nWe don\u2019t advertise Adaglass as a SPO business looking at delivering extra value to differentiate ourselves from other pools. Instead, we are a Cardano-based business taking advantage of the STS model as an innovative way to provide access to our service. Our advertised community-driven core value is planned to be addressed at a later stage once we have all the platform building blocks in place, penetrated the market and healthy financials. We will publish our roadmap online shortly to provide better clarity. In fact, we have the vision to handover the platform to the community through the launch of a utility token, community governance and the decentralization of the platform infrastructure. This is a large topic and will be addressed as part of our 4th phase assuming all goes to plan.\n\nCapability to build the pool and CSA:\n\nWe have the full capability to build what we are proposing ourselves.\n\nFrom a DevOps perspective, working for service integrators, we have years of experience building enterprise grade marketing, data analytics and integration platforms with the like of Drupal, Adobe Experience Manager, Mulesoft, Splunk, Solr, Elastic Search, Open Search on-premise or in the cloud (AWS or GCP) and using configuration management, containers and infrastructure-as-code with Ansible, Terraform, CloudFormation, Jenkins, Kubernetes and Docker.\n\nFrom a development point of view, we have front-end experience with Ionic, Angular and Typescript, and have built sites, storefronts and portals for financials and telco companies. We have experience building serverless cloud solutions, microservices using Python and backend systems using JEE."}, {"q0": "The proposers are aiming to build a platform that allows users to visualize the growth and performance of the Cardano ecosystem in an easy and centralized manner. Providing users with an accessible data intelligence system will be useful for many within the community and could contribute to a greater understanding of the projects undertaken by Cardano. However, I give this proposal a three star rating because I believe the impact might not lead to an increased onboarding or implementation of the Cardano Ecosystem by B2B/B2C businesses. The Adaglass platform does not seem to be geared toward helping businesses adopt blockchain technology - rather it focuses on delivering the existing community with better tools, data and analytics and to increase engagement within the Cardano community. To achieve a 5 star rating I would simply submit the proposal to another category (e.g. Developer Ecosystem or Miscellaneous Challange). ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers provide a detailed breakdown of both the timeline and budget of the project, which makes it easy to understand how they will spend the money if founded and what steps they will take to develop the Adaglass platform. Furthermore the proposers have over 20 years relevant experience with software development, tech solutions and project management within the European tech industry. This strengthens my belief that the team will be able to complete the proposal. I do, however, worry that 5 months is too short of a timeframe to execute all the features the system should provide. On that note, the proposers discuss this issue in their detailed risk analysis and have come up with solutions to mitigate the issue. All in all I believe it is quite feasible for the proposers to achieve their goals, but in order to receive a 5 star rating I would recommend the proposers to extend their timeline by a couple of months seeing as they are a small team of only two people.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers provide a very detailed list of system requirements and features the platform should have when completed, making it easy to audit the progress of the project. However, I find that the proposal lacks KPIs regarding the value the system contributes to the Cardano Ecosystem and specifically how the platform aligns with the key metrics for the specific category.To achieve a higher rating I recommend that the proposers discuss how they will measure the success of the finished product. I would for example like to know how you would measure an increased community engagement, an elevated global awareness or how you will measure that the trust in the Cardano Ecosystem has indeed increased. A couple of examples for KPIs could be: \u201c40% increased community engagement\u201d, \u201cGlobal awareness increased by 10 %\u201d, \u201c15% increase in monthly users of the Cardano ecosystem\u201d (please note that these numbers are arbitrary). Such KPIs would ensure that the platform provides it\u00b4s intended value to the ecosystem.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1403", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you for taking the time to thoroughly review our proposal and highlighting some of your concerns and gaps.\n\nFirstly, with regards to your concern that the Adaglass MVP Platform proposal might not lead to an increased onboarding or implementation of the Cardano Ecosystem by B2B/B2C businesses, and that as such it should be submitted to another challenge, we seem to have a different appreciation of the Business Solutions\u2019 challenge. The primary aim of our proposal is to setup Adaglass, a new Cardano-based business, by launching its MVP and beginning its operations. Additionally, this operationalization phase of Adaglass relates to Cardano in four ways:\n1.\tIt focuses solely on the Cardano ecosystem\n2.\tIt integrates with reliable and relevant Cardano-based data and content sources, helping to strengthen the positions of key services and actors in the ecosystem\n3.\tIt participates to the Cardano decentralization via the build and operations of a Stake Pool\n4.\tIt is sustained by a Stake-to-Subscribe business model and leverages dApp connectors\n\nWe believe this delivers on key aspects of the challenge, including that:\n\u2022\tIt is an innovative product and service that increase transparency and stakeholder engagement\n\u2022\tIt is a Minimum Viable Product that could be built on Cardano\n\u2022\tIt is a creation of model of a system\n\nSecondly, with regards to the proposed 5 month project duration that might be short to allow the full delivery of the scope on time, you are right in highlighting that this is a very tight timeframe for the size of the team. We are fully aware of this, have highlighted this as a risk, provided some mitigations, anyway have purposely built an optimistic and still realistic timeframe based on the followings:\n1.\tWe want to start small, drive simplicity, build an MVP and keep a short time-to-market\n2.\tWe want to reduce pre-seed fundings to its bare minimum\n3.\tWe want to ensure a fast execution to keep momentum and manage team fatigue\n4.\tWe want to keep the team small to reduce onboarding and ramp up time, ease collaboration and increase foundational quality\n5.\tWe will be accelerated by solution blueprints, templates, and automated jobs that we have built in previous relevant projects\n\nFinally, with regards to the lack of KPIs that relate to the value provided to the Cardano Ecosystem and specifically how the platform aligns with the key metrics for the specific category, we have again done this on purpose and decided to commit on output-based criteria over outcome-based. The primary drivers for this are:\n1.\tThe Adaglass Platform and the Cardano ecosystem are both in their incubation phase and baseline metrics don\u2019t exist to propose any measurable outcome-based improvements. We aim to fulfil that gap with Adaglass.\n2.\tOutcomes are mainly out-of-our-controls and not the primary objectives of this proposal. We aim to build a platform and bring a business into operations at this stage, achieving market penetrations and ecosystem improvements at this stage would require additional marketing initiatives, fundings and partnerships that are planned for a later phase in the project.\n3.\tPositive ecosystem outcomes coming from proposals would be fragmented across and summed up by all initiatives in the challenge/ecosystem, would not be reached and quantifiable in isolation, and would be reached far beyond the timeframe of this proposal. There are other mechanisms, services and actors in the ecosystem that are best placed to undertake such effort following a more holistic approach. Trying to do this ourselves would distract us from the original objective of this proposal.\n\nThat being said, there are a number of KPIs that we will track on the back of this phase to baseline and start measure the performance of Adaglass, including:\n\u2022\t# Total Visitors\n\u2022\t# Home Page Visitors\n\u2022\t# CSI Signup Page Visitors\n\u2022\t# CSI Homeview Page Visitors\n\u2022\t# Total Qualify Leads (Connected Wallets)\n\u2022\t# Total Customers (Staked Wallets)\n\u2022\t# Total Signups (New Staked Wallets)\n\u2022\t# Avg Stake\n\u2022\t# Total Stake\n\u2022\t% Conversion Rate\n\u2022\t% Churn Rate\n\u2022\t# MRR\n"}, {"q0": "Creating a platform where users can go to find more information about the current growth and opportunities in the Cardano ecosystem is extremely important.
