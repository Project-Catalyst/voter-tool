This allows the community to easily understand assess the impacts of this project. They did intensive research on the current market and discover the huge potential to develop their project aiming at their key clients (Pharma Clients). The proposal also mentions the expected outcomes that their project will generate using the Cardano Blockchain and eventually grow Cardano\u2019s ecosystem. They set clear goals of leveraging the relationships with current clients and access to 250k potential candidates. This will help the community identify their determination and better evaluate the solution in general.\nThe main challenge is well foreseen, along with possible addressing orientations. They are confident in their ability to confront this problem and looking for other support from the Cardano ecosystem.

All smarts contracts/transactions between the various Parties will be handled/resolved in ADA, DJED or perhaps, our native token (decision pending).  Based on our forecast, we're aiming to be a 10-digit annual $ turnover organization/project soon thereafter.\n \nRe: funding status, this is our first time requesting funding for Phase 1.  Subsequent Phase 2 & 3 are not yet funded, and we'll be seeking funding help from Catalyst process in Q3/Q4 time-frame.\n\nPlease allow us to provide add'l points re: the platform.  Our solution is a first of its kind to use AI / ML and Blockchain to accelerate patient recruitment, matching and increasing the retention, while reducing the delays in clinical trials. The entire clinical trial information and patient data is stored and imported from our existing Kognitic platform, which is fundamental to how the information is stored, sliced-diced and analysed. The new platform would have modules to collect data from thousands of records on patient matching through the clinical trial process with the AI / ML scripting and models deployed. Blockchain would have the Cardano-based wallets for the stakeholders involved in the clinical trials to track the token rewards and subsequent transactions of the ADA tokens. We expect a rapid rise of these tokens as more patients, pharma companies, Doctors / Clinics join the bandwagon. The platform would have a web and mobile portal for tracking of activities and milestones.  By end of Month 1, we shall have the screens and process flow ready with ADA token economy. By end of Month 3, the platform should be able to have an integrated flow between the application and blockchain. By Month 6, we should be ready with going POC with client(s)."}, {"id": 4036, "q0": "I think this proposal is highly humane because this is a project that the target audience is those that the proposers are less interested in. and surely if this project is successful, it will bring many benefits to the patient's participants.

In addition, this proposal also aims to encourage Pharma's customers to participate in our solution by monetizing through ADA staking. Access and partner with leading pharmaceutical clients to develop next-generation drugs or therapies and access patient records. and all first clinical trial solutions built on blockchain to ensure data integrity and safety.

HIPAA Compliance would be built in the end-to-end process of data acquisition, patient matching and sharing the patient information with Pharma clients through an appropriate Patient Consent mechanism built in the application. We would use Atala Prism for the Decentralize Identity along with encryption of data. The patients would provide consent through the Private Key which allows the decryption of the data to the party to whom the PHI needs to be disclosed, as appropriate. Our conceptual solution, as of today, has good clarity on how HIPAA compliance would be achieved and would follow on HIPAA Risk Assessments regularly to check for breaches, if any. In our detailed plan, we would be developing HIPAA sensitive transactions and storage of information and highlight at each stage of the process on how we plan to remain compliant."}, {"id": 8798, "q0": "This proposal is a B2B technology solution and so within that frame the proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\n\nHowever, the proposal, in this reviewer's opinion, is not \"Innovative products and services that increase efficiency, transparency, and stakeholder engagement as well as expand the business to new areas.\"\n\nThe tech proposed does not bring a new capability to the world, because it is, at its core, a reward and patient matching scheme, relying on existing tech to accomplish its core mission- website development, API's, CTMS, and AI.

Please allow us to address some of the points raised which will help explain as to the rationale for filtering out the reviewer's rating.\n\nHistorically, patient recruitment was heavily-dependent on manual interventions and driven by each pharma organization in silo.  What makes our platform innovative, brings new capabilities and increases efficiency is that we aim to decentralize and democratize clinical trials patient recruitment.  We will give patients, regardless of their background and/or access to quality healthcare, more power and resources to directly search, find and sign up for the clinical trial that best suits them via a ranking system.  Additionally, our platform will make it easier for the patients to navigate and understand complex medical protocols (ex. inclusion & exclusion criteria).  \n\nFurthermore, the crypto industry and crypto projects have started to see some broader adoption.  DeFi and NFT projects have, for the most part, greatly led the way.  Our solution will bring into Cardano's ecosystem, based on our rather conservative estimates, by Year 3, 1) ~150m patients/patient records registered on the blockchain and 2) over 10 Big Pharma clients and another dozen of smaller Pharma and CRO clients.  Cardano's founder, Charles Hoskinson, has a strong vision to make inroads into the healthcare industry, and we're aiming to be one of the pioneers in this aspect.  Additionally, our Finance team will work with our clients' finance teams to onboard them into the world of smart contracts and crypto payments.  Picturing a Big Pharma company, such as J&J, Novartis, BMS, Merck, etc., settling their first invoice via crypto payment will surely be a significant step not only for this project, but we also hope for Cardano and broader crypto industry.  We were all excited to read about Dish Network's decision to use Cardano, we hope that Cardano Community will be equally excited to read about this big step/achievement in the coming months.\n\nOur platform would be the first of a kind to bring NLP, multiple dimensions of AI / ML in the assessments, recommendations and retention phases of the patient recruitment and clinical trials on the blockchain. The business ecosystem includes potential patients, Doctors / Physicians / Clinics / Hospitals, Pharma and Medical research companies coming together for mutual benefit of better matching, retention and accelerating clinical trials and efficiency. With the host of clinical trials and patient data already on the platform, our AI / ML models should be able to build a better and sophisticated patient matching models and assessments/scoring.\n\nThe Executive team is complimented by a team of 10 associates from current company (Kognitic) and NatSoft (blockchain dev. partner) who are supporting and contributing \"sweat equity\" as we're trying to take the project off the ground in the short-term.  Furthermore, we will be looking to hire 4 dedicated Scientific Affairs associates (included in the budget proposal), as that is the area where most amount of focus and effort is needed, besides the platform development.  Recently, we have made progress by attracting our new Head of Sales & Relationship (due to confidentiality, we cannot disclose his/her identity yet) and have also added to our Advisory Board a reputable American Radiologist/Doctor, who is well-versed in the field of Clinical Trials, and own and manages 70 clinics in the US.\n\nFrom a platform development perspective, significant work has already been done on the clinical trials database aspect (~70k hours).  What awaits is work to be completed on the patient records, portal and blockchain.  We have already taken steps with our legal counsel to start registering the company and assess/build our HIPAA-compliance policies.  From a sales perspective, we are currently working with 7 clients, and are actively in discussions with one client.
