Creators are people who invest in the stock market and issue tokens that simulate their portfolio and sell to investors. The question is why the stock market? Investor capital will flow into securities instead of the Cardano ecosystem. The proposal is completely inappropriate for the \"Business Solution (B2B B2C)\" challenge, and I have not really felt how the proposal will bring value, impact the Cardano ecosystem.\nAlso, the proposal says \"Just passionate fans-turned-investors of content creators who want to see them grow their business\", it's clear that creators benefit, and Catalyst funds are used to fund this group of people.\nI would recommend to the proposer that it is advisable to focus on what Cardano is building so that directing the capital inflow here will have more impact.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "There are many points that make me disagree about the feasibility of the proposal:\n\n1. Crowdfunding flows into the stock market through tokens from the creators, rather than into the Cardano ecosystem. One thing will make the voter not accept the proposal and no vote for you\n2. When the creators receive dividends through securities, how does the proposal distribute back to investors through smart contracts?\n3. How is the creator's input checked? What I mean is that the creators themselves must have professional qualifications, good portfolio management capabilities, and certifications in portfolio management in order to gain the trust and credibility of investors. The proposal does not yet have a solution to test the ability of the creator.\n4. Legality is not available, currently the proposal is only mentioned in the section on risks and challenges, there is no specific measure to implement this issue. In addition, the proposal's member has no legal experience.\n5. What is the spending budget for each work item. The proposal requests a budget of $30,000 and there are no reports mentioning the use of this funding. It is difficult for the community and voters to evaluate the feasibility of implementing the proposal.\n\nConclusion, I have a little suggestion for the proposer, you should add more resources to meet the strict requirements, and have a more detailed plan.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "I look forward to suggestions that can update more core team information.
