While this proposal does offer a unique B2B/B2C opportunity, I'm still not convinced that the restaurant or cloud kitchen business models would be best served by a blockchain/NFT solution.  I'm also a bit confused how the personas and white labeling ties into your business model.  And regarding NFT minting for recipes, you it would be helpful to have more information about the monetization model you are proposing (i.e. Would creators plan to sell these recipes?  Do they represent ownership?  Would that kind of ownership be enforceable in any way?)", "q0r": 2, "q1": "While I do believe that your unique team experience could help you to overcome your main stated challenge of making a user friendly experience for your non-tech target market, and based on my personal experience with projects like this, I think your team could benefit from more tech talent or a plan on how to deliver tech achievements with an outsourced solution.  Based on the team profiles provided, it seems the UX/UI developer will be carrying a lot of the load on this, and there wasn't enough information to evaluate if the project lead (Karim) has the skills needed to bridge the tech side with the non-tech feedback side - in order to deliver a feedback loop that would make this project meaningful.  And given that this project is mostly in an exploratory phase, I would encourage you to develop it a bit more, then put together a more full proposal that might be able to get you to an MVP stage without the need to double back for small amounts of funding.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "While the timeline and budgets proposed for this project are still a bit conceptual, it might be possible to audit this project if they use the open source repository linked to the proposal.  However, since most of the deliverables for this project are still early phase design and concept oriented, there could be some challenges in evaluating the \"readiness\" or this project for follow-on funding or continued development work unless those reviewers are knowledgable in the competitive landscape of this specific type of business operation.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1224", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 942, "q0": "This is an interesting, unique and fun idea to integrate the F&B industries and \"foodies\" into the blockchain economy and closely fits the challenge setting by bringing extensive experience in the business area proposed in to the Cardano blockchain. Usability both B2C and B2B should be possible with this project, and the main components of a successful business solution like delivery and marketing channels are presented. The whole proposal is unfortunately quite brief and lacks some of the information mentioned in the Community Advisor Assessment Guide such as discussion of key metrics of the challenge setting and how they would align with the project's. Also, no mention of scalability is made and reference to risks under the Impact section of the proposal is made only to UX/UI and not the technological aspects of the blockchain, the business environment, economic climate, trends and other desirable information.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "No timeline is given and the team's profiles are also lacking references to verify or understand more fully whether relevant skills exist.

First, I want more details on the technical aspects of this interface. Does this website/app have any distinctive qualities that set it apart from other competitors in the market?
