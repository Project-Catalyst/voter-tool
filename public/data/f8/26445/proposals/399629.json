Proposals are in line with the business solution challenges presented. I have read through all the details contained in the proposal and have a few small questions if you can answer me. Can you detail why when the goods are put on the exchange, it will improve liquidity, because the nature of this commodity is already illiquid? Assets such as real estate, goods, when exchanged, how will the legality in that country be? A detailed description of these additional issues will facilitate your application for funding.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "In terms of feasibility, the proposal provides development roadmaps as well as the amount of work to be done and the estimated budget. I completely agree with this route. However, when it comes to feasibility, there are still many questions surrounding the legal issue. I have suggestions on how to add a roadmap to improve the legal framework in Vietnam. And have you taken into account the risk that the legal framework cannot be built, does the proposal have a backup plan? In addition, you also detail the experience of each member of the development team, I appreciate this. However, if you can add links to personal pages like Github, Linkedin to check more specifically, it will increase transparency for the project.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As for the KPI to evaluate the success, I completely agree with the targets and data of the proposed proposal.

This proposal raised a critical, relatively large-scale problem that met the challenge. Currently, many enterprises face issues related to the security of their illiquid assets and extensive inventories. The form of barter has existed for a long time (also known as Barter Trade). This idea will form a new way of segmenting trade that combines the classic spirit of Barter Trade with Blockchain. This will create liquidity for illiquid assets, and non-bank currency trading will become more common.\nThe proposer has carefully given documents to guide viewers with an overview of the world barter industry and blockchain barter. The solutions they offer for this proposal are very detailed, identifying most of the problems of the challenge. Cardano will be an essential bridge to bring tangible assets into the blockchain world.\nThey also mentioned three main risks: market economy, legal and regulatory, and financial. Every threat has a solution to overcome.\nWhile this is a good suggestion, the solutions are relatively complete. But I see that transportation and tariffs are also crucial in trade between countries. It affects the value of goods and assets exchanged. So how will the pricing of the goods be guaranteed? I hope the team can explain it to me.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has provided a very detailed plan, a clear roadmap, with goals according to specific timelines.

However, the cost of launching the test network has not been detailed yet.\nThe information about the group members given is not complete. There is no specific job assignment. However, identity is challenging to determine. Here, the proposer provides only basic information about the experience. I would like to know more about their achievements and their specific work in this project.

That can work for the success description, however, for the progress measurement there should have been a different answer. The question is not what the progress is, but how it will be measured. For instance, the first step on the roadmap is \u201c- April \u2013 June 2022: set up development team and making MVP\u201d - there should have been an explanation of how the community can easily verify if that certain step has been implemented, will there be a website, a GitHub, etc where the code for the MVP will be uploaded, will there be any announcement and description of the development team hired and so on, for all the KPIs provided.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_20", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7582, "q0": "Problem statement\nEnterprises encounter with liqiuidity problem with their illiquid assets. Barter exchange on a blockchain platform may solve this problem.

This solution will help to create the necessary liquidity or exchange of goods between companies. I appreciate this idea, it fits this challenge. The proponent also gave 3 main risks (Economic and Market risk / Legal and regulatory risks / Financial risk ) To promote the use of electronic money for this, I have a small suggestion besides the exchange of goods, please promote the payment of electronic money. Pay for your company's merchandise in crypto to help people get to know each other.

Information provided is complete, development time is reasonable I appreciate this. Regarding the proposed cost, it is recommended to add more clearly 5 members of the development team to be assigned work, time and unit price to clarify $ 4000 per member / month. Suggested cost $100000 doing a demo barter with 100 members, would be great if you could clarify in detail how this would be used.
