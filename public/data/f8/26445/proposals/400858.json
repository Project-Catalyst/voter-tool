Regrouping multiple transport companies into this platform could be very useful for people and could bring a lot of new users into the Cardano world. IT would be interesting to consider why people would choose this platform since public transportations already have websites where to purchase their tickets. Also, it means that using this platform, prices will be higher considering that to be financially sustainable, the platform will have to charge fees.\n\nAlso, the proposer wants the platform to be decentralized over centralized, what advantage will it bring? Why this choice?\nWhy using crypto will make it easier for people who want to travel, especially from remote area?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The general idea is interesting and the team has a good backgroung in transportation services and project management I think. Nevertheless, the technical part of development of the platform and the coding part is absent in this proposal. Also, The team does not contain anyone able to code and build the platform. \nDoes the proposer want to integrate a wallet within the user accounts to be able to pay for ticket transportation? If so, this is a lot of work and time to make a secure feature.\nAlso, the plan of 1 million users within 2 months would include probably hundred thousands of dollars of marketing. How do they plan to bring this amount of people in such short time, especially with the pandemic?\nThe proposer list several interesting  future challenges but does not propose any solution to them. It would be interesting to think about a solution in advance and write it in the proposal.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The answer to the description on how the progress of the project will be measured is:\nUsers/travelers - whether you are resident or a visitor that uses a mode of transportation, it will be easier for you to commute because of the readily available payment mean\nPayment solution providers - since there is a reduce barriers of transportation options, an increase in the number of ridership means an increase in revenue\nGovernment/Transportation policies - Unifying payment creates fair benefits by allowing access to lower fares and better payment method\n\nUnfortunately that will not help the Cardano community to follow the progress of the development of the project. It would be interesting to have a Github link for example or any other solution. Sharing progress or struggles in the development of project may help proposers to receive feedback from the community and so to be more efficient.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1311", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3028, "q0": "The proposal is based on building a unified payment solution for the public transport in Philippines.

However, from my point of view as a marketing expert, the go-to-market strategy is not coherent enough.

The system can integrate all existing modern payment forms such as EMC, NFC, QR Code, Digital Wallet, etc..\nThe solution will change the way to recognize blockchain applications.

The budget is well allocated in single phase with costs and a list of specific work done. \nThe committed team members have a lot of experience in the fields of banking, computers science and business administration. In addition, I\u2019d like to suggest the proposer to add people with experience in building platforms on the Cardano blockchain, namely Haskell, Plutus languages for building smart contracts to perform automatic fee collection and payment transactions.
