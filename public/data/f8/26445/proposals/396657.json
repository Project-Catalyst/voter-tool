DAOs will be at the heart of driving real world adoption on Cardano for B2B/B2C use cases, and the goal of this project is to make it simple and easy for businesses to create and manage their DAOs. \n\nThe proposer clearly shows they have been critically thinking about this concept for a long time through the inclusion of previous catalyst proposals that break the larger vision of this proposal into smaller components. It would be beneficially for the community to understand the status of those proposals in more detail.\n\nAs mentioned in the proposal there seems to be a focus on getting real estate developers and start ups in the Miami area to start operating as DAOs after the completion of this proposal. Tooling for these use cases will likely need different capabilities. \n\nOverall, I believe this proposal addresses the challenge because it aims to lower the technical barrier to entry so that businesses and real world organizations can operate on the blockchain as DAOs.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It is unclear whether the team/individual will be able to implement this proposal successfully. While the individual proposer has an impressive background in spacecraft software and is located in a hotbed for crypto adoption, building DAO infrastructure wrapped in an easy to use interface is a highly complicated and large task.\n\nI am left with questions: Does the proposer have experience coding in plutus? Are there more individuals on the team trying to accomplish this project? Is this project talking to businesses wanting to become DAOs in Miami? Were the previous proposals communicated in this proposal carried out or worked on at all? The proposer can potentially shed light on some of these questions.\n\nI am familiar with a few other projects and development labs working to build easy to use DAO infrastructure within the Cardano ecosystem and encourage the proposer to get in touch to see how synergies between their projects and this proposer can be made. There might be more, but as previously mentioned it would be beneficial to see how this proposer can collaborate with other projects building similar solutions.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposer has provided clear and understandable KPIs for after the completion/launch of V1, but due to the roadmap lacking identifiable time horizons it seems audibility of this proposal would be difficult. \n\nIt would be useful for this proposal to commit to providing a monthly/bimonthly update to monitor progress should funds be won. In general it is not obvious that this proposal can be easily audited as the roadmap does not detail time horizons and there is no mention of how the proposer/project will update the community as they embark on building DAO infrastructure.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1087", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 5, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal is aligned with the Challenge.\nThis proposal clearly stated how they want to help the business enterprises using the Blockchain & smart contracts to solve their business problems.

It will be great if the proposer can provide the timeframe to complete the proposal. \n \n The proposer mentioned the main challenge is to convince the enterprises to use ADA as the base unit of value as it is volatile but with the introduction of the most awaited stable coins in Cardano ecosystem, this challenge can be eased. \n \n I think the main challenge will be to convince businesses to introduce the use of blockchain in their business.

The studies are based on the research of the proposer group. I hope the group will come up with specific solutions so that the foundation model can be put into practice soon. However, besides that the project also has certain risks that we may not be able to foresee.

I think it's very reasonable, but it is necessary to leave an estimated budget to supplement in case of need or if not, there must be a backup plan when necessary. About members to work, I think that's too thin not to say whether the members' capacity is suitable or not if the project is successful, it is expected that there will be at least 100 financial organizations on the platform.

Detailed explanation about businesses\u2019 needs and why they should employ this solution should be added to show how it helps solve the demand of businesses. From that, the description about how impactful it is to business would be more persuasive. However, the proposal did such an excellent job in explaining how this solution met three key metrics of the given challenge. With a simple funding portal of the project's MVP, it will raise additional funding to the stage. This solution also helps reduce a whole lot of overhead costs with the assistance of the blockchain system. An example illustrating this benefit was also provided to make it even clearer to see. Also, this solution will boost the Cardano network as it employs Cardano as the main currency for all business transactions.

The fact that one of their development goals is to on-ramp traditional small businesses onto the blockchain, hence assisting the community's growth, is worth-praising. This proposal's purpose and measurements are in line with the requirements of the challenge. It's also interesting to see the proposer define the objectives for each metric so that the impact may be estimated. Nonetheless, I would advise the developers to present more details on how it will meet the needs of the users of Cardano.

This proposal, in my opinion, would benefit much from a brief presentation of the core team, as well as adequate connections to validate their skill and experience. Perhaps a link to previous work or LinkedIn profiles would be really beneficial. From the proposal, the majority of the funding would be spent on security auditing and scaling software development efforts. Although there is a roadmap with described events, it would be helpful to include extra information on the duration of each step. A well-defined timeframe with exact figures at monthly or yearly intervals is strongly advised. I would suggest that the amount of the budget (or percentage of it) spent on these areas be made public. Furthermore, developers are a part of the team; how the budget is divided among the individuals, as well as how many working hours are projected for each job, would greatly boost the viability of the idea. In conclusion, I recommend that the team consider providing a clear statement that these concerns were taken into account.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal includes some valuable information about measurements of success with specific numbers, which is incredibly easy to track the progress. According to the proposal, the project will be monitored via the MintMatrix.io DAO's on-chain activity with links to the proposed metadata identifiers. Auditability can be measured through the points that the authors address. It is, in short, the number of users participating in the platform (individuals, companies), the successful transactions, which all are measurable. However, I believe the proposer should provide much more information on the project's development and approach. It would be extremely helpful if we could see a detailed roadmap with milestones. For example, where is the project after three months, six months, nine months, and twelve months?
