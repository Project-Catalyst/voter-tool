Blockchain is growing day by day, and it is gradually being applied to businesses, industries, and governments around the world. However, it still has many limitations, so developing ideas about enterprise solutions is necessary. ERP is considered one of the most successful business management solutions today, turning resources into resources, saving costs, increasing competitiveness, and bringing long-term benefits to enterprises. But most undersized businesses, large enterprises, corporations, or governments use a centralized ERP solution. If this proposal succeeds as intended, then CERP will be the leading solution running with a decentralized and distributed blockchain subtitle. I think Cardano ERP (CERP) meets the challenge will drive the perpetual growth and adoption of the Cardano ecosystem. \nTeam solutions have identified most of the problems, clearly written and logical reasoning, towards adding value to the Cardano ecosystem. Apply Cardano to businesses, industries, and governments of all sizes. There are countless opportunities to innovate and create modules tools and provide support. Define, innovate, create and shape commercial and government standards. Provide Catalyst Fund recipients with accountability and transparency. Create many opportunities for partnerships inside and outside the Cardano ecosystem. Leverage thousands of experienced developers to train and develop solutions on Cardano. \nBesides, the team has given some possible risks when implementing the project and delivered specific solutions for them.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Reading the experience summary and Cardano ERP - Vision Paper, I highly appreciate the project team. The founders are international ERP consultants and have over 30 years of experience scoping ERP solutions, testing, implementing, supporting, training, customizing, and hosting for vendors leading ERP solutions. They have a good understanding of the Cardano ecosystem. Each person was given a clear work assignment per their experience and knowledge. However, it will be even better when I identify them. I would like to see more information to verify the creators of this project, such as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin,... so that I can make sure that they are not impostors, they have professional experience. They are regularly active on social networks and have updated news about the project. \nThe implementation roadmap is divided, including phases 0-3. This proposal is phase 0 of the project (planning phase). The project's proposed budget is relatively high ($600,000 accounting for 60%) for Phase 0- Planning phase. The budget is divided into 3 sections, giving clear and detailed explanations for each item. Reading the Cardano ERP - Vision Paper with my basic understanding of ERP, I think this proposed budget is reasonable. The talent of an experienced ERP developer is costly, but the team has come up with a precise hourly wage calculation, and other costs are explained in detail.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proponent did not give any numbers or KPIs to measure the progress and development of the project. Instead, they only say how to use the money received; and the reports will be posted periodically and transparently on their website. Progress will be measured when the timelines are met. However, when looking at the project's website posts, I would like to know what metrics I should pay attention to and how much they are.\nThis is a brand new project. Not tested yet, only in phase 0, so this proposal's success is essential. If not funded, the following stages will be considered eliminated.

Unfortunately, planning activities do not lend themselves well to KPI reporting.  Hence we do not offer any for Phase 0.  In our opinion, projects are not all \"cookie-cutter\".  The \"requirement\" for KPIs does not fit every project or project phase and the suggestion that KPIs are \"required\" may need to be tempered somewhat.  After we architect the solution, we should have plenty of KPIs to share for future Phase funding proposals.  Providing bogus KPIs such as \"We expect to have 3 ideas from every Team member\", or \"We expect to write 100 lines of code for the MVP\", or somesuch during this planning phase would be a transparently bogus attempt to \"check a box\" and immediately seen as such by an astute community.\n\nIf, after reading our proposal and linked Vision Paper, you have some suggestions for KPIs for Phase 0 (only), we will certainly consider them for publishing to cerp.dev.\n\nWe hope to earn your vote and invite you to send any questions or feedback to us at feedback@cerp.dev.

The budget breakdown was given, but it was quite general and lacked details. For example the cost for teams, it should describe how many people are included in a team, how much budget would be distributed for each person. Another point to mention here is that this proposal stated that the detail would be included in the Vision Paper in the attached file, but it would be more convenient and easy to follow if  it provided all details here in the proposal. The project is led by a talented team. The project founder possesses 30 years of experience in leading ERP solution vendors. He is also an active supporter of the Cardano mission and vision. Therefore, it is likely that this project will be directed in the right way. The project manager is also an outstanding person in the field of ERP solution scoping, testing, implementation,...with more than 30 years of experience.
