The solution would be useful in industries similar to  biotechnology, artificial intelligence, chemical synthesis, and other high-computation sectors.  \n\nAll of these sectors have a bright future ahead of them and are high growth, knowledge-intensive sectors. It is premature to say that there are significant scaling opportunities here that can benefit from a blockchain solution, but I think that the high rewards possible in case of a successful implementation definitely deems this proposal worthy of being voted for.
