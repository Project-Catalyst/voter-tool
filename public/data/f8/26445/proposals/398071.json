We have that the proposal fits the scope of the challenge, but some reservations must be made. Given the way the problem was stated and the structuring of the site so far, we realized that the idea was conveyed very directly. Considering its complexity, perhaps the best strategy would not be to initially target the development of the platform and then sell parcels of properties on the site. The idea, structured in this way, seems to speed up the implementation of a rather new concept too much and thus raises a great doubt regarding the future success of the project. Also, given the pretension of the idea, the amount being asked of $25,000 might not be enough either. Let's take a closer look at these points later.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The central idea of \u200b\u200bthe project aims to obtain a 'part' of a real property. The acquisition of this part would take place through a purchase with tokens, but it was not possible to find in a simple way on the website what the value of these tokens would be, and this would be a key point in the proposal. In addition, it is not possible to find the resume of any professional involved in the project. The description of the professionals needed in the project is also very general, the need for 3 developers is indicated, but what is the specialization of these developers? How much will they earn per hour worked?\n\nThe strategies indicated for marketing are also lacking in detail, there was only talk of using Twitter and Instagram to promote the idea, but without further explanation about how many people it aims to reach in the first months of disclosure, for example. As for the budget details, development and marketing expenses were mentioned, but given the complexity of the business, it seems that other aspects should also be considered. In general terms, we can see that it will not be easy to convince people to invest in real (or virtual) properties if a more elaborate plan does not exist, a recommendation would be to make more efforts to better understand a possible public adhesion to this new concept. , and reduce the amount of the budget a little, aiming to carry out, initially, a market research, instead of already trying to create the product and sell properties.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "For the same reasons described above, it seems that the metrics defined here to monitor the evolution of the project are not very viable, since the completeness of the site, or even the number of visits made, do not indicate whether the project will be really successful and if there is a real engagement around it.\n\nOnce again, it is a suggestion to try to channel the initial efforts to better carry out a survey with the public and establish quantitative indicators that demonstrate the public's adherence to this new way of investing in real estate.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 2, "ng": 9, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1602, "q0": "Your proposal is approaching a need in today's low-income people's life that is to own cheap real estate, I think this idea is good but there will be a lot of discussions here.

But unfortunately, the challenge is seeking solutions for businesses, this solution seems inappropriate. However, there is something that this proposal could improve for making the next proposal. It is good to see that this proposal mentioned the problem first then suggested a solution. Having said that, it should describe more about the solution by adding more technical information to explain how this solution works, its activities, its features, and functions. The impact of this solution was quite well-written, emphasizing on benefits that it will bring to the target audience. Another thing that this proposal could improve for the next time is to analyze the impact of the solution on the whole Cardano Ecosystem. In fact, It lacked mentioning the role of Cardano blockchain tech supporting this solution and how it will help increase the adoption of Cardano. It could explain if more people used their product, then what would happen to Cardano like more people would know and join Cardano or it would help increase the usage of ADA currency.

Besides, it should mention how long the cost would be used for, how to calculate that, whether it is calculated by hours, weeks, or months.

The increases in house prices relative to incomes make housing unaffordable to many segments of the population. Proposer want to release certain amount of tokens as proof of real estate ownership. And because house prices have a wide price range, it is better to define the price of the house you want to own. In addition, I predict that the proposer creates an investment pool for each house purchased. I think it will be better to create an investment pool for the entire portfolio of houses that will be purchased later. Since you want to provide housing to people who need a place to live, Proposer may grant discount on lease to the token owner. If they don't claim these rights, Proposer can give incentives in other forms. i.e. better rate of returns. Through this scheme, you will have 2 market segments: people who need a place to live and those who want to invest in property.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The concept offered by the Proposer is very similar to crowdfunding. It enables fundraisers to collect money from a large number of people via online platforms. It is an innovative way of sourcing funding for new projects, businesses or ideas. Financial pledges can be made and collected through the crowdfunding platform. And as relatively new offerings, many crowdfunding lack a lengthy track record of success. We can create a case study of buying a property through crowdfunding to map out the whole process.

Therefore, the proposal interest is aligned with the challenge scope.\n\nRegarding the potential of the scalar solution in future challenges, this is a question that requires a deeper analysis. First of all, as it is a feasibility study, the result will tell under what conditions the business solution can be implemented and the feasibility of developing a platform to conduct this process.

There is no solution to this risk, nor is there a marketing approach to attract people. In addition, I believe a powerful third party should be present to assure the security and protocol of incorporating a token into the purchase of real estate rather than money.

However, the idea should be more precise about what they do during those five months. They can include the phase of developing the app, as well as the equipment used to produce the app and the testing process. Alternatively, the proposer can indicate what type of personnel and how many will be required to construct the app. I am also not sure about the budget breakdown when the proposer only gives the total amount. The proposer can divide the proposal into little parts. such as estimating the hourly work, and then proceed hour by hour. If necessary, decide the budget on heads.

Although positive drift is very likely, i.e. over time the price will increase, an investment in real estate takes years to pay off.

That is, there is no army of retailers or professionals entering the market to buy or sell a property (as in stocks or other assets), only a handful enter the game. And with this lack of players comes wide markets, i.e. markets in which the buying and selling prices are so far apart each other that in the end neither buyers nor sellers get fair prices: in most cases, the seller will get a price far below and the buyer will get a price far above.
