This is an innovative way of looking to solve this problem with the help of blockchain technology.\n\nAs this proposal relates to supply chain management, the other proposers working on the same problems can collaborate or contribute to this feasibility study.\n\nThe proposal is going to provide a whitepaper on the completion of this study. I think this study will help many other projects who are willing to use the Cardano blockchain to solve business problems specifically supply chain-related issues. But I suggest the proposer broaden the proposal\u2019s work to include more than the removal of intermediaries.  \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team is qualified in business process mapping and project management. The developers' details for consulting in white paper preparation are not provided in the proposal. There is no external link such as LinkedIn to recheck the team credentials.\n\nThe roadmap and the timeframes have been extensively broken down into days. This is very good and will help with following up on the progress of the proposal. \n\nThe budget has been broken down onto a team process basis. The budget appears to be quite high in contrast to the task to be completed which is the removal of the intermediaries.\n\nThis proposal will not require additional funding as it will be accomplished on white paper writing. The interested individuals or concerns can utilize this white paper to improve the supply chain management and remove the intermediaries.\nGiven the above facts, the proposal is likely to be completed. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal progress is auditable by tracking the status of the various tasks, which are already divided and allotted the days to complete those tasks.

As this project is client driven and wants to work on a real business solution, it perfectly fits into the challenge and is able to show the benefits for other companies as well, as the white paper can be used to create further blue prints. Therefor it can be scaled and is a basis for further develpoments in this challenge.

The team\u00b4s experience fits to the project dedication and all roles are matched with people that seem to have the right experience fort he job.

For this proposal, a working use-case has already been shown, which is a good indicator of what is needed and will be used. The plan also identifies several major limits and hazards that may arise, as well as some appropriate solutions for each difficulty.
