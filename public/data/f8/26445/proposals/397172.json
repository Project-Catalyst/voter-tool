Therefore, it could be said that the proposal found a Cardano-based solution to satisfy businesses' needs, which is what the challenge is looking for. It defined the proposed product, Agora - a set of Plutus smart contracts, showed its functions, and also differentiated it from DAO. It takes a role as a governance library boosting the efficiency of Cardano DAO. By listing how B2B/B2C companies, DAOs, dApps, and community members will be able to benefit from this project, the proposal showed how impactful it is to those targeted objects. Besides, features for V1 and V2 of the mentioned products were also stated to provide readers with an overview of the proposed solution. Another highlight is that the proposal also demonstrated the technical aspect of the project. It listed how each function of the product works with technical information in great detail, which is highly evaluated to make it easier to visualize how the product functions.The proposal listed their expected outcome and explained why this solution met the first four key metrics of the challenge. It will create benefits for Cardano DAO from business solutions. It will scale this model on Cardano like the way they did a DAO2DAO deal size in Ethereum. It will also foster the quality of B2B/B2C proposal submissions. And this project is also funded from other sources as well showing how potential it is.

Also a detailed budget breakdown was not given, which is a big minus point in giving sponsors an overview of how capital will be allocated.\nAbout the team members of the project, a team of engineers and developers are highly appreciated as they have accumulated much experience. Take CTO Emily Martins for instance with more than 6 years of experience in this field.

According to the team, as Cardano DAOs get more and more powerful, they will inevitably attract web2 B2B/B2C companies that offer them products and services. The problem is that without a standard governance framework, these organizations cannot effectively engage in governance. In order to address this obstacle, they propose to introduce Agora, a simple and composable Plutus on-chain governance lego to unlock B2DAO economic models and open source DAO tooling. In my opinion, it is a very good idea and well written proposal. Problem statement is clear and the proposal solves it accordingly. A dedicated session exposing impact and providing an overview of Agora is also very welcomed as it makes the value proposition clear. Agora implementation directly addressed the first four key metrics to measure in this challenge. The team also anticipated possible risk and migration methods of reducing it which make me think they are very determined with the work.

This can greatly aid readers with understanding (in a rough sense) how the project is progressing or when the tasks listed in each section will be completed. There is a deadline for when the solution will be completed, making it simple to determine whether it can be completed in a certain amount of time. However, I have no idea how the funds will be distributed. They are requesting a large sum of money (100.000 USD), so it is critical that they provide details on how it will be used. I only see that they provide information on the working hours of each task. The proposer could potentially elaborate on how much they would pay per hour for individuals with different tasks in the project's implementation, which would help a lot in determining the budget's fairness. About the team member, there is Liqwid Labs: A team of expert Haskell / Plutus engineers and full stack developers building the 1st native lending and borrowing protocol on Cardano with CTO Emily Martins has been a professional Haskell developer for 6+ years, partnered with MLabs - a top-tier Haskell development shop in the Cardano ecosystem.

It would have been fantastic to include some credentials here. A LinkedIn page, a YouTube channel, or even a Twitter or Facebook account so that voters can learn more about their experience and qualifications.

The Agora suite addresses this problem by providing a relatively simple \"propose, vote, delegate, lock and execute\" process, so all possible DAO functionality is coherent and does not produce inconsistencies through complexity. Splitting the project into v1 and v2 phases should help to ensure relatively simple code and success of both open source rollout and more customized modules for actual needs by larger businesses later. \nThis is a fairly complex, definitely non-trivial, and potentially risky (if corporate/DAO funds are involved) endeavor but I think the high degree of Plutus specialization, experience with DeFi and strength of the team should see the project through to success.\nDisclaimer: I have no contact with Liqwid Labs and not much experience with DAO tooling.
