In short, yes, I agree that this project can have an impact that everyone can have equal chances of providing and accessing healthcare and services. However, it seems to me that the description is quite general since there is no clear impact on the ecosystem. It could have been mentioned how many people are targeted and should join the community, how many providers are expected to be in the market, etc. I suggest that some deliverables should be clearly provided.

The team is seeking funds to develop a marketplace using Blockchain Decentralized ID(DID's) and Stable tokens implementation to secure the provider\u2019s data and make services accessible and available globally. The goal of the proposal is quite clear, to reduce prices for services and the providers will offer more value added services, decrease the gap between rich and poor, company size and geography. If this proposal is to be implemented successfully, it means civilizers from developing countries can get access to advanced businesses' healthcare services globally, as well as small organizations can offer their services directly to consumers globally at an equal footing with big brands. The idea is ambitious and worth-praising. The intention is clear and sensible. The team also foresees some possible challenges, which is appropriate but unfortunately no sensible solution is presented to show how they plan to tackle them.

Referrals on LinkedIn were provided, so experience can be validated from that standpoint. However, I would suggest that the first background include some reliable links illustrating the initial works to increase the project's feasibility. The proposal also mentions recruiting new members from the Cardano community. My recommendation is that the team provide further information on how many individuals are required, the abilities required for each specific role, and what duties are required to contribute to the implementation. The plan does not provide enough information; it appears subjective and does not provide clarity on what will be created in the coming weeks or months. Unfortunately, due to a lack of information about the time, milestones and steps to take in order to attain the stated objective appear unreasonable and imprecise to what is being proposed. The budget is divided into three major categories: blockchain work, seller management functionalities, marketing, and onboarding. But, once again, none of them are clear, making it difficult to carry out the feasibility assessment and ensure the fairness of the budget breakdown. The team could consider defining and explaining particular expenses that should be broken down into identifiable items, as \"30K for blockchain work (Tokens, DID's, Wallets, Payments, Governance Modules)\" is insufficient to understand.

I wonder if it\u2019s accessible for everyone or just auditors? It would be greatly beneficial if these information were included: how long does the trial last for early participants? How many participants have the chance to be onboarded (no need an exact number but at least an estimation)? And how is \u201cearly\u201d in this situation? With answers to those questions, I would have a clearer vision of the project. The measurement of success is not sufficient to audit, also the success definition seems to be a bit short and hard to understand.
