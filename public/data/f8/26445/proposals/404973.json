Hence this proposal is aligned with Challenge as it involves B2B solutions.  \nThe way it will be carried out is first they will do a survey of 450 companies from 33 countries from around the world. Then those who are interested in Cardano-based solutions will be provided with training via workshops. I think this is a better way to bring the businesses into the Cardano ecosystem and Project Catalyst. This proposal will have a noticeable impact as it is going to onboard companies from around the world.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is capable to carry out the proposal as they are already active in the world and working with the United Nations Development Program for sustainable development goals. The team-related details are provided and can be seen on the website.\nThe timeframes given to complete the proposal is realistic to complete the survey, conduct the workshops, and then provide the selected companies with assistance to integrate Cardano into their Businesses.\nThe budget asked to undergo this proposal is realistic and it is broken into identifiable tasks. The team is experienced and thus they know of the resources required, they are doing this kind of work where they conduct surveys, conduct workshops & provide assistance to companies and hence they are well equipped for performing the mentioned job to help grow the Cardano ecosystem.\nAs mentioned by the proposer, they are encouraging the participation of the businesses in the initiatives of Cardano by bringing them together by conducting the workshops. This is one of the best ways to handle the challenge of lack of participation.\nThus by taking into account all the above facts, this proposal is highly likely to be executed.  ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal can be audited by tracking each step of the proposal such as the progress of the survey and its result, workshop participation and result, and finally the provision of assistance to the selection firms.\nThe budget is also tied to each stage of the proposal which is clearly defined. So, it makes it easier for the auditor to verify the execution and the disbursement of funds.  \nThe milestones are set out clearly in the proposal with the duration required to achieve them.\nAs stated in the proposal will be completed between May to September. This is a reasonable timeframe.\nThe success of the proposal can be measured with the number of companies using Cardano-based solutions, proposing in Catalyst, utilizing Cardano-based launchpads such as Cardashift, etc., and as a result, attaining projected cost savings & revenue increase.
