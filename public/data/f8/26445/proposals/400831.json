I absolutely loved the first one. This one isn't too different. In fact, it is almost the same proposal. Research Guild has a very solid proposal template that covers almost all bases. They have adapted the content to the challenge and proposal but most of the details are the same. So I will take a page out of their book and use some of my analysis from the other review here as well. \n\nThe proposal aims to produce a business report detailing status of business solutions in the Cardano ecosystem. The proposers have identified a critical problem in my opinion. They note: \" in our zeal to iterate in an exciting and innovative environment, \u2018scatter-gun\u2019 approaches to idea-generation can create a proliferation of poorly developed ideas, and inefficiencies in how those ideas are communicated or implemented\". \n\nThis is a massive pain point I too am feeling as I write these reviews. There are so many proposals looking to solve similar problems. Concentrated communal effort can be more effective at solving these problems. Research Guild provides an answer: a blockchain business report that scopes blockchain business, revealing these problems and solution efforts in detail. The visibility provided by the report will help the business ecosystem greatly. \n\nThe proposal not only promises to deliver an Business Report, but also the beginnings Research Guild, a collection of individuals with academic research skill. The guild will use those skills to generate tailored research projects for Catalyst campaigns and proposer collaborations. The proposers will start by contacting individuals in their researcher network but will also open the Guild to others to apply.  \n\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have gone out of their way to provide the most detailed budget in Fund 8. They have selected 5 surveys from which to find an average hourly rate for researcher work. This results at an hourly rate of 32.74 USD for research assistants. If the proposal is any indication to the attention to detail and quality of work we are to expect in the report, this is a bargain. \n\nThey have also created a 80-20 split for each proposal under Research Guild. 80% of the budget for each proposal (including this one) is reserved for research. The rest is for Admin Fund for Research Guild. The details of what these mean are given in astounding detail. They have a solid grasp on what they need to do to build Research Guild, how they will spend that 20%. They also define Custom Guild Reports and set an expectation for future Research Guild proposals and this one. \n\nThe proposers are a group of three PhD Candidates with varying backgrounds. Collectively they form a strong foundation for Research Guild, bringing in skills related to software, technology, intellectual property, law, international relations, media, creative, health and community development. With a clear methodology to find more researchers with expert knowledge when necessary, I have full confidence the team will be able to produce a high quality report.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is the most clear and auditable proposal I've seen in Fund 8 (along with its twin in the Open Standards challenge). The proposal is divided in two: establishing Research Guild, covering its administration costs and creating the ecosystem report. There is ample detail on what each of these entails, what will be done to make them happen. There are multiple KPIs for each which can be used to gauge the success of the project at any time.\n\nThe process by which the report will be generated is provided in detail. There is a report time budget template, which highlights how research will be loosely based on. This details the steps of the research project and provides a general timeline for those steps. Also, the proposers have provided a frame for this research, which can easily be used as a checklist by auditors looking to see if the goals of the project has been accomplished. Overall, this proposal is very clear and auditable. If all proposals were like this we wouldn't need CAs :D", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1323", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3634, "q0": "It explained how its outcome would address the question of the challenge. Because it will conduct project research and make a report about Blockchain-business solutions, and then this report will be transferred to the community so that it can be used to support or incorporate future funding proposals about Cardano-based business solutions. This solution seems indirectly aligned to the given challenge. It also did a great job in describing the activities of this solution, showing what it will do clearly, which helps easily visualize how the project will proceed. In fact, it described the benefits it brings about, which helps analyze the SWOT model that impacts the project and also assists to save time in the exploration stage, identify knowledge gap....Besides, it also shows the indirect impact of this proposal as this solution also aims at bringing more researchers to Cardano if it is launched successfully in the first phase. It mentioned the challenges when delivering this project. The plan to overcome them was given as well.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan given was detailed with a clear timeline. It first separated the plan into 2 main sections that need to be done in the plan, then provided the detail of each step. It also stated the proportion of each step in the overall percentage to complete this project. Each step was set for a deadline to complete. In terms of the budget breakdown, it was well-written. It showed how the cost was calculated. The explanation about this was given in great detail. In fact, it calculated the cost by hours based on the average of five online career surveys. After the rate was determined, it explained how to calculate the rate for each researcher by taking the scale and the scope of each project, the time required to finish... into consideration to come to the conclusion about the rate exactly. About human resources,  as it mentioned in the first part of the proposal, this project is led by three PhD candidates specializing in blockchain applications, intellectual property, Laws and International Relations.... The detailed information about their background, skills, and relevant experience was mentioned clearly along with the link to their profile as well. In conclusion, this project seems feasible as it has a detailed plan, clear budget breakdown and a strong and high-quality workforce.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "It mentioned 3 ways to audit this project. Each way, it explained thoroughly the criteria to measure.The fist way is to use KPIs in accordance with two main stages given in the plan which are building business guild and customizing guild report.  However, in the first way to measure the progress and the development of the project using KPIs, it should add more figures on the KIPs to make it more measurable. The success of this project was described in three criteria, but it would be better if more figures were added. Besides, it should mention whether this project is a continuation of a project that was funded before or not. All in all, it seems quite clear to measure the proceeding process of this project if figures are added into the KPIs.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1665", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5358, "q0": "This project clearly states the area of need and then proposes the solution in a clear, carefully thought out and remarkable way. This project would serve a great need for bridging idea and implementation. Research by experts for integration with Cardano based projects is fantastic. The Cardano community will definitely benefit from this Guild and it will facilitate the smoother initiation of and starting momentum of initiatives.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The building of the Research Guild is broken down into very specific tasks which makes it apparent that there has been thorough consideration of all the work that needs to be done, and this will create a solid foundation for future growth. There is built in quality control and payment is only made after report delivery which will prevent seepage of funds. The budget is based on researched information and seems feasible and appropriate.This Guild will flow with the Cardano funding cycles and will be able to evolve with the changing nature of the proposals. Members are highly specialised and have a broad range of skills and interests. There is evidence of thorough consideration of each step and potential challenges. The proposal creates great confidence in these people to make this happen.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPIs are detailed and adaptive. There is awareness of Sustainable-Development Goals of the UN and evidence of both the vision and the implementation. There is transparency and the Cardano community can access the progress made. There is clarity around payment, measurable success and the significance of this project is very clear.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1944", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10485, "q0": "This is a very interesting proposal to me. I believe that the success of every project will depend on the success of the kind of background research that has taken place and how it influences the goals of the project. In Cardano, one can boldly say that there is much acceptance and value of academic work that takes place; however, the mention of the Catalyst community lacks coordinated research that links Cardano-solutions to business needs. This is exactly the problem within the ecosystem. That is what this proposal has identified as their major problem. The issue now has to do with the manner in which they intend to solve the problem. It looks promising too to read on the solutions they offer. \n\nOu\n\n\nThe proposers here appear to be simple with their solution \u2013 they intend to  offer customised research reports for Catalyst campaigns. However, like software development, research isn\u2019t sexy \u2013 it takes grunt work. To achieve this work in a scalable way, they propose forming a Research Guild, or a collective of independent researchers investigating blockchain solutions on Cardano. Their aim is to be involved in building a professional research network within Project Catalyst, through invitation and paid research gigs. They also pens that the Research Guild will also provide paid support to other proposals and initiatives by forming problem-solving scrums around key issues. If the project is successful, their vision will be to build a global research network that draws researchers to Cardano, increases adoption as well as knowledge capital for DLT enterprise development. This is commendable and interesting as it will help mitigating alot of challenges involved in the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have been straight forward. They have been clear with the plan they presented. The information about the team described in the proposal is detailed, the experiences described and the\nwork already performed indicate that the team is fully capable of developing this work. The budget allocation requested is justifiable. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In this proposal one I can say that they equally did a good research in preparing this document. It reflects in the manner the proposers presented their metrics and KPIs. They  were well chosen and there is hope that they are good indicators for examining and evaluating project's success.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_925", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "The Research Guild will deliver a report to investigate opportunities and links between Cardano-based solutions and business needs (C2B).", "experience": "Three PhD candidates studying blockchain applications in land management, intellectual property and peer production; a PhD in Law and International Relations; expertise in research, project management, community development, governance, teaching, license compliance and auditing."}
