I absolutely loved the first one. This one isn't too different. In fact, it is almost the same proposal. Research Guild has a very solid proposal template that covers almost all bases. They have adapted the content to the challenge and proposal but most of the details are the same. So I will take a page out of their book and use some of my analysis from the other review here as well. \n\nThe proposal aims to produce a business report detailing status of business solutions in the Cardano ecosystem. The proposers have identified a critical problem in my opinion. They note: \" in our zeal to iterate in an exciting and innovative environment, \u2018scatter-gun\u2019 approaches to idea-generation can create a proliferation of poorly developed ideas, and inefficiencies in how those ideas are communicated or implemented\". \n\nThis is a massive pain point I too am feeling as I write these reviews. There are so many proposals looking to solve similar problems. Concentrated communal effort can be more effective at solving these problems. Research Guild provides an answer: a blockchain business report that scopes blockchain business, revealing these problems and solution efforts in detail. The visibility provided by the report will help the business ecosystem greatly. \n\nThe proposal not only promises to deliver an Business Report, but also the beginnings Research Guild, a collection of individuals with academic research skill. The guild will use those skills to generate tailored research projects for Catalyst campaigns and proposer collaborations. The proposers will start by contacting individuals in their researcher network but will also open the Guild to others to apply.  \n\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have gone out of their way to provide the most detailed budget in Fund 8. They have selected 5 surveys from which to find an average hourly rate for researcher work. This results at an hourly rate of 32.74 USD for research assistants. If the proposal is any indication to the attention to detail and quality of work we are to expect in the report, this is a bargain. \n\nThey have also created a 80-20 split for each proposal under Research Guild. 80% of the budget for each proposal (including this one) is reserved for research. The rest is for Admin Fund for Research Guild. The details of what these mean are given in astounding detail. They have a solid grasp on what they need to do to build Research Guild, how they will spend that 20%. They also define Custom Guild Reports and set an expectation for future Research Guild proposals and this one. \n\nThe proposers are a group of three PhD Candidates with varying backgrounds. Collectively they form a strong foundation for Research Guild, bringing in skills related to software, technology, intellectual property, law, international relations, media, creative, health and community development. With a clear methodology to find more researchers with expert knowledge when necessary, I have full confidence the team will be able to produce a high quality report.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is the most clear and auditable proposal I've seen in Fund 8 (along with its twin in the Open Standards challenge). The proposal is divided in two: establishing Research Guild, covering its administration costs and creating the ecosystem report. There is ample detail on what each of these entails, what will be done to make them happen. There are multiple KPIs for each which can be used to gauge the success of the project at any time.\n\nThe process by which the report will be generated is provided in detail. There is a report time budget template, which highlights how research will be loosely based on. This details the steps of the research project and provides a general timeline for those steps. Also, the proposers have provided a frame for this research, which can easily be used as a checklist by auditors looking to see if the goals of the project has been accomplished. Overall, this proposal is very clear and auditable. If all proposals were like this we wouldn't need CAs :D", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1323", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2151, "q0": "NOTE for VCAs and voters: The Research Guild is a network that has launched 6 proposals during this funding round. This proposal is judged partly through its individual merits, and partly through the way it fits into the wider Research Guild framework. My assessment takes into account aspects common across all proposals (the network\u2019s organizational aspects, competency, research approach, workload, or similar reporting mechanisms and budget logic). You shall therefore find common parts across these proposals and parts specific to each proposal.\n\nThis proposal aims to deliver a report that targets Cardano-2-Business challenges and solutions by exploring cases across blockchains.There is a good alignment with the challenge with a fair potential for added value for Cardano if the report is shared with the community and thoroughly digested by future proposers before designing business solutions. A worrisome point is whether an academic approach is the best in terms of identifying business opportunities since in general academics are not widely recognized for their business acumen. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Key takeaway: A point of concern is whether academic oriented people will be able to deliver valuable business insights and opportunities to the community.  \n\nThe plan. The core team consists of 3 PhD / PhD candidates from Auckland University, Renmin University respectively University of Osnabr\u00fcck, all currently undergoing blockchain-oriented activities. They would NOT conduct the research themselves, but instead they would extend invitations to their networks of academic and professional colleagues to participate in the actual research. Perhaps the standout of the team is the wide-net that they can cast within their own respective networks when searching for viable research candidates. They would subsequently undergo a recruitment / selection process based on received resumes / review of academic work published / blockchain experience. The actual work itself would be undertaken by this collective of independent researchers onboarded as above. \n\nBudget talk. 20% of the budget would go towards building the research network (research identification, outreach, project management, support, designing reporting templates, etc.). 80% of the budget would go to creating tailored research projects following a loosely based pathway which makes sense considering the knowledge-building capacity of the project. Payment for individual researchers would follow a determined base hourly rate, based on the average of online surveys already undertaken. There are extensive figures offered in the proposal, but the key figure to remember is the overall base pay of USD 32/hour and US 60/hour for highly specialized work.\n\nThe team estimates that the report will take six months to complete: from May 2022 until November 2022. There is a detailed project roadmap outlined in the proposal, with great granularity down to weeks necessary for each intermediary step.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Key takeaway: very clear roadmap and extensive KPI list, great verification potential and clear communication channels for work undertaken.\n\nThis work will be delivered in the form of a public report with key research insights and recommendations that can be implemented by the community immediately, or pursued through future Project Catalyst funding proposals.\n\nThe project team will approach auditability in three ways: (1) establishing a set of project indicators, (2) engaging in internal peer review processes for each deliverable and (3) engaging in Project Catalyst community advisor review processes. \n\nSuccess would be measured 20% through the success of establishing a research network and 80% on the report itself. The KPI list for both items above is extensive and quite possibly very challenging to implement in practice, but they are definitely an excellent starting point.

The assessment process provides a great opportunity for our team to clarify where our communication worked or not. \n\nThis flag is just a clarification of a couple points that may have influenced your score.\n\nThe first is your 'worrisome point' about whether academics will be suited to the task due to a perceived lack of business acumen. This seems to be the main point of concern raised in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcImpact / Alignment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFeasibility\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 criteria, and this may arise from a perception of who academics are generally, rather than who our team is personally. There was also a second point about who would be conducting the research for the Fund 8 batch of proposals.\n\n'A point of concern is whether academic oriented people will be able to deliver valuable business insights and opportunities to the community.'\n\nFirstly, the task we are proposing is to compile and deliver research reports that target campaign questions and communicate valuable insights and opportunities to the Catalyst community. We are specialists in this particular task. Not only for business, but for any field that requires valuable research-based insight. \n\nSecondly, our immediate team come from various professional backgrounds, and have not worked solely in academia. Atleast two of us are pursuing doctorates after 20 years in a wide range of professional environments, including start-up ventures and DAO communities. This will be something we will gladly communicate more clearly, and we appreciate the point made.\n\n'They would NOT conduct the research themselves'\n\nThis statement is not explicit in the proposal, and it may have been construed from the section speaking about recruitment. To clarify, members of our immediate team - including any eligible and available members that we recruit - will complete the funded research reports; as a completed report is the major deliverable for each proposal.\n\nThank you for taking the time to assess our proposals."}, {"id": 3634, "q0": "It explained how its outcome would address the question of the challenge. Because it will conduct project research and make a report about Blockchain-business solutions, and then this report will be transferred to the community so that it can be used to support or incorporate future funding proposals about Cardano-based business solutions. This solution seems indirectly aligned to the given challenge. It also did a great job in describing the activities of this solution, showing what it will do clearly, which helps easily visualize how the project will proceed. In fact, it described the benefits it brings about, which helps analyze the SWOT model that impacts the project and also assists to save time in the exploration stage, identify knowledge gap....Besides, it also shows the indirect impact of this proposal as this solution also aims at bringing more researchers to Cardano if it is launched successfully in the first phase. It mentioned the challenges when delivering this project. The plan to overcome them was given as well.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan given was detailed with a clear timeline. It first separated the plan into 2 main sections that need to be done in the plan, then provided the detail of each step. It also stated the proportion of each step in the overall percentage to complete this project. Each step was set for a deadline to complete. In terms of the budget breakdown, it was well-written. It showed how the cost was calculated. The explanation about this was given in great detail. In fact, it calculated the cost by hours based on the average of five online career surveys. After the rate was determined, it explained how to calculate the rate for each researcher by taking the scale and the scope of each project, the time required to finish... into consideration to come to the conclusion about the rate exactly. About human resources,  as it mentioned in the first part of the proposal, this project is led by three PhD candidates specializing in blockchain applications, intellectual property, Laws and International Relations.... The detailed information about their background, skills, and relevant experience was mentioned clearly along with the link to their profile as well. In conclusion, this project seems feasible as it has a detailed plan, clear budget breakdown and a strong and high-quality workforce.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "It mentioned 3 ways to audit this project. Each way, it explained thoroughly the criteria to measure.The fist way is to use KPIs in accordance with two main stages given in the plan which are building business guild and customizing guild report.  However, in the first way to measure the progress and the development of the project using KPIs, it should add more figures on the KIPs to make it more measurable. The success of this project was described in three criteria, but it would be better if more figures were added. Besides, it should mention whether this project is a continuation of a project that was funded before or not. All in all, it seems quite clear to measure the proceeding process of this project if figures are added into the KPIs.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1665", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5358, "q0": "This project clearly states the area of need and then proposes the solution in a clear, carefully thought out and remarkable way. This project would serve a great need for bridging idea and implementation. Research by experts for integration with Cardano based projects is fantastic. The Cardano community will definitely benefit from this Guild and it will facilitate the smoother initiation of and starting momentum of initiatives.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The building of the Research Guild is broken down into very specific tasks which makes it apparent that there has been thorough consideration of all the work that needs to be done, and this will create a solid foundation for future growth. There is built in quality control and payment is only made after report delivery which will prevent seepage of funds. The budget is based on researched information and seems feasible and appropriate.This Guild will flow with the Cardano funding cycles and will be able to evolve with the changing nature of the proposals. Members are highly specialised and have a broad range of skills and interests. There is evidence of thorough consideration of each step and potential challenges. The proposal creates great confidence in these people to make this happen.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPIs are detailed and adaptive. There is awareness of Sustainable-Development Goals of the UN and evidence of both the vision and the implementation. There is transparency and the Cardano community can access the progress made.

I believe that the success of every project will depend on the success of the kind of background research that has taken place and how it influences the goals of the project. In Cardano, one can boldly say that there is much acceptance and value of academic work that takes place; however, the mention of the Catalyst community lacks coordinated research that links Cardano-solutions to business needs. This is exactly the problem within the ecosystem. That is what this proposal has identified as their major problem. The issue now has to do with the manner in which they intend to solve the problem. It looks promising too to read on the solutions they offer. \n\nOu\n\n\nThe proposers here appear to be simple with their solution \u2013 they intend to  offer customised research reports for Catalyst campaigns. However, like software development, research isn\u2019t sexy \u2013 it takes grunt work. To achieve this work in a scalable way, they propose forming a Research Guild, or a collective of independent researchers investigating blockchain solutions on Cardano. Their aim is to be involved in building a professional research network within Project Catalyst, through invitation and paid research gigs. They also pens that the Research Guild will also provide paid support to other proposals and initiatives by forming problem-solving scrums around key issues. If the project is successful, their vision will be to build a global research network that draws researchers to Cardano, increases adoption as well as knowledge capital for DLT enterprise development. This is commendable and interesting as it will help mitigating alot of challenges involved in the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have been straight forward.
