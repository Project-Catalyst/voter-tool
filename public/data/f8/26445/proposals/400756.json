Thus, it is possible to see that the proposal is in accordance with the goals established by the challenge. And imagining a successful scenario for the project, we would have a positive impact on Cardano's ecosystem, as another possibility of using technology, in this case influencing to reduce environmental pollution.\n\nThe asking amount of $99,000 doesn't seem too out of the ordinary given the technological implementation the project will involve. However, the possible impact of this project is closely related to the existence of a simpler way to access these assets and trade them, and we realized that the proposal focused a lot on describing the most far-fetched steps without citing many practical examples of how the logic of negotiation. This seems to jeopardize the possible impact of the project, as the message it aims to convey is not very clear at the moment.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The steps that describe the feasibility of the project are conveying a very technical character, which can make it difficult for the end user and even other companies to understand the process. We know that the idea is to make climate assets available at an early stage to be traded, and that there will also be a whole logic for the legal validation of these assets and for the establishment of their value over time. But the lack of some graphic material to better convey the business logic made it difficult to understand the steps after the purchase of one of these assets.\n\nHowever, we realized that the team responsible for the project was appointed, and the curricula were made available. Observing the experiences of these professionals, we noticed that their skills are complementary for a good execution of the project, contemplating not only development skills, but also in the areas of growth and entrepreneurship. It is also interesting to note that there is a pilot plan, considering a specific location, which helps a lot in the feasibility of the project.\n\nRegarding the budget details, we have that the largest portion, $70,000, is being allocated to the production of technological components, which is quite plausible since this was the main focus of the feasibility plan. We noticed, however, that there was no defined plan more focused on the marketing of the initiative, which would be a very important point, given the objective of the proposal to attract more people to invest in this market.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Given all the aspects developed in the feasibility plan, we noted the need for well-defined quantitative parameters to monitor the evolution of the project. And we see that a very important parameter is stated here, the linking of 500,000 CO2 to the ecosystem.\n\nBut it seems interesting that other metrics were also enunciated as ways to measure the project's progress, for example, how many users got to know the platform in the last month? Did these users already have prior knowledge about the market or made any investments? What is the volume of transactions of these assets? What type of asset is most traded? We noticed that the absence of a greater number of parameters makes it more difficult to understand how the project works.\n\nBut it is worth noting that the concept of the Suan Blockchain project seems to have the potential to be disruptive in the market in which it intends to operate, with the possibility of popularizing investment in this type of asset and creating a considerable impact on environmental conservation. It seems interesting that some concepts could be explained in a more intuitive way at first.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 4, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1627, "q0": "I really like the idea of a project that can incorporate blockchain technology into the emission control process to protect the environment.
