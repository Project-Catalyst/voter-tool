How to build a project model that adds value to the Cardano ecosystem through payments in ADA and stable coins. The proposal also outlines possible challenges or risks that are legal as well as expansion to other markets. I have a small suggestion to increase the successful impact of the project is how to solve the problem of popularizing blockchain knowledge for newcomers to increase the number of users as well as in many national markets that has a negative view towards blockchain space.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The list of members necessary to successfully implement this project, the information about each person's work experience is published in detail and there is a link to the linkedin page for comparison.. I have a small suggestion for your team that is to add a person with legal expertise to improve the legality of the project. As for the budget, I recommend you to be more detailed about each expenditure for each job. For example, $20,000 for branding and marketing, specifically, communication on social networking sites costs xxx USD, organizing seminars costs xxx USD, publishing videos on youtube costs xxx USD.

And this proposal suggested building a rental marketplace using Cardano to satisfy that demand. Therefore, it could be said that this proposed solution is aligned with the given challenge which is finding a solution based on Cardano to solve businesses' needs. The description of the proposed solution was given in great detail. It is a rental marketplace for properties called, The Loqul marketplace. The way it operates and how all stakeholders in this marketplace interact with each other were explained thoroughly. It emphasized the benefits this solution will bring about for landlords and tenants who are Gen Z. This shows its impact on the target audience. Besides, it also analyzed its impact on the Cardano ecosystem as well. Because when users engage in this rental marketplace, they will experience new and helpful tools and mechanisms on the web 3. From that, it will attract more new people to the Cardano ecosystem. Another thing that is  worth mentioning is that the proposal also provided some criteria to measure the performance of this project. Some challenges and the plan to overcome them were given and explained quite clearly.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan for each quarter was given, but it is better to provide a detailed plan in each month or a shorter period of time so that people can better see how this project would be operated step by step.

About the team operating the project,  despite the fact that as mentioned at first, it is run by an experienced team in the field of  Real Estate, Finance, Consulting, and Computational Mathematics. It should add more information related to the background or related experience of each staff that would be beneficial to run this project well.

The proposal mentioned three factors to measure the progress of this project including outcomes, the number of tenants bidding per property, retention rate, and the number of properties listed. How to calculate these indicators were clearly mentioned, which is good to help sponsors visualize how to track, trace, and audit this project. However,  it could take advantage of some key performance indicators mentioned in the impact section as it has more performance indicators than what is mentioned in this part. Therefore, if more indicators were added, then it would be much better. About the description of the success of this project, because it lacks figures, so it was not provided so clearly. As a lot of key indicators to measure its performance were mentioned at first, it should make the best use of it to mention more numbers in accordance with those indicators so that everything would be synchronized and easy to follow.  Besides, it lacked mentioning this is a new project or a part of another one which was funded before because it said that one rental system was launched successfully in USA and it is expanding into other markets", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1665", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4310, "q0": "The problem mentioned here is that the current rental system is gradually becoming old-fashioned, expensive and causing housing costs to skyrocket due to speculation and lack of transparency. The solution given by the proposer is creating a safe rental marketplace with new monetization mechanisms, DeFi tools, secure crypto payments, & NFT receipts by using Cardano. From my point of view, proposal described the solution very clearly. In addition, they identify accurately target audiences (Landlords that have 1-4 Units that they manage on their own (B2B), and Gen-Z/Young Professionals/College Students). Not only that, what these objects can benefit from implementing this type of model is also specified. They strongly believe that \"By building a great set of smart contracts and applications we are helping both individuals and businesses enter the ecosystem, benefit from it, and grow in a trusted and frictionless manner\". They also provide performance indicators to help us track. Difficulties and challenges along with resolution plans are also described in great detail. My rating is 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\"To evaluate the feasibility of this proposal, I would like to make a few comments as follows:\n- In terms of time, the project implementation schedule is about one year, divided into four quarters (in 2022). With each stage, there are specific jobs and workplaces. In my opinion, it can be broken down by month or week for the community to better monitor the project.\n- In terms of operating budget, 172750 USD is the number for the budget they requested. But I do think the article would be good and clear if this part of the budget could be allocated smaller. For example, the distribution of salaries to employees, how much will each person with different tasks be paid and for how long?\n- Lastly, about team members, the proposal lacks information about the total number of the team and who will need to be added. However, the members mentioned all have clear titles as well as LikeIn links to their profiles. This helps the community to verify the ability and experience of these peopleHowever, what jobs will these people do and how will they be assigned tasks?

However, I believe that the proposers should mention a roadmap of their progress again, which will allow the community to keep track of its development.

There are also good key performance indicators that have concrete values that can provide insight into the success of the project. From the information in the proposal, it does seem that the proposers will be transparent about the progress of the project, so I believe that they will provide frequent updates to the community.
