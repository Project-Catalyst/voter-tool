The proposer brings a  full cycle focus, which is important to form a well rounded approach to the full market, creation, distribution and consumption.

", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The organization seems to be an established company with technical execution abilities for the hardware involved. There is very little detail on the plan or the specific project focus they are starting with from their 3 main stages of the electricity cycle. In regards to budget, details are lacking here; I would like to see how their budget is deployed across the needs of a specific project, thus requiring a deeper project scope. I would encourage the proposer to focus to a first step of this vision with a clear project scope, it is a worthy cause!

The business shows experience of work done and looks like a well established business in LatinAmerica and is aware of the team missing to complete the project.\n\nI think the timeline could use a little bit more explaining: \"Six month gol, By the end of september 2022 have a @energiasocial #GEN_USR beta platform online\" What will be done in the middle, do you have a plan for that yet? The proposal would benefit of more explaining on that 6 month period. If the plan isn\u00b4t clear you could add tasks like: Team Assemble (you did this well), Research and organization, prototype, development starts and BETA Release. This will give the voter and yourself a little bit more clarity on the timelines to complete and organize all the information.\nAlso a clearer breakdown on the budget would be appreciated, its okey to estimate on costs but an approximate should be given in salaries, hourly rates and if possible hours of work and weeks/months needed, do you have promotion costs in the budget? Do you need a 2nd Proposal for completion? After 6 months what will happen with the beta? Will it already be self sufficient?

The current team seems to understand a lot about business and sustainability and that increases the chances of success of the project. The proposers pointed a milestone of creating the beta platform online in 6 months but we don't know how much time the team would get to be completed (with all the necessary members to work in the tasks), how would the current members deal with the possibility of not finding the right people? I think that's a risk that should be studied as well as it can be reasonable to create a plan to manage and mitigate this kind of risk. Another question is: why the members have divided the budget in 6 equal parts? What if they divide it by tasks? That's only a idea that I think would helps us to understand better how the requested funds can be used.

I think the proposers could think about what could be measured in the project through numbers or percentual and from there create some KPI's to help both team and the community to be able to check the project progress. Some example of indicator can be the number of days a project phase is late, the number of people joining the idea in a month, etc. With some coherent KPI's it's possible to measure the project progress and success. To conclude, there is only one milestone to achieve (the beta platform online creation). I want to ask the proposers if there aren't other milestones to reach in these 6 months.

There is clarity in the description of the problem and the solution presented and proposed is appropriate to the challenge. The proposal would address the challenge by creating a decentralized, transparent, autonomous renewable energy social company controlled by institutional members to reinvest profits in research and development of urban sustainable development strategy. In my opinion, this proposal is a great idea.

The required budget for the project is $25,000, which is also explained in a very general way. As shown, the budget will be divided into 6 equal parts of 4,166.66 U$D, which will be invested in manpower/hour to develop the #GEN_USR platform + #GEN_USR Communication Strategy. It would be better if the budget describes each cost associated with a specific purpose, for example, how many people are involved in the implementation of the project, the role of each member, the salary paid for each position. how much. What channels will your communication strategy be through? The more detailed the explanation, the easier it is for the community to track the progress of the project. The project group is also not described, the proposal provided a Linkedin link to the @energiasocial group I went to that link and was told this group has 11 members, but unfortunately for some reason I am not on I have the page of each member so I don't know who they are, have the right experience and qualifications to take on this project.
