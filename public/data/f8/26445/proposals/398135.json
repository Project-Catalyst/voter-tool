One of the good points that can be pointed out is that they explain some technical terms, which helps the community better comprehend their solution. They also give a brief introduction of who they are (Comodi), identify their target audience (small farmers), and analyze the problems they are encountering. Based on these findings, they offer a detailed solution including main features (commercial B2B/B2C and private C2B/C2C) and the core functionalities followed up. This section is well written in a logical order, ensuring the clarity and soundness of the solution.\nThe main challenges are well foreseen in each type of user. They properly offer further strategies with expected efficiency for mitigating these issues, proving their proactivity in risk management. The community may take this into consideration when assessing this proposal.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "They successfully mention two main focuses of their project at the present time as well as their positive impacts on the Cardano ecosystem. A detailed roadmap goes with a reasonable financial plan is provided. As they presented, their activities for the first 270 days of the implementation process will be broken down into 2 principal phases including development and operation. The specific tasks in each phase are also plausibly split with a compatible budget. This will help the community smoothly track the rate of progress and determine the rationale of their spending. \nThe team members are properly described with their backgrounds, main roles, and relevant working experience needed for the smooth implementation and development of the project. They also give a short description of their currently used technology to help viewers better visualize their team capacity in this project. Past sample works of the team are additionally provided for references\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The primary KPIs with specific acquired numbers are proposed for better assessments of their project\u2019s success. These indicators are well aligned with the key metrics of the challenge setting, proving that they know really well what they are doing and are very serious about it. Their definition of the project\u2019s success is also very clear, proven by particular successful metrics with realistic numbers to ensure the project\u2019s attainability. All this information will be useful for the community in the tracking and evaluation process, generating more accurate assessments.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1651", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3613, "q0": "The proposal aims at creating a decentralized marketplace for businesses and consumers to purchase, sell and trade physical agriculture commodities on the blockchain using a low fee model to make it affordable to small farmers. The proposer emphasized the problem that small farmers are facing is that they couldn\u2019t compete fairly with Big Ag and their powerful lobbyists in advertising for their products. Also the corporation between farmland and retail grocery pushed them out of the market and faced bankruptcy, and foreclosure.Therefore, they are in an urgent need of having a platform with a low cost of sales unlike the existing one such as eBay, Amazon,,...with a high cost up to 15% cost of sale. This project is an ideal solution for them by providing an alternative platform with a low fee - less than 1% per transaction and a lot of benefits that the blockchain technology has to offer. Therefore, it could be seen that this proposal succeeded in realizing smaller farmers\u2019 needs and providing them a feasible solution based on Cardano, which is aligned with part of the challenge required. However, it is better if they determine the needs of businesses as well, what businesses are looking for, and why this solution would be beneficial for them. The proposal included details about the description of the suggested solution, functions of the proposed products, but didn't present how this solution has an impact on the development of the Cardano ecosystem. It mentioned two main challenges which are related to commercial users and private ones in the process of operating this project with an explanation on how to overcome them over time.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal lacked a detailed plan with a clear and step-by-step timeline of what to do to operate this project successfully. It just mentioned that this project would focus on two-user profiles and how it impacts the Cardano ecosystem. However, in the section listing a budget breakdown, it mentioned the budget distributed in each phase of the project, which is highly evaluated. It would be better if they would create a detailed plan based on every period listed on the budget allocation plan so that everything could be synchronized and easy to understand.The proposal did a great job in listing all important people to ensure the success of this project. An outstanding person taking part in this project is founder Lief Olson who used to work in the organic farming field. He has contacts and experience in running businesses in this field. He would be fully aware of the purpose of this project and lead the team in the right direction to achieve the final result. Besides, the developer team has high expertise and experience in blockchain development. One highlight here is that the proposal presented a recently coded smart contract that was highly evaluated by a community of developers and crypto professionals. It also had some talks with some farming organizations in the USA, Colombia, South America with positive beliefs about its potential. These are good signals to trust in the feasibility of this project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer set up KPIs with specific figures for two stages of the project, which is complying with the plan. Besides, it defined how the success looked like by listing detailed successful metrics including the time to get a targeted number.

The proposer should have included a short description, containing skills and previous work for each team member, adding also a (professional) social profile link for verification.

Currently, the biggest barrier is the legal issue, so many countries have not yet accepted cryptocurrencies. However, our children and grandchildren will be more open, so this is the best time to grow. Web3 and cryptocurrency payments are obviously more secure, the cost is much cheaper, and the audience is global without any continental restrictions. So this is a project I highly recommend, and hope it has enough funding to go through.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "They are at the stage of market research, technology, business model modeling standards. So this is a stage that requires a lot of practicality, understanding reality and then doing it methodically, for sure.
