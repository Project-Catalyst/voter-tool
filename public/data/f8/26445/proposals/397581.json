You are right we are not beekeepers, but we know what this means because before even drafting this proposal we have been interacting with beekeepers in an attempt to nurture bees on our own veranda in the city (this sounds hilarious but yes it is true).  This is how the idea came up.  We actually saw the problems (some of which you have mentioned) they encounter, and we have realized the difficulty of trying to nurture bees. Beekeepers don't have the time to think or write..., they run around from mountain to mountain, field to field to take care of their bees.  It is a very hard working job and consumes a lot of time.  Collaborating with others was a thought, but since each country is facing different difficulties in beekeeping, we have decided to go for it solo along with the expertise of the Cypriot beekeepers. Regarding auditability, tools have been mentioned especially in the marketing and campaign process that actually measure and give statistics that the catalyst community can have and check. The proposal clearly states the number of NFTs to be sold.  A unique piece of art to be sold out in the streets costs at least 30euro, and by this, surely a piece of art in NFT form created for a good cause will definitely worth more.

All these points are indeed enormously important for our survival, but at first they do not fit directly into the overall challenge. However, the project ultimately bridges the gap, as the products of each beekeeper have to be marketed and we are still in the area of small business. Here it would be important if the products could also be assigned to the beekeeper and the respective bee colony. This would create trust among customers through traceability. The introduction of the beekeeper community to the blockchain with all its possibilities can definitely mean a significant added value for the Cadarno community. If successful, this model could be applied to other areas of agriculture. However, as this is a regionally limited project, it is a field trial for the time being.  If this project were to succeed and be adopted by beekeepers worldwide, the impact on the Cadarno ecosystem would be enormous. Risks are explained honestly and objectively and are tradable. Due to the actually high mortality of the colonies, the idea of a sponsorship through the purchase of assigned NFTs is a very good approach, which enables the beekeeper to acquire new swarms or productive queens.

The basic idea behind the proposal is undoubtedly intriguing, and it is evident that it might do wonders, particularly in the field of beekeepers' work. I am confident that this proposal adequately addresses the challenge at hand. I find that there are lucid objectives presented for how the team intends to proceed. One area in which I must compliment the team is the section about risk management, which not only identifies possible obstacles to success, but also suggests countermeasures that can be taken to mitigate the identified risk.. All in all, the proposed solution is well-described, further details on how to get to the initial goal are provided, which is credibly helpful for readers to have greater trust in it.

However, I must admit that from my perspective a greater effort could have been made. As an example, regarding the \"Project management & Coordination\" cost, the community will need to know the number of people assigned to the task, the description of their roles, and the hourly rate assigned to each. This makes it difficult to carry out the possible assessment as it seems kind of vague to me. An area to be improved by adding the specific cost of items in it is webpage development, development, graphics, domain, hosting, add ons, NFTs etc should have a price tag to check its fairness. The cost of campaign issues such as supplies, travel costs, and meetings for website development are also unclear. References to core team member LinkedIn profiles are provided, it is evident that the team members are committed and experienced in multiple knowledge areas, which is necessary and will help the project to advance.

It is difficult to give exact travelling costs when you have to go to different parts of the country in the middle of nowhere to check if there are hives and how many for instance.

You are absolutely right about the NFT mechanism, but in an attempt to stress the importance of the bees we may have neglected to add this technical part.

We have been trying since then to find ways to help them.  We have chosen just Cyprus first to see how things will go.  Asking too much money and eventually not delivering is not something we want to encounter, therefore it is more secure to take it slow and steady. As you have already seen, I have a record on proposal writing and project management.  From my experience, there are hidden costs that we cannot identify while we write the proposal (these are EU proposal terms).  These may come up along when we implement the project.  That's why the words \"miscellaneous\" or \"hidden costs\" are used.  Even now, I cannot identify these. Another reason for having these, is when one of the calculated costs for some reason changes.  And instead of having an incomplete task because money ran out, we add from the miscellaneous to cover it. And just to let you know of the long term plans.... while drafting the proposal we had the idea of adding a bee product eshop with transactions on cardano, cardano users buying the products etc, thus building a more sustainable network for income provided to the beekeepers and any other future beekeeper.
