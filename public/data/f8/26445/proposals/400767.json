There is no more information about the long-term development, but in the scope of this proposal the team will make a virtual fair for brands to show across multiple platforms, and the income from fair portion purchasing from brands will be used for mass marketing the fair. So, my advice is that the team should provide some detailed benefits to the brand when using their solution but not just only the traffic from mass marketing. Moreover, some detail about the fair, the portion like the design, space, place, number of project... that they will show the brands should be provided here. \nThe idea can be aligned with the challenge because they can attract a number of projects to buy a portion in that fair and join the hub long term, moreover they can go further with the connection between the project and scale it up if they want - that's my idea for the scaling solution. \nLastly, I think this is a big and complex project but the proposer just mentioned the challenge of full-time human resources that they're lacking.

Moreover, I think the budget they required is a bit insufficient for this kind of project from my experience. They require the budget for 3 months of development but we can't define which quarter in their roadmap will use it, I think it's the first quarter.

Not only does this project foster B2B but also B2C interactions but I would go so far as to say that what is being proposed is infrastructural to Cardano. Whilst I mentioned it may even fit the ScaleUp Hubs challenge, the fact its a supporting structure for the number of niche communities already in existence is the kind of inter-Cardano endeavours we need to promote and support as these can lead to greater adoption, lowers barriers of entries and create synergies which strengthens the ecosystem. As a former assessor of tenders for a university, you need to be able to look beyond the platform they are intending to build and also appreciate the downstream benefits it will bring to the community. I whole-heartedly agree this fits the challenge perfectly. However, whilst I provided 5-stars, I would suggest to the proposer to ensure ease-of-use of any resources added on to a  proposal. The carnivilla.com site was a little difficult to navigate and this can cast an unfavourable view to a voter. Please ensure such resources are working as optimally as possible as to leave no doubt to the expertise behind a project. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Unfortunately, what has been presented on the proposal weakens the project in this category which has led me to disagree that this proposal can be implemented successfully. Firstly, whilst two team members have been presented , only first names were given with no links to a site where their bona fides can be further examined. In terms of the experiences described, while having some relevance to their objectives, are more operational in nature rather than technical, which Carnivilla will require. Jesse has experiences in events though not at a high production level and Chris has graphic design and cinematography experiene, which while valuable to support such a project, is not at the level required for their vision. He has also mentioned exp in the game design but as a hobbyist. It would have been a good supporting argument for their case if examples of released previous work were added to the proposal. You can often overlook a proposer's lack of qualifications if there are mentions of the intention to secure the expertise lacking, however, this is not present in the proposal. As a result, this casts doubt on the budget presented particularly for the Primary Developer. TRhe three quarters of 2022 were presented as milstones with high level targets. It would've been beneficial if the development phase was presented in parallel to these timelines. As it is, the additional screenshots of Carnivilla's future state creates an expectation from the reader and these images and the plan presented lead to doubtfulness of their proposal's ability to be implemented. Creating such a hub is not simple and Cardano voters are now becoming more sophisticated and more aware of what it takes to build anything. The proposers should keep this in mind when representing this proposal as often, when the vision and the plan do not look in sync, this creates disbelief. I highly recommend the proposer carefully describes how and with what resources are they intending to build Carnivilla, provide plans on how to secure expertise not currently available, and also present yourselves professionally, in full and with links to your career profiles and previous experience so as to gain confidence in your abilities. Goo luck.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The KPIs presented while invaluable in measuring the success of Carnivilla post release, it does not provide the kinds of measurable points for the Community to assess how the project is progressing from an audit standpoint. I recommend that a resubmission of this proposal includes measures which can run in parallel to the build milestones presented under Feasibility, as this will allow Catalyst and the community to check on how you are progressing. This is where the inclusion of social channels in the proposal adds value; twitter, facebook, reddit, TG or Discord channels could be added and would be the likely points from where the proposer can announce the release of the HUB, for example. In addition, there is a significant tech development associated with this proposal and this is where a github/gitbook account could also provide an audit point from where progress can be tracked.
