Moreover, it will also connect them to the information that supports their business and mining activities. This idea is great and can make some impact on the mining industry.

Then better is the detailed explanation about what they will do in these tasks and its delivery, outputs. For this kind of project, developing a platform that connects multiple players in an industry is not an easy task. There is a bunch of work from researching the value chain, segmentation to target, the micro things like insights, challenges that the user has to face to make a great product. \nMoreover, the game of convincing and balancing users on a platform is one of the toughest work to do. At least, if the team has no one that experiences in this industry, the team should have a research plan for it. \nWithout a detailed implementation plan, I believe that their budget is also unreasonable.
