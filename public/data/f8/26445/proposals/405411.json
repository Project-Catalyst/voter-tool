The targets in particular are media/entertainer groups, and things like professional sports leagues, but it could just as easily be imagined for paying artists (co-op DAO, anyone?) and especially musicians.  The media groups that the proposer says they have commitments from should be good group to prototype since they will have to navigate both contract law and any collective bargaining laws around the industry, while still getting plenty of variety in roles and protocols for payouts, to prove out the agility required of the smartcontracts.  The speed and accuracy benefits to the participants will be fantastic for sure, but where I have more concern is at the oracle level, which really wasn't discussed here.  The media requirements may be different, but I know for the sports contracts, a lot of the things that need to be tracked and implemented for performance based incentives are not always public, and sometimes, such in the case of injury waivers or other medical riders, the information can be critically private.  This might indicate scaling and privacy issues across the whole proposal foundation, as some aspect of SSI may need to be adopted to properly manage the incoming data used to feed the smartcontracts.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team will need to bring on board plutus or Haskell specialists for the smartcontract design, but the reset of the team looks well qualified for the higher level design of protocols to be followed, and onboarding process design.  With outreach already underway to prepare some businesses to be onboarded, they are demonstrating needed marketing and B2B skills that will eventually be essential once they have PoC.  I do think they will have challenges coming from the legal side in the form of dealing with collective bargaining practices in certain jurisdictions, especially if they really do target something like the NBA in north america, but the media collectives that they seem to be working with seem like good soil to till.  The other area where there is some concern for me is that there isn't a lot of description here about how they onboard the payees to the results of the smart contract...if it is to inform the contract holders, than it really doesn't add anything, it actually needs to be able to process the transaction itself, so does that mean onboarding a bunch of ADA wallets or does that mean doing some kind of exchange based background platform, or the use even of a stablecoin?  The small questions lead to more questions.  At first glance the budget looks reasonably tilted to the smartcontract and IT stack side, but adding up all the areas like consultation and project management, and considering the need for more legal help, likely, the project does start to look more like a research project with a PoC deliverable, which I think is well within scope here.  But as a full solution delivery for the existing commitments, with PoCs for other areas they could migrate the business model, it might be biting off a bit much.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This is right around a 6-month timeline, and the auditability is a bit difficult to parse.  The development really needs to be broken up into may be some weekly sprints, both to give an idea of where the beats are for reporting during that period of time, but also to help clarify some of the things in the timeline regarding exactly what is under development at any given time (development is used pretty generally in this proposal, but seems to be composed of SC design and implementation, UI/UX and some server/IT setup).  Delivery of things like post product support fall more under scalability and the latter PoCs, I don't know if I would consider them to be good measurables of success for the project.  Obviously, onboarding and executing the first transactions handled by the smart contracts is a key milestone that would mark the mvp release and could close out the project.  Additionally it would be good to see some measurables for the development, preferably sprints and %complete.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 6, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Thanks very much for your assessment and you highlight an excellent point regarding oracles in particular, which we should have provided further information and clarity on. Before I explain, we do acknowledge that an oracle should have at least three independent data sources.\n\nSports POC Oracle - for this specific project, we will be consulting with the team around which data sources have been agreed upon with the players. There are certain pieces of information the team tracks which may not be publicly available, and as it's a single data source it does go against the 'three sources' acknowledgement. In short, the data sources we use for the oracle will be determined and ratified with players and team. In the event our POC moves up to the league level, then consultation with the league as a whole around what is considered a valid data source would be conducted.\n\nMusic POC Oracle - in the South African market, there are two main companies that provide needletime information (i.e. which songs were played and when). Only one of those is recognised and used by the primary industry body, so while it goes against the 'three sources' preference, it is the only data provider that we can safely use.\n\nRegarding collective bargaining - it is important to recognise that we are only facilitating the process of player payments i.e. we are only executing the terms of contracts that have already been agreed to by the team and the player. We are not responsible for the terms expressed in those contracts.\n\nRegarding payments - thank you for highlighting this. Primarily, players will still want to be paid in fiat currency - to this end, we will be establishing escrow fiat accounts with the organisations we provide this service for (a sports team wouldn't want an external party to have access to their accounts to make payments). An escrow account allows for an initial payment method while CBDC options are explored, and player wallets are added as an additional option, and also acts as a security layer for the team, players and the league: if the escrow account does not have sufficient liquidty to cover player payments, relevant parties can\n\nTo summarise: the purpose of the smart contract POC for any performance-based earner is to remove the manual calculations and potential errors, speeding up earner payments, as well as providing security for earners to know their terms have not been altered. \n\nThank you again for your feedback."}, {"q0": "The proposal addresses the royalties payment in sports/music/arts and similar.

Regarding the team operating this project, it described the role of some staff along with the Linkein link to their profiles. It mentioned that the Business Development Director already achieved the first two actual customer commitments. This is a good signal that he will contribute more to the project. Besides, this project also involves the participation of an experienced chief development in platform development. If more relevant experience of other staff were mentioned, it would be more persuasive to prove the high feasibility of this project.

Likewise, the proposal they made focuses on multiple KPIs targeted in the B2B:B2C challenge and all have been checked.

The first concern on solvency is a major one because that appears to be the entire value proposition of the project. While I don't doubt that there are likely actors that are mismanaging contracts, I also have to acknowledge that those actors have all the leverage in the relationship. The employers have to be willing to move their operation onto the blockchain, which requires an argument on what incentive they would have. This proposal also would not really solve merchandise royalties UNLESS the entire economic infrastructure were to adopt Cardano so that purchases could go directly to players at the point of the transaction. Otherwise, merchandise sales would have to be recorded, processed, and distributed off-chain. This, I assume, is a big part of why royalty delivery takes too long, and this proposal doesn't seem to solve that issue. I understand how royalties for the music industry could be facilitated with ease because the whole business can be run on-chain. I think this proposal needs clarity on the rationale for how this process would logistically work. It also needs specific names of teams, players, and partners that are interested in utilizing this product. This will also help add legitimacy to the product, which is an area that also needs to be addressed in this proposal. The only link that the proposal provides is not a currently active domain. I think the idea behind this proposal has the potential to be innovative and very impactful but it's missing a lot of important information everywhere from logistics to background information.

I'm actually impressed with the level of specificity for dates when these things are going to happen. However, there's a lot of references to sports teams, entertainers, shows and documentaries but not specific names that have been identified so that CAs can look into them. I understand there may be some kind of NDA agreement involved but there has to be some third-party legitimacy provided (especially for this amount requested) if an investment proposal is going to get approved. The budget isn't a huge issue, but it could use some improvement also. There could be more specifics in breaking down sub-categories for how the money is being spent. For example, it's a good idea to hire more smart contract developers but it can add greater clarity to disclose how many are being hired and what their salary and contract timeframe looks like. I appreciate the core team members look good and I appreciate that there are LinkedIn profiles given. Overall, the proposal doesn't look that bad. I think they have the right experience/talent to get this accomplished, they've got plans for what they're going to do for the next 12+ months, and they have a breakdown of categories for how the money will be budgeted. Maybe my review is a bit overly critical but I am a stickler for details, especially when the asking amount is so much higher than most proposals.

Plus, a completed product can stil go completely unused and it would not have the desired impact. So, goals about the product can be left up to the feasibility section.
