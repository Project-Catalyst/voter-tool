The community can clearly see that their solutions are closely aligned with the key metrics and largely solve the challenges approaching. They give a clear presentation of the project including explicit goals and its main features. They also visualize the long-term vision for their project, propose specific results such as improving the entire onboarding process, data management,...This obviously shows their intensive research and carefulness in proposing solutions, which can be taken into the proposal evaluation. \n\nThe proposal sensibly answers the question brought up in the challenge setting with practical examples. All the key metrics of challenge measurement are considered to be in the guidelines provided to the community. Some main issues they may encounter are well mentioned together with some initiatives to mitigate.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A detailed roadmap is provided with 2 main phases in a total of 16 weeks. With each phase, they mention the central task and then split it into small ones to guarantee attainability.

They effectively present what and how much they gonna spend on each feature. And these costs are proven in tune with their action plan and schedule. \nThe team members' information and their highly relevant experiences in the Cardano community and blockchain area are described. They have worked together for the past 6 months and are promised to give a strong commitment, which benefits them in running the project smoothly.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As they mentioned, all information will be open source, so the community will easily access to have the best picture of the project development.

Businesses today want to create impact-driven businesses or the transformation of business. It is commonly known that from big corporations to small-sized firms, they also strive to create a business that has a positive impact on society and the environment to achieve sustainable development. And the proposer also cited the case of Nestle as an example to illustrate this is a real business need. Therefore, the proposal suggested a solution that is totally appropriate to the needs of businesses and aligned with the problem of the challenge as well. The proposal also mentioned that in order to meet the demand of businesses in creating an impact-driven business and expanding their business scope and areas, Transparency and traceability are two things to focus on. And tools on the Cardano such as DID, smart contract, open ledgers, ...will be useful ones to solve this issue. In fact, this project will help make the best use of tools on Cardano to boost the ability of tracking and the level of transparency, and connect businesses in the Cardano ecosystem as well. This will attract businesses to join Cardano and this project also includes products to support them in the onboarding process. The proposal named some challenges related to how to build trust in businesses to join the Cardano community. It did suggest detailed solutions to overcome these challenges by providing the most sustainable contact and company within the Cardano ecosystem, guidelines in great detail, and a clear budget for external auditing of the project. In sum, this proposal did a great job in emphasizing the businesses' needs and suggesting a solution that is closely based on their demands. Also, it explained how useful it is to join Cardano to better achieve what businesses expect.

A good point here is that it included the KPIs to describe what is expected to achieve when following this plan. A Budget breakdown was well-written including incentive budget and process lead budget. In each section of the budget distributed, it explained in great detail how the budget is used.The team working on this project has been cooperating with each other for the past 6 months, so it would be easier for them to communicate and collaborate to achieve the best outcome without wasting time adapting to the working style of each individual. Besides, the leader may know each member's weaknesses and strengths as they have been working together for a long time so that the job may be assigned more effectively to take advantage of the strong points of each team member.The team includes Nori with 30 years of experience in software development would be a highlight to prove the feasibility of this project. Besides, some staff have accumulated much experience in the Cardano community. All in all, the project is still feasible thanks to having a quite detailed plan, a proper cost breakdown in great detail and team members who have been working together.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The progress of this project would be measured in months through monthly reports. The project also stated that they would use an external audit team to evaluate the progress using the DYOR form, which is transparent enough to track and trace clearly.

According to the team, there are very few businesses\u2019 sustainable practices that are related to blockchain and unlocking Cardano\u2019s potential so a new model that generates business collaborations for people who seek to be blockchain for impact pioneers is a must. This project wants to create an open source model to collaborate with the community and generate a range of opportunities for collaboration with impact businesses, then onboard them to Cardano. This will be a great contribution with an even greater impact if it happens since it brings more businesses into our community and helps them take full advantage of the opportunities Cardano unleashes. The proposal identifies a problem fitting for the challenge setting. There is a clear idea of how this will improve the ecosystem. They even provide some examples and research based on Nestle\u2019 2020 annual financial report to prove their point. Overall, I do agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team members seem very committed and potential since they have necessary experience to cover a variety of skills needed for this project and more.

The budget is very clear and detaily broken down to be understandable and provide enough information on the required sum of money. There is a realistic roadmap set for all stages of the proposal. The plan is sensible and the \u201chow are we building this\u201d is described as much as the \u201cwhat are we building and why?\u201d, which is quite great. all the necessary resources to implement the proposal are listed. Overall, this is a good feasible proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The key metrics and KPIs mentioned are relevant for the success of the proposal.

The goal is to create a new model that provides many opportunities as well as support for the onboarding process in collaboration with the community, which I believe is completely appropriate for the task. It is also evident how the proposal impacts the challenge in a credible way. The team discusses in depth the long-term vision for the next 6-12 months, including a strategy for achieving the set objectives.Another good point is the proposing team adding plans of scaling up the project, also they anticipate some potential obstacles and provide reasonable solutions to tackle, which highly grows confidence in everyone who is interested.

The proposal timeline and milestones are clearly outlined, a detailed explanation on what events will be carried out in each phase so that we are able to keep track of the progress and know exactly where it is heading. A full mention of KPIs and deliverables are displayed. The funds requested to establish the project are very reasonable and the author of the proposal already demonstrated the budget allocation. Somehow it seems vague to me, which jeopardizes the feasibility assessment of the requested budget, as it would have been preferable if they had additionally included more information specifying the quantity of work for each phase/time required along with corresponding remuneration. Overall, I am confident that the project can be implemented successfully based on the information provided in this proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal has a high likelihood to be audited based on the information given by the proposer.

I liked the overall concept, the project proposal, and the overall stated tasks and milestones, which seemed like a reasonable notion to me, not only for the desired investment value but also for the entire project proposal. Also, the project's concept and design appear to be well-thought-out, and I will be accessible as an expert in this field to assist the concept and project implementation. There are various possible use cases associated with this concept that may be worth considering in a longer-term vision.
