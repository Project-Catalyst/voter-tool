This CNFT will be created by the creator (artist, photographer, graphic designer, etc) and users will purchase it through the project platform. These CNFTs on the Cardano blockchain are proof of the creator's works, irreplaceable and immutable. An idea that is not really new on the Cardano ecosystem when there are now many platforms that are also integrating this solution.\n\nIn the part of risks and challenges that will be encountered, one of the biggest challenges of the project is what is the competitive advantage compared to other NFT platforms. The proposal does not clarify the advantages, the fact that you integrate more into educational tools such as instructional videos on how to create an ADA wallet, how to buy ADA or transfer to another wallet, it is all general. This knowledge. is basic that anyone can find on other websites. So how do you show your users what other attractions are only available on your platform?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Incorporating entrepreneurs, creators, artists to create NFT requires a work of identity verification and author transparency.

For example, \"Marketing manager: \u00a335,000 per year\" but what exactly are the jobs inside marketing that cost \u00a335,000?

The aim of the project is to attract creators and businesses to join Cardano to create and sell CNFTs (Cardano NFTs). The proposer explained that artists are still selling out their artworks in the old way, which is not efficient and appropriate to the new context of society under strong waves of technological explosion. And it is hard to protect the ownership of the author if they still sell their unique artworks this way. So, they need to modernize this process by applying this suggested solution to better protect their artworks' ownership and to sell them more effectively on Cardano. From that, it could be seen that the proposer realized a need for businesses in the art industry and they are proposing a solution incorporated with the Cardano blockchain to meet that need. The proposal did describe its products as a gateway for creators and businesses to engage in Cardano and mint their own CNFTs, but it would be better if it includes more details about its features and functions in terms of technical aspects. It also showed that apart from creating a solution to meet the demand of businesses, it also contributes to educating people about Cardano. The proposal mentioned that community involvement would be a challenge but it believed that its model would bring more users into the Cardano ecosystem.

Apart from the budget for the marketing manager being mentioned to be used for a year, the rest of the budget breakdown didn't how long that capital would be spent. The measurable unit of each section of the budget should be listed to make it clearer. The information of the team operating this project was not stated in great detail. No expertise or experience or any related background was listed. So if they added more related information of all staff that show how suitable and important they are to the success of the project, the feasibility of it would be enhanced considerably.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Not much information about indicators to measure the progress of this project was mentioned. It just showed the aim to have one new user on DROP every 10 days in Q422. This is just enough to audit the end of the process Because the plan would be carried out from March 2022. However, there is no indicator to audit this period of time. Therefore, more measurable criteria should be mentioned to track the proceeding process from the beginning to the end.

One thing I quite like is that they are very specific about what they will educate such as how to buy ADA, how to create a wallet, transfer ADA to a wallet, scan a QR code or copy the base address needed to send ADA,... this helps learners to visualize what they will be learning and what they will get from the course.
