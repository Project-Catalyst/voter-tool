Although there is a defined number of team members, there is opportunity to expand and scale as needed. A thorough explanation of the team behind this project may be found at the website address provided in the proposal description. From a professional standpoint, I am confidence in the team. The initiative gains credibility as a result of this. The budget is clearly laid out and broken down into actionable things to be carried out. There is a realistic and comprehensive timeline for bringing the project to a successful conclusion, however I don't believe it will ever be completed and will instead continue to develop. The allocation of cash is clearly stated in the plan, however not in terms of hourly rates; instead, monthly rates are offered, which are justified (6 months).

High marks on all points.  This solution would provide tremendous value to the Cardano ecosystem and is absolutely aligned with the philosophy and values.

Especially if the proposers lack experience in key areas (in particular such as business & start-up issues). However asking for or offering mentoring services, when you do not know the mentor or mentee is a barrier. To even asking. But there aren't may ways to know that the fit is correct. This AI approach, which seems to already have undergone some alfa or beta experience has the potential for high impact. I can imagine that a proposer who signs up as wanting mentoring help, would be more inclined to follow through if the system suggested a  match or several matches. Sort of the matches dating sites offer. Not necessarily perfect, but puts both parties in the right ballpark. The proposal objectives that go far beyond project catalyst are what make this proposal much more interesting. The only reason why I rate this proposal 4 star and not 5 star is the uncertainty about people's willingness to use mentors at all. Or for that matter to use the tool/system. Not a fault of the proposal, just uncertainty. But I do sincerely believe the Cardano Treasury should fund the proposal. Please refer to my ratings in the other two dimensions.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The first point in the proposal's favor in their request for Cardano Community funding is that it is a company! A company that comes to Project Catalyst having already built AI mentor matching software. One that has demonstrated users and pilot projects undertaken with organisations. This is precisely the kind of 5-Star proposal we need.\n\nThey come with Mentor matching logic: a successful matching algorithm for a target demographic. And have a platform with over 650 users signed up as mentors, mentees or both. Having made more than 200 mentor matches to date with a high success rate is another indicator of 5-star feasibility. \nFinally the team is super. Combining significant years of experience with having already worked together is unusual in Project Catalyst. Whist proposers may have one, they rarely have both features, \nFinally the two leaders of this proposal are among the most active in our Project Catalyst community. Having watched and at other times participated in their zoon sessions, I measure them as visible, helpful, insightful. And show themselves to be empathetic, sympathetic and open to all points of view.\n\nThe budget and use of funds are clearly defined. And seems both practical (enough) and reasonable (not too much). \nTotal: $30,000\nMarketing & Comms resource (creating leads) - 3 months x $1,000 = $3,000\nSales & Partnerships (converting leads) - 3 months x $2,000 = $6,000\nProduct development & technical support - 4 months x $3000 = $12,000\nMatch validation & customer support - 3 months x $2,000 = $6,000\nProject management and administration = $3,000\n\nNote that funding to reach objectives for months 3/4 until 6 are not included. They have mentioned that they expect to have recruited 2 paying organizations by month 3 to cover ongoing expenses.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The goals are clear, modest and achievable. Especially from their starting position. Their plan is simple.\n\nStep 1: Outreach to potential partners to secure early partnerships. We will use our existing networks and sales collateral to support this outreach. \nStep 2: Onboard organisation leads to support the role out of the programme within the organisation/network\nStep 3: Onboard mentors and mentees using OUOD dashboard\nStep 4: Propose matches\nStep 5: Matching begins\nStep 6: Monthly check-ins to assess match quality and progress \nStep 7: Match finishes\nStep 8: Report learnings\n\nThe timeframe seems doable. \nOne month: Outreach to organisations\n\nPrepare marketing materials\nLeverage existing network to facilitate introductions\nShort list 10 organisations that are warm leads\n\n\n\n\nThree month: Confirm two aligned organisations as partners and onboard key stakeholders within organisation\n\nConfirm partnership with Services Agreement\nOnboard stakeholders \n\n\nSix month: Onboard organisations and complete first round of matching\nRecruit and onboard mentors and mentees\nMake matches using matching algorithm plus validator\nCheck-in and collect feedback from users\n\nThe pathway to reaching those goals is clear.
