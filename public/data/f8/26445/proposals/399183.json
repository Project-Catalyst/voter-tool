I haven't seen anything like this one. That's why I enjoyed reading through it. There isn't a huge focus on utilizing Ada as a form of payment. I think that this team is right in the sense that global adoption will require these tools listed such as a platform to pay using Ada. For these reasons, I think that this proposal will allow these tools to be developed and have more users to pay with ada. I give this section of the proposal a 4 out of 5 stars. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Including LinkedIn profiles are one of the best ways to introduce the members of the team working on a proposal. I was able to look through the different LinkedIn profiles and given the experience and expertise from these individuals, I think that they will be able to implement their proposal successfully if funded. The plan is directly linked to their area of expertise and the proposal reflects what the team may be capable of achieving. For these reasons, I give this section of the proposal a 5 out of 5 stars. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I like that the team has a \"show\" rather than \"tell\" approach to this project. There is a great detailed description of the roadmap and how the team will be working to achieve what they are setting out to accomplish with their proposal. Something I think that the team could add to the proposal is in the section of the detailed budget. I went to the link and found all the information I wanted to look at in regards to how they will be utilizing the potential funds requested. However, I think that giving a brief description of where the funds are going to go on top of that link will help the community to see everything on one page and will increase the teams ability to receive the requested funds in this proposal. For this reason, I give this section of the proposal a 4 out of 5 stars.

It clearly described the detail of each tool that this project is developing at the moment to attract businesses to employ Blockchain and digital currencies. However, it lacked emphasis on how this solution impacts businesses in particular and the whole development of the Cardano Ecosystem in general. It mentioned that this solution will also aim at developing and promoting how beneficial the Cardano Blockchain is to businesses and providing some use-cases to prove that. But, no explanation to support that point was given. Therefore, it should explain why businesses need all of the tools that this project offers, and how they benefit businesses. Besides, it should mention how the outcome of this solution is suitable for the given challenge. The proposal also needs to give a more detailed description of some issues when delivering this project and make a plan to overcome them as well.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The plan given was not detailed and it was quite general. It could be improved by adding a timeline for the plan along with a description of what should be done, and how to do it in each small step. The budget breakdown was quite well-written. Every cost distributed seems transparent and auditable. Human resources are a strong point to show the feasibility of this project thanks to a talented team of developers, translators, researchers, and data entry assistants. Some key members along with their experience were presented. There are three people who have been working together for around 10 years on several projects. This will ensure smooth cooperation between different members to all together achieve the best work result. One of the most outstanding ones is Carl Henry with over 20 years of experience in building business websites, managing teams of nearly 50 developers. The Linkedin of these people was provided. Another thing to mention here is that the team operating this project used to submit proposals for the previous funding round, namely Fund 6,7. Some of them were funded too. This increases the feasibility of this project", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The way it presented this section is not serious and well-prepared. It would be impossible to track, trace, and audit this project as there are no indicators, KPIs, or key metrics to measure or evaluate the progress of executing it in each period of time. Besides, it lacked the timeline for the plan, then it seems difficult to just even know how everything will occur and take control over the proceeding process. It should add a specific timeline along with a description of what should be achieved in each stage, criteria or indicators should be added too. About the way it describes the success of the project, it is too general and not comprehensive. Instead, it should give some criteria to evaluate the success. There is just one positive point in this section is that it stated this project was not dependent on other projects but it incorporated the previous proposal's insights and ideas, and the success of the previous project would support the next one. However, it lacked mentioning the funding status of this project, whether it was supported by previous ones or not.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1665", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The idea successfully tackles the difficulty of providing companies with \"Bolt-On\" solutions to trade in ADA and other native digital currencies. Also, to develop and market the Cardano Blockchain's numerous benefits and use-cases to enterprises. The proposal highlights an issue that has the potential to influence the challenge, however, more research/white paper is required. The idea has the potential to contribute a lot of value to the Cardano ecosystem, however additional detail regarding how the tool works would have been helpful. Several of the proposal's key metrics and goals align with the challenge settings. Although certain precise KPIs are suggested by the difficulties, they are not specified. This proposal has identified several noteworthy hazards, however, it would be preferable if they also identified appropriate remedies.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Members of the team have amassed a diversified collection of talents and expertise from a variety of areas. The team highlights each member's qualifications and expertise, all of whom have significant experience and a reputation within the Catalyst community. Referrals on LinkedIn were supplied, allowing experience to be confirmed in that manner. When it comes to the budget, however, the cost is not related to each item, despite the fact that the pieces that make up the budget are broken out in great detail. As a result, an accurate assessment of the explanation for the required amount is impossible. Despite the absence of a section on the potential hazards to the proposal's success, the team's expertise provides me confidence that this initial phase will be successful.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Unfortunately, there is no mention of any KPIs that the community may use to keep track of the project's development. Reporting the amount of Github commits/issues/milestones submitted during the development stage, as well as setting specified milestones in project planning (e.g. UI/UX desktop draft, MVP without graphics generated, etc.) might assist the community check that everything is on track.

But one thing that stands out in this proposal is enriching their efforts by providing various benefits & use-cases of the Cardano Blockchain to businesses. In addition to providing the classic payment methods, the team has another purpose of providing additional features to improve the businesses they are partnering with. This is certainly going to bring more credit to the community from the businesses and the acknowledgment from such huge players is going to take Cardano's capabilities to a greater extent. However, the team in spite of identifying the possible obstacles and risks involved provides no preparatory measures in place to overcome the same. And a little more detailing on how their proposal is different in their approach in addressing the challenge than most others would had sealed the deal for them.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team makes provides makes very less effort in providing the readers with an elucidated plan but instead promises to show results instead of narrating the plan; but with no knowledge about the approach the team is intending to take, it's quite difficult for the reader to assume the feasibility of it. The budget plan is also missing at great lengths; The link provided by the team does not lead to any substantial evidence regarding the budget breakdown or the action plan of the team. The experience the team members carries is quite impressive. But that alone wouldn't be enough for the community to draw conclusive assumptions regarding the possibility of the team's successful implementation.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer also misses out on leaving an impression on the readers in the auditability section. The proposer again makes promises on producing some mind-blowing metrics for the community to track their efforts as they progress forward. But with no preliminary metrics, the readers are given nothing to report on. The team however having submitted proposals in several previous rounds should have made a suitable effort in providing such KPIs rather than just relying on the reputation they have built. The community basically has no possible way of determining whether the proposal is aligned with the challenge's requirements and expectations. I suggest the team goes back to the drawing board and come back stronger in the next rounds with suitable indicators and information for the voters to build the required trust and confidence in the team and the wonderful approach they have towards solving the vulnerabilities present in the ecosystem.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "We in the \"Digital Industry\" have to give them easy-to-use tools & facilities that make it a \"No-Brainer\" for business to adopt our industry", "experience": "In addition to 43 years in business with 23 online I have been producing Software components that interact with COTI ADA Pay allowing various shopping carts to accept payment in ADA (FUND 7).
