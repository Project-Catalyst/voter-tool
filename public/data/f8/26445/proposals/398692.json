Stemming from the need of businesses, specifically firms in the sector of Italia agri-food which is the first target object of this project, that they want to track and trace the origin or the authenticity of all ingredients that will make up the final products to assure the high quality of their offerings. The proposal suggested Logyq Protocol,  a Cardano\u2019s DApp, which allows anyone to track the products' origin or shipment. This is, to some extent, what businesses are seeking to improve their business efficiency and motivate the adoption of e-commerce solutions as well. The proposal also did greatly in describing its products, its functions, features, how it works, and how it brings benefit to users thanks to Cardano blockchain including technical information. In short, the suggested solution satisfied the challenge to some extent and it also showed its impact on a  lot of stakeholders and in some indirect ways enhanced the development of the Cardano ecosystem.

Some summarized tasks need to be done in each period of time. This showed the proposer put a lot of effort into preparing such a complete, clear, understandable, and easy-to-follow plan. Another compliment for this proposal is that the budget distribution was listed specifically. Several types of costs were given. There is just a small point that this proposal could improve is that some of the costs were mentioned, but there is no indication of how long they would be used for. Overall, the budget breakdown was quite well given.

Lucus is just an engineering student, but has got 2 years of experience in blockchain engineering and smart-contract programming, and used to work in DeFI startup. Alessio, an Economics student, is the founder of  Criptolab, a coworking space that holds blockchain and crypto-themed meetups.

There is a problem with counterfeiting and selling counterfeit items, according to the team. The act is becoming increasingly sensitive, and there is no means of knowing whether it was counterfeit or not. Proposal indicates statistics from studies related to the problem of counterfeit goods to reinforce the need to solve the problem. The team plans to introduce Logyq Protocol, a logistics and supply chain protocol based on Cardano blockchain that anyone may use, to address this challenge. If properly implemented, Logyq will give a simple, user-friendly interface that will allow anyone to trace their product's provenance and shipment, making it easier to locate buyers and commercial partners. I consider both the problem and the solution to be relevant, as well as the success metrics that are being proposed to be both suitable and in line with what this challenge is seeking. A full overview of steps to take to success and an explanation on how Logyq protocol will work making this proposal much more trust-worthy.
