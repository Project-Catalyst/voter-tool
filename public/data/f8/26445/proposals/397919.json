In addition to the eminently desirable legal incentives, this platform also promises direct targeting and offers as proof of its effectiveness not clicks and views (long the province of ad-tech, where bots and click and review farms are rampant) but actual sustained engagement with the brand (via gameification and incentivized self-selection).  Are you a business owner and ever had a large ad-buy with a typical digital provider like Google or Facebook?  Have you ever had to listen to their stat touts?  You know that pi$$-on-me-and-tell-me-its-raining feeling?  Say goodbye to all that, and lose the headache over whether your website is up to date with the latest privacy laws, and whether your annoying pop-ups (that you have clear metrics showing that they are driving away traffic) are legally robust enough.  There is a whole consumer side to the equation, too, that I'm not covering, with data controls, legal education and DSR tools, incentivized gaming and deep SSI based privacy protection and security.  All in all when Profila says they are ready to disrupt ad-tech, all I can say is I hope Cardano is ready for Profila.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It is always worth checking out the Profila website and looking at their high level road map, just to orient yourself in their growing platform architecture.  This proposal, focused on a huge design, development and integration of a 3rd-party-cookie-busting protocol for B2B clients has a 5-month workflow, and like some of this team's other proposals the early work is quite granular through the product design phase, before becoming heavily generalized going into the development sprints.  However, they include the architecture they are integrating to, and later discuss the milestones of each integration, so the emergent property seems to be just the integration itself, and since we aren't talking about Plutus or SSI or anything, but rather the UI/UX dashboard for businesses and other \"standard\" tech, I have high confidence that most of the missing details are standard agility areas in software development, rather than gaps in architecture knowledge.  Not much can be done about the risks for this project, namely what kind of performance the platform will experience on blockcahin, which is why I am glad to see that they are planning for lengthy testing and beta phases with already onboarded SMEs.  On this timeline we could see Hydra in play, ZKsnark rollups and a few other scaling solutions that could be gamechangers for these kinds of worries.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They include here their typical thoroughness in listing out both all the ways that the community can follow along as well as the milestones leading to delivery.  Communication includes the standard progress reporting and coordinator calls, as well as their newsletter, Git and swarm sessions, which are the best ways to get in touch and get questions answered with their AMA format. The success milestone is pretty specific here, and worth reading in full, as it is a causal chain initiated by a targeted ad from the ad-server that ends up in a blockchain Tx for auditing purposes, but the interesting stuff is what happens in between.  Each of the steps in that chain could be considered a deliverable though none of them are separate modules, so the actual measuring of these KPIs will be a factor of code commits and sprint burndowns.  This is the kind of project that will report as %complete.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 6, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2396, "q0": "with today's growing social trend.

With estimated statistics, I think this project will be very successful if applied in practice. I feel this project should be scaled up to address future challenges. The solutions are also very reasonable given by the group. Profile's DeMar platform will provide businesses worldwide with a new privacy-preserving alternative, This Proposal addresses the current B2B and B2C challenges. However, the group's solutions do not have specific evidence or research. Even if the project is good, it cannot be without risks. The group has also given the risks that the project may face in quite detail as stated in the project. however, I would like to add more. most of the community is still following the old technologies. but the old technologies today also do quite well their role.

I see that the project has started a specific timeline. will complete the work within a period of 20 months. and has been subdivided into different sub-categories.

The progress of the project is also quite easy to check and track by the community. with a budget of less than 10% of the full challenge budget and has been broken down into the amounts mentioned above. I find the splits to be very reasonable. however, the team should leave a backup budget in case additional budget is needed or should have a contingency plan in case of need. Regarding the provision of team members, I see the group has listed more than 5 members. with a team of members who are experts. Famous designers and engineers, they have a lot of experience. With a good degree and seniority, I believe this project will be successful. However, the members' identities have not been verified, and it is not easy for the community to track.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "in the description of measuring the progress and development of the project.

I see the success of the project as closely related to the challenge of the campaign. it brings people into a new era. However, the new project is stopping at the idea section.
