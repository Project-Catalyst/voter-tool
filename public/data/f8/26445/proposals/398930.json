The team mentions the challenges that are in front of them and seem to have mitigation methods, nonetheless how comfortable are the existing users of the application going to be knowing that their data is actually being sold; How is the team going to instill the trust and remove that hesitancy that might develop? There are no reservations regarding the impact this could have on businesses and the Cardano ecosystem, it's gonna be massive but I feel the team might have to look a little beyond and identify the other possible risks they might have to overcome during their voyage.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "For the gravity of funding the team has requested which is about 3,25,000 making it more than 30% of the entire fund, there are a lot of details missing to the plain eye. The road-map is very brief with no well-defined milestones and deliverables. The timeline of 12 months in spite of being a long one, there sure are a lot of intermediate stage points missing. The team, however, looks propitious and bright but the cumulative years of experience would have added more insights to the mix and their capabilities. For the amount so huge, a detailed breakdown is looking very very vague and I as a reader would have appreciated if I was provided with a more elaborate how and where the funds are utilized. On the whole, I suggest the proposer goes back to the drawing board and comes back with a stage-wise development plan wherein they can ask for smaller funding and then approach the future rounds for more funds with some evident deliverables. This would be easier for the community considering the massive fund the team requires in making this proposal a reality.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "For a proposal of such gravity, the KPIs sure seem dull. For a grand scheme, the proposer presents us with and the humungous funding required, a lot of important metrics seemed to have been forgotten. The proposer provides a few development metrics such as git commits, data availability, and a few business metrics such as revenue and quality partnerships which are surely come in handy, but monthly or quarterly measurable metrics that are aligned to the milestones the team sets and also in sync with the challenge's key metrics would have done the trick. But with the metrics currently defined, I have to slightly disagree that the audit process would be fruitful and fun. The proposal being a new one, these are some key points the community and voters would depend on to grasp the intensity of impact the proposal would deliver and how much of return of investment can be expected and hence I feel dainty more information regarding the KPIs can surely make this proposal a heavyweight in this challenge.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1163, "q0": "I recently heard a saying that goes something like \"Data is the new oil\", and this is because if the data is not really refined it cannot be exploited, just like oil. The author of the proposal argues that every day many businesses generate data without having the slightest idea of the demand and value of the same, for that is proposed to develop an on-chain marketplace that allows all interested parties the opportunity to buy and sell access to these off-chain data. Personally I see a clear alignment of the solution with Cardano, how? What is proposed is that what has to be in the blockchain is the access control, the buying and selling of access would be through tokens that I would understand will be native to Cardano. To improve this proposal I would recommend the author of the proposal to define which is the target market and which is the market share that is planned to be gained. In addition I think it is also necessary to define targets of the defined goals, for example, 1) \"Discord/ community growth\", I would ask him based on his experience what is the estimated number of users that will achieve engagement? 2) \"(#) of Marketplace Transactions\", also in this case I would ask him what is his estimation? Of course I understand that these are difficult values to estimate but I believe that this is part of the work that the community expects, much more considering the amount you are requesting. Another recommendation I would give is to address the topic of storage of the dataset that will be available on the platform, particularly everything associated with decentralized storage. Based on the above, I assign a score of 4. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team assembled for this proposal comprises 4 people with different backgrounds relevant to the proposal presented, their skills and experience were verified through their linkeind profile. They do not have a developer with experience in Haskell / Plutus / Rust, etc. this seems to me a very important topic that was not addressed in the risk section mainly because I know that developers with that profile are highly demanded so I would have liked to read mitigation countermeasures regarding that risk. When analyzing the budget we found that this proposal requests a little more than 30% of the challenge budget and more than 90% of this will be destined to the payment of professional fees for the different profiles, although I consider that there was a correct description of the different items and the requested values are appropriate to the international market, I found several of these items that should have been better described, for example, it is assigned to marketing US$23,000 this would be why amount of time? The same for the value assigned for the frontend it is not clear the calculated hourly value. These details should have been more precise to allow a better evaluation by the community. When evaluating the implementation plan I found it a bit confusing, for example, it is indicated that in May 2022 \" \"Build MVP1\". What does this mean?  Does it mean that construction will start? or the MVP will be finished? If the latter, you expect to build an MVP in 2 months? The same goes for point 4. It is not clear if by October 2022 you expect the deliverable. Here I can give you an additional recommendation in case you are not allocated funds this time, I would recommend you to split the project in two phases where the integration with DAOs is left for a second phase, and for that you can reapply for funds with already a MVP done. Based on this, I assign you a score of 4.

Regarding the roadmap, it is presented in a period of 12 months, describing deliverables in milestones at 3 months and then between 6 and 12 months. Here I see an inconsistency with the challente setting since they ask the proposers to submit plans up to a period of 9 months, however, it is not very serious from my point of view.

How do you encode this data into tokens while the data source is off-chain?
