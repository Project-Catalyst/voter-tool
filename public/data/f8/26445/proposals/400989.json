There may be ways to integrate this opportunity into the cardano ecosystem, and there are a lot of helpful and collaborative members of the community online.  Perhaps you could connect with some of them to develop this more, and come back for a later fund.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "There is very little information in the proposal, attachments, or social media account provided which would indicate that the team has any experience or capability to execute this model.  There is no timeline or budget breakdown present, and the overall business model appears to be very conceptual at this stage.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proposer mentions that product movement is likely the only way to audit progress based on this proposal, otherwise they would need to establish alternative metrics in the future.

Here I must respectfully disagree because, yes, the mineral content of water is an important variable, it is only one variable that contributes to fatigue levels in people, so from this point of view I recommend the team to really think about what problem they want to solve and why the consumer would choose you versus your competitors. However, assuming there is something I am not catching in your problem definition, the solution you are proposing is to offer a water alternative with high mineral content, which seems reasonable to me. My biggest problem is that after reading this proposal more than once I don't see a clear relationship as the team proposes to leverage the goodness of Cardano to help solve the problem. A market and business has a lot of potential if it can synergize with what Cardano has to offer, so I invite the team to get in touch with teams like WADA who I am sure can come up with a much more attractive proposal in upcoming funds, for now I must rate this proposal with 1. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Regarding the team, there are 5 people with different backgrounds that complement each other well for a proposal of this type. However, the necessary links were provided to verify their skills and experience. If the link was provided to the Facebook page of the company \"SayYes\" in after a quick review it appeared to be a legitimate business, although unfortunately I tried to access the link to their website that was on the facebook page and it did not appear to be working. When evaluating the budget, unfortunately the necessary information is not presented to make a proper evaluation of this as there is no discrimination between the different items that compose it, therefore it is impossible to know the team's logic to reach the requested amount. Regarding the implementation plan, the only information provided is the intended approach, which would be the scaling of the project. Based on the above my recommendation to the voters is not to approve this proposal, for the proposers to take this feedback and incorporate it into their proposal for future Catalyst cycles, my score is 2. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Finally on auditability issues I only had the opportunity to analyze two metrics presented. Which are associated with the traceability of the weekly volume and monitoring the level of growth after the implementation of the scaling strategy, these seem to me appropriate for the type of business they maintain. When analyzing what are the expectations of success the team describes \"When local communities order and we see the product at sports days, refrigerators etc\" this is very vague and difficult to measure, it is necessary to find metrics that allow the community to audit during implementation. I hope this justification will help the voters to decide not to approve this proposal for this fund, and for the proponents to take this feedback and come back in future funds.
