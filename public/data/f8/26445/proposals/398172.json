In turn, the stake delegators will be rewarded with new Cardano native tokens in the line of MELD protocol. This will help in bringing many users to the Cardano ecosystem.\nCurrently, they are operating in Peru, with immediate plans to expand to Columbia and Mexico. On a long-term note, the proposer is planning to expand to other Latin American countries. Hence the services provided by this project are on the verge to scale to include larger geography. \n \n The micro-lending market is underutilized as many in the informal sector do not have access to it.

The proposer also looking for a partnership with MELD for the provision of liquidity. The developer required by the project seems yet to be hired for the native token launch and operation.\nThe budget is reasonable as it is 50% of the amount required to launch stakepools, token launch & operation, etc., \n \nThe timeframe has been provided by the proposer and all the mentioned stages such as stakepool launch, native token launch, and incorporation in BVI along with other legal matters are scheduled to be completed within 6 months post-funding. \n \nAdditional funding will be coming from stakepool rewards as the proposer will run a 100% margin stakepool and delegators will be entitled only to the protocol new Cardano native tokens. Apart from this, the proposer is looking for liquidity from MELD. \n \n Considering all the details above it is likely this proposal will be executed in migrating the services to the Cardano blockchain but it will interesting to see the onboarding of the number of nano loan seekers to the protocol.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The timeframe has been laid out in months to complete the various steps of the plan.

So it will face challenges to have 100% of the rewards generated toward the funding pool. Proposer needs to provide a more liquidity (allocation from the return) for investors to cashout on KSHN tokens which will be distributed later. In addition, I believe that the economic cycle also affects the default rate of borrowers, so it is better to create a sharing responsibility mechanism through financing to a groups consisting of several people.
