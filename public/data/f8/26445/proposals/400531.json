Not that I could not imagine what the proposer wants to create, he wants to create a traceability and communication solution on the line between producer and consumer.  However using unnecessary amount of buzzwords and not simplifying and organizing the explanation of the main idea of the proposal will hurt its chances to be funded. I recommend to the proposer to reevaluate the way he conveys the information in his proposals.\nThe proposal is both a B2B and a B2C and also could be a C2B solution, so this aligns well with the challenge. And given that the platform is built on Cardano blockchain it will eventually hit the measurables of this challenge also.\nI strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer claims a test agreement with a number of companies, but does not provide the names and contacts of these companies in order for the voter to check the validity of that claim. \nThe proposer has attached a pamphlet explaining the same idea but without detail.\nIt looks like the proposer does not have a team assembled for this proposal because he states that for the Q1, Q2 and Q3 of 2022 they will continue to strengthen their team.\n The section where the proposer presents the team is completely empty. No team has been presented. Even the proposer does not present himself. \nThe plan for the project is vaguely outlined to say the least. The plan raises doubt that a real detailed and actionable plan exists at that stage of development. This brings the question how someone outlines a budget without having a plan?\nThe budget is regarding the Q2 2022 to Q2 2023 and \u201cconsists of a progressive growth of the start-up taking into account the hiring of many people during the year.\u201d\nThe proposal outlines a budget by profession and total funds needed for that profession by quarter. There is no detail on the number of employees, hourly rates or hours needed to complete the proposal.\nThe budget includes hardware and vague items like \u201cblockchain consultancy\u201d. \nTotal budget is for USD 345,147, but this proposal requests $100,000. There is no mention where the rest of the funding will come from. Maybe from following Catalyst Funds, maybe from another place, this question is not discussed at all.\n I strongly disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proposer states that the project will be developed into stages and each stage will have different achievements. However I don\u2019t see why this information is not presented in the roadmap plan for the proposal, this would have made the proposal way more trustworthy.\nAnother measure the proposer suggests is volume of products traced by the platform. This is a good measure, but it should have a date and a quantity attached to it to make it really an auditable item. Also, this measurement will be available only if and when the solution is developed and adopted, the Catalist audit team will need earlier milestones if the proposer wants to receive funding before the final stage of the project.\nThe success metrics are a work in progress\u2026\nI strongly disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\nDear proposer, you are asking for funding from the Catalyst community, you are asking for a significant sum of money to develop your idea, please be so kind to spend a little bit of time and finish your proposal properly.

End users can see where the goods they buy come from, and retailers can track the entire supply chain that reaches the consumer. However, it all depends on the idea on paper. The proposed team has not yet come up with any solutions to implement this idea.\nFor example, how can they give information about the goods such as what day this apple was picked, in which garden, what coordinates, in which container truck? And what technology is this information encrypted through? And how is it included in the Cardano blockchain? (Through the Oracle, and how many Oracles to ensure decentralization?)\nProposals do not explain all these aspects, so the ideas are just ideas.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "A very general budget breakdown, the proposal requires a budget of more than 10% of the total Challenged budget but does not elaborate on the costs. \nFor example: Full Stack Developer: USD 64,615, how many Full Stack developers, how much USD for 1 working hour. Very general. \n\nIn addition, the project spends too much on the programming team, but how about the cost for marketing? If the budget is not spent on Marketing, will the project be known to many people?\n\nAnd the biggest challenge that the project has not mentioned is how to disseminate knowledge about blockchain and information technology to end-users and suppliers.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proposal does not specify how many people the team consists of, and how experienced they are.

Solution is breakdown carefully and reasonably when the products of project will help all stakeholder meet their needs. \nThe proposer can add some case-studies to let all audience imagine easily. \nThe outcome of this project was set by the proposer which includes their ways of implementation and the target. Based on their explanation, we can understood easily how the actions will be done. On the other hand, it is necessary to set quantitative indicators as well, to ensure that all stakeholders have common vision on what they want to achieve in each stage. \nRisk management is considered very well to deliver the project successful.

So, the proposer can add more information in this timing on how they will do that. The project\u2019s budget is broken down based on quarter with detailed expense for each part. It will be better to add more detailed information on how much will be paid for what activities. \nThere was no information about the human resources which cause difficulties for audience to believe that, the project will be done.

Clearly, the proposed solution has the intention of delivering these results and fits perfectly into the expectation of this challenge.\n\nStill on the potential impact of this project, it is worth mentioning that the proposal includes the validation of the solution with an MVP for a restricted group of companies, which have already agreed to participate. This initiative is critical due to the size of the project and helps to increase the value generated by the final delivery to the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The author did not present any references about his experiences nor about the team members. Until March 24, this form field was described as work in progress.\n\nThe attached presentation presents information a little more contextualized than the proposal, which helps to make the idea clearer. However, this presentation also does not contain who will be involved in the project development.\n\nWith a clear and concise presentation of milestones, we were able to get a great sense of the expected progress of the project.\n\nNecessary information that was not presented are detailed plans and schedule. This is a huge project, which includes several phases and professionals involved. Without this detailing, we were unable to critically analyze the feasibility of the project and completion of each step within the informed milestones.\n\nThe budget information was presented clearly, detailed and divided between types of expenses. I would like to point out 2 things in this aspect.\n\n(1) There is an inconsistency between the budget requested at the beginning of the proposal and the cost breakdown. This inconsistency can be fixed.\n\n(2) The idea of the project is to develop a robust platform that works through all stages of the supply chain. After final delivery, how will this platform be sustained? Where do the revenues come from? It would be important to detail this business plan as well.\n\nFinally, about the risks, it surprises me that this project, with all its complexity, presents only 1 risk. It would be important to understand if all possibilities were analyzed and no other risks were really identified. Otherwise, it is essential for the author to inform about this issue.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The author did not clearly indicate how progress in project development will be measured. From the previously reported milestones, it is evident that there is an organization in this sense. But to monitor progress, both for the project leader and for the community, it is necessary to have the definition of goals, indicators and ways to calculate progress.\n\nFor a good project management, this information is just as important as the description of the solution, which was made with great quality. With that material in hand, the author could share with the community. A qualified audit is indispensable for a project of this size.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1818", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5902, "q0": "I like the idea of having a more integrated value chain where product information can be traced back to its beggining, to benefit costumer, and potentially, somehow, improve grower margin. \nMoreover, proposal does address the challenge as it is \"MVP that could be built on Cardano\" at the same time it is a business solution (increase transparency on product origins). it is also good that the proposer already identified partners who are willing to test the MVP. This would be a great challenge otherwise. Speaking of which, challenge section correctly identified one risk with a mitigation plan in place. However, there are other challenge associated with product costs, quality, meeting schedule, advertising solution once its concept is proved and so on.\n\nAs further suggestions, it would be nice to see here some business casse draft, saying  how this product could increase sellers margin (increase product value or decrease production/logistic costs?) and even bringing some numbers on a market research with costumers on how appealing is this solution how much they would be willing to pay for it. Implenting a new technological solution usually involved bigger initial investment from produce and would be nice to see how it pay offs over time in their revenue and fixed costs. And of course, how it would generate revenue for the proposer (tech provider). This type of analysis is specially imporant in this market, where the value-added of the products are not so high and is somewhat commoditized, and any small change in price might affect sales.\n\nThere are also other companies going in similar direction regarding valuechain integration and transparecy with blockchain. Though I'm not sure in which TRL they are, It woud also be nice to look into them and check if there's potentiual for sinergies and how it would differentatie (be better) than potential competitors.\n\nFinally, I'd also see potential to assess sustainability aspects of this project. Is it possible, with a more transparent, information-driven, and integrated value-chain, to decrease use of packaging (and future waste) in the logistics? Is it possible somehow to lower these packages weight or optimze routes/transportation in order to lower CO2 emissions from trucks, ships and airplanes?\nThis would make the value proposition of this project much more appealing but some research would have to be done.\n\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There's a timeline but it is very summarized. More details could be provided on the acitivites and intermediate deliverables. for  instance, in the first 9 months, the only acitivty mentioned is  \"strengthening the team to be prepared for the trial\". There are a lot of smaller things in that, specially considering this large window of time. This project has a great potential to use an agile (or hybrid) approach, and, if that will be done, some sprint deliverables and product backlogs could be explored here.\n\nThe budget breakdown is done by role and by quarter and seems to be based on until the first year of project which brings the question if it it will subtmit more proposals in the future or be self-funded. However, the MVP seems to be delivered in this 1st year, which is proposal scope, and the budget matches timeline. Imporant to notice that this proposal takes up 34% of total challenge budget. If not approved because of budget, I'd consider break it in two funds.\n\n\nRegarding the team, unfortunately, no information is provided. it would be nice to see who are the people behind this project - their experience, background and capabilities - and how they match the roles in the budget breakdown. If extra people would need to be hired, its also imporant to mention. I tried looking into the pdf attached here but it also doenst have information on the team.\n\nAll in all, as it is an expensive project, with a not very detailed plan and no team information, It's really hard to say it will be feasilble  and I see a very risky project then I'll score it 2 stars", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Auditability section also seems incomplete (it says work in progress for the definition of success).\nThe way proposer is propsing to measure progress is also very subjective, generic and hard to measure. \nThe only really measurable kpi mentioned is the volume of products that will be traced through our platform. It is a good one but it has no target and is not time-framed and, if only the MVP will be delivered here, I'm not sure this number will mean a lot (though it could indeed be monitored anyway). It will be really imporant though in the future, when final product version is launched in the market and will be interesting to see it grow overtime.\n\nTo improve auditability, I'd highlight here what are the main milestones of the project, for each phase and would have a dedicated directory to provide sprint reports and an updated product backlog (if it has an agile approach on it, which usally software development does). It would be imporant to have other kpis that could measure the MVP success (maybe satisfaction survey with the clients that will test it, how it is increasing growers margin and final costumer perception).", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_298", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9776, "q0": "Technology /Tools: This solution uses blockchain technology infrastructure to deploy a decentralized ecosystem to connect agricultural product producers with end-users and other direct channels.
