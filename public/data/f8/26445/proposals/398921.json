They are transitioning to web3 by building a DAO and upgrading their marketplace to web3. This proposal is for the upgrade to web3. They intend to sell their existing products through Cardano.\n\nWhile the proposal doesn't match the examples given in the challenge brief, I believe it is in spirit completely in line with the challenge. This is an existing business use case being implemented on the blockchain. As far as I know, it is also one of the early examples of real world products being sold through web3 as well. Bringing real business use cases to Cardano is the aim of the challenge. This is both a B2B (vendors) and a B2C (buyers) solution that will be a great example of a business use case once implemented. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The fact that Konma already has a working marketplace for users is great for feasibility. Instead of building the technology and the business in parallel, all they need is to focus on the technology. They already have the business - marketing, operations, etc. \n\nThe proposal is entirely based on software development. The project is divided into three phases with increasing complexity. The first phase takes products in the user's cart at checkout, produces an NFT and bills it to the customer. This is relatively simple. Phase 2 and 3 are for developing smart contracts for the vendor&customer and for affiliates. Phase 2 and 3 will require extensive knowledge of smart contract design.\n\nThe team's experience is then critical if they are to implement the smart contracts. Out of the four people in the team, only one is a blockchain engineer. Sangeet, the CTO has 4+ years of experience in blockchain development. It is not clear what percentage of that experience is with Haskell and Plutus. Either way, his extensive experience in blockchain is a big plus. It increases my belief in the team knowing they have someone who has implemented such solutions before. \n\nThe team has all the necessary skills other than development already at hand. The proposers do note they will hire developers but it is not clarified how many and with what skills.  As long as they find the missing skills, the proposal does seem feasible. Clarifications on skills needed and the number of developers they will onboard would be appreciated. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The three phases do provide deliverables as each phase is connected to a specific functionality. The phases however don't come attached with dates. The included roadmap doesn't mention them. The roadmap is divided into 2 week chunks. Each chunk highlights the focus of the two weeks. There isn't much detail to each chunk. For example week 3 and 4 is to Finalize Architecture Design. There are no deliverables but the roadmap gives a broad idea of what to expect.\n\nI feel the roadmap was thrown together rather quickly without a lot of thought. 2 weeks are given for the preliminary audit. Another 2 weeks for Final Audit and Q/A. Audits are held by 3rd parties. I don't understand why 2 weeks are given by the team to hold audits while work still needs to be done. In reality, of course the work won't stop when the audit comes. But it seems in the roadmap that it will stop. \n\nSo it's rather difficult to pin down the path of the proposal. I suggest the team to provide a clearer plan, linking the phases with the roadmap, attaching estimates for each major deliverable.

For these reasons, the impact of this seems largely unknown in practice.

The team looks to have the needed experience to accomplish the goals of this proposal.\nThe voter should know that the same proposer has another proposal in fund 8 in the Hub challenge and plans to develop a physical hub that will double down as an inventory for the online marketplace.\nThe proposer outlines a risk for this proposal and proposes a mitigation plan for it.\nI agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In the auditability section the proposer lists a number of tasks/milestones, but does not attach dates for them (maybe we could take some of these from the roadmap) however there are no measurable that the proposer suggests.

Therefore, I see Konma has foresight when it wants to develop its marketplace according to web3. And if everything goes smoothly, the Cardano ecosystem in general and its utilities in particular (NFT, ADA coin) will be even more welcome.\nHowever, the proposer presented the context and introduced the solution quite coherently, but when describing the link between the project and the challenge's KPIs, you did too little. Challenge requires \u201cdescribe\u201d not \u201clist,\u201d and 3 lines are not enough to prove that link. Furthermore, in my opinion, you should correct your wording in the main challenge and risk section. Since the blockchain concept is new to many, you must \u201cFIND A WAY TO POPULARISE AND ENCOURAGE USERS THANKS TO ITS EASE OF USAGE AND CLEAR INFORMATION\u201d to overcome this risk.

It is not hard to understand this point of view. I mean come on DEVs, wrap it up already. Well this type of sitting around waiting for the cool stuff to come to your way is not helping the community and needs tp end here. Luckily, this is simply fixed with a little education and understanding the grasp of how web3 needs to be implemented. I would love to sit here and write a full explanation, but luckily for everyone, the information is more available now than it has ever been. When we are talking about web3, we might as well be talking about decentralization itself. P2P ( or Peer-to-Peer) marketplaces are very exciting. They will have a huge impact on not only effectively addressing the challenge for this specific proposal, the impact will be felt throughout the entire crypto ecosystem.\n      Many different parts of the Cardano ecosystem can and will be utilized in realizing web3 as a whole. There is a strong argument that web3 along with P2P payments and decentralized markets are not even possible without something like a Cardano ecosystem. I would suggest that this proposal take advantage of how vital Cardano is for addressing their Problem Statement, and include other projects such as Profila and Ardana as examples of maybe how converting a web2 environment over to web3 could even be possible, while at the same time highlighting the importance the exact ecosystem this proposal is wishing to compliment. \n\n  The proposed implementation that was briefly outlined for a use case of CNFTs is really interesting, and a proposal on that specifically would be great to understand in possibly a future funding round.\n    Along with the other things mentioned the CNFTs could be eventually evolved to meet other normal interactions and bring new engaging, and importantly even better cost effective CNFT solutions to an already established legacy approach.\n  This proposal is very ambitious, and while admirable, would have better impact if broken down into multiple funding rounds. This would allow the proposer more time, and also likely a larger budget to achieving the end goal of migrating to web3. More specific goals for a proposal would likely find this team able to more effectively address specific problems needing to be solved for the challenge this proposal is ultimately requesting to be given funds for. It Is not portrayed very effectively if the main focus of the project wants to migrate to web3, and wanting to use the CNFT was just an afterthought.

I would recommend a good look at what value A proposer can add to the PROBLEM STATEMENT at the beginning of their proposal, and consider how would they explain a solution to someone new to this space. The community guidelines for submitting a proposal do not give the voter expectation of a full technical breakdown from start to finish, but it needs to be reasonable to expect, based only on what your proposal gives a reader, there is a decent chance this project will do what they are proposing. I believe that this team does not outline enough information on specific things such as, examples of current P2P projects that are in development that can help in outlining a path to a web3 implementation. Specifics on their verry innovative CNFT use case, with examples to show the knowledge to successfully make this happen. This CNFT idea, the only specific mention to the cardano space, i believe would make a great option for a future proposal.
