Here the group has raised the issue that, countries around the world are having to invest a lot of money in the health sector. and the introduction of Citaldoc technology into healthcare management. As we all know Citaldoc is a flexible, extensible platform where B2C and B2B models coexist. The team's solutions are very good and suitable for the future challenge, which is to balance the opportunity to access safe, affordable, and quality healthcare services. Will start testing in Latin America and the Caribbean and later expand to the world. I found this proposal to be able to solve the problems in the challenge. The group also gave very reasonable evidence, studies, and arguments. on risk management. The group also pointed out the risks that the project may encounter very specifically as stated in the project. and also suggest ways to deal with those risks.

The proposal also highlighted the potential market in the medical segment in the Latin Market with statistics collected from reliable sources, which is a plus point to emphasize the impact of this project if it is incorporated with the Cardano ecosystem.

In each segment, there is a detailed description of every step in the process attached with certain time milestones, which proves that the proposer knows what to do step by step to operate this project successfully. Another thing that is worth mentioning here is that the proposal provided a very clear budget breakdown going from the total of capital needed to the smaller sections. For each small section, the proposer listed out the budget required, how long it would be used for, and how it is used to reach a certain purpose of the project. It could be said that the budget was thoroughly allocated into many distinctive activities in order to avoid wasting capital resources.About the human resource distribution for this project, it consists of talented people who are used to be CEO of some firms and the mentor of a tech company in the medical field, and some developers. It would be better if the proposer included more information about the background of the developer team with their reference link to their profile to show how suitable they are to this project.

Furthermore, Citaldoc is a model that allows B2C and B2B to coexist, and it may generate a lot of profits when integrated with the Cardano ecosystem. The B2C vs B2B model, through a unique management mechanism, allows customers to enjoy both medical care advantages and incentives such as discounts or earn points. Furthermore, the recommended solutions are perfectly suited to this challenge. This will push the circuit to use cryptocurrencies like ADA to make the number of people accessing the Cardano system more and more.

I'd also want to compliment the project team. They all have several years of expertise and practically all have previously engaged in health-related activities, therefore they will undoubtedly bring success to this project.

Maybe it's insignificant, but it would be better if they added this detail to their project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In terms of the success they seek, I wholeheartedly concur. Beginning with short-term success, growing the number of ADA users will provide several benefits to the Cardano ecosystem, particularly in areas with high medical expenditures like as Latin America and the Caribbean. In addition to the medium and long-term accomplishments, scaling to other continents and linking various professionals with different languages would assist the Cardano ecosystem in expanding to the global market.
