Although not directly a ready-to-deploy product or service that can be easily understood and promises mass adoption, it is a thoughtful step to increase transparency and stakeholder engagement as called for by the Challenge setting. By creating dialogue between stake pool operators and Cardano dApp businesses, a financial system with Ada at the center is supported. Therein I see the main strength but also drawback of the proposal: Staking as a Service (STaaS) is a novel concept, and even within Project Catalyst all funding is always treated as US-Dollar equivalent even though funding occurs in Ada. So staking on behalf of businesses is a very, very early idea. We need to develop a mentality to see Ada as stable as dollars and increase its use as a means of payment and store of value other than a very long-term, speculative or emotional asset that we squirrel away for the day when finally the rest of the world starts to share our vision. The strength of the proposal is that it introduces a discussion in this direction, and by having ESG-compliant staked Ada, instead of just plain staked Ada, maybe businesses will start to hold more working capital in Ada and make more payments in Ada too.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The business plan presented is extremely detailed and backed up by external references and market analysis. The team member names and profiles and provided and the company behind this proposal has provided its website link and testimonials and product summary therein. A six month timeline is presented and credibly backed up with a budget breakdown and all metrics and milestones are coherent and believable. It seems from the depth and breadth of the proposal presentation and risks covered that the successful implementation is likely. I noted as a positive that this does not seem to be copied and pasted from some other blockchain, VC pitch or hackathon, but is Cardano-specific with a track record of Atala Prism pioneer, SPO operation and Dandelion network connection of the main proposer. 5 out of 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The Auditability section of the proposal has KPIs and refers back to the timeline making it possible to track success of this proposal. It is however not as strong as the Feasibility section, with much less detail provided and over-reliance on onboarding - the central metric here is how many businesses are contacted, consulted, assisted etc without any metrics to ensure the level of customer satisfaction, $- or Ada-amounts staked or customers of the businesses, making it somewhat too easy to fulfil the targets without providing impact as promised above.\nThe section however manages well to cover both the 6-month implementation period and a long term vision and provides valuable insight into the thinking of the project proposer.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1357", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 1, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Thanks so much for this very thoughtful and detailed assessment. While I agree that this is an early idea in that the volatility of ADA inhibits Cardano based businesses from holding large amount of working capital in ADA, we still believe the positive impacts of this project on a number of fronts - charitable causes, marketing/PR, providing a viable business model for a small but growing number of SPOs - will add up to significant benefits in the short term, and increasing benefits in the mid-to-long term. ESG compliance is coming to businesses big and small, and we want Cardano to be the hand's-down best-positioned layer 1 on this issue. \n\nWRT your feedback on auditability, your points are very well taken, and we'll consider how we can deliver robust accountability to metrics that extend beyond outreach. "}, {"id": 3617, "q0": "The proposal pointed out the need of embracing ESG into Cardano-based businesses as ESG has become an important indicator in corporate governance and global financial flow.  It listed several reasons why Cardano became an industry leader in ESG-driven investment. And this solution, based on Cardano, will bring greater effects and impacts on businesses to solve the need of building projects that comply with ESG. The solution was explained in detail. It mentioned that this project will partner with B1G1 and a description of the business scale and the influence on a lot of businesses in the world of B1G1. This proves that with the cooperation with a big partner, this project seems to have a huge impact on  Cardano-based businesses. How this solution works was also provided in great detail with technical explanations. Another highlight here is that it shows the impact of this solution on the whole Cardano Ecosystem. By outlining in great detail outstanding advantages that the Cardano ecosystem can bring when it comes to meeting the demand of complying ESG in the business projects over other blockchains, if the solution was enacted, then it would attract more people to join Cardano to build projects to meet ESG requirements and then ultimately boost Cardano's mainnet and testnet. These impacts are aligned with the key metrics of the challenge. Besides, the proposal pointed out three risks that this project may face when delivering the project in great detail including technical explanations. And the way to mitigate these risks was thoroughly explained as well, showing the careful preparation of this project for even the worst scenarios.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan was given in detail with a clear timeline. It also separated the plan for this current fund and the future fund. This shows the long-term development and the potential of this project. The budget breakdown was given quite clearly. However, there are some costs mentioned but do not include how long they will be used for. Regarding the team operating this project, this project is led by a team full of experience. In fact, the team has been building applications for small-sized firms and NGOs for 11 years. The proposal includes the link to the team's website as evidence to prove that. This helps build trust in the possibility of executing this project successfully. Apart from mentioning the background and experience of the project director and the business development lead at the beginning of the proposal, the detailed information related to the background, skill, and relevant experience of other team members was not mentioned. If it could improve this aspect, it would be more persuasive to say that this project is led by talented leaders and the participation of outstanding staff, which will help increase its feasibility.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal did a great job in listing clear criteria with specific figures to evaluate the progress and the development of the project. Through that, it could track, trace, and audit how everything is going on in each month based on listed criteria. However, the plan starts in May, but there are no indicators mentioned to measure the proceeding process of this month. The description of the success was given,  but it could be improved by adding more figures so that the success could be more measurable. Also, it should indicate this is a new project or a part of another project that was funded.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1665", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "A thorough, detailed, and (I think) very reasonable assessment.

"}, {"id": 6121, "q0": "Love this idea! ESG-focused, STaaS consultancy certainly goes a short way enticing cardano-base enterprises to participate in staking with the prospect of returns that goes beyond their ada staking rewards. This is not a five start because the proposal does not adequately discussed and addressed the risk to an enterprise engaging with such a service. What are the tax implications? Security implications and resulting overhead? While this is an excellent product, I feel like it would fail the \"build it they will come\" test. Would to see some specific business profiles that would have enough incentive to take on the risk displacing their ADA and what those incentive beyond the pr and marketing benefit of being ESG compliant. Excellent idea nonetheless and would love to see this built. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Detailed budget breakdown, clear timelines, team possessing core competencies to execute all screams 90% feasible.

My one point of contention is I do believe this project will be able to get considerable traction with cardano-based businesses that are holding working capital in ADA. The reason being, these companies, along with a growing number of institutional investors, have a pretty limited amount of risk in non-custodial staking with Cardano's no-lock, no-slashing model. \n\nGranted, there are tax implications to earning inflationary rewards on ADA holdings, but ascertaining these is outside the scope of this idea, and even outside the scope of Project Catalyst in general, which understandably doesn't offer any  tax guidance or speculation about the ADA awarded to businesses via Project Catalyst. And even if we find that businesses/institutions holding ADA are currently opting to custody their ADA with a third party, or have put cumbersome restrictions on the re-delegation of that ADA, we believe we'll be able to make inroads with many of these companies over the mid-to-long term, mainly because ESG mandates are coming to companies handling digital assets whether they like it or not, so our goal now is to make our solutions known, adapt them to the needs of businesses, and make it known that Cardano has the most ESG-compliant staking ecosystem of any consensus out there. \n\nAll that being said, it seems our rating on both Impact and Feasibility was negatively affected on the basis of you not believing Cardano-based businesses will opt for it, but in that case, it would have been helpful and clarifying if you would have enumerated specific concerns businesses may have in delegating to stake pools from which they can derive ESG benefits, and how those concerns would likely outweigh perceived benefits. \n\nAlso, we don't believe this is simply a solution that can be built and attract delegators, which is why we are going to place a lot of focus on outreach, shaping our solution to achieve service/market fit, and sales. That said, you make a great point that we should try to record our contacts to the outcomes of our outreach to the Cardano community. We may need to anonymize projects in reporting this info, but we'll certainly explore ways to capture this data for the community as much as possible.
