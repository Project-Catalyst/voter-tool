The proposal also explained how this solution will impact and facilitate the adoption of Cardano through creating on-chain entities.Two popular challenges were realized. One is the lack of knowledge related to Cardano/Blockchain. The other is the incapability to change due to cost issues.  This proposal suggested a way to overcome the challenge by accompanying the firm to set up on Cardano and grow with them, but details about it were not stated. Therefore, If it described how they go together with the firm at the beginning and how long this will take, then everything would be more persuasive.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "A plan with different steps and phases to be executed was mentioned.

It just included the cost for lead developers and supporting developers, but other operating fees were not mentioned. Therefore, a more detailed list of budget distribution should be included so that sponsors could evaluate the possibility of executing this project that does not waste much capital.

This project, as claimed by the author, is essential to the development of the Waya Collective. The team hopes to establish an operating system that includes three key features for businesses: transparent governance, access to Defi, and efficient bookkeeping. It appears to me that the relationship between this proposal goal and the challenge setting is very obvious. Furthermore, the anticipated impact implementation, along with a well-thought-out description of how it works, makes everything appear solid and accurate. Furthermore, there is a mention of possible issues, which I believe is appropriate. However, I would have liked to see the team demonstrate a clear method or approach to attracting the attention of other companies and make them join despite their \u201clack of knowledge\u201d and \u201cinability to change\u201d. For instance, it is claimed in the proposal that large organizations have considerable switching costs, so how does the team intend to tackle this for the better?

It would be greatly beneficial if there is a well-described plan on how to assess the stated goal of each phase and provide a more transparent vision of where the project is after a specific interval. There's a high level budget breakdown but more details on it could also be offered. Since the budget will be allocated solely on developer staff, it could provide additional information on: how many hours per week/month they work, what task to do to be exact, etc. This would help to understand the rationale behind the number and check its fairness. In terms of viability, I disagree that the proposal provides me with sufficient information to believe in its successful implementation.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are no specified metrics with targets or intermediate milestones.

The final deliverables could also be presented with more specifics or a more plain approach to measure/evaluate them as it is a bit subjective and can have numerous restrictions of success.
