With that dramatic adoption increasing in this art industry, I think that this idea will help fast increase the adoption in the Cardano ecosystem. The proposer provides some basic features and benefits that their users will receive when joining and engaging their platform very clearly. However, my advice to the team is that they should have more detailed content about the features to help us better understand how they work. The content should be clear in independent parts that are related to each of their target audience and the connection between them, this will convincing the impact of the platform easier for the community. \nMoreover, I can understand that this platform will increase the adoption of artists, fans, and investors but the proposer should make more content to show how their idea further impacts the Cardano ecosystem and align with the challenge. \nLastly, the proposer provides 2 challenges that they're facing, but I think they're not the big deal. One is about the market adoption that I believe it's an opportunity for them more than a challenge. And one is about the budget that I also think can be solved with the Catalyst fund.
