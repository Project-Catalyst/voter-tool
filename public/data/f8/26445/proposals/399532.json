Future proposals are also planned. That's worth mentioning because this F8 proposal appears to be a reasonable phase within a larger roadmap. \n\nSo, China. I think everyone can agree that it would be absolutely wonderful to have a strategy for blockchain projects and related services to penetrate the Chinese market. I also believe that DLT360 can deliver a solid analysis of Chinese risks, trends, and regulations. What I'm less sure of is how useful this will be to the community given China's general disposition towards decentralized/blockchain business activities. It's very easy to over-promise and under-deliver in this area.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "This proposal appears to fit in well with the pre-established processes and frameworks DLT360 has built and, if anything, appears to be a fairly modest addition. Given the scope of the larger project, it seems reasonable to fold F8 activities into the broader service/revenue umbrella. \n\nThe budget breakdown is adequate, but it might be helpful to have a sense of how many hands are working on each element. Since the Chinese legal consultants are key to this phase of the project, it would also be nice to have more information about them. Have they put out any white papers? Who are their previous clients?", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As Catalyst veterans, the proposers claim to have an established accountability process setup through Catalyst Coordinator.

I have seen your proposal related to problem-solving for different business areas covered by this challenge (like CPG and machine & equipment manufacturing), but this proposal adds another mission to the big project of your team.

This proposal seeks to conduct a focused assessment of the risks and potential associated with the implementation of public permissionless blockchain technology (Cardano) in industrial applications in China. The Chinese market is where worldwide acceptance of blockchain technology must occur in order to assist the local community in resolving some of its main concerns. Creating a platform to promote developers would benefit both the local community and the Cardano ecosystem. The proposer has included crucial metrics that are completely aligned with the challenge. I did not specify a scaling strategy for future issues, but in my perspective, there are at least two approaches to growing this proposal: one is to focus on certain regions of the nation, and the other is to expand the present platform over the entire country.

The proposer goes into great length to describe the technical components of his plan and does it admirably. Based on the information supplied, I feel the proposers have the requisite expertise and skills to carry out this project effectively. The crew as a whole possesses a diverse set of talents that will all be required. Many of the proposers have prior experience with Cardano catalysts, thus they are acquainted with the system they are attempting to enhance. The proposers presented a detailed roadmap as well as a timeframe. This roadmap is ambitious, but not so much that it will be impossible to achieve. After a month of fundamental research, they will bring in proposal teams to create the financing process. Furthermore, the budget is acceptable given the quantity of vital effort that the proposers will put in. The KPIs are more focused on the operation and the milestones to development/implementation, which makes sense for a project like this and ensures that all stages are covered and auditable.

The proposal states about basic research from Chinese lawyers. It will help if the team can clarify what are the backgrounds of the Chinese lawyers and whether they have sophisticated understanding and experience about blockchain technologies.
