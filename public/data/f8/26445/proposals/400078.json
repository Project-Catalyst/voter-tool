Normally, the recyclable plastic also ends up in oceans (damaging the sea life) or in landfills with other waste.\nThe operation area of this proposal is Kumasi city in Ghana and initially, it will include institutions (government and private) to register and utilize the Cardano Recycling DApp. Hence, its initial impact will be in Ghana but if successfully executed it can scale to a larger area including other countries. \nAs the participants such as institutions, households, and recycling agencies will be using the Cardano Recycling DApp to access this platform, it will bring new users to the Cardano Ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is experienced and seems to be pretty qualified to undertake the work of this proposal.

Waste management\nas it stands is a global challenge for most nations in the world. The creation of a\nprogressive web application; Cardano Recycling Dapp as a global innovation,\nencourages waste separation from various sources of waste generation to recycling\nagencies. In my view, it is excellent that the piloting of the project is test-driven on an\nexisting company with 5 years experience and on a regional level before scaling up\ninto the global market. The proposal\u2019s inclusion of a roadmap on the application\nfunctionality and integration of the smart contract highlights its impact on the Cardano ecosystem. The use of the Cardano ADA as transaction currency expands the role of Cardano Blockchain in digital businesses.

With the sufficient information provided, I believe funding allotted to the team will secure the implementation of the project to match the SDG goals set for waste recycling and waste management. Cardano Recycling Dapp has a 3 months roadmap for team vision proposed within the first phase of implementation.\nMost importantly, piloting with an established waste company is a way to measure\nthe changes that the project introduces and the growth it generates in the set\ntimeframe.

Furthermore, the integration of ADA-based waste pricing and transaction recording on the Cardano blockchain will increase the number of individuals who have access to this community. Furthermore, the collaboration with Premier Recycling Agency in Kumasi, Ghana, a recognized company, will undoubtedly boost the project's popularity and assure its success. Second, it is rare to see wastes are divided into separate classes in most waste-reduction projects. Meanwhile, this is clearly demonstrated in this project with distinct sorts of rubbish such as medical waste, food waste, and plastic waste, as well as associated remedies that I believe, are suitable. Furthermore, allowing users to communicate with one another via DApp will cut expenses while increasing mutual trust.

Furthermore, with industry experience, particularly with senior members of companies in Ghana, can assist the project in grasping the challenge more quickly and easily.

In terms of the success they want, it helps organizations become essential stakeholders in the Cardano community while also reducing waste. This not only benefits corporations, but it also has a significant positive influence on the Cardano ecosystem. Furthermore, the fact that at least ten organizations, both government and private, have contracted with the project indicates that the initiative's success rate is fairly high.

However, that the team includes a specific auditor who will be tasked to report on the progress is commendable and provides assurance of its auditability.
