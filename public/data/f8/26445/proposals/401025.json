The description of this solution was thoroughly mentioned. It would investigate the use case related to the need of having proof of provenance in the food and beverage sector. In fact, it gave details about its study case of a seafood company in the UK. A general description of how it will executive this project was also given, which helps people visualize how it will conduct the study case. It also shows its impact on Cardano as thanks to analyzing the benefits of blockchain tech in closing the gap between needs and capability, it would attract more companies to go for the Cardano Ecosystem to find solutions for their issues. Another highlight to mention here is that it predicted some potential challenges along with the way to get through them.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "A detailed plan with a specific timeline was given. Breaking down the plan into small periods of time in days makes it easier to visualize and follow the plan.The cost breakdown was well-written as well. It listed different activities with specific cost amounts. It also shows how to calculate each cost. About human resources, it did a good job in describing the role, what each person in the team will handle, their skills, and relevant experience. This makes it trustful that this project has enough human resources to operate smoothly and effectively. Another point which will boost up the feasibility of this project is that its team won the Fund 7 proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding audibility of this project, it mentioned that it will base on the project plan in the attached file to measure the progress of the project. However, it seems difficult to evaluate the process of executing each step because there are no KPIs included in the plan. Therefore, it should mention specific indicators in accordance with all milestones in the plan. The success of the project was quite clear. It is the successful publication of the whiteboard that will show how beneficial the Cardano Blockchain is in facilitating the proof of provenance of produce in the food and beverage sector.Besides, it should indicate the funding status of this project, whether it was  funded before or not.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1665", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4305, "q0": "The issue reported here is \"Food & beverage businesses want to prove the provenance of their products as a differentiator but don't have reliable solutions\". And the solution the author gives to this problem is they will use a set of real business use cases as a feasible study to inform how the Cardano blockchain can facilitate proof of provenance. Besides that, the author analyzes the Impact part in great detail. There is an introduction (with related proposals and links to references), a summary of the use case, constraints, and solutions for them. Thanks to the experience of a Fund 7 proposal winner, the goals and results that the project brings are described very clearly by the proposer (how it affects the ecosystem). Challenges and resolutions to tackle them are also clearly communicated to the community. With the above mentioned, my rating for this part is 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In terms of time, the proposed roadmap includes 14 weeks, with each clear program roadmap. And after each program, there will be feedback and review for timely adjustment. Also, I believe that the author is very thoughtful and careful when providing the project roadmap link to have a deep understand about this project\u2019s plan. As for the project, about 7 weeks will be the main period for the successful implementation of the entire work. In particular, each program will have different jobs. Each week will have separate work items and campaigns divided by day. From my perspective, this makes the plan very thorough, detailed and convenient for the community to keep track of the project progress. Regarding the budget, the total requested for this proposal is US$31,330. It is obvious that this part of the budget is allocated quite reasonably. There are estimated costs, employee salaries (paid by hours they work) and are broken down for each program and each work item. And finally, about team members, one commendable point is that this section has a detailed description of each person's position, job and role for the project. But, unfortunately, there aren't any references or links (probably LinkedIn or Twitter) to help the community and project investors verify their skills and experience. Similarly, the author should add the total amount that the project needs, who already has it, and who will come in the future. For the Feasibility as a whole, I think my rating for this part is 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap is clearly mentioned in the previous sections and it is better to summarize and reiterate to ensure auditability for the proposal.

Therefore, the interest of the proposal is aligned with the scope of the challenge.\n\nAbout the solution's potential to scale in future challenges, this is a more complex statement to make. Firstly, as it is a feasibility study, the result will tell under what conditions the business solution can be widely implemented and whether it will be viable to develop a platform to conduct this process.

The author also indicated project delivery milestones and deadline detailing for each main activity.\n\nRegarding the budget, the information was divided by work specialty and by project stage. For the deliverable project by the proposal, it is enough information to analyze the feasibility.\n\nRegarding the risks of the project, 2 risks related to the technical team and the consolidation of information for the production of the report were pointed out.\n\nIn addition, I would like to see possible risks regarding the collection of information, selection of research participants, among other issues related to the execution of the study.
