Industrial IoT has not brought the expected benefits", "f6_no_assessments": 6, "f6_rating": 4.5, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 2124, "q0": "NOTE for VCAs and voters: This proposal is part of a wider project (DLT360) that has at least 13 proposals in this funding round. This proposal is judged partly through its individual merits, and partly through the way it fits into the wider DLT360 project. My assessment takes into account aspects common across all proposals (team specific like adequacy, competency, workload, or similar reporting mechanisms / budget logic). You shall therefore find common parts across these proposals (labeled as such) and parts specific to each proposal, which should offer a good balance of looking at each tree but not missing out the overall health of the forest. \n\nSpecific part: this proposal is about researching a part of the industrial value-chain: Consumer Packaged Goods industry. The goal is to run a project in close proximity with large vendors and to integrate the findings in form of a Whitepaper.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "COMMON part: Great team. DLT360 is operated by an outstanding and growing team of regulatory experts, very active in the Cardano community. They also benefit from a scalable network of contributors from the Cardano community, academia, industry and EU institutions. In terms of team competence, skills and experience, they are well positioned.The multitude of projects funded under their umbrella showcases the great capacity to identify opportunities within the Cardano community and clearly articulate them into actionable projects. \n\nCOMMON part: Significant existing and future workload. DLT360 is a wider project initially funded in Fund6, and greatly supported by at least 5 proposals in Fund7, for a total funding so far of 85.000 USD (own calculations), many of them being still ongoing. During Fund8 the team is casting a very wide net with 13 additional proposals across several challenges, for a total funding of 295.000 USD. Onboarding so many projects so quickly can potentially lead to: too much workload, overlapping deadlines, increased risks of under-delivering, inability to distinguish added value of one project versus another, unnecessary stress and a lack of focus on and core scope and competencies. Future iterations that can bring comfort to these worries will of course be highly appreciated. \n\nCOMMON part: ALL of the 13 projects have overhead items included in the budget (project management, social media, back office, etc.) consuming an overall 30-40% of each budget (an educated guess let\u2019s call it). I think there was a missed opportunity there in terms of gathering all overheads under one roof and simplifying the budgets for all proposals by keeping them strict for core-activities.\n\nSpecific part: project would comprise basic research by senior & junior contributors and various meetings & discussions including travel.  For budget core-work rates are 80 USD/hour. Core research + meetings take up 60% of the budget.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "COMMON part: Existing track record. DLT360 projects are interlinked and since there are a number of running projects the team is definitely familiarized with the standard procedures and reporting process of the Catalyst team, so there are very low risks in terms of failing to communicate properly or inability to implement the necessary KPIs. \n\nCOMMON part: The website is a great opportunity for improvement. A concern is the fact that glancing at the DLT360 website, there is no reflection of recent live presentations that were perhaps delivered to the community in Q1 2022. I am aware that it is a work in progress tool, and a very nice-to-have feature would be for such live presentations / slides / supporting materials to be uploaded there as soon as possible and be accessible for the community as an intermediate deliverable until the projects are finalized. Also for the sake of transparency, a user-friendly list of funded (any why not unfunded) proposals would definitely be appreciated, at least by future CAs.  \n\nSpecific part: project - specific KPIs are inserted. They include project-specific network growth, no. of industry and consulting partnerships, Whitepaper published.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1454", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3675, "q0": "This is not the first time I have read the proposal related to the DLT360 team\u2019s project, and I still appreciate the seriousness and carefulness of the elite members of your team. Each proposal begins with a thorough description of the actual context and reasons why the team's project could help solve the audience\u2019s problem. And this time, the proposal mentions the huge challenges machine and equipment manufacturers face in the context where digital transformation is eroding their OEM business model. The problem is posed, thereby providing a reasonable solution and leading to an overall quality picture is always the way to introduce the remarkable project of the DLT360 team.\nStill, I remind you not to repeat the passage about \u201cthe need to pack our activities into single projects\u201d twice in the same Impact part. Don't make your proposal more verbose.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Honestly, I've read this Feasibility part, and it doesn't seem to have changed at all in the proposals related to the overall project of DLT360. I have already commended the team's thorough preparation in other proposals, so I will not elaborate further on the main content of this part. Instead, I have a piece of advice for you. Since I see the 6th item in the detailed plan is annotated \u201cnow specific to this project\u201d, I wonder why it doesn't have anything specific to the topic of this proposal. At the very least, if you can name a few typical names in machine and equipment manufacturing that you are aiming to collaborate with in the future, perhaps this part will have a bit of a highlight. This is just my honest advice, and I hope it helps.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Each small project is part of a bigger picture, with broader goals and implications. Each proposal is a different issue but will be handled similarly and as part of the DLT360\u2019s big picture. So, I can understand why I have to read the content of this Auditability part one more time. Fortunately, you changed the indicator of the first KPI to match this proposal\u2019s theme, which proves your team's professionalism.

This proposal specifically tackles the enormous issues that machine and equipment manufacturers (also known as OEMs) confront. Through this project, the proposers will study future strategies and specific prospects for the machine and equipment manufacturing business. The concept is excellent and well connected with the problem. Also, the project's concept and constructs appear to be well-thought-out. Furthermore, a clear and well-explained description of how it works, as well as the desire to implement it, helps people understand what is going on and define how and why they want to participate, which is sensible. However, the proposer should make an attempt to quantify the impact. It may have been stated here how many industry partners and consulting firms are being targeted, as well as the next actions to be taken with them. One further recommendation would be to include more specifics here about the solutions to the probable issues that the team has previously anticipated.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "My trust in the proposal's practicality is great because it is a crucial component of a large project called DLT 360, which has been successfully funded in rounds 6 and 7. To validate what was claimed in the proposal, the proposing team submitted their credentials as well as LinkedIn profiles. Because they are the project's core members, the team is very likely to be well prepared to lead this project to success. Given the time and essential work that will be put into the project, the proposal's budget appears appropriate. The proposal would benefit from clarification on the prizes and how they would be distributed. The plan for implementing the solution is straightforward and well-described, but there are no dates associated with each stage other than \"specific key-activities - all during Q3 / 2022.\" It's hard to assess this for someone who doesn't deal with it directly, so more information would have been helpful. The plan should outline when the aforementioned tasks will be achieved. However, given the data and information provided in the proposal, it seems clear that the proposer will be diligent in their work on this proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal has a hazy timeline, which makes it difficult for the community to understand some aspects of the development process. I would have loved a little more clarity in the various milestones that tell the reader what it hopes to achieve in what period. Several KPIs are presented in a systematic and chronological manner, but it would be useful to offer more detail on each KPI here. It is possible that adding a few numbers would improve the proposal's clarity. There should also be some links to social channels incorporated so that the community can track the project's progress.
