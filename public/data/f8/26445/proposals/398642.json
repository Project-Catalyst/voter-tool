The project\u2019s expected results are in alignment with the objectives of the challenge and directly affect the Cardano ecosystem. However, they can be more specific about how their Interactive Map is presented, what the main features are and how users can easily use it without difficulties (except the sharing and filtering feature mentioned)\nThe main challenge is well foreseen, but there is a suggestion of providing possible solving steps taken to gradually address this issue. By their risk management, the community can clearly see their future vision and assess whether they are proactive in problem-solving or not\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The detailed timeline for the 3-month implementation process is well illustrated, guaranteeing the realisticity of their running process. For each month, they present very clearly the main activities under the note form. This allows the community to easily follow and evaluate the effectiveness of their plan.\nThe main costs for this project are provided based on their detailed timeline. This assures clarity in their financial plan and facilitates the community in identifying the sensibleness of their cash flow management. As they mentioned, more complete details will be provided when they are selected.\nThe team members are well described with their names, positions, relevant experiences, and past works. The community can see their potential capacity to strongly develop this project", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Some main metrics and KPIs which are used to measure the progress and the development of the product are mentioned. They have a firm definition of the project\u2019s success. This shows that they are very serious and clear about the goals.

The solution they came up with for this proposal was to design the UX/UI to be excellent to increase Cardano's visibility across the social platforms and Cardano feeds. it makes it easier for users to observe, capture information, and accept it. The main challenge this project faced was creating a design and experience that was compatible with a large number of projects. I think this is quite a challenge because it will directly affect the success or failure of the project. I quite like they optimize the personal experience by allowing users to filter projects by category to bring relevant recommendations.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I quite  like the way their roadmap is presented because it is divided into several stages and each phase will have tasks to perform, it makes it easy for me to see how the project is going,in the budget part, I can see the items that they have to pay compatible with the tasks that they to do with the roadmap that they provided. One point where I find the project feasible is that the proposal team are all qualified members and are suitable for the activities that the project has to do such as Ot\u00e1vio Lima, Founder & CEO at Cardano Feed, and has remarkable technical knowledge he has extensive knowledge of the market, digital marketing, UX/user experience... all of these will help the project to be widely known by the media and was able to attract more people, and can help the project solve the challenge that they mentioned earlier creating a well-presented design and user experience according to the number of projects in the Cardano ecosystem. thanks to the patronage of Ot\u00e1vio Lima. Felipe Barcelos is a software engineer with a wide range of knowledge who will be playing a core role in creating front-end programming with users and releasing the MVP as a beta to early adopters. or marketing assistant will be able to grasp the market and help the proposal get more reception and increase engagement. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Although the proposed team has outlined criteria to determine the progress and development of the project. I think they should provide specific indicators in each of these criteria, as it will help in measuring. It is easier and can tell if the level of development is high or low, Similar to how they measure the success of the project, they should indicate specific indicators, in addition, for the roadmap they mention the Researching UX / UI for the website I think this can also be included as one of the criteria to judge the success of the project through whether the customer is satisfied with the interface they design Because if UX/UI is effective, it will help increase the number of people sharing on social networks and more visits.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1701", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 4, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "We are happy with your comments, and even more that you really liked the presented project.
