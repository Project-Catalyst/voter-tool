In the first place it is focused on a specific community and location ie. the Salmon Nation. The attached document on the Salmon Nation provides relevant information to people like me who have no idea of the movement nor where it is actually located on the map. The proposal aims at delivering information which is a key part of the challenge but more importantly provides this information within the cultural context and understanding of the people of the Salmon Nation. The proposal has a low capital outlay given that the team is able to work from anywhere, has a strong emphasis on sustainability through the creation of a paid course, collaborations and by having substantial funds in the SAMON stakepool which is owned by SANADA and providing a roadmap to sustainability. The emphasis on collaboration with other blockchain groups and events is especially cool since it is part of the strategy to integrate them into the Cardano ecosystem. Certainly a great plan which will have a direct impact on the Cardano ecosystem. The proposal also addresses the minimum viable hub concept of the challenge and is clearly able to scale to address similar challenges in other regions. Proposers have definitely earned 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal provides a clear and implementable plan for carrying out the tasks, using a variety of methods including outreach, networking events, one-on-one support, town hall events etc. Key risks and their mitigation plans have been well discussed and the tasks required to implement the proposal have been captured. I would have however, loved to see the tasks assigned to specific months. For example hold 2 networking events in month 1, provided a minimum of 10 one-on-one sessions in month 2 etc. This break down not only facilitates implementation but also ensures that progress is properly monitored.\n\nThe project team comprises highly experienced members of the Cardano ecosystem and Catalyst community with a variety of skills relevant to the success of the proposal ie. catalyst circle team members, funded proposers, challenge setting team members, organizers of Pacific Town Hall with skills in IT, cryptocurrencies among others. There is little doubt that this team is adequately versatile to successfully implement the proposal. In addition, I believe the experience already gained on the ongoing project from fund 7 will provide the relevant motivation to see the project through to a logical conclusion.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal provides key metrics by which success will be defined and KPI which can be used to track progress. The fact that these KPIs are verifiable through their online events and channels makes it easy for the Community to monitor progress and success.

Such a breakdown will surely enhance the auditability of the proposal.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1437", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 4, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1885, "q0": "This is a proposal to provide continuing operating funds for SANADA (Salmon Nation Decentralized Alliance) as a Cardano Local Community Center. The project has a plan for self sustainability in 6 months. Both the project idea and the self sustainability commitment align perfectly with the challenge setting. \nThe project Community Hub is in Victoria, BC, Canada.  The goals of the project are to host in person or online Cardano events, onboard new participants in Project Catalyst and connect people to build blockchain solutions to local and global challenges.\nThe proposal covers all of the objectives of the proposal very well. \nKudos to Nori Nishigaya  for the perfect presentation of this proposal.\nI strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal has a monthly schedule that should be repeated every month for 6 months.

What I see as a mistake is that the team does not provide links to CVs or linkedin accounts. Given that most voters are not very familiar with the active Catalyst community, I believe it is better to present these materials in order for the voter to make a history check if he feels that need. \nI agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer gives plenty of measurable parameters for auditing the project, however there are no exact numbers to provide benchmarks against which an auditor could compare the real progress of the project. Please provide numerical expectations for the next project.\nSuccess parameters are immeasurable and the auditor could not conclude if the project is successful or not.\nThe auditing part of the proposal is all about how the auditor should evaluate the progress of the project in order to release the next funding round. There should not be a need for the auditor to make discretionary decisions, because this puts too much power in the hands of one person. Please consider that in your next proposal.\nI neither agree nor disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1417", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2631, "q0": "Biology is a large and important field for real-world blockchain applications.

Can you elaborate on the blockchain application in biology that the team is planning to implement? We were happy to see that it was an idea that was planned on paper. How will the blockchain technology that Cardano currently has in place help the project? SANADA currently has a very good community in the area, which is remarkable, you are also visionary in every aspect, I am completely convinced.

Their reach into areas perhaps not reached by other Cardano resources. As such a citical element of efforts to grow the Cardano Community. Their modest budget request and methods of being financially sustainable through other sources is both clever and perfectly in line with the Challenge.\n\n\"The target audience for SANADA is people in the Salmon Nation bioregion who are looking to use Cardano blockchain technology to solve local and regional problems. We seek to onboard new people to Project Catalyst and to help them become successful community members. A secondary audience is those that are in neighboring regions who find events happening in the Pacific timezones convenient (USA, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Pacific Islanders, etc.).\n\nTheir work is proven by the activities undertaken in their fund 6 project. \n\n\"we hosted several Pacific Town Halls covering the topics of whether Crypto, NFTs, and DAOs were the technology of the future or just technical sleight of hand, or worse, outright scams.

I think that educating local communities is really important to accelerate cardano mass adoption. In that regard, the proposal clearly articulates how it adds value to the cardano ecosystem. I have to say though that this is a fund 6 continuation of a funded project. As a previously funded project, I would like to see more progress on the marketing side of things. I see that they have a stake pool with 300k which is quite good, but I did not see a great social media following which should be one of the focuses of this kind of project. That said, I think that the idea is good and they are on the path of being self-sustained eventually by running a stake pool and maybe other businesses. Altogether, the proposal is in line with the spirit of this challenge. My only advice is to focus more on marketing, developing social media and maybe using seo as well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Since this is a continuation of a funded project, I would like to assess this proposal based on results they have achieved. I know that the proposers have a stake pool with 300k staked. This is a good result in my opinion as attracting delegators is not an easy task. However, I also wanted to see metrics such as the number of events participants and how this translated in people joining the ecosystem. I would also like to see more followers on social media such as discord members. At the time of this writing, their discord has only 21 members, which can be improved massively. They have also provided the team members skills and experiences but they can improve it by adding linkedin profiles or other resources. The proposers can also make improvements by providing a timetable to complete the work. They have provided a list of activities without precising the times for delivering the work. The budget is broken down but it is not precise in my opinion. They can also improve this area of this proposal. Altogether, I think that the proposers can make some improvements to add more chances of being funded.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of this project is not great, but it has a lot of potential. With only a few improvements, they can increase massively their chances of being funded.
