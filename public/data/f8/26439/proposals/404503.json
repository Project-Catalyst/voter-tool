The proposal tries to combine both and educate kids into blockchain and Cardano while having a race day of gopeds and a fun meetup.

The team also provides the main risk that they face, that is growing the community and they have a reasonable solution for it.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal has a detailed plan and roadmap of what will they do in what time frame by giving into 3 main phases, in the first month, 3rd month, and 6th month. The team provides detailed budget information and breaks down how they will use the proposed budget. The proposal does not give enough personal information regarding the background, skills, and experience of the team/proposer. At the very least, the proposal should be giving the full name of the proposer and it would be better if the proposal provides a LinkedIn profile of the proposer so the community can easily verify to whom their funding go.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Metrics and KPIs for success are clearly defined and measurable by the number of gopeds in service, the average number of meeting attendance, number of Cardano wallets created, Twitter followers, and youtube subscribers.

The solution that the proposer has in mind is to create an youth organization that will captivate kids with Go-Ped racing and parallel to that will educate them about blockchain, finance and Cardano.\nThe proposer already has experience with Go-Ped and kids and wants to extend the group due to demand. The proposer is located in the Bay Area, Silicon Valley and this will be the place for the club.\nTotal funds requested exceed 5% of the challenge funding and by the rules set in the challenge, the CAs should favor other the assessments before this. Also, this is not a hub with main occupation Cardano, this mainly a Go-Ped club and in between Cardano.

The plan is that the project will be fully operational in 6 months with some pilot events in between. The plan is not task oriented and it is not detailed. The plan does not provide any KPIs.\nThe budget of the proposal is detailed. It is important to point out that the proposer will assemble the Go-Peds himself and will not take any payment for that. \nThe project is not for profit and the funding, will not charge for the events and the funding will last for one year.\nThis is a single proposer project but the proposer states that he has a core group of other goped mechanics.

This challenge asks more than that, so my rating will also take that into account. That said, I like the idea of this proposal as it targets kids, and allying fun and education. Basically the proposers want to organize go ped events and teach blockchain and cardano to kids at the same time. I think that the proposal identifies a problem within the challenge, which is to educate kids about cardano. However, this proposal is too focused on the go ped and not too much on the education material. I suggest to the proposers to add more content on the education such as the content that they will provide and the means to deliver them. Aside from that, goal of this proposal align with the outlined challenge settings.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "One thing that is really important for proposals is trust. I suggest to the proposers to build trust by adding links to linkedin profiles or resources that can confirm their skills and experiences.

The proposers have also provided a roadmap and timetable to complete the work. They also included a detailed  plan to achieve their goal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer has provided a detailed roadmap and a timetable to complete the work. In regards to the KPIs, I expected more from the proposal. The only metrics provided by the proposer is the number of social media followers.

First and foremost, the requested funds of this proposal exceed 5% of the total budget for this challenge. Second of all, I think kids are not considered to be MVHs (minimum-viable hubs) because we can foster a kid hub rapidly and have an instant impact. Furthermore, kids can have other opportunities to learn about Cardano if this project does not exist. However, if we do not consider this proposal in this challenge scale but the long run, educating kids about cryptocurrency does scale up future community hubs and create advancement for Cardano.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I think the experience of the team provided in this proposal is not enough to persuade me about the team's success. There should be more introduction into the team's experience on education, technology, and community involvement. For the project to succeed, the team needs to come up with a better plan on attracting kids - targeted customers - to this program. There are a lot of parents who are still worried about their own involvement in cryptocurrency. It will be difficult to persuade kids if we can not persuade the parents. My suggestion is that the team should pay attention to the parents' side and have a plan to attract them to the project.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I love the passion that the presenter puts into this proposal. I have a detailed and informative solution description, budget breakdown, and timeline of operation. All of the mentioned aspects are explained clearly and reasonably.

How do you see the development of this program in the next 10 or 20 years?
