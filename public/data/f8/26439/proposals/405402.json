With 24,000 members in 100 locations, Cardano benefits from visibility within the Geneva ecosystem. Proposals have a big impact on the challenge.

It also focuses on delivering information to people who would not otherwise have the access and raising awareness of Cardano in Geneva by exploring an innovative collaboration model to set up Cardano community hubs, within an established networks of entrepreneurial hubs through Impact Hub Geneva. Impact Hub Geneva is a part of the Impact Hub network, which is a network of impact-driven entrepreneurial communities, hosting over 24,000 people and organisations driving change and made up of over 100 communities in 60 countries. The proposal is excellent and will have a formidable impact on the Cardano ecosystem given the kind of reach the impact hub network gives to Cardano and blockchain. Moreover, it will provide the opportunity to scale the collaboration between Cardano and the Impact Network hub across the globe, particularly in markets where Cardano is under-represented. Successful implementation could also lead to collaboration with impact finance and UN organisations that could provide resources to support the hub going forward. This proposal is an excellent example of how collaboration can lead to exponential expansion and growth for the Cardano ecosystem while providing the means to fund new ideas and contribute to attaining the SDGs.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal is aimed at obtaining the funding to pilot a wider partnership with Impact Hub Geneva through its program known as Accelerate2030 which supports entrepreneurs from developing and emerging markets to scale their solutions for the SDGs. A concise implementable plan has been provided with a clear roadmap for implementation over a six month period ie. May to October 2022 which covers a number of activities including selection of 5 companies which use blockchain technology in their business to showcase their solutions at an upcoming event among other activities. A detailed budget has also been provided with a breakdown into identifiable budgeted tasks.\n\nProfiles of the 5 member team are provided and though new to the Cardano community, they indicate that they are already in contact with Cardano Foundation and various catalyst communities such as Cardano4Climate, SustainableADA and the Catalyst school. The team has managed the Accelerate2030 since 2016. This is a program hosted by the Geneva Impact Hub and during which Cardano will be showcased to the network of hubs. The team also has experience in impact management and reporting, having managed complex logframes with partners in development agencies. This appears to be a solid team for the job.\nKey risks and challenges to be expected are identified together with mitigation measures that will be put in place.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Key metrics identified for purposes of auditing success of the proposal include number of companies reached through the sourcing campaign, number of Geneva ecosystem stakeholders participating in the event among others. These are clear and measurable and will be able to determine the success of the pilot stage of this proposal.  Proposers intend to set up a plan to track progress based on the project plan and KPIs however, this information will only be shared with the Community in a final report at the end of the funding. This may not provide the Community with adequate information to be able to measure the activities and success of the project while it is ongoing. Proposers may want to improve on how they intend to communicate with the Cardano community during the lifetime of the project.

The Cardano ecosystem is developed sustainably, methodically, and is academically proven. If the two work together effectively, the community will thrive and grow together. Can the project state which areas Cardano can have practical applications in Geneva? Let's demonstrate this in a specific array. This will also solve the challenge mentioned by the project, Geneva is a traditional corporation, but will always innovate to take the lead. And who knows, the solutions on Cardano will become a traditional partner of Geneva. As for companies, their understanding of blockchain is not much, but if you prove useful value, they are ready to accept, handle small things convincingly, for example: Blockchain application for product supply chain management, NFT in product identification, staff attendance management\u2026 I strongly support the project.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project has a good plan, the roadmap is quite suitable. In particular, the projects that allocate resources and approach the first companies are very good, I find very positive.

Being presented to a huge community and having the opportunity to present solutions to their problem in BB meeting is amazing. Of course, as mentioned in the risk management, we do not know how many of these companies and entrepreneurs are aware of Cardano community and, therefore, we cannot measure how this presentation is going to be new. However, still, there are lots of concerns and miss conceptions around blockchain, since there are lots of schemes flourishing, and that might be a good opportunity to change that image.\n\nMaybe, since you\u2019ve stated that Geneva has a very traditional community, maybe addressing these schemes concerns and pointing out all the solutions and security would allow them to change their view.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan is well written and the timetable seems fair. My suggestion here is about the budget \u2013 I would appreciate if it is possible to breakdown a little bit, giving more information in these specific points. Another consideration is about the \u2018contribution  to travel and accommodation costs\u2019. Since you don\u2019t know how many members the company has and where they live, this cost is unknown, therefore it could elevate a lot this 8K USD (and I have no clue how much you\u2019ve separated to this cost and to the \u2018supporting companies [\u2026])\n\nIn feasibility part, the first (1) point: You said that you\u2019re going to select a mix of Cardano and Accelerate2030 companies which uses blockchain solutions. In the (a) observation you said \u2018Define with Cardano\u2019. What do you mean by it? Are you contacting some Cardano members to help you to select these companies? How is going to be the selection\u2019s criteria (activity, profit, etc.). It would be good to know how the decisions are going to be made\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In this part you said \u2018we will set up a plan to track the progress based on the project plan and KPIs outlined here.\u2019.

The problem described in the proposal is fitting into the challenge. A Cardano community in Geneva is a great move to increase awareness of the blockchain to people who are not aware.

However, for the sake of future proposals, information under budget such as \u201coutreach campaign, application process, screening selection process, engage entrepreneurs\u201d etc should have their specific individual amounts attached to them, I don\u2019t really like the way they have been boxed with one amount. However, I think that the budget is not too much and hence it aligns or adheres to MVH principle of this challenge.\nI like the fact that there is a well described and comprehensible plan for the project\u2019s execution.
