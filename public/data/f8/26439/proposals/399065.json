This is a group, called Cardano Baltic Hub, that will create a startup hub in Tallinn, Estonia. The objective is that workshops about our blockchain are promoted there, that a networking process is carried out between the local business community, that events take place that present to lay people what Cardano is and what blockchain is, as well as events with more advanced themes. that aim to make local companies adopt the technologies of our ecosystem. According to the proponents, they have already had contact with the local community, but it is necessary to increase the frequency and investment in these meetings, creating a permanent hub, so that the presentation of our blockchain can be strong and constant enough for startups and companies conventional companies choose to invest and build in Cardano. They also claim that other blockchains such as Ethereum and Solara are already being adopted for practical use, which creates the need for Cardano to be very well publicized and presented, as these entrepreneurs are likely not aware of the differentials and advantages that our blockchain has to offer. Therefore, I believe that the project has a lot of future and it makes a lot of sense to finance it, because a) we would not be starting from scratch. The proponents have already started this work, but it needs to be intensified so that the desired results are obtained b) from what we can see in the description of the proposal, local entrepreneurs are already open to the possibility of working with blockchain, but they still do not know Cardano c) the proponents already have a networking base, as I understand it, which can and should be amplified and strengthened. The only issue I found in the impact part of this proposal was: proponents should better specify the events they intend to promote. How often will they happen? What topics will be covered, and in what order? How will ordinary people and business people be captivated by participating in the meetings? How will they ensure that entrepreneurs understand the benefits of Cardano compared to the blockchains they are already embracing? I think it would be critical for them to have enumerated what topics they will cover, from introduction to blockchain to more advanced and specific subjects (eg use cases). If they had done that, the visualization of what is about to happen would be much more solid. In addition to the questions I raised, it would also be great if we knew who would be presenting the workshops and the estimated duration of each. Although such details are absent, I truly believe that the proposal has everything to do with what we are looking for and we should consider funding it. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is ok, having good points and some things to improve. Starting with the analysis of the script: there is indeed a timeline that allows us to visualize which activities would have to be carried out in which periods of time, so that the final result could be achieved. However, the explanations are superficial, the time division adopted by the proponents is quite extensive. Instead of reporting what would happen in the first 3 months, I think it would be better if they had told you what activities are planned for each specific month. As explained to us, we do not know if, for example, it would be necessary for an activity to be completed for another to be started or if parallel activities could take place. We don't know exactly how long each of these activities would take to start and finish. Some activities could be better detailed, I will give two examples to clarify my point of view. When bidders say \u201cConnect with 5 startups and at least 2 VCs in the first three months\u201d; How would these connections be made? Do they already have some startup options in mind that they plan to date? What would \u201cVCs\u201d be? In the part of \u201cHold weekly events, growing to more than 20 people per event\u201d: as I mentioned in impact, what topics would be covered in each meeting? How would about 20 people be mobilized to participate in these moments? Some activities do not require further elaboration, but others would be better contemplated if small explanations were attached. Now let's analyze the requested budget. I thought this part is great, the total amount is divided into a few parts and each of them has its own explanations. For example, in relation to the salary of the community manager, we know the total amount paid and also how many hours he would dedicate to the project, so we are also informed of the value of his work hour. As in this case, the other parts of the funding are very well detailed, so I have no criticisms to make in relation to that. However, the team presentation was the part that left a lot to be desired in my opinion. I would think it would be more appropriate for them to already present the proposal with a defined manager, however, since they do not yet have this person, the selection process they would go through to be hired could be described. What kind of profile are you looking for? It would take someone very specialized in Cardano, how will they find this person in the locality? When proponents state that \u201cThere is no need for more people at the moment as we already have connections in the area who would be interested in helping and co-organizing events\u201d, it would be very important for them to spell out what those connections are. Who are these people? How are they proposing to help the project? What are your previous works? Nor is direct information provided about the bidders themselves, what we know about them is what is said in \u201cSummarize your relevant experience\u201d; however, it is not specified who did what, their full names, and a very organized history is not given about each one individually. Therefore, I think the team presentation part and also the script should be improved. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability proposed for tracking progress is good, but mostly numerical. We know that to measure progress, indicators such as \u201cNumber of open wallets / Number of long-term holders / Number of wallets that have staked their ADA\u201d and so on would be used; and that it would also be a goal that at least 3 startups adopt Cardano in their actions. However, I have two suggestions to make. First, in addition to knowing the goals for that period of time, it would also be important that we had the means to audit the tasks that were being carried out to achieve these goals. In this sense, I think that the proponents should prepare weekly reports with updates on the activities that were developed in that period of time, it would be important that they also include in these documents the numbers that they intend to monitor. This information should reach the Cardano community in some way, for example, the documents could be posted in the discord or telegram groups we have. I think discord would be best, as the proponents claim that channels will be created so that members of the locality where they will work can stay connected. Regarding the final results, the proponents suggest a highly explored scenario, which goes beyond numbers, but also has more qualitative goals to be achieved, such as opening new hubs in nearby locations. In my view, it would be necessary for them to take a look at all this information, and explore the part of startups adopting Cardano, because I feel that this is the root of the issue, and after they had all the information collected and organized, they would pass it on to the community. This can be done through a more extensive report, or also via a video call, during or after a Town Hall. If it is a report, it would be interesting to include graphical representations of the results, so that there are not so many texts and it is not so tiring for us in the community to read everything. In reality, how to bring this information to light is up to the team, I just want a bridge to be established between them and the Cardano community. I like the auditability here, I think the proponents gave due importance to this part of the proposal. However, it remains to be further clarified how all members of our ecosystem will be aware of all updates and final information. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 8, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal aims to start a Cardano Hub in the city of Talinn, by renting a space in a co-working centre and organise events in order to attract more talent and VCs to the Cardano/Catalyst community and spread the word about Cardano in general.

What kind of people is the hub looking to attract? Does the person delivering the speeches (one of the proposers) have the necessary knowledge to talk about those topics?\nThe budget is sufficiently broken down, and if looking through their linked marketplace, one can eventually find the proposers in the about section and go through their LinkedIn profiles, and for the most part, they seem capable of handling the project.

I think that a startup joining the catalyst project is a great addition to the cardano ecosystem. They plan to organize workshops that will introduce cardano to the community. Based on these facts, I consider that this proposal is in the scope of this challenge. If they can execute this properly, it can add value to the cardano ecosystem because it can bring startups and entrepreneurs who can join the army of cardano builders. However, I recommend to the proposer to better describe the relation of this proposal and artano.

However the proposers have done a good job including a timetable of 3 months 6 months and 12 months worth of goals. I think that these goals are achievable but I would recommend to the proposer to add their user acquisition strategy. In fact I suggest to the proposer a marketing strategy that will allow them to attract users as well as building a loyal following. As a digital marketer, I advocate projects, to acknowledge the importance of defining a marketing strategy. Other than that, I suggest to the proposer to add information about the team even though I can assume that some of the artano team will work on the project. There are definitely improvements to be made on this proposal to build confidence on its successful implementation.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I think that the proposal can be audited from the information included by the proposer. They have included a roadmap with milestones to achieve their set goals. Furthermore, the metrics/ KPIs are strong too. I think that the number of people opening a wallet and staking is a pretty good measure of success of the proposal. Of course, they have listed other metrics but these are the basics and strongest in my opinion. Altogether, I think the proposers have done a great job on the auditability of the project.
