However, I am not convinced it fits the campaign. I think the project would benefit from a more focused outlook, maybe engaging a specific location and then scaling to other locations.\nThe challenge mentioned is very relevant, as it is not easy to engage people when it comes to environmental issues, but from the proposal alone I am not sure how they will mitigate this risk.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The roadmap presented seems a bit risky, as there are many activities going on in each month, but as the team members have previous experience with projects, it might be feasible. I like how they are already connecting with other hubs to execute the project, and I think it has the potential of having a bit impact on sustainability in the Cardano community. By increasing education on this topic, maybe new proposals could come up.\nThe budget seems a bit incomplete, as it seems to consider mainly the team's payments, but it has little mention to costs that go beyond personnel.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The KPIs are very specific and measurable and consider the many fronts of the project.

Although the proposer has a clear understanding of the challenge, it doesn't quite address the challenge well with the proposed solution. By educating public about the algae  token and how algae is served as carbon neutral energy source , it doesn't directly engage with the community hubs to drive adoption of Cardano.
