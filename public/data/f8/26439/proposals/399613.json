I do think that you could keep with this co-working (there are some people which likes the in-loco work and those who need it), however I really think that this might not be the right focus.\n\nI\u2019ve seen that you\u2019re planning the have the capacity to attend 10 students simultaneously, therefore this is not scalable. Of course if you invest in the online part of the idea (spreading the materials generated) it would gain volume \u2013 however you would have to change the core of  the proposal.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The first thing that caught my attention is the budget crossing with the timetable. You\u2019re asking the value of a 3 months rental, however you will rent during the 3-6 months and the labs will work during the 6-12 months, this doesn\u2019t fit.\n\nAnother point that should be more detailed is the alternative resources, since you\u2019re asking the money for just 3 months, maybe adding a more detailed resource would help us to verify the validity and longevity of this proposal. Since you\u2019re planning to open a co-working, it always includes a tax to use it \u2013 adding this information is important.\n\nAnother aspect is that you didn\u2019t include other costs associated with a physical place like taxes, light, cleaner, water, fire protection, security, etc. These costs may not be that cheap in Kampala and it can affect the whole proposal.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Creating a platform to share information regarding this proposal monthly would be very helpful to follow the evolution of it. These could be any type of info \u2013 hiring, finished content, rental, etc. This would allow you to tackle each part of the project (0-3, 3-6, etc), having a ways to share every progress\n\nAnother KPI that could be added is the # of actual projects running in Kampala.\n\nI do think that this \u2018auditability\u2019 part is a little bit confusing. If you take some time to reorganize your ideas and and focusing in answer simpler questions adding them in blocks together would facilitate for us to read it all (block of all the Key Performance Indicator you want to measure, the metrics, the shareable and the place to do it, etc.). I\u2019m sure that organizing in these blocks will help you to make everything clearer.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_25", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5816, "q0": "In line with the Challenge, this is a minimum viable hub for Kampala, Uganda. No frills, no fancy things, just basics in place and good ol\u2019 entrepreneurial spirit as the secret sauce. The proposal delivers exactly what is needed on the ground level so that the community can drive adoption and awareness, communicating in both virtual and physical spaces.\n\nAccording to the proposers, emphasis is on education and enabling entrepreneurs to collaborate and to solve local problems using Cardano. This builds on an existing meetup group and the idea is to increase the numbers from 30 to 100 members. Once the computer lab and co-working space is set up, the proposers wish to form partnerships with 5-10 student associations. They wish to reach 50 learners a year and provide the basics of Linux/Haskell for local developers. Furthermore they are ready to lobby towards a local exchange to get ADA listed in Uganda. Lots of leg work is required but that\u2019s what entrepreneurs are good at. Respect.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It\u2019s a solid, well-written, succinct yet thorough plan ready to be implemented. The budget is very detailed and shows exactly what is needed.\n\nOne of the proposers, Percy, gives support from afar, while the other one, Jerry, works as the boots on the ground. The proposal would be even stronger if there were a couple more names mentioned here. But, to be fair, the team is planning to grow in numbers and it\u2019s all in the plan.\n\nThe risks are discussed openly and mitigation plans are in place. They are aiming to change people\u2019s perception of all crypto being a scam. They are ready for patching infrastructure interruptions with a secondary ISP if needed. \u201cIn the event our learning lab generates more interest than expected, we will add a third table for users to bring their own laptops.\u201d I love pragmatism.\n\nThis proposal ticks most of the boxes: It drives adoption and awareness at the ground level, empowers people to change their lives and keeps with the principle of minimum viable hub, The team has a clear understanding of their target audience and they account for local needs and infrastructure concerns. Projections for reach / onboarded members are well laid out in the requested 3/6/12 month intervals. Moreover, there is some visioning two years ahead, hinting that there is also a financial sustainability model in the making (e.g. via consulting services).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The only caveat to point out is that the team first says they refrain from giving financial advice and a few paragraphs later talks about \u201cconvincing Ugandan Cryptocurrency Traders to sell their current crypto holdings and buy ADA for staking\u201d. That\u2019s probably something you don\u2019t need to do. Let the people figure it out on their own.\n\nApart from that, everything is very nicely laid out in a palatable form. The set goals are realistic and the budget makes sense. The team seems to be very collaborative and will surely keep the community updated of their progress and results. It is very easy to see how the $10K will be used and what will be achieved with it.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_289", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6597, "q0": "The idea behind this project is brilliant as it benefits the uganda community as well as the cardano ecosystem. The course they have in mind will have a great utility as students should be able to run their own stake pools which will help them sustain themselves as well as participate in the cardano decentralization. Force is to recognize that this proposal is in the scope of the challenge and that it will add value to the cardano ecosystem. I think that with a good execution, this project can go a long way.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I have high confidence in the feasibility of this project because the proposers have provided all the required information. The budget is broken down into items and it seems reasonable. Furthermore, the team sounds knowledgeable according to their linkedin profiles. This is great as most Africans lack opportunities which can be brought by blockchain technology. I think that this proposal is well thought and designed to meet the needs of the Uganda local community. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal can be audited based on the information included by the proposer. They have provided a roadmap with milestones and a timeframe for achievement. The metrics/KPIs are also strong and will enable the tracking of the progress of the proposal. Altogether, I think that this project is great as it tackles 2 issues which are the education and income for the Uganda local community.

They also want to provide an incubation space to foster creation off Dapp and Defi start-up companies solving local problems. This will add value to the Cardano system as it grows the community and get companies exposed to modern technological solutions to their problems.\nI am very impressed with the whole proposal and can see that this is not their first attempt. Their KPI's are in line with that of the Challenge as it forms part of bringing in new talent into the ecosystem by growing their current community, and they want to have Cardano to be listed on their local exchange app.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is sufficient evidence that this team will be able to deliver on this proposal. They are both technically educated and equipped and I believe have the necessary experience to make this a success. They are requesting only USD 10 000 which is only 2% of the total challenge budget and in line with the preferred percentage. Just under half of the budget goes towards furniture and setup cost. there after it is monthly rent, internet, advertising and hiring of staff. I believe they are trying to focus on being a MVH. They already have an existing Kampala meetup group, and having a physical location will increase their membership. I am also impressed that they want to start by educating the members that not all things crypto is a scam. I have seen in my own experience when trying to explain the Cardano eco system, that people immediately think \"scam\". This mean they will begin by gaining trust and then build on that and remove the social bias that all things crypto is a scam. They have set out a detailed road map with goals broken down in 3 months each. This proposal could serve as a template and guideline for future proposals.  I was very impressed with the detail and information given. It was easy to read and understand. Well done.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer has provided a detailed roadmap with 3 months intervals and key points on how success will be measured. They are very clear and precise and the proposal is easy to read and understand. They have set out what success for them will look like. An important aspect is that they also mention that they would like to become self funded through stake pool earning rewards and other ventures. Their KPI's are in line with that of the challenge as they aim to grow the Cardano Ecosystem and their members from 30 to 100 in a year.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_795", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Start a community hub in Kampala with emphasis on education and enabling entrepreneurs collaborate to solve local problems using Cardano.", "experience": "IT & software professionals based in Uganda and Canada with experience running businesses and facilitating technical training in Uganda."}
