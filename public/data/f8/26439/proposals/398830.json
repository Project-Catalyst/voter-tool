First, the proposer should do research on the Kandy community's degree of blockchain understanding. If there is a lack of awareness of blockchain, then building blockchain events should take precedence over creating Cardano ecosystem events. Second, why Jaffna rather than another city? What if the Kandy community is indifferent about Cardano? Lastly, the proposer was ADA holder in Circle V3, VCA and CA work in previous funds does not really mean he is competent in delivering and sharing content in such topic. \n\nOverall, more information should be delivered to better assess project's impact.\u00a0", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The plan outlines the actions that will take place during the next three months. The money's usage is clearly indicated in terms of how it will be used. \n\nA marketing plan to recruit participants, on the other hand, should be outlined. Furthermore, I believe the proposer should predict further issues that may arise and how to cope with them. What if, for example, people decline to join the core group and contribute ideas? What if members simply attend the meetups to be rewarded rather than actually contribute to the hub? What if the number of attendees drops after one month and they prefer online meetings, resulting in a redundancy in rental costs? \n\nOverall, there may be several obstacles that might\u00a0hinder project implementation.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The information on how the proposer intends to measure progress is unclear and difficult to understand. The proposer should define clear success metrics/KPIs (how many core members, sub members are successful?) and outline a detailed mechanism for tracking performance.

They plan to organize physical meetups as well as local meetups. I think that this is a good idea and if well executed, will add value to the cardano ecosystem. Furthermore the proposers have included key metrics that are in line with the challenge settings. However, the proposers can improve the proposal in order to increase their chances of being funded. I suggest to the proposer to add more metrics regarding the online meetups and how they intend to build a social media following. In the long run, this will help scale and selfstain the proposal.

They have included the links of the linkedin profiles of the team members. This is a good thing as it increases the confidence in the execution of the project. They also have added a budget breakdown which can be improved by bringing more precisions. For example the cost of meetups in 3 months and the social media campaigns costs can be broken down further. I also recommend to the proposers to be more specific on the type of content they intend to deliver. This will ensure that they can be more precise on the audience they should target. Altogether, I think that this proposal is feasible although there is room for improvements.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I think that this proposal is auditable because the proposer has provided the necessary information.

I recommend to the proposer to provide a roadmap of 3 , 6 and 12 months worth of activities to gather more information as 3 month is a really small window of time to operate.
