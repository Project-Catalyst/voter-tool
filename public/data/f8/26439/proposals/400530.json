We have already had our first networking event in Cuenca, Ecuador ahead of schedule and have planned out our events in Ecuador for the next year. We have partnered with Ayllu who has been producing the course we are advertising in our events.\nFeasibility:\nA very small amount of money goes a long way in the areas of South America in which our operation resides. In regards to our linkedIn accounts, it is true we are young, many of us have finished college in the past couple of years. In that time though, we have accomplished much and expanded our skills quite a lot. We haven\u2019t used our linkedIn accounts much since college because most of us have been working steady jobs since, again, we graduated only a short time ago.\nAuditability:\nWe would like this to be taken down as we agree and will implement these changes to our project. We already take lots of photos of our events for both our website as well as for proof of execution. We will now also record and submit documentation that proves our events are taking place as the commenter suggests."}, {"q0": "I think that this proposal is really interesting and is in line with the spirit of this challenge. The proposers want to expose Latam students to the catalyst program in order to create the ultimate solutions for their countries, by submitting proposals.

Although the proposer has included some good information, such as the team members linkedin profiles, they didn\u2019t include a timetable to complete the work. Furthermore I\u2019m not really convinced about the budget breakdown. I think that the proposer should improve the budget breakdown by grouping items together to make it more readable. In addition to that, I suggest to the proposer to create a plan that will outline all the steps needed to achieve the goals. As the proposal stays right now there is no detailed plan of execution. Altogether, I think that the proposal can be improved by working on the feasibility.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This proposal doesn\u2019t include a roadmap, which is huge for the auditability.

Furthermore, I suggest to the proposers to add stronger metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal. I think that the proposer should set some expectations in regards to the metrics. Altogether, I think that this proposal has the potential to have a good impact, but it needs improvements on the feasibility and auditability departements.
