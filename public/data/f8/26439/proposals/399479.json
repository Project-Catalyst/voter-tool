We have seen incoming activity from other blockchains such as ETH, SOL and DOT, therefore, on-boarding new people to the Cardano Ecosystem is imperative! The general consensus, currently, among the present Cardano population that this on-boarding should including a welcoming environment and education on this ecosystem.  Nonetheless, the proposal left their specific method of accomplishing this goal in a vague and scant one sentence response.  In addition, the proposed solution and the discussion of relevant experience was diminished and brief.  The ability to discuss solutions and plans for a proposal is ideal.  It is beneficial to have a detailed strategy and also to discuss the experience that each member brings to the team, as it may illicit trust for the team and the project.  Currently, there is no clear plan on how this project will be executed who will be involved. When asked \"What does success look like for this team?\" A one word answer was given, \"Spaces\".  Furthermore, the breakdown for how and for what will the funds be used is confusing.  They state that \"60%\" of the funds are to be used in \"Spaces\", however, spaces is a free service to use.  Please clarify.   Supporting projects that grow the Cardano Community is critical and planning for this endeavor should be done with careful execution to ensure success.  Please consider spending more time on the process of execution, team coordination and funds that will distributed for this project.  It is a great community need that cannot be taken lightly.

It would be ideal for the Cardano Community to have a solid structure for on-boarding Cardano new comers.  The proposal submits a website that looks fragmented, with minimal information on the spaces such as names and what time it is held.  It would be ideal to discuss each Community Space and the content that is valuable to a newcomer to Cardano and the community as a whole.  Education is critical to ensure success for any new person learning an ecosystem.  Showing how your platform actually accomplishes this goal would be helpful to understand the value it would bring to the community.  It is with great interest that this information to improve the proposal for its success.  Ensuring that the team has the necessary experience, credentials and involvement in the community will help to strengthen the proposal.  Having a detailed benchmark of the how the funds will be distributed and spend for the benefit of the community will also go a step further to help solidify the project with fiscal responsibility.

It would be ideal for the team to come up with metrics which include a poll with all the new members who use their services at the inception of using their services and then a follow up with those members at one month or 3 month time frame.  This will allow the team to find information which may help to support any feedback from users/members that the services are helpful to newcomers.  Additionally, this poll or survey may also help with any additional suggestions or ideas that these members may have to improve the project.  There are many online survey tools that are free-to-use.

As you can see, the issue is well-defined and well-explained. Moreover, while the solution is obvious, it has yet to have a long-term impact on the Cardano environment. The concept of opening a coffee shop to draw the community is intriguing, however the author has not explained who the target consumer is or how the events will be organized.
