So the solution was to exhibit at BC EXPO, the largest business event in JP, and introduce Cardano to Japan's Fortune 500 and public institutions. The idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal is great, displaying a Cardano booth at the EXPO will help raise awareness about Cardano, the main audience being entrepreneurs who have registered their company and personal names. I totally agree with the solution given, creating a knowledge booth about Cardano will encourage public companies to consider adopting blockchain and other blockchain company will consider switching to Cardano from other chains like Ethereum. This proposal shows a legitimate problem and then provides an idea of \u200b\u200ba valid solution.\nThis proposal, instead of stating challenges and risks, provides very clear KPIs. And I think the main challenges in this proposal are how to achieve the target set by the KPI, how to attract interested visitors to this exhibition booth.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is a Process that lays out the details of the actions to be taken, which I find reasonable. The proposal provided a 3-month roadmap with a detailed plan and very specific timelines that made it easy for the community to track the progress of the project.\nThe $80,000 required budget is also detailed. As a large portion of the budget is allocated for the construction of the pavilion, it is difficult to determine if the values \u200b\u200bare reasonable since they are highly dependent on the local context. The project team are members of EXPO, the team has prepared a good description of the skills and experience of the members. This can be verified in the website https://expo-dow.com/1279/ which the proposal provides. In my opinion the proponents have expertise and experience in handling large projects and should be able to successfully handle this project. Given the experience of the team and the plan presented, I believe it is very likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As far as testability goes, the team has achieved excellent results. There is a clear explanation of the milestones, showing 5 milestones with brief descriptions, so that the community is aware of both what will happen and when. In addition, the reference to a website maintained by the Expo stake team enhances the testability of the proposal. The success metrics are well defined, which shows the level of motivation and confidence the team has. In addition, the proposed team has experience in organizing exhibitions through two previous grants from fund 6 (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/367080 ) and fund 7 (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/367080 ) http://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/381820 ).

Because it prevents it from generating successful use cases in \"the real world\" of business, it intends to address this situation by participating in a BlockChain Expo where large companies from different sectors participate. While there is a clear alignment with Cardano I do not find a direct relationship with the challenge setting, the concept of minimal-viable hub was not addressed, there is no indication of the intention to form a hub, however, I can agree that there is an indirect alignment since there is a possibility that the contacts that are generated to follow up end up being ADA holders and having an active participation in the ecosystem. So I have decided to assign a score of 4. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team submitted the necessary references describing the skills and experience needed to execute this proposal, many of the members are stake pool operators which increases my confidence in the competencies of the team. Additionally this proposal has already been approved and funds have been allocated to them in past challenges and they have successfully executed in previous Expo. Regarding the budget 40% is allocated to structure and decoration issues which is difficult to evaluate if it is appropriate or not as it depends largely on the context, however, all the items included are reasonable to me and allow to know the reasoning of the team behind the requested amount. The implementation plan is simple and well explained, at the time of implementation of this proposal it would already be the third time so I would understand that the difficulties encountered in the first two will be taken into account. I have a couple of concerns regarding this proposal, the first concern is that the amount requested by the team is well above the challenge setting which places a cap of 5% which is around $25,000. The second is that after reviewing the Dashboard for tracking the funded proposals there is no progress in the proposal funded in fund 6, the last update was in December since in January the KPI requirement was not submitted, from this I have one more doubt, it is assumed that the event for which the proposal in fund 6 was funded occurred in October 2021, then it would not be clear to me why it has not yet been reported as completed. Surely there is an explanation for this that I am not seeing but ultimately I think the team should have addressed these issues within the proposal description. So based on my previous analysis I cannot agree or disagree from a feasibility standpoint. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The explanation of the key milestones is clear, with clearly defined dates. All milestones have a short and concise description that allows me to understand what the steps would be in broad strokes. The KPIs presented are quite concrete and appropriate, but I have not been able to find an update on them and considering that the first Catalyst funded event ends in October 2021 (as explained in your proposal) it would have been great to see the impact and lessons learned. I recommend the team to update the community with this information as it is possible that events like this will happen in other parts of the world and what better way to approach it than with the experiences you have.

About 10 explainers will meet the visitors and explain the Cardano blockchain in order for the visitors to understand Cardano on the spot.\nThe goal is rising awareness for the Cardano blockchain and drive adoption. \nThis challenge is hardly the place for such proposal in my opinion.
