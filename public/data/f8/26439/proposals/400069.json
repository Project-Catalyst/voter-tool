There is an existing infrastructure of hubs for scale", "f6_no_assessments": 3, "f6_rating": 3.5555555555555554, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"q0": "The proposal is very confusing, we are told that all existing hubs would be brought together so that together they can more effectively boost the popularization of the Cardano ecosystem. However, it is not explained how this connection process between the hubs would be, what would happen after they were connected, who would command which activities in favor of the expansion of our blockchain. My perception is that this proposal seems to be an idea at an early stage, which could be very promising, but in the way it is described, little is known about what the proposer plans to develop. This challenge aims to popularize the Cardano ecosystem for a specific community; at the end of reading the proposal, we are told that these hubs would come from Kenya. In this case, that would be the target community. However, it is not described what would happen or even how future activities would respect and dialogue with the specific characteristics of this audience, therefore, the objectives of the challenge are very uncertain. In terms of barriers, the proponent cites several problems to be overcome: \u201clack of genuine software, inadequate computer in the classroom, low speed internet, lack of motivation on the teacher and student side to use ICT, lack of of adequate training, unavailability of the latest ICT equipment, lack of specialized technical personnel, poor administrative support\u201d. But how will this all be resolved? He points out the problems, but not the solutions. In general, the launch of the idea is done in a very confusing, uncertain way, not giving confidence in the impact that can be generated. \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "There is a basic roadmap in this proposal. We know superficially that some activities would need to be developed: \u201clobby the department responsible for the hubs to mobilize hubs and execute programs\u201d. But how will this all be built? The proponent would need to explain in detail what activities would lead to the development of these objectives. The time division is adequate as the bidder breaks down what would happen each month. From the way the project development process is presented to us, it is not possible to understand how these activities would gradually be built, how phases would be developed, in short, how the gradual process of carrying out the project would be. All we have is an overview of the process. The budget is also not well explained, only 1500 dollars are requested, but when explaining the project's expenses, parts are mentioned that add up to much more than that. We know that the budget would be divided into such parts, as: \u201cOne exhibition of Cardano and Catalyst (Cardano day)\u201d. What would that show look like? What would be shown? How would the target audience be attracted? Because that would cost 2 thousand dollars (a single part is already over the requested budget, I think there was a confusion here). All parts needed to be better explained and detailed, so that we had an accurate understanding of the need for such investments. And finally, speaking of the team, this is the best part of feasibility, because basic data about those involved are informed, such as: their full names, professional areas, examples of previous work, how their relationship with the ecosystem is Cardano (as in the example of Angela who knows Plutus) and their linkedin profiles, where we can see in practice what jobs they have done before. I suggest that the bidder review the feasibility, increasing the detail in the roadmap portion and clarifying the expense issue, only the team presentation is adequate. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The indicators for monitoring the process chosen by the proponent are the expected achievements each month. I think this part was quite adequate, as it is enough for the team to maintain some kind of contact with the Cardano community to inform if these goals have been achieved. It would also be interesting for them to report not only the partial results, but also how their work routines were in the respective months. Were there problems, was something missing? But in general, I liked the auditability of the progress, I think that part of the proposal is well specified. Now regarding the final success, basically nothing is said, just that they aim to reach 30 hubs in Kenya. Okay, we know from impact that this is the goal. But how could we monitor if all hubs were actually reached? Would a list be made of the connected hubs, of the activities they would be developing? Would an analysis be made of how this project has impacted the Cardano community from Kenya in practice? Unfortunately, once again the information is confusing and superficial. I do not agree that this proposal is easily auditable in terms of the final results, as the information given to us is very abstract, very broad. I will give it 3 stars because one part is adequate (process) and the other is inadequate (success scenario), making it necessary for the proponents to adjust this, in order to improve this last topic of analysis. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposers intend to leverage on an existing infrastructure of 30 hubs to scale and expand the reach of Cardano in Kenya which is largely in line with what the challenge focuses on. The use of a broad base of existing infrastructure which increases their impact as information delivery nodes and minimizes start up cost, the focus on the average Kenyan as the target audience (thus reaching them in their cultural context) as well as the focus on onboarding members of the hub onto the Cardano ecosystem through collaborations with the Catalyst community and IOG experts all fit well into this challenge. \n\nThe impact for the Cardano community will be significant if all goes well as planned.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A monthly implementation plan with allocated activities to be undertaken has been provided and this aligns with the budgeted items. The total budget for the proposal comes up to $12,000 however, requested funds is $1,500. Proposers need to review and rectify the budget. Although a number of risk factors have been identified which could affect successful implementation such as lack of genuine software, inadequate computers or hardware, low speed internet etc., no mitigation measure is proposed to manage them. This is worrying and proposers could brainstorm and provide practical solutions to these potential challenges to enhance successful implementation.\n\nA four member multidisciplinary team is presented with backgrounds in ICT, software development, education and cyber security. Some team members are also active in the Catalyst community as funded proposers, CA, vCAs. One member is a co-host of the Eastern Townhall and Fund 7 Idea Fest. THe team is adequately equipped in terms of professional background and involvement in Catalyst to deliver on this project.\n\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Identifiable KPIs are provided for the 4 to 6 month duration of the project. Some of these KPIs have metrics attached to facilitate auditing eg. 'run bi-weekly training program...., organize one exhibition of Cardano and Catalyst...\". Although not all KPIs require metrics to make them auditable, there are other KPIs in the proposal for which metrics could be provided to enhance their auditability.  Proposers also need to clarify how they intend to provide updates to the Community on the progress of work.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1437", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposers address the challenge head on and boldly \u201cchallenge the challenge\u201d, stating it takes too long to achieve required scale if we try to focus on what community hub at a time. Rather, they suggest utilizing existing infrastructure (in Kenya) and approaching dozens of startup and innovation hubs at once through an umbrella organization called Countrywide Innovation Hubs (https://countrywidehubs.org/) who operate in nearly 30 locations outside of Nairobi.\n\nThis is a move that sets them apart and brings home the importance of scalable impact while staying true to the challenge and ensuring Cardano adoption and awareness is driven at the grassroots level. As a former social enterprise consultant I appreciate this thinking and applaud the team\u2019s ability for lateral thinking.\n\nThe team has clearly articulated how the proposal will add value to the Cardano ecosystem through supporting entrepreneurs to adopt Cardano in the smaller towns and rural areas of Kenya. And the Countrywide Innovation Hubs seems to be very much aligned with the same vision of helping them build impactful sustainable businesses.\n\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal align with the outlined challenge. The proposal lays the required groundwork and, although not explicitly mentioned what is imagined to happen after October 2022, when successful, it would be easy to scale this up to address many future challenges. Hats off for dissecting the social development goals and thoroughly analyzing the impact from the SDG point of view. The team seems to have a great understanding of their target audience. This proposal clearly drives change at a local level and helps the entrepreneurs to build much more than just cool products. Many lives will be changed for the better.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This is a strong proposal because the team seems very capable of addressing the challenge. Anne, Victor, Anthony and Angela come across as solid professionals\u2014a team with a diverse set of skills and prior experience to build on. Relevant credentials are listed in a succinct manner. Team profile and composition seems just right to get things off the ground but, if successful, more help will be needed. This proposal is so much in line with the aims of Cardano that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if even IOG and Emurgo stepped in to offer a helping hand at some point.\n\nGovernment support will be very important for the success of this proposal. The Countrywide Innovation Hubs falls under the purview of the Ministry of ICT, Innovation and Youth Affairs (https://ict.go.ke/). It is a little unclear whether the team already has some connections to them, and if not, how are they planning to obtain them.\n\nThe team mentions a litany of intriguing concepts such as Cardano Day, Cardano Workshops and Cardano Lecture Series but fails to impress with the level of detail. The proposal would be much stronger if each of these were fleshed out a bit more. Moreover, the requested funds is only $1,500 whereas the budget totals to $12,000. This is probably just a human error, though and it\u2019s clear that the actual sum is the latter. Either way, it\u2019s value for money. Cost per hub is still very low. What is being asked might even be a little bit on the low side to get everything accomplished. I can\u2019t evaluate this objectively, however, because I\u2019m not fully aware of what things cost in Kenya.\n\nKnowledge gaps have not been identified at this stage but, going forward, it is important to openly communicate the needs for additional team members. There is a lot of work to be done to implement everything listed in the proposal.\n\nThe proposal accounts for local needs and infrastructure concerns. It also shows creativity in addressing the issue from a higher level. The team points out that the entrepreneurs in rural Kenya could lack genuine software and adequate hardware. They may suffer from low speed internet and poor ICT infrastructure. Also the will and skill of the communities to use modern ICT is called in question and lack of expert technical staff and administrative support is highlighted. On top of these, the team should consider risks related to collaboration with different actors in the ecosystem. Because the proposal is so \u201cmeta\u201d, it would be good to take into account the potential risks related to miscommunication and differing motives of those involved.\n\nThe background research is very well done. The enclosed list of tech hubs, co-working spaces, investors, incubators, accelerators, conferences and events gives a good idea of the potential in the country. The team might have been even a little bit modest making the case for the Kenyans ability to come up with world changing solutions. They should be proud of the rich history of frugal innovation in Kenya. Pioneering examples like M-PESA are still discussed in business schools and management books worldwide.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The plans and budget are laid out on an okay level. Auditing the progress and the success of the proposal should not be too difficult. However, goal-setting could be improved and the information provided could be a little bit more detailed. Milestones are a little bit generic and only outline what is being done, not so much how it\u2019s done or how much will be achieved. Measures and key performance indicators are missing. The team has not explained how this approach will become financially self-sustaining. Including some more nuggets of wisdom would make the proposal even stronger.\n\nTo improve the metrics, the team could include 3/6/12 month projections for reach and entrepreneur onboarding on a more granular level. It would also be good to know which hubs are focused on and why. What are the priorities?\n\nAll in all, the proposal delivers value for money.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_289", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "There are more than 30 countrywide hubs in Kenya that reach out to the community.
