This problem statement addresses a problem within the challenge and needs to be solved. The lack of access to basic ICT services retards the development of the community which has an effect on employment especially getting a job in the low-tier service industry.\nA principle of the Scale-Up Cardano community challenge is the delivery of information to people who will not otherwise have access and in line with that, this proposer seeks to come out with a modelled ICT Hub for the deprived students which will serve as a source of information to help ensure self-reliance within the community. Some of the key impacts of the project will address the efficient utilization of Cardano,  blockchain technology and its opportunities, an increase in business development and management skills among the youth.\nThe key performance indicators which ensure the success of the project in the long term can be linked to the indicators the challenge requires. The proposer seems to have a very well understanding of his target audience which refers to the deprived student. The project in adherence to the KPIs also places more emphasis on the minimum-viable hub which looks at the smallest effective unit for a hub.\nIn as much as the project is a very good one, I really expect the proposer to highlight some of the main challenges that are likely to be faced as there seem to be numerous risks associated with such a project.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "A project before implementation needs to go through a series of assessments before implementation and given that, there needs to be an evaluation of the practicality of the project plan to judge whether or not the project can scale into the future. This proposal seems to be well detailed to help ensure that it can be conveniently done, there is a timeline for delivery from 1-2 months that looks into the acquisition of space, furnishing with internet access and other acquisitions and the period 3-6 months looks at the running of the hub. There seems to be a realistic time frame to implement the project and the budget looks reasonable to accomplish the work.\nThe budget of the proposer is very well detailed and seems to give an accurate projection of future cash flow to help the project achieve its target. I will urge the team to be very financially conscious and adhere to the budget since that will help the team gain control over the project's financials. I will also wish to know about the budget versus the cost to launch model which is also a very important thing to talk about, In most cases, the Cardano treasury delays in releasing the funds in batches due to demand pressure and based on that I will wish to know what the team will do if only  1/5 is to be applied as a cost to lunch??\nI am very confident in the team involved in the project, Jeremiah Baani being the team leader of the project and leveraging on the strength and support of the WADA team that has good technical and human resources.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There need to be an assessment to know the extent to which project management standards are being upheld. The project in my view looks sustainable through the leadership and supervision of the WADA organization. WADA has handled many projects and has secured funding through past funding periods with an exceptional success rate in achievement. I strongly believe in the WADA team to deliver with this project since they have the understanding of their target audience and can accurately provide their reach both physically with various offices opened in more countries across Africa and their online presence across the opened web. There has been a good projection of the number of onboarded members to the hub within the year and I also see the project to be keeping with the minimum viable hub principle.\nThe key performance indicators that serve as a measurement yardstick to help ensure the project's overall long term performance can be identified in the outlined proposal. As the Scale-Up Cardano community hub challenge principle looks at the minimum viable hub in terms of the smallest effective unit for a hub, the project really adheres to this principle with a number of 10-20 deprived young men and women in the northeast region.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1170", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 6, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2634, "q0": "The proposal clearly outlines the specific difficulties in an area, if implemented well, it will help the community a lot. The advantage of the project is that it is located in Ghana, which is a developing African country but has a really strong Wada community. I recommend the project to contact the Wada team directly, you will get a lot of support. As for the risk, in addition to members who need to use the internet, how do you promote the center and the benefits it brings? When the majority of young people only use the internet to play games? Or shy when not daring to learn?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Regarding the project budget and roadmap, I find it suitable, but surprisingly the team has only one member, I think this is very difficult, there is still a lot of work to do, such as infrastructure, maintenance machinery, managing equipment, creating courses\u2026 Connect a few more capable members with the same vision, you will go further.

That's also a big problem", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I know Wada is a big community in Africa, but you should clearly show quantitative indicators for the community to watch more closely, for example, central image, number of computers, equipment, blockchain lectures, the number of members coming to the center\u2026 Let's tune in to get the project started, the Cardano community is really happy to be of some help to your hometown.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1544", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6931, "q0": "The northern part of Ghana is mostly deprived of proper education since it lacks infrastructure,tools(computers) etc to impact/empower young pupils/students/youths as compared to the southern and other parts of the country, so therefore I totally agree that this proposal/project would help tackle this difficult situation in the north east region(Nalerigu) and future generations to follow.

There is also a very detailed description of the budget items, which covers all aspects of the budget. The team behind this proposal is Jeremiah Baani and members of WADA, who have extensive experience working with the tasks required to complete the project. Not only are they very active in the community, but they also provide other initiatives and projects.
