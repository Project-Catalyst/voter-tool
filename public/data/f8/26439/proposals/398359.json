It is a very creative proposal to cooperate with existing local coffee shops to sign a long-term recurring conference contract with them instead of setting up and operating a coffee shop by yourself, this will help reduce costs, ease to choose a convenient location to help many Cardano enthusiasts will be able to attend and easily replicate the model. In addition, seminars will be streamed live for both online and offline audiences to attend, which will provide attendees with a more enjoyable learning experience, thereby engaging the community co-participating, raising awareness of Cardano among attendees, encouraging them to participate in various catalytic so that Cardano adoption will be higher and add value to the ecosystem.

The conference should also not reduce the water price, both creating a cost burden and the attendees are also less interested in the meeting, they attend with a superficial spirit, do not actively absorb, the effectiveness will be reduced.

When holding periodic meetings at the cafe, everyone will know about blockchain, cardano... in a close and friendly space. People will easily access, exchange and share knowledge, so the number of participants will easily increase. Besides, when held at a cafe, it is easy to attract the curiosity of customers at the shop, who does not know blockchain, cardano through images of Cardano, Catalyst.\nAs such, the goal of this proposal is in line with the challenge's goal of encouraging the local community to promote Cardano adoption and awareness, growing the Cardano ecosystem.\nIf this project is successful, the model can be expanded to some other big cities in Vietnam such as Da Nang, Nha Trang, Vung Tau... This contributes to the expansion of the Cardano platform.\nThe project presented 2 risks about the Covid -19 pandemic and the legality of local event organization, including the full solution. But I have some personal opinions as follows: Proposal is calculating, estimating the number of attendees of a meeting about less than 20 people. If the number of attendees is 50 or more, it will be more difficult to find the right cafe. Therefore, if the project is approved, the proposed team should choose a suitable place to sign the contract.\nIn addition, if the epidemic becomes more serious, the gathering of people at the cafe will be banned or the number of participants will be restricted, so the project will be interrupted. The proposed team should anticipate coming up with a suitable solution.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal has a clear roadmap:\nPhase 1 is a basic course and standardization: after 1 month will complete basic level training, sign a contract with a coffee to run a weekly event in at least 6 months term, complete areas of page design decoration, banners, standee, flyers. After 2 months, complete the advanced training course, conduct 3, 4 offline sharing sessions at Cardano Coffee lounge, invite more blockchain experts to participate and present key topics, deploy sharing sessions weekly basic and advanced with predefined schedule, weekly meeting.\nPhase 2 is to scale up: After 3 months, replicating the model in Ho Chi Minh City, holding weekly meetings in both areas.\nThe above route is reasonable, easy to implement successfully.\nThe total cost for the project is $24,800, of which the cost of designing and producing banners, standees, flyers for Catalyst, Plutus, Haskell for both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, displayed on LCD screens at Coffeeshop in the events: $1,000, budget provision for discounts on coffee orders (from the audience): $1,500, event marketing and media: $1,800.\nThe rest $20,500 for 410 hours of labor, unit price is 50 USD/hour for the following jobs: design and create a basic course on basic Blockchain, catalysts, instructions for creating Daedalus and Yoroi wallets; searching and choosing a suitable coffee shop, labor costs to design and create advanced courses, speaker costs, recording, editing and uploading videos to youtube, project management\u2026 The above expenses on average 50 USD/hour, this level is reasonable. However, different jobs with the same unit price of 50 USD/hour are not suitable.

Therefore, it is likely that the first-time participant will continue to attend the next time until the end of the course.\nThirdly, the cryptocurrency market is currently a new trend that dynamic young people want to assert themselves. many young people in Viet Nam have just become rich in this market.
