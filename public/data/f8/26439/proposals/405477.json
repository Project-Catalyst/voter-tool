Lack of quality articles explaining Cardano and the ecosystem.", "f6_no_assessments": 9, "f6_rating": 4.518518518518519, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 5833, "q0": "This team of five students and researchers from Oxford has taken a very pragmatic approach to creating community awareness and attracting/grooming potential developers before they enter the job market and become prohibitively expensive. They have a step-by-step plan to drive Cardano adoption among students. They are implementing this plan one step at a time. This proposal tackles specifically the lack of quality articles explaining blockchain, Cardano and Catalyst in a way that speaks to busy and smart students, the top talent of tomorrow.\n\nThe proposal is definitely in line with the \u201cminimum viable hub\u201d approach as its goals are almost too humble. Yet this agile implementation/iteration process\u2014and the articles, illustrations and infographics created as part of this proposal\u2014are something that can be later used to create student hubs in universities around the world.\n\nAs a former student activist with years of personal experience from a global student-led organization I salute this kind of student activity in these times that students are increasingly pressed with demands to graduate quickly and get a well paid job. This team clearly understands the target group (because they are part of the target group themselves) and they have managed to create an approach that is easier to sell to the students: this has an immediate impact in their future employability and it can allow them to get Catalyst funding for their projects already while studying. It\u2019s an approach that empowers students to take the lead of their own careers and contribute to Cardano at the same time.\n\nThis proposal builds on a previously funded proposal (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/381527), from the same team. If this proposal was funded, it would allow the team to offer a scholarship for selected students to learn Plutus/Prism as a \u201csummer job\u201d, as well as to introduce students to Catalyst as CAs and proposers. The proposal surely addresses the challenge well, although the scope is limited to the local reality at Oxford and it only aims to get a specific set of tasks delivered. With an added level of ambition, the impact could be a lot higher.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This is a strong proposal because it builds on the same strong team\u2019s earlier work. These are not just any odd students and researchers but a high caliber selection of brightest minds in academia. Their listed credentials are so strong that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some of these co-proposers would continue to become future Nobel laureates. Yet they are not one-track-minds. This is in fact the first time I get to write an assessment with a soundtrack included. One of the co-proposers, Dr Adaku\u2014a PhD holder with a double MSc\u2014is also a songwriter. This is a good example of a multi-talented team. I am so convinced of the team\u2019s ability to produce quality results that I would almost suggest adding a zero or two after the next proposal sum in Fund9, if there is another follow-up proposal.\n\nThe linked notion page is a great example of the team\u2019s ability to simplify complex matters. The proposal would be even better, however, if it included samples of articles written by the team. Other than that it\u2019s hard to think of anything to improve. A solid and simple plan. A well outlined, reasonable budget. Clear timeline and milestones. A strong team. Top quality.\n\nPotential risks have been well outlined and addressed. It is a great idea to collaborate with the different societies and reach out to students via different channels, using customized messages tailored to a particular target group. So far the team has not thought of any other incentive to lure people in apart from free food and drinks. If that works, fine. But there are so many other instances competing for the limited time of the students that this is probably the aspect to focus on the most. What is the unique factor that speaks to students in Cardano/Catalyst? I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no simple answer to that question and it will only be revealed through trial and error. Furthermore, what works in Oxford, might not work in Cambridge. What works in the UK, might not work in Sweden or Nigeria. Looking forward to the team sharing their insights as they learn more.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The plans and budget are clear and the set goals are realistic. Information provided is sufficient, making progress/success auditing easy. Projections for marketing reach / onboarding of hub members is included in 3, 6, and 12 month milestones. The team\u2019s decision to ask for the public address of each member\u2019s ADA wallet is a brilliant way to track the on-chain activity of the members also afterwards.\n\nAll things considered, it\u2019s difficult to poke holes in a proposal so clear and easily auditable. Value for money delivered, once again. My only question is this: Have you thought about how to make the Oxford Student Hub financially self-sustaining? Can you productize and sell your know-how or find ways to get recurring funding from outside of Catalyst?", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_289", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1202, "q0": "The Oxford Student Hub address the challenge excellently. They have paid particular notice to the success criteria the challenge sets out such as MVH, cost to challenge ratio and considers the value this hub can bring to Cardano at multiple different levels such as developing with Plutus to Project Catalyst. The value add to Cardano is very evident, particularly as the captive audience such as under and post grads can offer enormous potential for the future. Additionally, whilst their is a clear \"minimum viable hub\" prospect, there is also potential to scale this hub into greater depth at Oxford, but also could be opened to other educational institutions at a later stage ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap is concise and realistic enough to deliver value in their suggested timeframe. They also have considered the length of the project to deliver value across 2022. Budgeting is clearly broken down (into granular detail) and is realistic agains the set of tasks detailed with fair value on hourly rates and general admin costs.

They have also considered risks to the project and have provided solutions where they can to solve.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "With a clear roadmap and deliverables detailed it will be likely that both auditing progress and ultimate success of the proposal will occur. I would have liked to have seen how evidence can be shared on progress such as detailing attendance records, images/video of events and other general \"in-flight\" proof of traction. General metrics/KPIs can be distilled by whether or not the tasks have been completed as detailed, and they have provided two simple KPIs (social media engagement and new wallets registered). The former will be easier to publicly track with the latter a little more challenging. Overall, the problem and solution to the challenge is clear and again likely to lead to success of the proposal.

For the extraordinarily low price of $4150, we can get direct exposure to Oxford students that can be onboarded as CAs and Plutus Pioneers. I don't mean to overhype Oxford. I know there have been accusations out there about Oxford losing some social credibility, which I feel is a bit harsh and exaggerated but I digress. Oxford is still a world-recognized academic institution that has the potential to add credibility to Cardano! Likely, in a relatively small way. I think the proposers undervalue what they can bring to the Cardano ecosystem as a reputable University receiving sponsorship from the self-proclaimed \"research-first\" blockchain. I realize that I have yet to address the actual proposal impacts up to this point in my review, I just needed to acknowledge the value-cost ratio. I LOVE the documentation created and presented in the impact portion. It's a very well-researched and thorough comparison that should probably be more widely circulated. I really like the idea of onboarding Oxford students as CAs too. I think the resources and information the Oxford Blockchain Society provides to get students involved in Cardano is a strong material. They might just need a bit better on-campus marketing/incentive. The food should help. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I've seen $50k+ proposals that had WAY worse roadmaps than this. The amount of work they do to prove that they are deserving of less than $5k is overkill. Of course, the scale at which they are impacting is far less than a lot of these other projects. The 12-month roadmap that they provide is very realistic, yet still challenging in the context of their target audience. In the course of 12 months, they plan to \"convert\" 100 students to Cardano and get 10 students established as Catalyst CAs. In my mind, that's $40 per Cardano participant (10 of which will be heavy contributors to the community in Catalyst) and they establish a much better grounding to continue their work in driving adoption on the Oxford campus. ALSO, the budgeted rate for the production of writing and research is SUPER undervalued. The average wage for Oxford residents is a little more than $50k/year, which translates to approximately $27.50/yr at 35 hours a week (UK full-time). For some impressive quality materials, based on what I've seen so far, that's a deal! If they keep requesting Catalyst funds for such quality levels of production at such a low budget with major potential for impact, I'm glad to vote yes 100% of the time. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They listed all the success metrics and KPIs in the previous section. I'm big on thorough KPIs and timeline-based success metrics.

As blockchain technology and the Cardano ecosystem is still in its early days, it is important that awareness is established to accelerate the growth of Cardano. By increasing the exposure of Cardano to students at Oxford university, an institution where some of the worlds best academics attend, this proposal clearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem in both the short and long term. The project has a very well thought out plan on how it will achieve their goals in relation to their outlined challenge settings. Partnering up with student societies is an effective way of gaining exposure to different social backgrounds. It gives me great confidence in this project as they have recognized their future challenges and how they aim to solve them. Their ability to identify the different levels of blockchain knowledge in their audience portrays that they have recognized a challenge and worked out a solution for their future audience. I would have liked this proposal to explore the use of key metrics to support their challenge i.e. a percentage of Cardano wallet holders in the University or a ratio between people who have beginner and advanced blockchain knowledge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It is evident that the proposer is reliable as they are already putting in motion partnerships, events and putting together educational resource to increase the exposure of the Cardano ecosystem. They also have future plans of creating scholarships which indicates that they also want to continue to add value to Cardano. The information presented on the team is detailed and clear. Their linkedin profiles look professional and they appear to be high achievers. I believe that this team have the skills and experience needed to implement the proposal. There is clarity in their roadmap with realistic timelines. I also like how they have key metrics to identify the success of each phase of their roadmap. It gives me the impression that they are productive and hold themselves accountable. The budget that they proposed is very detailed and the amount requested to achieve their goals appears to be reasonable. It was great to see that they were very particular in how they broke down the allocation of funds with every single item. The proposer also describes the resources needed to succeed and is reflected in their proposed budget.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The description of the problem is clear and concise. Auditing the proposal was a smooth process as the solution is closely aligned with the challenge and is depicted well through the information on their background, previous experience, roadmap/milestones and budget.

Targeting students to join the cardano community is a great way to add value to the ecosystem. In that sense, the proposal identifies a problem within the challenge that needs to be solved. Furthermore, the proposal targets students in computer sciences who can possibly be developers in the cardano ecosystem. Students can also be trained to be part of the catalyst ecosystem, which will add value to the cardano ecosystem. Some of them can work as CA while some of them can be proposers or developers. I have to say that the proposer has added clear key metrics that are aligned with the challenge. Regarding scaling in future challenges, the proposer should have mentioned it but, I assume that the proposal should be able to scale in future challenges without much issues.

The budget has been broken down into identifiable items. It is reasonable in my opinion. Furthermore, they have provided a timetable to complete the work. The items described in the timetable look achievable. I can say, from the plan layered by the proposer, that they have some experiences on the subject.

In Fund8 the team wants to maintain/scaling up that Cardano community Hub by writing articles and creating educational infographics about Cardano to help students in the community have deeper knowledge about Cardano, lead them to the Cardano ecosystem and Catalyst Project. In my opinion, the proposal definitely fits into the challenge as well as adds value to Cardano ecosystem.
