Initially, 2M+ ADA sounds like an ambitious goal for a new stakepool. However, with the reach that they already have combined with planned marketing efforts, this is very much an attainable goal. In fact, with 40 million people living in Poland and another 20 million people with Polish ancestry worldwide, this can ultimately become a very large hub and stakepool.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Having already attracted more than 1,100 members in their network, the Cardano Center Poland is well on its way of doing just that: becoming self-sustaining. With a budget as low as $5,280 this is in line with the Minimum Viable Hubs concept introduced by the challenge team. Even when combined with their other proposal regarding the live events (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/399413/) the total budget remains well below the 5% of the total fund allocation ($25K). This investment makes sense if it can reduce the need to apply for further Catalyst funding in coming Funds.\n\nThe plan is not only to cover the expenses of initiating stakepool operations from a technical standpoint but a lion\u2019s share of the budget is reserved for marketing costs, to bring in more people into the hub and into the stakepool. This shows that the team\u2019s focus is a balanced development of the hub as a whole.\n\nAs 30% of the budget is earmarked to a \u201cLinux Specialist who is willing to play a part in this project\u201d, it would have been good to disclose the identity of the said individual or at least share some of the credentials if they prefer to remain anonymous. Apart from that there is nothing much more to improve in this well thought-out and somewhat simple plan. The team has proven themselves and since they are somewhat public figures in the Polish Catalyst scene, it is likely that they deliver exactly what they promise.\n\nCurrent unpredictable geopolitical situation has been taken into account and, to be on the safe side, the servers will not be located in Poland. Virtual Private Servers should guarantee 100% uptime.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is clear and the set goals are very realistic. The team aims for an ambitious delivery schedule, promising that the Stake Pool will be up and running after two weeks of being funded. First block should be produced within 2 months and total financial independence should be reached within 6 months. These projections are reasonable.\n\nStakepool operations can naturally be tracked with any publicly available tools and the marketing activities will show up (in Polish) in Telegram, Discord, their website and through their partners\u2019 channels. Hence, this is clearly an auditable proposal and there is nothing much to improve.

"}, {"q0": "Cardano Community Hubs is an important direction for the global Cardano development. Taking to account my experience in multiple funds, I feel that Europe and Eastern Europe (so Poland as important country in it) is underrepresented. So other geographies, like Africa, Latin America, East Asia have bigger attention and funding, but not Europe. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I think this proposal should be supported. Another reason is that after launching and maintaning high-quality Stake Pool, Cardano Center Poland can become self-contained from external funding. So this might be 1 time Catalyst funding and then we\u2019ll see the self-sufficient development of Cardano Center in Poland. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is experienced and known in the Cardano community. Moreover Kornel Gajewski is Cardano ambassador. Launching Stake Pool within one-two weeks is a good plan and the overall roadmap is very detailed and clear. A detailed budget breakdown looks fine too, the overall cost is modest comparing to many other proposals in this category. The only thing to add, I can suggest is to have a calculation of possible revenues from the stake pool. For example how much you will get with XXX number or delegation, how much with YYY and how these profits will help to cover the activities of Cardano Center Poland. Maybe the funds from stake pool rewards won\u2019t be enough, so then your Center can provide other activities, i.e. consulting, or running sidechains, etc. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Operable Stake Pool ~2 weeks after Fund 8 completion is an achievable goal which will be easy to audit and check. Actually all the results will be easy to check, by visiting the pages the proposer provided. However it would be harder to achieve 2M+ staked ADA. It\u2019s not so easy now for the new stake pools to find delegators. Maybe you could add how you think you will get this number. Maybe Polish communities are active among ADA holders and will support, maybe you have your own funds or funds of business partners, friends, etc.  \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_328", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you for your feedback and suggestions."}, {"q0": "The proposal is aligned with the challenge especially on that fact it will want to be sustainable.
