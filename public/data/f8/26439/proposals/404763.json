Blockchain is increasingly seeping into reality, the world of technology is changing very quickly. Before each event, you should take the time to contact the career center at each school for assistance providing information when students need it. At the same time, you should interact with students majoring in computers, software... You will get a fast and strong number of attendees, which will grow from there. A few suggestions for you", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Appropriate time, plan, and budget. However, it was surprising that the team was only 1 person, very fragile. You should incorporate a few more friends or the Cardano community in your media, as there is a lot to do: get permission from schools, convince students, event content, organize events, answer questions, and support after the event\u2026", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The stats you give are appropriate after the event is over.

Try to attract young developers and inspire their interest in Cardano and its ecosystem. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This project seems highly feasible.  Because the proposer has experience of hosting events.  And also own a pool being the Co- SPO. He works  as a software engineer in a global company.  Besides there is no need to pay registration fee to participe and food will be provided.  It can be expected to attract many participants and can be able to provide them with a lot of information about Cardano.  The goals of the project, the progress. the timeline, and every support are marked out perfectly.  In this way failure will be very hard to happen.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal's auditability is very likely.  Because the proposer will provide videos and images for review.

I believe this kind of event will definitely create an Impact in universities and attract more university students to participate CARDANO in the future.\n\n\n\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility is high. Based on his personal experience, he is closely associated with 3 different computer related societies, has 3 years of experience in organizing university society events, is co-SPO of DOG Pool, and has close relationships with other Cardano industry professionals. He also mentioned that he is currently working in software engineering at a global company.\nI think he is well equipped to organize this event to reach out to college students.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "It is completely autditable, It could be audited through the number of students enrolled and then participating through video and photo shoots, as well as evaluate the activities and content of the lectures through video.

I can see that the problem described here fits into this challenge, and that\u2019s intelligent. The metrics and goals from comparison are in alignment with the challenge ( one goal is to create an organization that can reach out to universities and offer fully paid talks). Cardano will benefit by addition of more members to the ecosystem through this approach. In future terms, I believe this proposal has a strong scalability effect.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Considering the the relevant experience described and the information about the team, I am confident that the team is well equipped to implement the project. The budget is comprehensive. However, a challenge I can see is that, under phase 1 of the budget, one bulk amount is stated for planning cost which includes finding food vendor, finding event location, planning event logistics etc but what would have been more appropriate is to provide an amount breakdown for each of them just as was done for the rest so that there can be a better assessment of the budget. The budget also adheres to the MVH principle which is one of the critical issues in this challenge. All the same, I still believe the budget is reasonable to achieve the desired outcome. The plan presented here is well described and I like the fact that the proposer has provided a definite timeline. I appreciate the inclusion of the challenges and risks that may arise during the the execution of the project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap provided here is detailed enough. The time horizon and milestones are also well presented, and I love those inclusions because they make auditability assessment easy. Educating university students about blockchain and Cardano is one of the metrics that define success of this proposal, which I believe is a good indicator of the desired outcome.\nThe targeted problem here is well described and hence with the proposed solution given, I believe it\u2019s good or addresses the problem when executed.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_717", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9116, "q0": "Campus cardano events are important to reach students who exploring to learn new things and create for themselves value and opportunities. The proposal is using the Student for Liberty approach to help student identify opportunities and skill and knowledge to be relevant in society. The interesting thing is to have the events in face-to-face to practically introduce the ideas and opportunities of the Cardano ecosystem. This makes the proposal aligned to the challenge to reach out a defined community of students.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team member has a close relationship with students and looks to have the capacity to organize the 6 events. The budget  is detailed but there exist vagueness on the component of the planning phase.

Although it broadly meets the key objective of the challenge, i.e. Local outreach, digging deeper it falls short on effectively addressing the challenge.  For example, there is no indication on how the proposal will ensure resilience and self-reliance within that community post the proposed event-based project.  The voter should consider if the requested funds of $19K+ is a good use of individual capital outlay for what looks like an educated university community. (the challenge brief suggests, delivering information to people who would not otherwise have the access).", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Based on the plans provided it seems that the proposal is likely to be successfully implemented however, the proposers given experience are vague and would be helpful if specifics were provided to enable the voters to access this easily.

Mitigations have been provided for the risks of low turn-out and impact of current regulation for large gathering, with online or intimate small gatherings. However, the proposer has not provided information on what happens to the funds of over $17K if they have to revert to online events.

I can see how the issue mentioned here fits into this task, which is smart. The challenge's metrics and objectives are in line with the comparison's metrics and objectives.
