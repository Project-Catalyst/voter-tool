This project will build a content channel to provide blog articles, infographics, and video tutorials to help everyone update information about the Cardano network. This proposer briefly mentions 4 key activities that they will provide to their target users to help them advance their knowledge about Cardano which I believe will help grow the community quality in Vietnam soon. \nLast but not least, for this kind of project, selecting and making quality content among a lot of information is a big challenge that they have to face.
