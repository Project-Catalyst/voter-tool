An opportunity for a solution arises.", "f6_no_assessments": 4, "f6_rating": 3.833333333333333, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 8732, "q0": "This is a great proposal looking to deliver information to people who would not otherwise have the access. I have not stayed nor visit Nigeria before, however, I can attest to the fact that setting up hubs in Universities to educate students on blockchain and the Cardano Ecosystem is indeed a problem needing to be solved in the challenge due to experience. This proposal proposal, as clearly articulated, provides a solution that addresses the problem while being able to scale to address future challenges.\nThe idea of hosting a conference for university students at phase 1 of the project and virtual trainings at phase 2 with hackathons at phase 3 to onboard people who would utilize the Wada Hub in Nigeria and as well Cardano community clearly aligns with the key metrics of the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal expresses that the team really knows what they intend to do with the project. A detailed breakdown of the project structure with potential risks being addressed, convinces me that this project, if funded, will successfully be implemented. \nAccording to the roadmap, the community and auditors are able to expect that at phase 1 post-funding which's estimated to take place within the first month, a conference introducing students to the general principles of the blockchain with Cardano in focus should be held with a total of about 500+ attendees. This is a good timeline with milestone. However, it would've been fantastic and helpful if the proposing team had gone the extra mile to break the month down into weeks and tell the community exactly what they'll be doing before the conference is due.\nAt phase 2, it looks like the timeline isn't clear to me. It's stated 5 months but not defined exactly what this means as to whether the goals in there would be spread across the 5 months or otherwise. However, it is stated under phase 3 that 3 months into the training program (phase 2), this phase would be launched and thus making the roadmap even more complicating with respect to the timelines and milestones. I advise that the timeline and milestone section of this proposal be looked at carefully by the team and further clarification be given to it in order to enhance the feasibility rate of it.\nA total budget of $22.5K which's well broken down looks a little bit skeptical to me as far as implementation is concerned. For instance, $2K to cater for refreshments (conference and monthly events) may not be enough, having in mind the number of expected attendees (500+) for the conference. Assuming $5 is spent on each attendant, that amounts to 5*500=2500$. (This is average cost of refreshment for events unless proven otherwise.) The implication is that an additional cost of $500 will be incurred by the implementation team and unfortunately, no information on miscellaneous cost which could be used to factor expenses like these were stated either. However, the total number of speakers if known, could have helped a lot to justify as to whether the allocated budget to them is enough or not.\nThe team behind this project is solid! Particularly Wada. We've witness Wada do a lot of great work when it comes to outreaches and events on several occasions. The other team members, with respect to their stated experience, I see to be great resources that could deliver the project successfully.\nIn a nutshell, I advise that the team behind this proposal should take a close look at their timeline and milestones, and budget to enhance this proposal for next iteration should in case this proposal is not funded in Fund 8 but anyways, great idea and good luck to this proposal even though I  neither agree nor disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "With the roadmap being complicated, it certainly would make the work of auditability quite difficult and skeptical even though the main deliverables can be pointed out clearly and easily. However, as it's allowed in Catalyst that proposals that win funding can amend their roadmap and deliverables with good rationale, auditability can be made easy if the team behind this proposal considers my comments on feasibility and treat it as necessary. The metrics/KPIs as expressed, clearly defines the success of this proposal and I want to commend this proposal for a clear understandable description of the targeted problem and a clear solution that addresses the problem.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_69", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 5, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2618, "q0": "The project will help many students access a new direction in blockchain, the future will require a lot of manpower. Can the team clearly state the approach and persuasion so that students can learn and participate? Since these courses are academically intensive, there must be passion and knowledge. However, it does not bring any benefits in the immediate future, and at the same time affects the main study. I suggest that the first centers should be located in universities specializing in software, the start and development of the project will be more favorable. Hope this comment will help the project", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It was really interesting when I learned that the project motivated students to participate with food and drink, very real. As for the team, you have strengths in software and programming, which is good. However, can the project be sustained in the long term? In the implementation plan, I don't see any other revenue plan, are the courses also taught for free?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The project has been funded to start through another project, Planting Roots, which is funded in fund 6, which is a big plus. The project has stated each phase, but through what communication channels do you update the community?

As a country of 220 million people Nigeria is the largest consumer of Guinness in the world (no kidding!) and the home for the second biggest film industry in the world (sorry Hollywood, you\u2019re third). Therefore, Nigeria truly is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe proposers wish to create hubs (notice the plural) in universities that train students to become plutus developers. To get started, a conference is organized to reach 500 and to engage at least 50 computer science students. The conference is followed by a 5-month developer training and the whole thing culminates in three hackathons that will result in something awesome that hopefully pays back the investment manyfold.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The approach is quite common in the \u201ctechie\u201d world and therefore approachable for the tech-oriented students. Like any students across the world, the majority will be lured into the event because of free food and drinks but even if 10% of them stay and take this seriously, that is enough to get things going. As a former student leader I know how these things work and I can sense this is a recipe for success.\n\nPriced below the recommended 5% of total budget allocation ($25K), this proposal falls into the definition of a Minimum Viable Hub. What is important is to get things going. If successful, the outcome is probably very different (much cooler) than what was expected in the beginning.\n\nBeing backed by WADA in Cameroon helps but it is clear that the core proposers are passionate about what they are doing and will ultimately decide the fate of the project. To improve the proposal even more, it would be good to jot down the details of what is required in each phase specifically, e.g. how many volunteers are needed to run a conference for 500 students, where do they come from, how are they incentivized etc. Also, it would be good to include references and links for relevant experience/skills. Should there be any gaps in know-how, it would be good to list what kinds of team members are still required to join.\n\nThe plan is solid but the budget could have been a bit more detailed. The proposal mentioned what is being measured in the different stages and the attendance goals were listed: 500+ for the conference, 40+ for the monthly event and 20+ for the hackathon. There was no indication of how the project will become financially self-sustained. Adding these aspects would make the proposal even stronger.\n\nIt\u2019s good that the risks are discussed out in the open. Having routinely experienced students on strike in South Asia, it\u2019s easy to understand how it can be a real risk to make these plans a reality. Tension with the government can be a tougher nut to crack. Offering online options and back-up in-person events through WADA network as well as in person events. Partnerships with Global Policy House and similar organizations are good for long-term collaboration but don\u2019t have an effect on disturbances like strikes or unexpected government interventions. Lobbying towards policy-makers and government officials is definitely needed but that is not in the scope of this proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Information provided is sufficient to get started. The sums asked are appropriate in relation to the project\u2019s intentions. The plan will most likely become more detailed as time goes by and as the participants provide feedback. Auditing the progress can be done phase-by-phase. Stated milestones are clear and simple. The metrics are mostly measuring lagging indicators like attendance. There is no indication, however, of what will happen if a certain goal (e.g. 500 conference attendants) is not reached. Backup plans are necessary.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_289", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 1, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8942, "q0": "This is an interesting idea, which aims to train students in Nigerian\u2019s universities become Plutus developers by building Cardano\u2019s community hubs. The proposal is not only within the challenge but also valuable to Cardano ecosystem, if it is successful, it will help to increase the number of new hubs which are launched in 2022, increase the number of deverlopers that the hubs bring to Cardano community, and increase the number of new users of Cardano onboarded.\nThe author explains about the preparation in the first 2 weeks before deciding to launch the technical training program, that helps us to understand this 2 weeks has an important role in the project, that the team needs to give a big effort on attract students to the Cardano ecosystem and Project Catalyst, that shows us the enthusiasm of the team.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The authors provide a detailed plan in a timeline 6 months with detailed budget breakdown and information of team\u2019s members  for us to assess the feasibility of the project: Regarding to the plan, we can see what needs to be done which is split into 3 phases in a chronological order in 6 months. The financial amount is broken down in details, which allows us to understand what needs to be spend money on, and how much it costs, besides it also aligns the condition \u201cdoes not exceed 5% of the total Challenge budget\u201d because the asking fund $22500 is 4.5% of total Challenge budget. About the team who will conduct the project, I believe we have a good team due to the information which is provided fulfilling with skills and experience related to the executing the project and the support from Wada (link included for more information about Wada, who they are, what they do, and how much they engage in Cardano ecosystem and Catalyst Project). In addition, the team explains about the risks/challenges and gives the solution as well as the mitigation, that shows the well-preparation of the team for the project\u2019s success. Because of all those things above, I agree the proposal is feasible.\nHowever, I believe it would be benificial if the authors make more clear about contents of the reference and the training program, for readers to understand more about the plan in details, and to raise the trust on readers/voters. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The authors provide enough materials to audit the proposal, consist of detailed plan, roadmap with miliestones, KPIs, and \u201cwhat does success look like\u201d, that allows us be able to track the steps of the plan, or monitor based on the roadmap.

I would recommend the proposal should add the following things into the KPIs:\n- Number of participants that participate Cardano community (not in any specific roles)\n- Number of Cardano wallets from participants\n- Number of feedback from participants\n- Number of participants that become CAs, vCAs, voters, proposers, developers. \nI think the final result we want to measure is how the project contributes to the Cardano ecosystem.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_714", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Create hubs in universities that train students become plutus developers with the help of our friends at Wada.", "experience": "Wada Hub community lead in Nigeria.
