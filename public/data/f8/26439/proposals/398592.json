The idea of using kiddie drawings to create magazines with contents focusing on Cardano is indeed a project that I see would have great impact on introducing kids to the ecosystem at their early stage and also satisfying the part of the challenge where information could be brought to those who may otherwise not have access. Kids are genius when they understand exactly how things are done and thus I want to commend this proposal for thinking about the next generation already. However, I think the proposer should have considered creating an MVH, either online/offline to onboard kids who are exposed to these magazines. By so doing, this proposal would've addressed the challenge fully and not partial.\nGood luck!", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team behind this proposal looks solid but unfortunately, it looks like none of them has the expertise in drawing according to the proposal. No information was also shared to communicate as to whether they have hired or are going to hire for that particular role. From the proposal, the main deliverable centers around artwork so therefore I'm wondering a little about the feasibility of this proposal since no information was provided on that in the team experience yet the team managed to have an artwork as showcasing their project title as an attachment. \nAlso, at 7 month post-funding, one of the deliverables is a website which's great. However, I think the team should have at least indicate in either the beginning or middle of the roadmap the commencement of the website build just to inform the community that a certain timeline is being allocated to website building.\nThe budget, I think is a good one to help implement the project successfully even though the team could not have it under 5% of the total challenge budget as indicated in the challenge setting. It would have been great if the proposing team could have respected that line or perhaps state the reason why they had to request more than the threshold.\nWith all these findings, I am quite skeptical about the team's full capacity to successfully implement this project even though it's a great idea!", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The KPIs and metrics provided in this proposal defines clearly what the community can expect from the project during implementation stage.

We all know that the development of technology as well as the emergence of a series of concepts such as blockchain, crypto, coin, metaverse and different platforms such as Cardano cause many difficulties for the community to access. and understand it. It is due to language and technical barriers.\nSimplifying complex concepts to make it more accessible to the community, I think, is important not only for children but also young people who are not yet qualified to understand the new knowledge needed. needed in the new technology era.\nTherefore, a comic book with easy-to-understand drawings, characters with their own personality, and a story integrated with knowledge is really a useful tool to help children and beginners understand the basic knowledge.\nThe idea of \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\"Aaa kid\" with applications in educational games and educational content is also quite meaningful. It makes blockchain much more intimate, real, and in-depth.\nMoreover, parents may be concerned about the problem that their children are online, using phones and computers too much, but they are very reassured when they see their children attentively reading books, comics, especially a comic book. which has great educational significance.\n\nI think what's more interesting is that they can incorporate some technology, for example, kids can use their phones to watch moving characters or live sounds from paintings. I'm sure they'll love it too\n\n\nWhat I'm worried about in this project is just that the content creators can understand blockchain knowledge, metarverse or knowledge from Cardano, but can artists - non-experts be able to convey it? Saying complicated things with words is difficult, with pictures is even more difficult.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Although I was a little worried about the simplicity of his words, what reassured me most was the expertise and passion of the proponent. I see his passion and technology knowledge on his blog. And more importantly, he's also a father, understanding his own children is the way to help him understand how to make complicated content easier for them? Just imagine, he brought the content and pictures to his children, they understood, got excited about it, that was success! If you still don't understand, you have to fix it, you have to adjust it further.\nAnother thing that makes me quite confident in this project is that I see the cost breakdown. It almost covers everything from creating content, creating finished products to advertising. There are many projects that ignore the Advertising element, while it is very important if your goal is to get more people to know about your project and product.\nAlong with that division, I have a LinkedIn of associates: a content creator, an information technology engineer, a Marketers, ... and they all have a certain reputation for their expertise. This proves that the Leader has a pretty good mindset in terms of personnel organization.\nOne small reason I'm worried is that there's no mention of how the book delivery will happen? How do they use bookstore channels online, offline, and at events?\nSince I have worked in the publishing industry for a long time, I understand that in order for books to reach many people, the distribution network must be widespread.

Thank you for the words!!"}, {"id": 7336, "q0": "I don't think this proposal fits the challenge, nor am I sure about how this idea could be put into practice and how it would affect the target audience. The idea is to bring to children and teenagers knowledge relevant to the Cardano ecosystem, instructing and educating them about what blockchain, cryptocurrencies, Cardano, Bitcoin and so on are. I'm really not sure if this is a good idea, in my view it might be interesting to produce youth content about it, focusing on those teenagers who already have an interest and a certain inclination towards business and technology. As a kind of playful magazine but that also introduces them to these subjects in a safe way. But for kids, I don't see much need to approach blockchain at this stage of life, honestly. I think at this stage, we're still understanding what money is, let alone something complex like a decentralized network of transactions. I think it is healthy to introduce financial education as early as possible, in a way that is compatible with the understanding of the target audience. For example, for very young children, the concept of value and exchange is taught at first, for example (let's go with a very playful example) a house is worth 3 cars, and so on. But how could we talk about something as advanced as Cardano's knowledge in fun, simple and accessible language? In fact, why should we do that? I would like the proponent to better argue in defense of their idea, both as to why it is necessary and impactful. If the magazine were focused on young people between the ages of 15 and 18, I think things would be different, because this is an age when they start to study computing, basics of programming, financial mathematics, and so on. So, in my perception, it's a more compatible audience with this introduction to blockchain. Another point is, I don't know if this proposal fits well with the objectives of the challenge, because in the hubs challenge we intend to create effective and simple ways to bring knowledge about Cardano to a specific group, respecting their cultural and linguistic characteristics. Until we have a very specific audience here, children and teenagers who speak English and Portuguese. However, it is not enough to be a single community, how many children speak English, they can be from the United States, Australia, United Kingdom, in short, culturally very different places! In the same way, in the case of Portuguese, we could be talking about a Brazilian, African, Portuguese-Portuguese audience, anyway... Unfortunately, I don't feel that this proposal aligns with what is sought here and I'm also a little unsure about its validity this idea, and, in my view, it is necessary for the author to argue better about it. \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The script is ok, we know what will happen over the months, but we don't have much detail about each of the activities mentioned. For example, it is said that, in the first two months, the script for the book would be written, the characters created, and everything would be validated. But how would the script creation process be done? Who would select how this story would be told? What topics would be addressed first? How would such technological concepts be described playfully? Who would be responsible for the script? The third month would be entirely dedicated to writing the chapters. I would like to understand how many there would be, who would write them, how long it would take for each and so on. Finally, details. We don't have many details on how this proposal would develop out of practice. I think the script is good for us to have an idea of \u200b\u200bwhat happens, not for us to understand the details of how it all happens. Regarding the team, this part of the proposal, in my opinion, is perfect. We know exactly who we are dealing with: their names, linkedin profiles and we have a good description of their CVs, first it is said what area they work in and then it is explained what they have done professionally so far, at least in summary. I really felt confident in this team, as in addition to having explained their previous experiences very well, they made it possible for us to have proof of this by looking at their linkedin profiles. So I have no criticisms on that part of the proposal. Now finally, speaking of the budget: approximately 34 thousand dollars are requested to carry out this proposal, and this total amount is divided into smaller parts. However, each of these parts could have been better explained. The journalist will have a monthly salary of USD 1200, but why? What will his workday be like, how many hours per week will he commit to this project? In the same way that I ask in the case of the journalist, I would like to know more about how the work practice on the project will be for other professionals, the writer, the designer, etc. Look, I'm not saying that the amounts charged are unfair, however, in order to convey a more sense of need, it would be necessary for the proponent to better explain the degree of commitment each professional would have towards the production of this magazine. Therefore, my opinion on the feasibility of the project is as follows: the roadmap could be better detailed, as well as the budget; the description of the team members is excellent. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability suggested for the development process of this project is not sufficient. We only have numbers, which would serve to quantitatively understand the reach of the magazine produced: number of hits to the website, number of printed magazines, number of shares of the digital magazine (what would that be?). In this way, we even understand at what level the project is, however, it is not possible to understand if the small goals that were established were met. As it is a playful project, my suggestion is to have meetings, maybe monthly, but bimonthly would be a good size, where the project leader would demonstrate to the members of the Cardano community what stage the development is in, show the results obtained so far, such as drafts of the script, first illustrations, the balloons being inserted in the comics and so on. I think it is more interesting that these meetings are held in this case because the project is very visual, so the demonstration of the drafts is indispensable. I usually suggest that monthly reports be prepared and sent to the community in some of our media, such as discord and telegram, for example, but I don't think this is the best way for us to audit this project, specifically. In these meetings, it could also be said whether the professionals involved were able to follow the work routine they had planned, if they faced any difficulties and if so, which ones, and so on. Now talking about the final result, the success scenario, in my opinion the author of the proposal explores qualitative variables as well, in addition to numbers, such as the testimony of parents and children. But how would these testimonies be collected? I loved the idea, but I would like to know how this would be put into practice. Maybe school meetings? Maybe by video call? And how could every community be aware of the data collected? In addition to knowing the number of schools visited, it would be great if we knew how these visits were, the reception of the children, the teachers, how did all this really impact those involved? In my view, a slightly longer general meeting would be necessary for such information to be properly passed on to the Cardano community. In general, my opinion about auditability is that it is strong in some points but has to improve in others, it is stronger in the construction of a final scenario than in the progressive follow-up of parts. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you very much for the comments, they were very thorough and necessary to help in the development of the proposal.

The proposer wants to write and publish comic books about Cardano/ blockchain for children and teenagers to read in two languages English & Portuguese. It\u2019s also interesting that the team has the vision to build ADAKIDS token on the Cardano blockchain and this series of comic books is the start. However, I only rate 3 for its impact because of three reasons:\n(1) The proposal doesn\u2019t specify the target audience & demographic where the team are going to focus. The age range of children should be determined exactly to prepare appropriate content. \u201cChildren and teenagers\u201d are too general because the teenager is a subset of children. Moreover, the proposer wants to visit some schools to promote these comic books. I wonder where these schools are, and tried to look for them in the proposal but I couldn\u2019t find one.\n(2) Before talking about how many digital magazines or printed ones has been published, we should ask an essential question: What will children contribute to Cardano after they read the comic books? \u2013 For me, to answer this question is to define the impact of this proposal. Supposed that comic books are very fun and children love them, I don\u2019t see any further step to measure children\u2019s engagement into Cardano. \n(3) Reading to the end of the proposal, the way the proposer listed down key metrics to success, again, makes me confused about who is the target audience of this proposal, children or parents/ teachers, or all of them? The purpose of this challenge is to scale up Cardano in those areas having potential users onboarding Cardano, I wonder if the schoolers and parents don\u2019t approve these comic books for their children to read, then isn\u2019t the target audience at the first place teachers/ parents?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "This proposal has a good team, each member would cover a role in the project independently. Yet, after reading the action plan, I\u2019m confused about the role of journalist, writer and content editor because somehow they are overlapped. One more thing about human resources is that after I have checked LinkedIn of everyone, although the team has 3 roles of writing, only Gino Matos truly has some professional experience in writing but he specialises in journalism/ press release. In my opinion, writing fiction, especially for children is totally another thing from writing articles/newspapers. \nTimeline is clear and budget is requested reasonably. I still would like to see the budget be broken down even smaller, into how much dollars per hour for each role. Estimating salary by month is too general for me because I don\u2019t know how many hours each person will work on this project in a month. \nI advise the proposer to discuss the risks and challenges of this proposal because approaching adults about blockchain/ crypto-currency is already difficult, here we are about to approach children. Some of my suggestions for the team: How could we approach schools and make teachers/ parents accept the project we are about to introduce to their children? What if children find comic books boring? What if children want to become users onboarded Cardano but their parents don\u2019t approve?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A roadmap with milestones is the best-written part of this proposal. Scope of work from months 1 to 8 is short but complete.\nKey metrics to success is unfortunately inadequate. The proposers leave all metrics/ KPI blank without any specific/ estimated numbers. I think it\u2019s possible to set goals into numbers. For example, how to estimate the \u201cnumber of deliveries of printed magazines\u201d, we can set a goal because the team already have enough members, estimated salary for each person, the amount of time they can work for the project, then we can calculate in that 1,5 \u2013 2 month \u2013 how many printed magazines can be written. A clear description of the targeted problem with actual figures is required in every fund of Catalyst. \nThe second point is about \u201cwhat does success look like\u201d, I think the proposer could write it better. Besides the number of interactions/ engagement online and physical, we can discuss further the metrics to get these \u201clittle users\u201d onboarding/ learning/ contributing/ benefiting from Cardano. Here are some of my advice for better metrics:  \n- Number of places to answer children\u2019s questions about Cardano if they get interested after reading comic books. \n- Metrics to run these hubs of students resiliently.\n- Number of external organisations to help these hubs stay connected (because there may have students from various schools)?\nAnd again, to have a good process, the proposer needs to relocate the targeted demographic as I said in the Impact.
