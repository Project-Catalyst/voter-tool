It veers away from the typical workshop sessions and meet ups and uses the concept of an online marketing space to promote Cardano, which is excellent. The fact that advertising the space will generate income also provides the basis for a viable financial sustainability model.  The proposal addresses the challenge to the extent that it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem by showcasing Cardano related projects and individuals. In addition, the visual spaces can be used by other language communities and can therefore scale to a wider audience more easily. The proposal however needs to provide more information or a clear strategy on how traffic or people who will be attracted to the marketing spaces will be onboarded into the Cardano ecosystem. This will greatly enhance its alignment with the challenge. This is because the challenge focuses on getting new users, developers and organizations onboarded into the Cardano community. Also, a clearer indication of who the target audience is will provide a better focus to the proposal. In other words, which group of people is the marketing effort directed at? Is it targeting the average person who has no idea of Cardano/blockchain, people or organizations who are already in the blockchain space but are yet to get acquainted with Cardano? I believe finetuning the target audience will provide a better focus on which category of people will be onboarded and how this onboarding will be contextualized in order for it to yield the expected results. \n\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has experience in event management, graphic design and communal marketing which are all relevant for the proposal. Providing further evidence of skills and experience (references of previous work or links) would however, enhance an evaluation of their ability to deliver on the proposal, more so since there is an indication that the hubs are already in existence and are progressing. It would have also been interesting to see a little of what has been implemented and to have a feel of the risks and challenges that have been encountered so far including mitigation measures in place. Unfortunately the link provided in the proposal is for a website which is still under construction. It says \"coming soon\".\n\nThe proposal provides a timetable for the execution of tasks over a period of 3 quarters, with clear tasks assigned to each quarter. A more detailed budget breakdown would however help in better assessing the adequacy or otherwise of the resources requested. \n\nThe proposal is likely to be successfully implemented although a lot more information on ongoing work would have greatly enhanced an assessment of its feasibility.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal provides a roadmap with identifiable milestones for each quarter as well as KPIs which will define the success of the project. To enhance auditability however, proposers may want to consider generating monthly reports of their KPIs, ie. site traffic, new/returning visitors for ease of reference by the community. Proposers may also want to consider linking KPIs to the Cardano ecosystem such that it is possible to clearly connect the project to a certain number of newcomers to the Cardano community.

It also addresses the challenge as it create a MVH to present these projects and potentially increases challenge kpis as \"new Hubs launched in 2022\" and \"total reach of the Hub's initial marketing launch\". Also, as the hub will generate revenue by advertising, it addreses additional challenge goals as indicating a financial sustainability model.\n\nHowever, the proposal lacks a proper communication plan in order to attract people to this hub, both thosw ho have projects and those who are there just to visit and get to know the projects. Ads depend a lot on communication to work and this could be better explored here.\nAnother point here, now in the challenge and risk part, it is is explained why it needs funding but no real challenge or risk on the project, if funded, is explicitly identified and mitigated.\n\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Project plan is clea and time time-framed, with good deliverables. However, some acitivites to deliver these deliverables could be mentioned. For instance, how \"Mass Marketing\" will be made?\nBudget breakdown is well done and matched the project plan.proposal total budget is 5%, the suggested upper limit for the challenge, so it's ok also.\n\n\nThere are 2 committed people in the team with experience and background in graphic design and film industry, which are indeed key capabilities for this project. I think, however, that it should have also someone with communication and adversiting experience here. Also, some links to check their capabilities, like linkedin, could be provided.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "the proposed kpis are good and will certainly help to track project progress. They could have, however, some estimate targets or reference values to see if the website is meeting what was expected in the beggining.

Currently there are several projects developing metaverses, in Cardano itself we have Pavia. It was unclear what the proposer means by more \"engaging\".\n\nI see a virtual hub as a potential direction within the scope of the challenge, but the proposal does not clearly articulate how this virtual hub will impact the ecosystem, there is vague mention that it will serve as a space for promoting projects through galleries, but there is not enough information in the plan to judge the potential impact of this proposal.\n\nThere are no established metrics/KPIs (the KPIs referred to in the proposal do not have targets, so they would not serve as KPIs). The absence of clear targets and targets brings a lot of uncertainty about the potential impact of the proposal.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The Carnivilla project is already under development, by checking the website it is possible to see a working application and get an idea of \u200b\u200bwhat the virtual hub would be like. The proposers have relevant experience for the development of Carnivilla, they are already developing the project, but there are no sources to check their qualifications. There is no mention of who will be responsible for marketing and this part is essential for the project to succeed, so I would recommend to the team to define who will be responsible for marketing and add links so that it is possible to check the qualifications of the team members (Linkedin , Github)\n\nThe budget presented has been divided into three parts but they are not detailed enough for a proper assessment to be made. It would be important to estimate the hourly workload in order to understand whether the requested budget is relevant. In addition, it is unclear how the marketing budget will be used.\n\nThe milestones presented in the roadmap use vague definitions. There is no clarity on the stages of development, there is a lack of details of what (and how) will be carried out at each stage.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal needs to better articulate the problem, what is the importance and potential of the metaverse? What can Carnivilla bring in relation to the projects that already exist? The presented solution needs more clarity. How will the team approach projects and members of the Cardano community for them to participate? How will marketing be for the virtual hub to be successful?\n\nThere is a roadmap for Q1, Q2 and Q3, but the development stages contain few details and the milestones are subjective and poorly explained, which would make it difficult to audit the development.\n\nRelevant metrics were defined to monitor performance, but there are no goals with clear targets/KPIs, which makes the performance evaluation subjective. I would recommend adding metrics on the number of projects developed on Cardano participating in the virtual hub, KPIs with targets and a more detailed roadmap with more objective milestones.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_43", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Unfortunately, I didn't find an innovative idea. It is about creating a space that would work as a virtual gallery, in which the objective would be for people to exhibit their projects involving our blockchain. The idea from what I understand is that it should be a space for relaxation, but it is not so clear what would happen after these exhibitions. Would these people be looking for partners to close teams, funding? Or just to present your idea to the Cardano community and receive suggestions for improvements? The problem I found here is that there are already spaces like this at Cardano, where people can share their ideas and exchange experiences. It is not clear what would be the difference between these hubs and those that already exist. So I think the impact wouldn't be that big. If the author had better explained the more exact characteristics of these spaces, perhaps my perception would have been different. Overall, the detail is shallow. With that unfortunately I will give a low grade to this topic.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The roadmap does not maintain the same level of detail in all phases. In the first quarter, for example, it is not said which activities would make up the \"Initial launch of the hub\". In my view, this would involve several things, such as defining the virtual platform, drawing the attention of the target audience, inviting the first people to present ideas, scheduling dates, moderators (if necessary) and etc. But none of this is made explicit. The other two quarters have more details, but it's still not the ideal case, because I think a monthly breakdown would make more sense in terms of understanding exactly what's ahead. The financial division is explained in an average way, some parts are divided and some of them are explained. For example, we know what minor tasks the main developer would perform. But we don't know, for example, how many hours per month he would dedicate to this project (nor how many other professionals would dedicate too). It would be important for the marketing campaign to be explained in detail as well. Speaking of the team, not much trust is given as they are apparently not active members of the community, it is unclear if they have worked at Cardano before. It would be interesting if they made their linkedin profiles available.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal is not so easily auditable. The KPIs provided for process analysis pertain merely to the partial results, not the work behind it. As the project would last 3 quarters, it would be interesting to have monthly meetings, so that the Cardano community would be aware of all the updates on the pre-production of these online meetings, in addition to their fruits. Speaking of success scenario, the entire scenario outlined only concerns the success of the project itself. It is not thought how the reflection of this would be measured in Cardano. How would we know that the challenges of the challenge were met from this project? Unfortunately, this part leaves a lot to be desired.
