Respect.)\n\nStarting a new stakepool wouldn't necessarily count as \"a community hub\" but digging into the details of the proposal it becomes clear that this is an experiment in utilizing a loophole in unfavorable legislation, to make sure people who had to stop staking could start it again. If successful, it can offer an entirely new model for staking - something comparable to the ISPO innovation from 2021. When successful, the new stakepool operations would also lead to donations to at least five other Catalyst initiatives. Therefore, it can be concluded that the risk/reward ratio in this proposal is very tempting. This could be beneficial for the entire Catalyst community, not only in Japan.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "At first the KPI of 5,000,000 ADA staked sounds quite ambitious, but you need to understand that the proposer is a stakepool operator who is already running a pool with almost 20,000,000 ADA staked and 117 blocks produced (at the time of writing). Hence, the ambition level is justified. They even say that if total stake falls below 300,000 ADA the stakepool will be discontinued. The risk for the community is only $500 a month. If they don't deliver expected results, IOG can stop paying them.\n\nIf I understood correctly the way it works is similar to an ISPO model: the stakers won't get ADA rewards but instead a native token of a selected Catalyst-funded (?) project. The difference is, however, that the stakepool uses their stakers ADA to buy the native tokens from the open market and returns these as rewards to the stakers. Naturally, the stake pool operator needs to take their cut. In this experimental model the projected fee is 5%. Honestly, as is the case with any innovation, no one can say with absolute certainty how workable the model is. But I think it's worth a try.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Due to the obvious language barrier, it is not the clearest proposal, yet it is understandable. It is very important for the proposer not to be viewed as scam and, although hard to read at times, the good intent comes through. It would have been good to include direct links to the previously funded proposals (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/381579). At first I wasn't entirely sure what \"Kittamu project\" referred to.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_289", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8986, "q0": "The proposal addresses the objectives laid out in the challenge setting. This proposal clearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem by onboarding users through meetups and also help ADA holders to get their staking rewards since some stake pool operators steal delegator's rewards. The idea is great but there is no detailed plan or information on how this can be achieved.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There is little information on the team and roadmap set for this proposal. I think with a little more information, this would be feasible, however, looking at the information given by the proposer, there is no guarantee that the proposal can be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The author has clearly defined the success of this proposal with measurable and achievable goals but no detailed information on how to achieve these goals and this can make auditing and tracking the progress of this proposal difficult.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_715", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10175, "q0": "A good idea to raise a large number of ADA starke into Pool from ADA Holders in Japan. The project offers solutions to overcome tax difficulties when Starking ADA in Japan. I agree that the income tax on starking rewards is calculated based on almost double the actual earnings from the rewards which are leading to many difficulties in Starking and expanding the Cardano community in Japan. The Japanese have a large percentage of ADA holdings, if the staking ratio is high, it will contribute a lot to the transaction processing under the POS mechanism. The Japanese can overcome the tax barrier to receive the full Starking reward. If successful, the project will have a great impact on Cardano both in terms of stimulating the starking of ADA holdings in Japan and attracting new users who want to hold ADA and receive rewards from Starking. The aim of the project is in line with the requirements of this Challenge.\nIn terms of risk, the most worrying thing is whether ADA holders in Japan have enough belive in to deposit ADA to the team for Starking. Since the nature of regular Starking is to entrust the head of the Pool with voting rights, the representative validates the transactions on Cardano and receives the reward from it. ADA remains in the wallet of the holder, not with the pool operator. In the case mentioned in the proposal, the ADA will be in the wallet of the Pool operator, so the risk will be on the user's side. The pool operation team must have a high reputation to make ADA holders want to deposit their ADA.\nOne more risk I think there will be for the Pool operator in this proposal is if ADA's price is down, the pool may be affected in terms of taxes as well as profit from starking for the holding ADA. I think the team should think more about this.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Regarding the development plan, although there are no specific details of the implementation steps, roadmap, and implementation time, the proponent has written a description of how to do it. The project is expected to receive starking right after funding, distribute rewards with original assets after 1 month and increase prestige in the community through the website for about 2 months. The project conducts a trial for 1 year, then evaluates the results to decide whether to continue or to improve. If possible, the proponent should list more specifically the steps taken to make it easier to follow the project's roadmap.\nRegarding the budget, there is no detailed spreadsheet attached, but the proponent shows a rough budget for major expenses. The project budget amount to 1.2% of the total budget of this Challenge.\nRegarding members, the identity of the implementing member is not specified. Perhaps due to the sensitivity of the proposal because of the tax implications. And the team is also confident that it can create trust from the community after being funded by existing performance and reputation in real life. However, if members can provide more detail about their experience, skills, or evidence of experience, it will be easier to assess the feasibility of the project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proponent has stated metrics such as the amount of ADA Starking, the number of ADA in the operator wallet address. The KPI is not mentioned in the section \"Audibility\", but as mentioned in the \"Impact\" section. Does the proposed group provide specific KPIs?\nCatalyst and the community can check the development of the project through the indicators and KPIs outlined above.\nThe success of the project is the amount of ADA Starking, which means effective use of the amount of ADA being held without Starking in the Japanese community.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_823", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "We will establish 100% margin pool and distribute original Token instead of ADA rewards.
