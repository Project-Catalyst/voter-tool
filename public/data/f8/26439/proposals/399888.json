Taiwain has a population of about 24m people (according to https://www.worldometers.info/) a number that might seem low compared to some other areas, but I think the economic potential compensates it. What I find especially interesting is that the focus of the proposal is to present it in Universities, where we can usually find people with potential affinity with Cardano. When I wanted to analyze the metrics to corroborate the alignment with the metrics of the challenge I could only find the number of attendees expected in the different workshops, and although I consider it a necessary metric for this type of proposal, it is necessary to complement it with other traceable metrics that show that this attendance would be effectively converted into new users, new proposals, new SPOs perhaps? I recommend the team to think from that side the focus of the proposal to make it more robust and with better opportunities for funding allocation. I have decided to give it a score of 4. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "When evaluating the profile of the team in charge of the implementation of this proposal I can only find details of merit of what appears to be only one person, no additional reference information is presented to support their arguments. Regarding the budget and implementation plan, as it is a relatively simple proposal with no complex steps, the information needed to make an accurate assessment. The budget is appropriate and is in compliance with the requirement of not exceeding 5% of the challenge budget. Regarding the risks, it raises the situation of restrictions associated with the COVID, as a counterproposal they propose the possibility of doing it online, another possibility that could be considered are open or semi-closed spaces. Another relevant risk that should have been taken into account is a high dropout rate, to which I would expect countermeasures to have been thought of as well. On a general level, and considering the amount requested, I agree with this proposal from a feasibility point of view. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "To ensure the auditability of this proposal, the team proposes the creation of a group of cha and registration through workshops, to which I would recommend adding some complementary measure that allows you to record the level of attendance which can be consulted by the community in general. The only metric included is the level of attendance at events. This metric is of course necessary for this type of proposals, but I would recommend adding metrics such as number of proposals in Catalyst as a result of these events, new wallets for events, among others.

The problem is clearly stated as well as its solution. The proposer is a young daring person willing to make the Cardano community known in Taiwan and specifically among university students.

I find extremely challenging and promising the fact that the target population are young people.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer is using her position to influence people which is very clever of her. She also has some experience in organizing events.  I am not sure though how a one person team can run 12 live meetings. The team members are not clearly stated in the proposal therefore, I can only assume that she will call in people for assistance. The total budget is reasonable for the activity the proposer is planning, although there is some overlapping of expenses (e.g. co-working space fee, food, drinks and meet-up logistics, venue costs).  Furthermore, the proposer refers to $1200 \u2013 ADA giveaway but she does not give further explanation, therefore it can only be assumed that she will give away ada as incentive to attend the meetings?  \nThe proposer has taken into consideration the covid situation and the risk of not performing the events in person.
