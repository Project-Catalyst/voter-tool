Certainly encouraging new community hubs is important but making sure the current hubs are up and running and making them better so as to keep pushing that standard higher is equally crucial. The Cardano Stonerz are looking for the support of the community to upgrade themselves and the quality of content they have been delivering and the kind of guests they have had over has been predominant in bringing a lot of Twitter community together and no doubt the impact they could bring to the ecosystem is ample. In a digitally-driven world like ours, it's quite important for any to keep an excellent image and make sure to have several verifiable communities worldwide to provide news and talks and Cardano Stonerz could be one of those premier hubs for Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The variety of people the Cardano Stonerz has been to gather throughout their journey has been appreciated by the viewers, a huge portion of the appreciation goes to the hosts to keep the entire session interesting and engaging. Hence, there lies very less doubt in the kind of content the team would be able to produce and host. The fund is about 5% of the total fund and their plans of upgrade seem promising and satisfactory considering their fund request. They also provide the community with a detailed breakdown of the budget, and how each contributor of the hub is paid optimally. Some of the names put forward by the proposer have made quite a sound in the community for their expertise and the entire team looks promising. I feel  there is substantial amount of information available at hand to draw assumptions that the proposal shall have fruitful implementation once funded.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The kind of metrics presented by the proposer are very much aligned with the challenge's requirements. The extent of fame the hub creates for itself is surely the most effective metric to track the success and also the amount of public engagement the hub achieves in the form of posts, videos, responses are verifiable add-ons. The results from the existing tools such as twitter diagnostics are credible and can be used by the auditors to track the progress of the proposal. Considering the team having raised funds previously for their venture, I feel the auditing process should be less complicated and the community would be able to generate enough evidence regarding the proposal's triumph. However, Cardano Stonerz being an established community, I feel the proposer could had provided the community with a few more unique metrics that makes them different from the other hubs that are striving to provide similar support to the community.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 5, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 114, "q0": "Aside from their affiliation with the ADACafe, the Stonerz club is already very popular and have done a lot of great work to promote and engage community members. This proposal clearly demonstrates the global impact they can have with a little funding to help them expand their reach. Enabling Cardano to 'bridge cultures and countries together in common spirit'' is a great framing for the challenge and because of the format of this community hub I think it is a perfect fit", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A clear explanation of how funding will be used and a simple but well defined scope of works. I recognise a lot of these community members in the team and have seen the positive impact they are having in the community first hand.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Tracking of the goals may not be the best necessarily, but I think that even just following the roadmap would be plenty to prove the work that the team will be doing. I would appreciate the metrics given and I do hope they can double their viewership in the next 3 months. I really respect the hard work this team have put into the community and I hope to see it continue with or without funding", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1053", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 281, "q0": "The Cardano Stonerz Club is an all inclusive, free wheeling Twitter Space with widespread community involvement across all spectrums of the Cardano community and beyond. The host of the club, Big Joe the Don, has a larger than life personality, and is able to successfully dialogue with industry giants like Charles Hoskinson, and people of all walks of life and levels of involvement in Cardano and other cryptocurrencies and NFT\u2019s. In fact, it was Charles Hoskinson himself that alerted me to the Stonerz Club as I followed him into the space one night. I never left, and full disclosure, I have attended regularly and participated in their signature event, Shill a Mania, In order to offset any implicit bias I may have, I downgraded my assessment of this project to a 4, from a 5, in hopes of balancing and presenting a neutral assessment. From my experience, this project is closely aligned with the challenge, and has been highly effective at onboarding new folks to Cardano, educating people about current and upcoming projects, an allowing anyone to speak on any project. Discussions can be interrupted at any time if a pressing need is brought to the table. One such incident occurred the other night, when a very talented artist was addressing the group for the first time, one of the community members asked to speak, and then asked for help regarding mobile wallets and integration with laptops. Apparently, her friend had finally decided to take the plunge into ADA, and she wanted to strike while the iron was hot. The Nami wallet was suggested along with a quick tutorial, and as she left the room to help her friend, the prior conversation resumed.\n\nMy personal experience with the Stonerz club revolved around a fundraising idea I had first brought to Cardano nights. The host, AllyIllustrated, was gracious enough to let me pitch my proposal, and as I was explaining my idea of working with local photographers to mint NFTs of photos to be auctioned off to benefit survivors of the Marshall fire in Boulder, I instantly received several DMs. The Shaw foundation offered to mint the NFTs and enlist the support of Big Joe to host the auction space. Shaw contacted The Hidden Order to be the auctioneer and the Stonerz club let me come in a shill the project on a nightly basis, and over the course of three separate events, we were able to generate several thousand ADA to send to a local charity that was administering funds to people who had lost everything in the fire. The first auction was very successful, but the second did not do so well, so Big Joe and his co-host Willyboy offered to have the last auction take place on the Stonerz Club. This gave our project greater exposure and led to a very successful evening. Big Joe is very charitable and he often can be seen in literally dozens of spaces throughout the week. Whenever he shows up, hordes of people follow hin into the room. He goes out of his way to help every one he can, whether it is in the Stonerz Club, or in another twitter space. It is more than a full time job for him, it is his passion and he is active in the community at least 60 to 80 hours per week. Willy does the scheduling and they expose their audience to all of the other Cardano Twitter spaces, projects, emerging artists etc.They msut be doing something right as Charles Hoskinson came back for a second visit.\n\nThe club advertises that they host spaces 5 nights a week, but in reality between Big Joe and Willy, they are up and running almost every night. .Rappers, musicians and NFT artists from other chains are frequently coming in to check out the action as many of the shows are unforgettably epic. Just recently an extremely talented young artist ported all of her work from Etherereum to Cardano, as she found a much greater level of support in the Stonerz Club than she was receiving in other spaces on other chains. Their presence in the community can not be understated and first time visitors are frequently invited to talk and introduce themselves. Anyone who has entered a space and was frustrated by never being recognized by the host will be pleasantly surprised by the ultra inclusive nature of this program.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I think it highly realistic to hit the target of doubling the viewership of Stonerz Club with the advent of Catalyst funding. Just by word of mouth, this space often has hundreds of participants on a nightly basis, and has been the inspiration for similar, though less impactful spaces on other platforms. Funding for the hosts and co-hosts would free these folks from having to participate in fiat mining (wage slavery), and create the opportunity for more time and energy to be expended in not just increasing quality content creation, but community outreach, marketing, advertising etc. 3 months of funding is requested and the breakdown is as follows: salary for Big Joe @ $25/hr for 40 hours a week for a 12 week period ( $12,000). Funding for the co-host at $1000/month for 3 months ($3000). $2000 for graphic artists to create graphics used in advertising the program and it\u2019s correlating events. $2500 for the creation of promotional videos and $500 for creation of musical content. The sum total of the request is $25,000. \n\nThe fact that the Stonerz Club is already operating successfully without funding indicates that this project has the potential to grow exponentially with funding through Catalyst. All metrics that indicate feasibility have already been met, thus I have no reservations stating that the likelihood of failure is virtually non-existent. \n\nAnother aspect that I have not previously mentioned is the strength of the supporting cast. Many of the clubs co-hosts and regular attendees are quite skilled and very active in the community at large. From graphic designers and artists, to developers, stake pool operators, content creators, IOHK innovators, police officers, and even professional wrestlers, the community is extremely diverse. It is not uncommon to visit with people from every continent on an almost nightly basis. In summation, the only issue concerning feasibility is how much additional success and broadcasting bandwidth will be amplified by funding this project.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The mechanisms by which KPI's will be tracked and measure have been clearly identified, but there is some room for improvement. The project promises to document the number of video views, twitter posts, likes and comments but does not specify who will perform theses tasks and whether or not this will be a funded activity. One KPI I would like to see added to increase auditability and measure progress would be twitter space attendance. Despite the fact that I have full confidence in this project to double participation in 3 months, I do believe a more rigorous analysis could/should be implemented. As full transparency is promised, the projects ideals are consistent with the Cardano mission. Another plus is that the entire budget is fully accounted for. All in all, despite the room for improvement, this proposal does demonstrate the ability to be successfully audited.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1131", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 5, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1733, "q0": "The team proposed with the idea of \u200b\u200bdeveloping Cardano Stonerz to be the most exciting, top destination for Cardano community members.

I also suggest to the proposer to clearly define how they plan to attract new people in the cardano ecosystem and mostly what is the value they bring to the cardano community.

That's why I\u2019ve suggested to the proposers to clarify the value they can add to the cardano ecosystem.

I suggest to the proposer to add a roadmap and time horizon for achievement. I also suggest to the proposer to add a youtube channel where they post the recording of their twitter spaces.
