Let's popularize our favourite ecosystem together under Cardano Center Poland brand!", "f6_no_assessments": 3, "f6_rating": 4.555555555555556, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"q0": "Creating a strong brand for Cardano without too much of self-branding involved is a nice fit for the challenge. Adding live events to a budding web presence, social media and translation services makes the use of all available channels and is very inclusive. Poland is a country famous for software development and games, so boosting visibility and publications in the national language are highly effective in spreading word about Cardano and Catalyst. The impact of this proposal is however only as high as the attendance of the life event, so it is hard to judge the impact without some \"mission creep\" from assessing feasibility. Using POAPs and free admission for a funded proposal are great ideas, but otherwise the content is not specified enough to assess whether it is tailored to leave a lasting impression or create a highly positive view of Cardano. Project Catalyst is only referred to once, and is not mentioned as included in the content of the event. With a small tweaks and added detail about the programme, the proposers could have made a good proposal even better by way of impact.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The LinkedIn profile of the co-proposer looks relevant to organizing live events and the experience presented is sufficient to make this a success. The current Cardano community videos and website of the proposers are very recent and have few followers or views. The budget is modest and realistic for 5 live events, and it is good that the funding will be used to provide free admission and create use of Cardano NFT as Proof of Attendance. Overall, it is likely that the experience of the proposers and plan of the events will be successful.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "What I like about this proposal is that it is realistic and even modest in its use of funds and promise of rolling out the events. The first event will happen 2 months after funding and one every 1 month after that. Using the suggested KPI's, it will be easy to audit success over time, and we will have a long-term impact of the funding compared to other Community Hub proposals that consume funds quicker.\nImpact on local news and other qualitative metrics (like \"list of lectures\") may have been more specific. As the events are free and content remains indistinct, there is currently no clear link between attendance and impact for the Cardano community in Poland. This will improve over time and with \"idea leads\" after the first event, so it is not a big problem at the moment.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1357", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 3, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you for the review and tips on how to improve the proposal. I agree we could at least present an example of 1st event agenda to make it more clear for CAs to judge whether we are serious. Hopefully we will be able to provide you and the community with full recaps of our amazing events :-) "}, {"q0": "After successfully funding the proposal \"Polish Cardano Center Website & Society\" from fund 7, the proponent realized that the Polish community needed crypto live events. The solution to this problem is to organize a series of Cardano-focused blockchain events in different Polish cities. In my opinion, this is a good value proposition that will address an immediate need quickly and simply. The problem and solution claims are reasonable and within the scope of the challenge.\nThe proponent also foresees some challenges and risks in the implementation of the proposal and has a number of measures to mitigate those risks. However, there are still risks to accept such as political factors or the Covid 19 epidemic.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Implemented a proposal of 2 members: Kornel Gajewski with 4 years of experience as a translator, writer and blockchain editor, he has also been a Cardano ambassador since 2018 (https://forum.cardano.org/u) / Cornl) and the 2nd member is Nikodem Zegzda - podcaster, Youtuber, owner of the brand Kryptowaluty Wieczorow\u0105 Por\u0105 (https://kryptowalutywieczorowapora.pl). The project team is very well presented, we know the names, training areas, interests and Linkedin affiliates of the team members, creating a strong security and trust in their work.\nRegarding the roadmap, the proponent provides a step-by-step plan to implement the proposal. Although there is no clear schedule, the goals are linked to the completion time, thus, they allow for the successful evaluation of the proposal. The budget also breaks out, $10,000 for 5 live events I think is a reasonable number. Based on the foregoing, I agree that this proposal has a high probability of success.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal includes a realistic timetable and a clear definition of success.

The timeline and deliverables are simple to understand and look achievable based on there being a reasonable gap proposed between events to gather feedback and assess.  Budget breakdown of the fund of $10K requested seems feasible and looks like a minimum budget request ($13 per head).", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The metrics and KPIs are clear and measurable.  The projects transparency is easy to access by voters with their presence in several social platforms.
