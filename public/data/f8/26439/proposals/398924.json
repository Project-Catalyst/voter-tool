I think this is an innovative idea since everyone who has an interest in tech will only reach out on cyber-space. The team plans to design a nice tour for visitors to walk in and engage in blockchain/ Cardano/ ADA. This proposal addresses the challenge at the point of delivering information to the people who don\u2019t have the access to the blockchain by making physical interactions in the centre. If this centre is well-designed and the team could run good marketing campaigns, I think it could attract people even without IT ground and may get them involved in the community spontaneously. Chennai is a nice location with an appropriate demographic, I think the community here will welcome an experience centre like this. \nHowever, after reading the action plan, I realise that although this is a good idea, its actual impact on Cardano seems not to be high. Konma is already an organisation with multiple channels, and the proposer is trying to integrate them with this X-experience Centre. This could be a huge advantage, otherwise a disadvantage. The reason I say so is that introducing Cardano to people is the essential point of opening this centre, I don\u2019t see the team having a detailed plan of what content to introduce to visitors and how to handle their reactions/ interactions/ engagement. The proposal presents very much about giving them chocolate, showcasing the Konma lifestyle or Konma art pieces, etc. but these activities are just the very first step for catching their attention. The real spine of the project should be invested more about Cardano, how to create a Cardano hub with all the speciality of the Konma community. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Compared to the proposal submitted in Fund 7, this round I could see the proposer added information about team members. It\u2019s a good point. After checking around the LinkedIn of all team members, I have a concern about the feasibility of human resources for this project. This X-perience centre is very much about blockchain, decentralisation, technical stuff, etc. but I see only the founder of Konma having some experience with blockchain management (still I couldn\u2019t find how specific his experience is), all other members are blockchain enthusiasts with various specialisation. \nI see a budget presented, but I think it should be broken down smaller. What equipment/ machines will be bought for renovation & infrastructure? Is there any reference for the renting cost? How many staffs will be hired for operating the centre? How much money they will be paid for an hour working at the centre? On which platform that the team will run the marketing campaigns? Questions like these are my suggestions for the proposer. \nAnother thing I want to advise the team is that the action plan \u2013 it takes 9 months for the team to launch all kinds of Konma channels in the experience centre until the first set of a staking pool will be held, that\u2019s inappropriate for Fund 8. This round we aim to build \u201cminimum-viable hubs\u201d with the small unit but effective one. It will take too much time & cost to run all these activities for attracting people. Furthermore, the proposer doesn\u2019t have a plan to deal with risks and challenges. What if after a lot of time and effort of building this centre, people would not find it interesting and we have a low amount of visitors?  The proposer should discuss this more. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal has a roadmap with 12 milestones for each month. The time horizon should be estimated and added. Key metrics are listed down quite reasonable but I think that KPIs should be filled into numbers. Just an example, how many participants from the Catalyst community could the experience attract - can be estimated by the number of Indian/ Chennai people who are active on the platforms of Catalyst/ Cardano. Respectively, other KPIs should be defined clearly. \nThis proposal provides me with not very sufficient information to assess its progress. However, I still think that this is a good idea. I advise the team to work more on this project.

The operation cost (salary of how many staff). The majority of fund will go towards rental and renovation cost instead of blockchain technology to amplify how blockchain can transform life.

The rent and renovation budget for this proposal is quite high and could emerge as potential issues as we go along the project.

For example as the proposer explained, people who may have walked in a center just to buy a bar of chocolate will get to see the technology that is giving them the transparency and food traceability. This is more convincing and easy for people to learn a new concept than telling them we used blockchain technology to give you traceability. They work both online and offline. The first Xperience center will be located in the southern part of Chennai, India, which has crowded and dense popularity, an IT district with 70% of the population being tech-savvy (they could open a minimum of 50 Xperience centers there). This idea of the Hub is great since the importance of Education is unsuspicious, but the traditional studying method shows its weakness so it is necessary to have an method more effective.
