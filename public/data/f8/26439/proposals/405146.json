Everybody responds best to a certain way of getting things explained that varies", "f6_no_assessments": 5, "f6_rating": 3.6666666666666665, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 6202, "q0": "From my understanding of it, this proposal aims to create a platform where users explain what they have learnt about Blockchain in their own words. It is explained in the proposal as a blockchain-diary of sorts. In my experience as a teacher and researcher of education, I can agree what the proposer states about there being great value in having a lot of different ways to describe complex ideas (everybody learns differently). Having a personalized element from these individual stories will strengthen the feel of community within the platform and the ecosystem. This is pure speculation, but I believe it also has the potential of being somewhat therapeutic. Instead of being an educational platform to educate people of Blockchain and Cardano, it will (hopefully) attract the average investor or person, who then can share their experiences of running around blindly learning about blockchain and crypto. (If that is what they feel, of course). There are platforms that have this concept included (Reddit, Discord) but these kind of stories and advice can easily get lost due to the wide range of topics covered in these forums. I believe the diary format is a good way to include people into the platform, and make it easily understandable. \n\nThe proposer seems to have a well structured plan on how to scale the project, along with a good understanding of what metrics to measure during the development phase. Also mentioned in the proposal is the (very important, in my opinion) acknowledgement that this is a long term project, and will take some time to grow into its full form. A lot of the parameters connected to the success is based on the users, and how the users act and use the platform. It is refreshing to see a somewhat unique take on what a community hub can be. Overall, I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The core team consists of three people with varied experience and skills, there are also mentions of two other members in charge of programming. In order to measure the level of feasibility properly in this proposal, I would suggest the addition of verifiable sources that can strengthen the credibility of each team member. It could be a link to a LinkedIn-profile, some details on previously implemented projects, etc. We are given credentials of the \u201dmain proposer\u201d, but this information would be more impactful if it could be verified in some way by an external source other than the main proposer himself. We are provided with links to previously funded proposals, which is a welcome addition. \n\nAlso, have the core team already hired their members in charge of programming, or is that something that they aim to do? Speaking from my experience as a recurring CA, there is a big difference if the team plans to hire specific roles, or if they already have done so. It is important for transparency. \n\nWe are given a budget breakdown that seems fairly reasonable given the long timeframe of the project, although it could be elaborated by adding some more information on what (for example) is meant by \u201dMiscellaneous\u201d. Another suggestion could be to add an estimate of working hours in the budget, split between the different roles. (Example: UX-designer is budgeted to work X amount of hours each week, representing a total of X amount of USD per week.) \u2028\nAs I mentioned briefly under impact, the team is aware of the project needing to be a slow growing long term-project, the challenge being that the \u201dreal\u201d contributors to the platform is the community. There is some need for clarity when the proposal mentions the \u201dDiary pioneers\u201d, will they be random members of the community or will it be the three core team members that produce these diary posts for a year? (The latter is implied under the auditability-section in the proposal). \n\nAn important question to address regarding the transparency of the proposal is: What is the reasoning behind these team members being sponsored for submitting diary entries, when the future platform will be a subscription service? \n\nThere are some improvements and clarifications that would make this proposal even stronger (as suggested above), but I agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "We are presented with a roadmap containing a rough estimate of a timeframe. From my understanding (correct me if I\u2019m wrong), the team aims to update the community on development progress via their Langbassadors Youtube language hubs. The chosen measurements of success mentioned in the proposal (number of diary submitters/entries, website subscribers etc) provide us with easily understandable and measurable information if the team choose to communicate it during development. A suggestion for making the proposal even stronger is to include some information in the roadmap containing the plan for subscribers and submitters to the platform. (When will they start recruiting users outside of the core development team? Will the first outside-submitters also receive incentives by making entries? Why, why not?). If I understand the proposal correctly, this will happen during the first year of publishing? \n\nHaving read countless proposals when doing CA-work, there are some questions or clarifications regarding transparency and communication with the future users that I would have loved to see answered in order to strengthen the proposal even further. I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals, but with the caveat that a few things should be clarified (as stated above).

I am finding very little in the proposal that creates any kind of a community. Really, the proposer is just proposing a website where a bunch of crypto newbies talk about their experiences. In video, audio, and text. Also, he wants the content in English, Dutch, and Filipino representing the 3 principals he has on the project. \nWhile having various languages is good it would appear he would dilute any sense of community with so many languages.  When it comes down to it this is basically a blog not anything that really builds community. If this creates a community it is going to be shallow and fragmented.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I do not see a good outcome for this project. Based on past funding success they have built a website, https://safetyinnumbers.co/#/ which really doesn\u2019t impress. They have also produced YouTube content that does not communicate content based on past funding rounds to educate about crypto and Cardano. (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTjtShSZD7sj61GhBT_7Riw) The content so far does not seem compelling, nor does it offer a high degree of information.\nThey have provided very little detail on their team. Rik, no other name has a master\u2019s in economics, but has been in business to business sales for 25 years. Tisha Caburian has experience in education but is primarily billed as a network marketing professional and entrepreneur. Jeroen has experience as gardener and in the hospitality industry. He only brings the experience of speaking Dutch to the table. These three are here to use their native languages to develop content.

Basically, users will submit content on the website to allow other people to learn from it. There also will be a reward system to reward content creators. I think that this is a good idea for those who want to learn about blockchain technology. The proposal is in the scope of this challenge. However, the proposer didn\u2019t mention how exactly this will benefit the cardano ecosystem. I suggest to the proposer to be more specific on how this will add value to the cardano community. Furthermore I would suggest to the proposer to add strong key metrics that will be in the scope of the challenge setting.

I suggest to the proposer to add links to  linkedin profiles of the team members. Besides that, the budget is broken down and it is reasonable. As a digital marketer, I know the costs to run a website of this kind. That said, I suggest to the proposer to include marketing in the plan. The proposer didn\u2019t mention how they will acquire the customers, which is really important for any project. Another important aspect is the work completion delivery which is included in the proposal.

I suggest to the proposers to use SEO as part of their marketing efforts. I also highly suggest to the proposers the establish a clear marketing strategy which is lacking in this proposal. That said, the metrics and KPIs are pretty strong and achievable.

The problem statement captures the critical issues of the challenge, hence there is an alignment. I can see a number of success/goals for this project all of which I believe are the desired outcome of seeding and growing Cardano in the African continent.

Are these questionnaires to be distributed to blockchain inclined locals or non-inclined blockchain locals, because the exclusion of this information leaves that part of the approach ambiguous. I am concerned about that because from the approach of the project, it\u2019s stated that information would be uploaded to the blockchain website in the local languages targeted, so I am expecting that right and quality information is uploaded to websites so that it can provide true enlightenment of the Cardano blockchain.

In this way, more people would be attracted into the Cardano ecosystem and get involved actively.\n\nThe proposers think that they expect 1 entry minimum a week after the launch of the website and would see at least 168 entries after the 15 months.
