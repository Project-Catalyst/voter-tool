From my understanding, the proposal aims to act as a welcoming committee, helping and guiding new people in the ecosystem with the onboarding process. Where the overall goal is pretty clear, the explanations on how the proposal aims to do it is not, unfortunately. If I understand the proposal correctly, they do have plans on creating community hubs and spaces within the metaverse, but I would have liked to see more detailed examples of how they want to do it. There is mention of using high quality art and gaming to help people with guiding new people (which makes sense considering their current NFT collection), but not much how this art will explain Cardano. The proposal also states that they will use Social media and twitter spaces but as stated above, not much is explained after that. I\u2019m wondering if this proposal would fit better in the \u201dNew Member Onboarding\u201d category, or possibly \u201ddApps and Integrations\u201d if the proposal will focus on developing the educational NFT-collection. \n\nIn my experience as a recurring CA (since Fund6) I would suggest to decide on one solution described in detail, and explain that thoroughly in order to make the proposal more clear. For example (if part of a more fitting challenge category), \u201dWe aim to create 3 series of NFT collections that will explain different aspects or functions of the Cardano Ecosystem, each NFT will be accompanied by a short educational video explaining the function represented in the NFT. We plan to collaborate with X team/organization to get in contact with as many newcomers to the Cardano ecosystem as possible, etc.\u201d (not a great description of a project, but hopefully you\u2019ll see my point.)\n\n\n\nCurrently, it is my opinion that the proposal is missing a lot of key metrics and goals aligned with the chosen challenge setting. There is however a lot of great ideas in this proposal, but it would need to be a bit more clear and focused in order to be assessed properly. Due to lack of clarity and information, I disagree that the proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal includes a link to the original NFT-project website of the team. Having a successful project completed or in development process speaks well for the commitment of the developing team. At the website we find the (eight) members of the team (this could be included in the proposal to improve clarity), but it would be beneficial to include some verifiable resources that can confirm the skills and experience of each team member (Such as LinkedIn profiles or links to previous projects).  \u2028\u2028Considering that the proposal asks for roughly 20% of the total funds for the challenge setting, it would be nice to see a breakdown of the budget included, along with an estimate of the working hours for each team member involved in developing the project. For example, \u201dX amount of USD allocated to marketing, split between two people for 40 hours each\u201d. To further increase the feasibility of the proposal, I would suggest to add a timeline. What does the proposal aim to achieve by what time? In its current form, the proposal states under \u201dbudget breakdown\u201d what it means to do with the allocated USD (purchase land within metaverse, create gaming facility, Cardano historical museum etc) but without stating amount of USD, or specifics on each mention. \u2028\u2028The more transparency there is, the more trust and credibility for the development and team will come (Which is identified as a potential challenge in the proposal). \u2028\u2028Due to the reasons stated above, I strongly disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "There is great vision within the proposal team, which aims to be part of and interacting with the Cardano system for a long period of time. There has been mentions of social media platforms earlier in the proposal, but would be nice to see that included here. If the proposal would include some measurements of success (or KPIs) presented on a roadmap with a chronological timeframe, it would make a huge difference in the auditability of the proposal. How many members do the team aim to grant exposure to their learning platforms or NFT collections, what is measured as success and how (and where) will the community be able to communicate with the team, and follow the development process? It could be as simple as to state \u201dWe plan to host educational guidance on these three platforms, and hopefully get in contact with X amount of people during Y amount of time. We plan to communicate with the community through X platform.\u201d\u2028Currently, there is not much concrete information in the proposal for me to assess the auditability.

The team intends to make available all its knowledge through the presentation of the ecosystem in digital spaces. So for me it is clear the value they intend to deliver to the ecosystem, however, I must say that when contrasting this challenge with the challenge settings and considering that the focus will be placed on nurturing newcomers with knowledge, and in fact, I allow myself to quote from the proposal \"Our willing to provide outreach and just getting to know new members of the community will be featured\". I am inclined to the conclusion that this proposal is in the wrong challenge, being the more appropriate \"New Members Onboarding\". However, I also believe that sharing in these spaces will encourage the possible creation of community. So I have decided to award a score of 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposing team claims to be \"Cardano Kombat\". Who as an entity are well known in the community. Talk about their history as NFT. However, I would prefer a description of the roles and people that will make up the committee that will implement this proposal. Considering that there is a reason that I do not know why no names are presented and considering the presence of Cardano Kombat in the community it is clear that they have the competences and skills to carry out this proposal. Regarding the budget unfortunately there is no breakdown to understand what is the logic of the team that led them to ask for this amount, this for me is critical. Also when contrasting the amount requested with the challenge settings where we are asked to the community of CAs that the amounts do not exceed 5% of the challenge budget and this represents 20% since the focus of this challenge is the expansion of Hubs in the form of MVH I must say that this represents another concern, which is why I decide to assign the team a score of 2.

The end result of the proposal does not match with the KPIs of this challenge which is basically to see positive growth in terms of number of hubs created, new developers, new users to Cardano etc. There is also no indication of the ability to scale and extend their reach and no strategy or plan in place to make the hub self reliant with time.
