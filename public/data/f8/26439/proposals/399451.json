The Science Hub in Argentina does not only aim for Cardano awareness and adoption but also to contribute towards the very scientific foundations of Cardano in the long run. This could easily become an example for other countries to follow.\n\nA series of two symposiums, a practical 5-day workshop and a closing meetup take the participating young scientists through a shared experience that connects their own research interests to that of the possibilities in Cardano and Catalyst. By the end of it, we can expect at least 5 quality proposals coming from the Argentinian scientific community and hopefully about 30 new scientists will remain as active participants in Catalyst. This is a prime example of empowering people and changing their lives in unimaginable ways.\n\nThese events serve as a basis for the hub. Even if not in scope yet, it would have been interesting to read what future plans the team has for this hub after the events. To make the proposal even stronger, it could have included some more visioning forward and outlines for how to make the hub financially sustainable.\n\nThe problem statement matches the challenge well. The proposed solution has room to grow in Argentina and it is also replicable globally. The potential reach is not limited to the Spanish speaking scientific community because the academia prefers English (according to Wikipedia, Spanish language publications in natural sciences and technology account for only 0.5% of the world total).", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Having followed the Noether team\u2019s progress also in Fund7, I am impressed by their capacity to produce quality proposals. The team underlines the importance of wrapping the new and exciting blockchain topics in familiar packaging, offering symposiums and workshops that scientists are used to. Scientists themselves, the team clearly understands the needs, fears and potential hesitation of the target group.\n\nOne of the strengths in this team is their multidisciplinary background. The fact that they come from different faculties should help the team attract diverse participation. How many other teams can say they are well versed in Digital Marketing, Cyber Law, Mathematics and Quantum Mechanics?\n\nThe budget is less than 2% of the total budget allocation for the challenge. It is remarkable how much the team promises to deliver for such a small amount of money. Unfortunately this is the global reality we live in but, on the other hand, it\u2019s more bang for the buck\u2014not only return on intent but, in fact, a really good return on investment, too.\n\nThe team has identified clear communication and bad reputation of cryptoeconomy as a whole as their biggest hurdle. They understand the need to frame Cardano as \u2018a serious project for serious developers and scientists\u2019.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal flows really smoothly and it\u2019s easy to understand how it addresses the challenge. The budget is neatly outlined and the costs are reasonable. The planned events form a coherent whole, a funnel-like program really, which ensures that those who remain until the end will in all likelihood become active participants in Project Catalyst and the Cardano ecosystem as a whole.\n\nIt will be easy to measure the results every step of the way: the team will track the number of speakers and attendants at the symposia and at the workshop. The expected reach of 50+50 symposium participants (thirty of them continuing to the workshop stage) is very realistic. However, it would be good to also measure the effort required to reach these numbers, i.e. some leading indicators on top of the lagging ones.\n\nAs said, the budget is realistic and well constructed, definitely good value for money. However, when I tallied the budget line items, I realized that it is, in fact, missing $500 from the total (organization cost of the first workshop was not considered). This is an acceptable human error and most likely shouldn\u2019t endanger the implementation.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_289", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 7373, "q0": "The idea of \u200b\u200bthis proposal is really very good and perfectly meets the requirements of the challenge. It is about creating a community in Argentina that has scholars, scientists and young people as its target audience, to discuss in a more traditional way (such as through workshops and symposia) non-traditional subjects, such as technologies relevant to the Cardano ecosystem. In my opinion, the idea is correct in several respects. Starting with the fact that the proponent already informs a very specific target audience. I notice that many proposals aim to attract lay people to the cryptographic world, which is certainly necessary for our community to grow, to become more popular. However, it is also necessary to invest in an audience that is already a little more involved with issues of computing, economics, development, etc., and the target audience of this proposal seems to me to be well in this environment. The scientific community needs to wake up to the advantages and differentials of blockchain, especially Cardano, as I believe that our blockchain is very promising but is not yet widely known and adopted. With that, these events would help Cardano to become better known and maybe be used in some projects. Another positive point is that these events would take place in Argentina; We know that in some places, such as Europe and the United States, blockchain technology is already better known and consequently adopted, however in Latin America, Cardano is still in the embryonic process of implementation. In Argente, specifically, taxes and inflation are very high, making it quite expensive to develop research and projects, as the proponent says. This makes me think the following: if the community that produces technology and knowledge there understand the economic advantages of all this, they might be strong candidates to adopt Cardano en masse, since it is quite expensive to develop anything there. During the reading of the impact, I was a little in doubt about the specificity of the project, that is, I was not able to visualize exactly which subjects would be addressed. However, this issue is clarified in the feasibility, it is said that subjects such as \u201cdecentralized validation, the mathematics behind a project's tokenomics, smart contract deployment, digital signatures, the PoS protocol and its advantages\u201d will be addressed. Therefore, I totally agree that this proposal aligns with the challenge as it has the potential to popularize the Cardano ecosystem (causing its greater adoption) for a specific community (the Argentine scientific community). \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Let's focus on the script: it is very rich in detail, but it lacked a sense of temporality and understanding what is behind the events. The activities to be carried out during the entire process are enumerated and richly detailed, so that we understand quite clearly what would need to be done and how. However, these activities are all related to the moment of the meetings, it is not said what the pre-production would be like. The point is that we don't know when such things would happen, and a script, in my view, should contain this information: what will be done, in what way and when. If the proponent had associated dates with activities, I would say that it is a complete script. For example, the first activity, which would be the first meeting, is explained very well, however, in which month of the year is this symposium scheduled to take place? What would have to be developed beforehand for this meeting to become possible? I believe that we have several things at stake, such as leasing a physical space, hiring people for the production team, hiring speakers, defining which topics would be addressed (this is mentioned), whether there would be a coffee break, a time for conversations and networking... Therefore, I think the script is accurate in terms of making us understand what events would be, but not what would happen behind them or how long each thing would take to be developed. Speaking now of the budget, I believe that the asking amount, approximately 9 thousand dollars, is very fair. Several meetings will be held, and as I said, it's not just the moment of the event, many things would have to be worked on before and some after, this generates a lot of expense. Regarding the explanations of this funding, we have some main points (symposium organization (x2), materials and space rental + workshop organization, materials and space rental + organization of the closing meeting, materials and space rental + social media reach and project management). The first three points are divided into small parts, so we understand very well the reason for the asking price for each. My only observation is regarding the last point, which would be the reach on social media and project management, this part does not contain more specific explanations, I would like to know what the marketing strategy would be adopted here and why. Finally, speaking of the team, this part is excellent, we know who the professionals involved are, what their professional areas are and it is also explained a little about their CVs, in addition to their linkedin profiles being attached, so that we can check all the information that is said. There is a lot of confidence in them, mainly because they are from the scientific community, which indicates that they would have a good idea of \u200b\u200bhow to dialogue with the target audience. That is, I believe that the feasibility is good, with only a few points to improve. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proponent gives us good indicators on how to audit the proposal, however I think that in the progress measurement part, we could have a little more qualitative data as well, for example: we are told that to measure progress a series of data would be monitored. They would be: number of registrations and participants in the symposia + number of speakers registered and approved in the symposia + number of participants who complete the 5-day Workshop + many other numbers, I will not quote them all because there is no need, just read the proposal. Anyway, knowing such numbers is undoubtedly necessary, but how could we observe the partial results from a more human perspective? I would like the proponent to have also suggested that a short report be made at the end of each event, explaining how the moment was, how the scientific community received the topics addressed, if some participants explicitly showed an interest in adopting Cardano's technologies in their projects, if they interacted well during the lectures, if there was any moment of integration between those involved (networkin), in short, qualitative data. In addition, I would also like to know how the pre-production process for these events took place, that is, if the work to be done to make the idea a reality was developed on time, in the right way and by the expected people. I would like to know if the two professionals mentioned as a team hired more people to form a team, such as designers and advertisers who would help form the visual identity and publicize the events, for example. So, in summary about the process, it would be useful for me to add to this number a more human analysis of the moments of encounter and also to monitor what was behind the events themselves. Regarding the final results, in my view the proponent approaches success in a superficial way, we know that the bigger goals would be \u201cto develop and strengthen the relationship between young STEM-oriented scientists and the Argentine community of Cardano\u201d, it is said how many scientists are expected that actually engage with the Cardano community (30) and how many proposals are expected to be generated from this project (5). However, it would be interesting to closely monitor those involved in the event, to find out how they absorbed the knowledge passed on, what projects would be born from there, if, in addition to the scientists, some students felt motivated to study about the technologies of our blockchain, as for example on Plutus... Finally, to trace a more specific notion of success. All this information (both progress and final results) must be easily accessible to the Cardano community, the proponent must gather them, for example, in online documents that are posted on some open google drive, in short, some way for all of us to verify these instances. Therefore, I will give 3 stars for this auditability, because I think it is ok but still has a lot to improve. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1166, "q0": "This team wants to present Cardano to the scientific community in the STEM areas claiming that there is currently no hub where this group of people can access, although this is a problem that is not exclusive to the scientific community in Argentina, I consider it a problem relevant enough to be addressed, due to the natural affinity that exists between the global scientific community and Cardano. Considering the spirit of Cardano and the type of events that are intended to be held, one way to improve the impact of this is the inclusion of reports or reports of lessons learned from the execution of these symposiums, since I consider that because they are so specific and In a community so in tune with Cardano, it would be nice if the global community could learn from their experience. Considering the amount requested, the events they plan to run, the audience they intend to reach, and the goals of success that the team proposes (30 new participating members of the Cardano community and 5 proposals from Catalyst) seem to me to be enough argument to give a rating. of 5 in the impact section.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "All the members of the team have relevant experiences and skills for the type of proposals, especially the person who is part of the main scientific organization of Argentina, the references to their link profile on linkedin allow me to validate experience, if it would have been interesting to know any paper or relevant investigative work of any of the team members. Regarding the budget requested, the team considered the requirements of the challenge, since it is in compliance with not exceeding 5% of the total budget for this challenge.
