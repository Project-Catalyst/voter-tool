The key is to be specifically tailored for videogamers who are interested in blickchain and adopting it.\nMaybe the connection with the challenge here is that this could be a metaverse hub, but I don\u2019t find it particularly well explained. Checkpoint is the platform that the proposer wants to leverage for bringing the content to the users http://www.checkpointhub.info/ .  Looks good and futuristic.\nUnfortunately I\u2019m not completely sure if this qualifies for a Cardano Hub, given that the hubs are local  and serve people that otherwise don\u2019t have access to the blockchain world.\nOn the other hand a metaverse hub will be very effective due to the small price per user acquisition.\nI neither agree nor disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal does not present a plan or a timeline for the development of this project. The only thing we have is Q4 for creation of the launch of  a Checkpoint Hub/Blockchain focused gaming magazine.\nThe proposer states that they will produce 1 magazine a quarter with a review at the end of the year to see if there is demand for more.\nThe proposer presents some kind of a budget breakdown but without much detail. Working hours and remuneration per hour, per profession are missing.\nWhat is important to be pointed out is that the biggest expense is for content creation.\nThe proposer explains that the magazine will create own revenue by advertising. Projections are for  $20K for the first year and $500K for the third year.\nThe team of two is presented but they did not link to their CVs and it took me some digging to find them for the voter to review if needed. https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamer-asfahani-622b2314/?originalSubdomain=uk and https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-elmes-3258a2b/?originalSubdomain=uk\nThe team looks well qualified to achieve the objectives of this proposal (creation of the e-magazine that is, I could not say about the advertising revenue projections.)\nThe only reason that I\u2019m tipping in the direction of feasibility is that the framework is build and ready, and this proposal is just for content creation.\nI agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability part is nonexistent.

The roadmap could be provided in more specific rather than Q4 of 2022, and with that also give a goal target for each quarter, also within each month (the progress, deliveries with the design and cover, etc.) Overall, a great and well written project, it could be better with the budget break downs and detailing its roadmap.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The metrics and KPIs is somewhat provided, however it\u2019s too general and too broad.
