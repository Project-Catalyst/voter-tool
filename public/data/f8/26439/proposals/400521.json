It\u2019s about filling the gap of the lack of awareness of cardano  in the french speaking west african community. The proposer has made it its mission to educate this community by eliminating the language barrier as well as communicating through different channels. This will certainly add value to the cardano ecosystem by onboarding new members to the community. Furthermore, the goal of this proposal is in line with the challenge settings. In addition to that, this proposal should be able to scale in future challenges. They have also detailed all the steps necessary to successfully achieve their goal. Altogether, I believe in the successful implementation of this proposal.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I have high confidence in the feasibility of this proposal. The principal reason why I think that this proposal can be successfully implemented is that the proposer has already built a youtube channel that provides great educational information on the cardano ecosystem. With a right boost, I think that they can do more, eventually with online and offline meetups. However, I suggest to proposers to make improvements on the redaction of the proposal. The first thing to do is to add linkedin profiles of the team members. Moreover, I suggest breaking down the budget a little more. Other than that, they have provided a timetable of 6 months to complete the work, which is good.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal is auditable because it includes the information necessary to track its progress. They have included a roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement. They have a window of 6 month to achieve their goal. I advocate for a period of 12 month which to me is a good timeframe to measure progress. Besides that, they have provided some KPIs that, I think, can be also improved. Altogether, I think that this is a good proposal.
