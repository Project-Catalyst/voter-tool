It updates the information of the Cardano ecosystem to the community, and create healthy environments for Chinese-speaking people who love Cardano. The proposed amount is less than 3% of the total value of the Challenge budget, this project is expected to bring great efficiency compared to costs. The solution to reach a large audience using social media is completely reasonable. It is an economical solution, not limited in distance and time, very suitable for a large community spread around the world. However, this approach is often difficult to make a profound impact because most of the information only goes one way. That\u2019s why it gets 4-stars for the Impact/Alignment rating.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It is quite impressive that the whole project will be done by only one girl with the nickname Bullish Dumpling. Her skills and experience can ensure the implementation of this idea as it has always been for the past 1 year. The information about her amazing works are very clear and easy for voters to check. The detailed plan and the timeline is not clear enough. Goals should be further broken down and have clear and reasonable deadlines. The requested fund for this proposal is only about 3% of the total budget for this Challenge. Expenses have been listed in 6 categories. It is relatively detailed and logical. It would be very risky for the project if Ms. Bullish Dumpling has health or contribution time issues. Therefore, it is advisable to consider recruiting more companions to develop a stronger project in the future and also reduce risks. Based on the provided information and the assessment as above, the proposal seems to be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The key metrics to measure the development of this proposal are quantified in numbers. The proposer also explains the reason why she set the KPIs in a realistic way. They are all countable and transparent, making it easy for the community to check and monitor the project. The KPIs all aim to grow in numbers, about 25% within 3 months. It is also a good way to evaluate the success of the project. However this type metric alone could not be enough.

The Hub she built successfully and the work she has made during the last 12 months is the strongest evidence for that. We can check on it with the links included.

About measuring the number of subscribers and the groups members, we can do quite easy based on the KPIs through the links which are provided for each group.\nI would recommend the author should give the number of subscribers and the number of two groups members in current.
