Under the heading \u201cPlease describe your proposed solution\u201d, you should be more specific about which part of the video content will provide information about Cardano to the community, I have a few suggestions as follows: basic concepts, how to invest, applications Practical application, updated information\u2026 The way you recognize the challenge and have a plan for it is quite reasonable, in addition, I would like to support you with an idea because it is a new youtube channel, the content quality is good and the number of videos is very important, in addition to building completely new videos, you can intertwine translating videos with useful content about Cardano, which will increase regular interaction with the community and does not take much time for video editing (note: remember to cite the source clearly)", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The timelines are suitable for those just starting to work on video editing, the budget is clear and reasonable. Two team members I think is enough to finish the video editing, but I have one worry, to complete a video takes a lot of time and effort, so the content must be precise, I recommend you should combine with a few advisors who specialize in blockchain to make things more convenient and accurate, what do you think of this suggestion?", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Subscriber count and view count are two very intuitive and easy quantifying metrics. In addition, you can provide more indicators of the number of videos, the total number of minutes taken, the communication channels to develop the community\u2026 And this proposal is a follow-up proposal in the previous Funds, an advantage big position.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1544", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3259, "q0": "Identify a challenging problem, large scale of impact. Indonesia is a large community. Therefore, the issue of providing the information of the Cardano ecosystem to them in Indonesian is essential for the Indonesian community to quickly grasp and understand Cardano more deeply. Identify a few problems of the challenge, make reasonable arguments. Creating youtube videos in Indonesian to capture the interest of the Indonesian community is a great solution. It helps to expand the Cardano community in Indonesia effectively, quickly, and sustainably. A number of risks have been raised, but no solution has been stated. I've seen them raise some difficult things like the new YouTube channel, it takes hours to complete the video. It would be great if this proposal was more clear about the difficulties they will face and there are some preventive solutions to those difficulties.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Clear, reasonable timeline with specific goals. The proposal specifies the timelines for completing each stage to complete 1 video in a month, 6 videos within 6 months. This plan is perfectly suitable, with a very high probability of completion.\n\nFund proposals of less than 20%, some expenditures need to be clarified. The budget for each job has been specifically divided. But it would be great to be able to see all the jobs calculated by man-hours performed. It's easier to imagine if we look at the cost per man-hour.\n\nMembers are assigned; Appropriate experience; Identity is easy to authenticate. The members are the ones who build the Cardano community in Indonesia. They have experience building and managing communities. This is very beneficial in the construction and completion of this project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There are KPIs/indicators, but all of them is difficult to measure. The proposal outlines two criteria for the growth of youTube channel subscriptions and the increase in the number of people watching videos. If you can specify the specific number for each of these targets when completing 6 videos, it will be easier to visualize and follow.\n\nNot yet defined success, not tested. I am well aware that they want to increase the number of members and people who are interested in the Cardano ecosystem in Indonesia. However, it would be a lot better if the proposal quantifies the number of views, the number of registrations after the completion of the project.\nIt has been funded but not related to this proposal. They have been funded for some proposals in fund 7. I checked the community links in their proposal and found this to be a really vibrant community, with a lot of information about Cardano being introduced to the community.
