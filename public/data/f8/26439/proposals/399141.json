We do not know, exactly, which activities will be developed within this library. On the feasibility part, the proponent explains that personalities (from the cryptographic world, I believe, because it doesn't make much sense for them to be well-known people who are not from the blockchain field) will be hired to lecture on \u201cmatters of national interest\u201d. What subjects would those be? How would the Cardano ecosystem benefit from these lectures and the other library activities? My understanding of this proposal is that the objective is to generate a more suitable place for school-aged students to concentrate and learn, but it is very inexact how this would all have to do with the cryptographic world, let alone Cardano. This challenge aims to fund projects that help expand our blockchain to more specific communities, unlike the challenge of new members on board. In this case, little is explained about the community that would be the target audience of this project. I researched a little about the Medie community, but I couldn't identify what country they are from, what language they speak, what their cultural characteristics would be. Another clue we have about where the people on this project would come from is through the professionals involved: it is revealed to us that Mr. John Kwame Afrane is an agent of fan milk Ghana ltd. With this, we concluded that the library would be built in that country, however, it was necessary for this information to be more accurate. Therefore, I consider that the impact of this proposal is, unfortunately, quite low, and could be improved with the following corrections. 1) The proponent should explain more about the activities carried out in that place, we know what their opening hours and target audience would be (although we know very superficially, as it is not given an exact age group that they would have or how many they would be). However, it is not clear how this would be a space for popularizing the Cardano ecosystem. 2) The proponent also needs to explain more about the local community so that we can understand how the proposal aligns with the specific challenge objectives. \n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The feasibility of the proposal is quite average, as all the information we need to know is passed on in a superficial way. Starting with the roadmap, we know which activities would be necessary for the development of the project, but these activities are not explained in detail. Let's cite as an example the first thing that would need to be done: \u201craising awareness of the existence of libraries in the community\u201d. How would this awareness be promoted? We are told that schools would be visited in person, but once the team was there, how would they explain to students, parents and teachers what space is and what are its objectives? Let's cite another example. \u201cRegistration of people to use the library\u201d - how would this registration be done? Could it be that decentralized identities from the Atala Prism project would be used? Or would it be a manual registration, which would be registered in some team file? Would only students be registered, or would teachers and parents also be registered? All activities, in my view, should have been better explained. I also notice that the proponent does not associate the activities with any notion of time, that is, we do not know how long each of them would last, in which months of the year 2022 such things are expected to be completed, etc. As a result, I cannot clearly visualize the process. Now talking about the budget, I believe that this part is better than the script, because it is explained in which small parts the total asking amount would be used. Some of them would require more detail as well, such as the \u201cprofessional fees for inviting personalities to a one-week program for each quarter within a 12-month period\u201d. It is not said how many personalities would be hired, so we were not able to clearly visualize the individual hiring value to determine whether the value is fair or not. Finally, speaking of the team, unfortunately this part is quite incomplete. They are actually a duo, but little is known about them. We only know their names and what their professional functions are, but it would be necessary for us to know a series of details such as: resumes that exemplify some of their previous work, in order to understand in what exact fields they have experience; their linkedin profiles or even other platforms that could prove the information that was said; it would also be necessary for them to explain how they are involved with our ecosystem. How did you meet Cardano? Do you have any experience with our blockchain, and if so, what? For these reasons, I believe the feasibility isn't all bad, but it has a lot to improve. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The indicators cited by the proponent are good ways to understand if the progress of the proposal is in fact satisfactory: monthly reports that explain how the activities and movement of the library are going, direct feedback from users through suggestion boxes and the maintenance of the daily attendance records of users. I agree that through these factors we can understand the partial success of the project, but it is not clear how all this information will reach the members of the Cardano community. Ideally, all this would be forwarded in a summarized and very practical way to us, and there are several ways to submit such indications, such as: online files through google docs, for example; tools like Miro and Notion; or through the telegram and discord channels of the community. I would also like to see a follow-up of the work routine of the professionals involved, but for that it would be necessary for them to specify precisely what the role of each of the pair would be. Now, talking about the final scenario, the auditability of this part is worse, as the expected results are very abstract: it is about students visiting the library frequently and also improving their school performance. But what about the Cardano ecosystem? How could we measure the ultimate impact of this project on our blockchain? After all, if the project is to be financed, it must bring some kind of advantage to Cardano. Therefore, it is essential that the proponent clarify how this relationship can be measured, perceived and informed. It should set goals related to this, such as how the library's activities specifically benefited our blockchain; for that, it would be necessary for us to know which themes were addressed in the speeches of the personalities. Also if the students who attend the library learned the basics about the cryptographic world, if this information was passed on to their families and if with that there was the popularization of Cardano. This popularization could be measured according to the increase in investment in Ada, creation of digital wallets, purchase of CNFT and much more. Once the proponent gathers these indicatives, they must be taken to the community through one of the platforms I mentioned earlier, in the partial results part. Finally, my opinion is that he was doing well with the auditing part of the process, but the level dropped a lot with the final results as nothing is mentioned regarding our blockchain, so the auditability needs to be reviewed. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2621, "q0": "I checked the geolocation of Medie, Ghana. This is an undeveloped, moderately densely populated place, I'm not sure if everyone here has a phone, however, it's very difficult to go door-to-door and announce that there is a library.

At the same time, I have a suggestion, set up a loudspeaker to broadcast the news, broadcast news according to a specific time frame, both creating curiosity for people and updating people's news every day, which can attract attention. everyone.

The Budget is clearly laid out and is 3.8% of the challenge's total budget, so it falls within the preferred bracket of not exceeding 5%. The budget covers basic running costs for 12 months and startup resources, like computers rent ect. This hub will be a CTH (brick and mortar hub) and the challenge requires that a CTH may only apply for 1/5th of their cost to launch.
