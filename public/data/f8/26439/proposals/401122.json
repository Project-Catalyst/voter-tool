There is no doubt that America and Europe make up most of the Cardano Community and Africa is clearly has untapped potential. The proposer briefs the community about how they plan to tackle this hurdle. The plan to set up an information hub, host events and meets, and conduct workshops and exhibitions are proven ways to indulge the people and make them aware of the Cardano ecosystem and its capabilities. However, the team makes note of the possible risks and challenges involved but provides no plausible solution for those. Probably, in my personal opinion, the involvement of trusted entities such as Banks, Government bodies could draw more people cause they bring a sense of trust and dependability along with them. However, the plan, on the whole, looks promising and the funding will be the essential key to drive it in a steady and fruitful manner.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team makes a clear plan on how it proposes to achieve its goals. The timeframe of 3-4 months lies well within the expectations of campaigns requirements and has all the traits of reaching people and becoming an \"MVH\" (minimum-viable hub) well before the next funding rounds, in case the team plans to expand its reach. The funds requested are also well within the boundary set by the challenge which is not more than 5% of the total allocation. The team makes sure it provides the community with a detailed plan about what the community can expect on a monthly basis and at the end of 4 months what would be achieved, and as a reader, the plans look reasonable in every way. The team put together to bring this project to life looks promising too. The 5 member team has a variety of people in it and almost covers all fields that a newcomer might need a mentor for. And the involvement of a translator makes the plan more accomplishable. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer makes a brief note of all the metrics that can be used during the auditing process. These metrics are very much in line with the challenge's requirements. The successful setup of a self resilient information hub is clearly the biggest metric that can depict the success of the proposal and quite enough to help the community see its success. But the team makes a mention of achieving all these within the time frame of 3-4 months and I personally feel that it would be a little overestimated and the numbers would not be great for such a short span of time considering, the target audience is from Africa, which is still largely under-exploited. Probably the metrics would not sum up to great numbers. Being a new proposal on the catalyst, I feel the proposer should plan to extend their plan to a bigger time frame such as 8-12 months as expected in the campaign brief to make sure quality information is imparted to people and a lot of patrons are retained and trained efficiently to make the metrics more attractive during the audit process.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal effectively address the challenge of scaling up the Cardano Community in Africa.

The office also has a logo and signboard on the outside for everyone can see.\n- The project has specific Offline Marketing solutions such as: organization of mini exhibitions and workshops to showcase the application of blockchain technologies or create flyers, stickers, pull-ups, brochures, key rings, badges, banners etc, will be developed in different languages \u200b\u200bfor ease of understanding\n- The project helps Ghanaians to easily access information and knowledge about Cardano and Blockchain.\n- The project is a channel to help Cardano be promoted to Ghana. Besides helping to train a knowledgeable community to suport Cardano in the future in Ghana.\n- The project also gives Ghanaians who are passionate about Blockchain a place to share knowledge and learn from like-minded people.\n***Projects that need improvement:\n- The project has not specified who is the target customer group? What characteristics should they have? Avoid wasting resources by communicating to those who do not need it\n- Online marketing solutions are still general and not specific. Online marketing solutions need to be more focused with more specific solutions to reach more people with less cost.\n- The approach to removing the fear of Ghanaians about cryptocurrency projects is not really effective enough.\n***Suggestions/Tips:\n- The project needs to identify the target customer portrait:\nWhat kind of people does the project want to communicate to? For example, only communicate to people who love technology, new technology, people aged 18-40. The more specific, the higher the marketing effect will be.\n- There are many effective online marketing solutions such as: Building a knowledge sharing channel on youtube in local languages, building a facebook group to share knowledge, telegram group...\nThis will help the project reach more people at a cheaper cost.\n- The direct approach solution has eliminated the fear of Cryptocurrency projects that will not be effective if they do not have enough information and knowledge about Blockchain. The project needed a tool to provide knowledge on a regular and long-term basis to the client. When customers have enough information and knowledge, they will be easier to accept, even actively contact to ask to participate. The specific tools here are online marketing channels.

Besides, Cardano's amount of knowledge is difficult and a lot of information is constantly updated. The translators must be people with blockchain technical knowledge. Therefore, it takes time to find and train the suitable people.\n- The project needs to have a specific plan for maintaining and taking care of the community in the future: When the community is expanded, the amount of work will be more and there needs to be a care process,\nprotect the community against fraudulent information.\n- Build information packages suitable for each level: Beginners, people with basic knowledge, people with in-depth knowledge...", "q1r": 4, "q2": "- The project has built a website to provide information to the community\n- The project listed 6 indicators to be able to evaluate the success of the project\n- The project has specific images in Offline training sessions\n\n***Projects that need improvement:\n- There is no specific commitment number for each indicator in each period\n- There is no tool to measure the indicators\n***Suggestions/Tips:\n- The project needs to provide specific commitment figures for each indicator\neg: After the first month of operation, how many people will come to the center in 1 day. After 1 month, it will calculate how many % are new customers, how many % are old customers, from which there will be a specific way to develop the project.\n- Online measurement tools can be easily built on the website with the number of visitors and registrations.
