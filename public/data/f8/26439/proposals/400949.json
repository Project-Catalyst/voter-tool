The budget have been broken down to details of which marketing type the proposer chooses.

I am completely convinced", "q1r": 5, "q2": "the number of Yoroi wallets is a suitable quantification.

We need to also keep in mind that the $37,500 budget is 7.5% of the total challenge fund, which exceeded the ideal 5% maximum asking funding for each project. My suggestion would be to split this project into 2 or 3 different Fund, since it is a 12 months project. All in all, a well written and comprehensive proposal, only missing the budgeting detail into more detailed manner for each allocation area. For example: how will the media advertisement budget will be used? Because $10,000 is a lot to only generalize it, we need to see what kind of advertisement medium that they will use, etc.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal provides roadmap with milestones.
