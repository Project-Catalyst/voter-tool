How can we reach this market in the best way?", "f6_no_assessments": 6, "f6_rating": 3.2777777777777772, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"q0": "Theoretically, the idea is good and fits the objectives of the challenge, however, the proposal is explained in a very superficial way. Overall, the proponent intends to create a local community center that would serve Philadelphia and surrounding communities to attend conferences on Cardano. From what I understand, the place would be geared towards debate, learning and exchanging experiences in relation to our blockchain. This seems quite relevant given that, according to the proponent \u201cthere is an untapped market in the Philadelphia tri-state area of \u200b\u200buniversities with IT departments, technology companies, financial companies and many crypto enthusiasts\u201d. In other words, the field is fertile, there are several people who can potentially become active members of the Cardano community, whether through participation in Catalyst as CA, vCAs; or even by submitting proposals; perhaps these people would buy and delegate Ada, increasing investment in our currency; In short, there are several ways in which this group could be involved in the activities and opportunities of our ecosystem. However, as I said at the beginning of the analysis, the proposal as a whole is very abstract, we know that conferences would take place, but what issues would be addressed exactly? Who would present these lectures? How would the local public be motivated to participate? How often would they happen? It is true that the United States is one of the countries in which blockchain technology already has more strength and is well known, but that does not exclude the need for the proponent to make it very clear how he will captivate the common citizen, who does not know what he is doing. is about blockchain, to participate in these events. Even those who already have some involvement with Cardano: how will they find out about such conferences? For me, the most important thing was to clarify these two things: how people would be notified of these meetings and also what content would be covered exactly at each conference. The proposal aligns with the challenge as we seek here to develop and expand knowledge about Cardano for a specific audience, and I believe that the proponent would be focusing a lot on the local community with this project, but it would also be interesting for him to explain how the specificities of the group in issue would be taken into account when promoting the events. Summing up my opinion, I think the idea makes sense with the challenge in theory, but in practice, it lacks a lot of detail. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is low. The script is very superficial, we know only superficially what would be done according to the weeks. For example, it would take 5 weeks to do a \u201cComprehensive Extension and Market Research\u201d. As well? What would a comprehensive extension be? How would market research be done? One month of the project would be dedicated to \u201cAdvertising Campaign Design, Event Planning, Infrastructure Setup\u201d. These things are quite different and require a lot of work and effort individually, and it would be necessary for the bidder to explain each of them in detail. For example, advertising campaign design, it would be important to know what strategies would be taken, as design is a very broad area that can involve the realization of illustrations, marketing campaigns on social media, dissemination through posters in cities... From How would this be done, within the various existing possibilities? Regarding event planning, this part encompasses many, many actions. The physical space would have to be chosen, who would present the conferences (who would be the speakers), how the target audience would be approached, what specific content would be the focus of each meeting and so on. All activities cited by the proponent should be further explained. I also think that the way he explains the passage of time is kind of confusing, some activities would happen in parallel, so it would be better if he split the time into weeks, and accurately scored what would be done each week and in what order. Leaving now for the analysis of the budget, the proponent asks for the amount of 27,500 dollars to carry out this project. The explanation of the use of this money is also superficial, the proponent divides the total amount in percentages, allocating how much each part of the project would need. For example in \u201cInfrastructure, Equipment, Labor: 50%\u201d how much would go to infrastructure, how much to equipment and how much to labor? How many people would work on the project and for how many days a week? In this way, we would have an idea of \u200b\u200bthe price of their working hours, if an exact value was assigned to how much money would go towards wages. I think that part of the proposal is totally inappropriate. And finally, about team, no team is presented. We don't know who the people involved were, their professional backgrounds, what previous experiences they had, how they would relate to the Cardano ecosystem... Anyway, nothing is said about it, so no confidence is passed in a team that we don't know. . We only have information about the proponent, but we would need to have information about everyone involved. In general, all parts of this topic need to be rephrased. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The auditability of the project is also not good. There are no safe ways to monitor either the process or the final results. Starting with the process, all that the proponent tells us are some things that could serve as indicators for the partial success of the project, I believe, namely: \u201cImpressions, Calls, Clicks, Conversions, Subscriptions and Participants\u201d. But these words are presented quite loosely, we don't know how to clearly correlate them with the development of the project. What I suggest is that, after the proposer reformulates the script, dividing the time into weeks and explaining in more detail the activities that would be developed and each of them, he should make a weekly report and send it to the Cardano community. This report should contain a summary of how everyone's work went that week, whether everyone involved in the project fulfilled their obligations in that time period, whether there were any problems, delays or dissonances, whether the week's goals were achieved, and so on. This report could be written and posted on some online platform, such as Notion or Google Docs. As the weeks went by, the proponent could develop this platform by adding the respective files each week. Regarding the final result, the proponent says that success would be perceived with the holding of the first face-to-face event, with the participation and feedback of the target audience. But I think the final scenario should target all encounters, not just the first one, right? All conferences should be monitored, so that we know if everything went the way it was planned. A survey could also be carried out on how these conferences impacted the local community, if the investment in our blockchain has become a reality, how these advances in relation to Cardano can be perceived, etc. All this can also be posted on the online sharing apps that I have suggested, and in this way, the final scenario of success should be traced. Therefore, I think auditability still has a lot to improve, the way it is presented to us is not possible to have a clear view of how this process could be done. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The Proposer wants to create Hubs in the Philadelphia Tri-State area, that will introduce people to and provide information regarding the Cardano ecosystem.

It is clear he has a passion for Cardano, and I appreciate the fact that he made a vidie to introduce himself and describe his plan in brief. It is always nice to see an actual person talking about his proposal.\nThis round of the challenge is more focused on creating MVHs (Minimum Viable Hubs). The proposer is requesting USD 27500 which is 0.5% over the preferred total Challenge budget of 5%, so is very close to the preferred percentage.\nI feel the budget could be broken down a little more, like Marketing - how much would go towards Social media, Print Media, Radio or what else he has planned. The Infrastrucrure and labour budget is 50% of the requested funds. Maybe break this down also a bit, stating what equipment, resources and their cost, the hrs of labour and the rate per hour charged etc. This will make it easier to see if the requested funds are realistic. Indicate if additional funding would be required in future as the Hub/s grow. Set out your team and their exprience and what they will be bringing to the table, like who will be presenting, educating people at events or seminars.\nThis is a good first proposal. Keep on working on it.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer does provide a Road Map / Time line, which is good, but I would have liked to see him project a bit further than 3 months, and the amount of members and organizations he hopes to onboard over 3, 6 and 12 months. \nHe hopes to achieve a 10% conversion from his attendees to attend regular events.  It would be good to indicate how the progress of the Hub/s will be reported, will it be via twitter, Facebook ect so that the community can follow progress.
