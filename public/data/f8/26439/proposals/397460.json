However, the Japanese have a large language barrier to access information about blockchain technology written in languages \u200b\u200bother than Japanese.\n- The project is an extension of the vcoincheck 1.0 project but in Japanese language. Help the Japanese community have more information and knowledge about blockchain as well as cryptocurrency projects. Through the project, many Japanese will be able to evaluate which Cryptocurrency projects are good and which are scams, thereby avoiding financial losses and having a better life. More Japanese people will know Cardano.\n- The project also helps many Japanese to have more knowledge about Blockchain, Cardano will have more quality CAs as well as many additional quality proposals for Catalyst.\n- The project also helps many Vietnamese who know Japanese to have more income from the new job of translating and analyzing cryptocurrency projects.\n***Suggestions/ advices:\n- Project to find Vietnamese people who know Japanese in Japanese language training centers. At these centers, the level is not really uniform, so if the project can provide specific selection criteria, the efficiency will be higher. For example: Japanese language level of N3 or higher and interest in technology will be a priority.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "- The project is an extension of the Vcoincheck 1.0 project, besides having a clear implementation plan every month, the workload is not too much, mainly translation and training, so the project is completely feasible.\n- The project has been carefully planned and calculated: the work items are allocated and detailed monthly according to a reasonable schedule.\n- The project has a plan to interact with the community through periodic Zoom meetings. This will help the project owner evaluate the effectiveness of the project through the number of people attending the zoom meeting from which to make adjustments on how to do it.\n- Reasonable budget allocation for each item. In addition, the project took advantage of available things such as a professional Zoom account and did not ask for capital in these categories.\n- Strong team with many suitable skills to execute and develop the project\n- Information about each member is transparent and clear, and can be connected at any time\n- Rich blockchain experience\n***Suggestions/ advices:\n- Currently the project's planning focuses largely on how to build a good product and Marketing mainly through face-to-face or passive meetings. Marketing strategy is an extremely important part of the project to attract more Japanese to know and join the team. Therefore, the project needs to have a more detailed online marketing plan with many online marketing plans suitable for the Japanese market.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "- The project has its own website\n- The given project indicators are useful and completely measurable through the project's website\n- The project gives a committed number for each criterion to be completed in each phase\n- The project describes very clearly and in detail the goals the project will achieve to describe the success of the project.\n- Indicators can be easily measured publicly through the project's website as well as the number of people participating in periodic zoom meetings.\n- Measuring website traffic is also very simple with a small add-on\n***Suggestions/ advices:\n- The project builds more Marketing categories to attract the community as much as possible because this is an online product. Resources spent are the same for different users. For example, in a zoom meeting to share knowledge, the resources used to share with 10 people are not much different from sharing with 1000 people.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1192", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1369, "q0": "We acknowledge that Japan is one of the biggest markets of Cardano and the community for this market is also big too.

English is not a parent language of this market, so the project to translate knowledge of Cardano and Catalyst to Japanese is very necessary. After having content for suitable language, we can create a lot of things such as the library, course, webinar,...for people of the Japanese community.

Currently, English is considered a common language for the whole world, but the number of people who can use English fluently is very small and there is still a language barrier. Therefore, the exchange of culture and knowledge is still limited. The proposed approach to solve this problem is to build a website for project evaluation, where information about the project can be found, as well as sources of knowledge that are scientifically synthesized and methodical and translated into Japanese. This will help a large number of Japanese people to better understand the Cardano ecosystem, increase adoption and raise awareness. In addition, it is also a cooperation between two countries, Vietnam and Japan, creating a sustainable community in the spirit of learning from each other.

Because at present in Vietnam, the development community sharing knowledge and experience on assessing the quality of cryptocurrency projects is in a rather narrow scope. Building a community center on the basis of your existing website Vcoincheck is really useful because it will save the initial cost but still create an effective community spread. However, the language barrier is still quite large because currently Vietnamese people know a lot of Japanese, but the Japanese language for specialties is not really much.

The solution is simply a swap exchange knowledge between the working expats.  The more advanced solution should not only be stopped at the translation, the team also propose the training course for deeper and more interactive communication. It would be more holistic approach if the proposing team can really understand the needs of Japanese community. Moreover, the risk is only mentioned about the language barriers. The proposal is an extentional feature based on the ecosystem of VCoincheck.io, this would be really encouraging for language adaptation to grow the community, thus the proposal is well aligned with the challenge setting of  Scale-UP Cardano's Community Hubs.
