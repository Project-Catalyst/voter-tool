This is excellent and directly responds to the challenge of getting the average person to participate in Cardano. The other elements of this proposal which clearly align with the challenge are the fact that it is in keeping with the minimum viable hub principle, provides a path for sustainability and is scalable at very low cost. The proposal KPIs also align with those of the challenge to the extent that it seeks to measure and identify members drawn to their discord channels, number of views and interactions within their social networks as well as number of people who participate in Innovatio activities and can be onboarded. The proposal fully addresses the challenge and clearly earns 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the profiles of the team in the attached pdf document, they have the relevant expertise and experience to successfully implement the proposal. The team also has experience in the Catalyst community and is active in digital spaces. The Innovatio brand started in fund 3 and solidified in fund 6 and have been successfully running the hub on the discord platform for the past three months. Links to their online events have been provided in the proposal. Based on the above, they have a track record of successful proposal implementation. \nThe proposal provides clear goals to be achieved including a list of activities, events and social networks to be utilized to achieve these goals. A roadmap detailing what will be done within a specific timeframe would however enhance the feasibility of the proposal and the extent to which progress can be monitored. Also, requested funds for this proposal is $30,000 however totals of the budgeted amounts come up to $27,600. Proposers should kindly rectify this error.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers provide a number of metrics by which progress will be measured and this can be verified from their digital channels. In addition proposers indicate that the Community will be given daily updates to promote community engagement. Reference is made to an actual Workflow document which is supposed to be attached.

All well structured and very good ideas to improve the discord community. Each of the contributions to be made in the proposal are very interesting and will surely improve this community.
