I must say that from my experience I agree with what the team proposes since we are seeing more and more proposals coming from this country, this is a clear sign of the permeability of the ecosystem in this society. To improve this proposal I would recommend the team the following: 1) In the solution section it describes \"...workshops in Cardano community and attract newcomers.\" but it does not explain the details of these workshops or outreach methodologies to attract these newcomers, although I can understand that the focus of these events will be networking for the generation of new teams and ideas, the topics that will be discussed in these workshops as well as the speakers will be key to increase or not the level of attendance and retention of these events. 2) Improve alignment with one of the principles of this challenge, which is \"Delivering information to people who would not otherwise have the access.\" Why do I say this? basically because I do not see any outreach initiative as such and in fact in response to the question \"Please describe how your proposed solution will address the challenge?\" the team responded that through communication in their meetup channels, LATAM TOWNHALL discord and twitter. While organically new interested people could reach these channels and receive the information, this proposal would be more robust if it presented actions on how to address this principle proactively. 3) To evaluate the impact it is important to analyze the proposed metrics versus the impact that the challenge expects, and here I do not see a direct alignment unfortunately, the proposal addresses the number of participants in the events, when the challenge expects that new Cardano Onboarded users can be measured. Yes, it can be argued that there is a high probability that whoever participates in the events will become an ADA holder, but it would be necessary for the team to track this information. Based on the above, I assign a value of 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The core members of this team are the organizers of the Cardano Summit Buenos Aires as well as being the moderators of the Cardano Blockchain Buenos Aires group which has 655 members, this for me counts as sufficient evidence to be in compliance with this requirement, it also describes the roles and the number of people who would be involved in the implementation. The budget is divided in enough items so that the logic behind the amount requested can be understood, the values seem to me to be in line with the Argentinean market and complies with the requirement of not exceeding 5% of the budget of the challenge. Due to the purpose of this proposal the implementation plan is not expected to be complex, and it is not. They present a series of actions that, although simple, meet the minimum expected from my point of view. Regarding the risks, they only describe what they believe to be the only risk, but do not present a countermeasure to address it, perhaps the possibility of hosting events outdoors? or semi-enclosed spaces? online? The problem of the high dropout rate of this type of events is not addressed either, I would have expected some kind of attendee retention strategy from the team. Overall, taking into account the experience of the proponents, the amount requested and the low complexity of the actions, I agree with the allocation of funds from a feasibility point of view. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditability in this type of proposal is really simple, and the team that prepared this proposal approaches it in the right way. They propose to make a record through photos and videos of each event. I would recommend complementing this with alternative measures so that the community can check the level of participation as planned. Regarding the definition of metrics / KPIs presents 3 metrics, the first I took as an example in the impact section that although it is not directly with what the challenge asks is necessary to measure it, the second where they intend to double the members of the Cardano Blockchain Buenos Aires meetup and finally match 30 investors with projects. The metrics seem to me appropriate and simple to measure. I would add, minimally number of proposals in Catalyst as a result of networking in these events and new Cardano wallets per event to improve alignment with the challenge.

The proposer has identified a need for a hub in caradano blockchain in Argentina and has also worked towards the implementation which is impressive and it will attract a lot of people to get involved in this and hence increase the popularity and face value of the cardano ecosystem.

The proposal should verbalize how the team intends to build up the Community Hub and drive adoption and awareness through its activities, empowering people on the ground level. There is a good point that post-Covid it\u2019s nice to meet people face-to-face.

The proposers have already been organizing the Buenos Aires Summit 2021 and they are active participants in the LATAM community.

One event will cost less than $1,000. This is definitely value for money.\n\nThe only risk mentioned is Covid-related. Therefore, it would be good to know what happens to the proposal if yet another variant sweeps over Argentina and all public events are canceled.
