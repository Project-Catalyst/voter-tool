The idea is to create a series of videos that teach the Haskell programming language to Vietnamese. The justification for such a project is necessary and that this type of content is lacking for the natives of Vietnam, and really, this type of learning is usually only available in English, and for those who do not have this as their mother tongue it becomes doubly complicated. of learning. There is also the fact that Haskell is not such an accessible language for people who know how to program in other languages, this makes it even more important that this course is created. I found it very positive how the proponent explains exactly the topics covered in the course (Type Haskell, Syntax in, Functions, recursion, Higher-order functions, modules, Making our own types and type classes, Input and output, Solving problems functionally, monoids and Monads). This gives us complete clarity about the content of each video created. It is also great to know that the course was based on a book recommended by the IOHK itself, this conveys a lot of confidence in relation to the validity of the theory studied. The project fits the objectives of the challenge as it will definitely help to popularize Cardano for a specific group of people (programming students from Vietnam), respecting their specificities (such as the spoken language). In addition to everything I have already said, it is also very relevant how the proponent intends to make a question and answer session to help even more students in possible difficulties that they may face only in asynchronous moments. Therefore, I think this proposal will have maximum impact. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the script, this part is great, we know exactly what will be produced in each month of the project, I really have no criticisms to make on this part since the proponent detailed how many videos will be created and what their themes are. Speaking of the budget, I believe that it is very simple to understand the amount requested because it corresponds to the value of the time used to produce the videos and also the exercises. In my opinion, the amount charged for the hour of work is a little expensive, compared to other proposals for similar activities, however it is at the discretion of other readers, CAs and voters to form their opinion whether the price charged is adequate or not. Now speaking in relation to the team, more information is provided about some members (Mrs Hannah for example) than others (Mr Curtis D'Alves for example). Ideally, the same level of detail would be available on both. However, analyzing the trust that is passed on to the team, I think they seem to be well qualified people, we have an experienced haskell programmer, a translator for Vietnam and a very active woman in the Cardano community, I mean, we have all the necessary functions so that this team is complete and well qualified for the respective tasks of the project. In short, I think the feasibility is very good, just needing a little more details about the first two team members and, in my opinion, the hourly rate charged is a little high, but as I said, this It could just be my view and I could be wrong. I think the team has generally provided us with the information we need to be confident in the feasibility of the project. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I think the partial results of this project are very simple to evaluate, because we can see the videos posted on youtube and the exercises uploaded on github. These are clear ways of auditing deliveries, little by little. I think it would also be interesting to have information about the tasks of the professionals, necessary for these small goals to be achieved. If there were some way to audit the pre-production of the generated materials, the auditability of the progress would go up. And finally, speaking of the final deliverables and how it would be possible for us to audit them, the proponent explains to us quite extensively several ways that success would be viewed, such as \u201cPlutus Pioneer Program participants will also get the basics of Haskell to learn from most effectively\u201d and \u201cafter 6 months, we will help at least 50 people join the Plutus Pioneer Program course and 10 proposals submitted on Catalyst through the Haskell Course For Beginner\u201d. These are both qualitative and quantitative data, provided that these nominees are duly presented in the monthly meetings with the challenge teams. So I think auditability is almost perfect, just add some way to audit the tasks in the first part of the monitoring analysis. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 4, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 591, "q0": "- Haskell is a functional programming language, a different way of thinking about programming compared to other programming languages. This is one of the barriers for other language programmers in Vietnam to switch to haskell. It is this that limits the development of projects in the Cardano ecosystem.\n- This proposal focuses on the Vietnamese community of programmers. This is a dynamic community with young people eager to learn and easily receptive to new knowledge. This will make the project more feasible and efficient. In addition to other language programmers, the proposal also targets a very large customer base who do not know anything about programming but have a passion for programming as well as the Cardano project. This helps to train new programmers with new ideas, making the Cardano ecosystem richer. Each new project will attract new people to the Cardano ecosystem.\n- The proposal has specific content for each learning module and has built a video channel with 30 videos in the past 2 years\n- The project has solutions to care, interact and solve users' problems after taking the course, which will help learners understand more deeply and apply it to real work.\n- The video is publicly uploaded to youtube. Besides, the exercise is freely downloadable on github which is a plus point for the proposal. This publicity will be very effective, helping more people in Vietnam to access Haskell language.\n***Suggestions/ advices:\n- This proposal focuses on the Vietnamese community, who have a big barrier to technical English but have not seen the proponent offer to translate courses, videos into Vietnamese or not. If there is a translation into Vietnamese it would be a great thing and should be added to the proposal to increase its effectiveness.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "- The proposal has a clear work plan for 6 months\n- Modules have been divided into each level to make it easier for users to absorb. A youtube channel is available to share basic haskell knowledge in English\n- There are already 2 Vietnamese communities who love projects on the Cardano platform\n- The budget allocated for each video is reasonable because the video can be used by many people and many times\n- Team with the right experience and suitable skills to develop the project\n+ Mr. Curtis D'Alves is someone with many years of experience with the Haskell language. Mr Curtis D'Alves has also built a youtube channel with 30 videos available on Haskell basics in the past 2 years.\n+ Ms. Hannah is someone who has experience in building Vietnamese communities. Currently managing a community with 40,000 members in Vietnam\n+ Mr. Quang Daniel is an English teacher with translation skills as well as pedagogical skills that can support the proposal\n***Projects that need improvement:\n- It is proposed to have a specific plan to exploit the 2 existing Vietnamese communities\n- It is recommended to have a specific marketing plan to attract the community\n- Time to complete the job is a bit long. According to the proposal, 1 month will publish 2 tutorial videos, 2 exercise videos, 2 exercise solution videos. Total is 6 videos. Estimated time to complete these 6 videos is: 6x2 + 5x2 + 5x2 = 32 hours. Minus the rest time, holidays, 1 month is still quite a long time\n***Suggestions/ advices:\n- This proposal needs to recalculate the monthly work allocation time to get a more suitable time period. With 6 videos as in the proposal, the completion time of about 15 days is reasonable.\n- Add more specific marketing plans suitable for the Vietnamese community such as Facebook ads, Zalo, Zoom meeting... so that more members of the 2 existing communities know the proposal, in addition, reach more people more outside the community, to increase the viability of the project: For example, it is possible to cooperate with reputable Haskell teachers in Vietnam", "q1r": 4, "q2": "- It is proposed to build a youtube channel, github link and 2 Vietnamese community groups on facebook \n-Proposal have clear commit metrics and are easily auditable via youtube views, github downloads\n- The proposal sets out a clear objective of describing the success of the project. It can be easily measured through the number of students attending the zoom once every 2 weeks. The number of students participating in the Plutus Pioneer Program can also be measured through student testimonials. The number of proposals submitted on Catalyst through Haskell Course For Beginner is also easily measurable.\n***Suggestions/ advices:\n- This proposal should include a plan to record zoom participants every 2 weeks to assess the number of new and old participants. From there, it is possible to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the project in a short time.\n- Proposal can also reward students with good results or proposals funded by Catalyst to encourage students to study as well as accurately measure the amount of funded proposals of course students.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1192", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you very much for taking the time to assess our proposal.\n\nImpact: We submitted 2 proposals for a Haskell course with 2 different developers. One proposal is Haskell Course for Beginner (in English) - link: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/399961 This Proposal focuses on building Haskell courses for Vietnamese. That means all contents of this proposal will be done in Vietnamese. Therefore, Vietnamese developers will not face any language barriers\n\nFeasibility: We made it very clear in the proposal \"We are also admin for several communities interested in Cardano who want to become developers to create projects on Cardano. We will be sharing this course with these communities.\" We will share video lessons and exercise links will be in the description of the video. Besides, Youtube also has a video recomend mechanism when users search for tags like: Haskell Course, Haskell Course for Beginner, Haskell tutorial, Haskell for Plutus, .... will find our videos. This is the most effective way to market at no extra cost\nThere are many people who have participated in IOHK's Plutus Pioneers Program and they have a lot of problems with Plutus because they have no knowledge of Haskell. They talked to us about their problem and wanted us to create a Haskell Course for Beginner (50+ people). That's why we have the goal \"After 6 months we will help at least 50 people join the Plutus Pioneer Program course\" and it's doable.\nAssessor said that: \"Time to complete the job is a bit long\" I think this makes our proposal more feasible, doesn't it? Because we will have more time to edit the content and get more feedback from the community. We only charge for 6 working hours per video and 5 working hours per exercise. But we put a lot of time and energy into making this course. So I think this is a good thing for other proposals because we're just trying to get a small cost, not a problem that needs improvement.\nYou can see that IOHK's Plutus Pioneers Program also only publishes 1 video/week. Because, learners need time to practice and review knowledge. If we publish more than 6 videos/month, learners will not have time to review the knowledge they have learned. Because beginners need more time to learn Haskell than experienced programmers\n\nAuditability: The assessor suggested that: \"This proposal should include a plan to record zoom participants every 2 weeks to assess the number of new and old participants. From there, it is possible to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the project in a short time.\"\nBut we create Zoom Q&A sessions every 2 weeks to answer learners' questions. Learners just need to leave a comment with the problem below the video. We will show them how to solve those problems in the zoom meeting. This means that these zoom sessions are only used to help answer some of the learners' problems, if any. Only those who leave comments on their problems below the video have the need to join the zoom session. But if no one has a problem (no one attends the zoom session to get their questions answered) then this means that the lessons and exercises have helped learners fully understand the knowledge. Thus, \"assess the number of new participants and the number of old participants.\" cannot be used to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the project in a short time\".\nThe assessor also suggested that: \"Proposal can also reward students with good results or proposals funded by Catalyst to encourage students to study as well as accurately measure the amount of funded proposals of course students..\" This is an interesting idea, but if we give students a reward, the total amount of funding needed for this proposal will increase, but the effect will not be significant. Because those who can learn effectively and truly grow should learn for themselves, not for rewards. When they really want to learn Haskell to advance their career with Cardano, they don't need a reward in this course. The most valuable thing they need is knowledge, not reward. If we have a reward for learners, it can create a few problems such as: They will ask others to do the exercise to receive the reward, they only attend the course for the reward,......"}, {"id": 6602, "q0": "This is a great idea because the haskell course in vietnamese will help remove the language barriers and eventually attract more developers in the cardano ecosystem. The impact of this proposal should be without a doubt positive for the community. For that reason I think that this proposal is within the scope of this challenge. The proposer has also articulated how it will add value to the cardano ecosystem. I think that Cardano needs more people capable of building dapps and initiatives like that can help attract more developers that otherwise won\u2019t be able to get this information.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I believe in the successful implementation of this proposal based on the information provided by the proposer. However  there are some improvements that can be done to make the proposal better. I suggest to the proposers to define a clear marketing campaign. It\u2019s one thing to build a good product, it is another thing to make people use it. Some people say build it and they will come but I think that marketing should be part of the plan. Furthermore, I suggest to the proposer to add the linkedin profiles of the team members instead of their telegram accounts. This will help build trust and increase our confidence in a successful implementation of this proposal. Other than that, the proposer should be able to complete the work successfully.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Since this is a course, this proposal should be easily auditable. The proposers have included a roadmap and milestones to complete the video production.

As a digital marketer, I know how hard it could be to attract users. The space is competitive and people should market their products to stand out from the crowd.
