Fun approachable ways to learn are hard to find.", "f6_no_assessments": 10, "f6_rating": 4.133333333333334, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"q0": "I liked the idea and I think it relates well to the goals of the challenge. It's about creating a space that is both a caf\u00e9 and a learning center about Cardano at the same time. The intention is that people can go there to have a snack while, in a space separated by a glass wall (according to the proponents, to arouse curiosity), these learning sessions take place, which will be attended by two different parts: people quite beginners in the cryptographic world and those who wish to delve into the subject. I find it positive how proponents cite what subjects specifically will be covered in these classes, from a basic level with \u201cthings like wallets, staking/mining and all the things blockchain is being used for, like tracking logistics, voting, identity storage.\u201d , file storage\u201d; to a more advanced approach like \u201cdeveloping with Plutus, smart contracts, token economies, DAOS, building NFT campaigns, and more\u201d. Another positive point of the proposal, in my opinion, is that we know where this space would be built, in the state of Arizona, in the United States. I think it makes a lot of sense to launch this project in a location where blockchain is already relatively well-known, because if the cafe opened in a country and city where people have very little information about it, I don't think it would generate any curiosity or interest. Unfortunately, most people still see the cryptographic world as just a way to get rich quick, when we know that it is not, especially in Cardano, where we have social and environmental goals to be achieved, in addition to the economic bias that is the basis of everything. . An observation that I would like to make is that it would be interesting for the proponents to mention what is the future expansion plan, that is, in which cities do they intend to open their franchises, if the initiative is successful? We know that the intention is to focus on the United States and Europe, but which cities? Another topic that could have been addressed at impact is who would be the partners and people who would teach these classes. As I understand it, the sessions would be weekly. But in this case, would it be a basic level class + an advanced class per week? Or just a basic class, and next week advanced? Details such as who will teach the classes, which faculties they intend to promote partnerships, how they will attract the target audience and which day of the week will be chosen for these classes to be held could be included. Furthermore, I think that the objective of the challenge is being well contemplated, to promote local hubs that facilitate the participation of diverse people (not just those in the technology field) and that dialogue with specific local characteristics. If the cafe is successful, I think their franchises could have the same basic idea and adapt to the characteristics of the local community in which they are launched. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Regarding the roadmap, the proponents cite the objectives to be achieved in periods of 3, 6 and 12 months. In the first quarter, they expect trainers to be selected, the physical space to be in the negotiation process (from what I understand it will be leased), the first coffee cart is being built, etc. Notice that they explain what they want, but not how are they going to get it? We don't know, for example, through which selection process these coaches would be chosen, at which faculties they will establish contact, which Cardano specialists they intend to try to partner with... Regarding the coffee cart, we don't know how this would be built, what the elements necessary for this project to be completed; About the physical space, how would they get in touch with real estate agents? What approximate lease size are you looking for? I think the ideal would be for them to divide the activities monthly, not every 3/6 months, this is a very long time for us to understand exactly the process that will be developed. If the activity division were monthly and we knew more details about each one of them, the understanding of the process would be better contemplated. In the completed milestones part, we see that the main author of the idea has already started to put into practice what he wants to accomplish, and has already achieved many milestones. This conveys a lot of confidence about his involvement in the whole process. Now, in relation to the budget, around 38 thousand dollars are requested, it is a high amount, but the project involves many things and, in fact, many expenses, so I don't think it's an amount that is incompatible with what is proposed. However, this part of the proposal is a bit confusing. During the financial breakdown, the author of the idea cites various amounts and expenses that exceed $40,000. In this case, the proponent claims that he is investing his own savings in the project. Y value would be necessary for maintenance of the physical space, being divided into several parts such as rent, electrical part, ventilation and etc. In this way, it is quite understandable how much the project would cost and why. Finally, analyzing the team part, this part of the proposal is quite adequate, we know the names and main roles of the team members, as well as we have a link (either linkedin or github) where we can see the work they develop in practice. I think the detailing about their resumes could be more intense, but the way it is, it already conveys a lot of confidence. It is extremely important that they have partnerships with teams already consolidated in the Cardano ecosystem, such as the Catalyst School group. So, in terms of feasibility, the improvement I can suggest is more restricted to the roadmap. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I really liked the auditability of this project, because I feel that the author is not only concerned with informing what the goal is, but also why that is the goal (there are several related goals). It breaks auditability down nicely into the two necessary parts, project progress and end results. The specific goals of progress, such as \u201cportfolios created, sustainability, conversion rate and etc\u201d are very well argued, as I said, we understand why this is important and how we can see if these goals have been achieved or not. My suggestions for this part of auditability are: could the author of the idea clarify how these objectives will be taken to the Cardano community, that is, how will the information collected reach everyone's knowledge? In my view, it would be important for him to make an overview, at least monthly, where all the necessary information would be gathered and forwarded directly and easily to the Cardano community. The author seems to be a well placed person in our community, so he is definitely in our discord, telegram and etc groups, where this report could be published. Now in relation to the final results, I think that the author is very aware of where he wants to go and where he will walk the path to it, but I think that it is also necessary to situate the Cardano community in a more direct way. How can we, people who live so far away from the caf\u00e9, know how this experience is developing in practice? In my view, it would be very interesting for the author to produce a short video, where he, his team, some teachers, some students, clients and anyone who was captive with the project would report how everything developed and what the current scenario is. If the objectives mentioned in the 3, 6 and 12 month roadmap were achieved, if the local community really got more involved with Cardano, if new wallets were in fact created, if young people were interested in learning and investing in our blockchain, who knows if local designers were interested in participating in the construction of our Dapps... Anyway, how was the process and the final results. This video would be great to play in Town Hall and maybe it could even be released in the audiovisual challenge in traditional media, for example. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "We can see that the purpose of the proposal in question is to increase the visibility of blockchain technology and various concepts belonging to this universe. For this, a not very traditional idea is imagined, to open a teaching center on technology combined with a cafe. In fact, the ideas propagated by the project fit the goals of the challenge in question, as it was planned to make several references to the Cardano ecosystem in this cafe. Thus, it is understood that with its success, more visibility will be brought to Cardano. However, as we will discuss below, there seem to be some quite considerable challenges for this idea to actually be successfully implemented, making the requested budget of $33,800 perhaps not adequate.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "We can see that the author was very detailed and knew how to develop the various aspects that the project had to generate public engagement in the feasibility plan very well. We sought to go far beyond a simple collaborative workspace, the concern to build an environment that breathes the idea of \u200b\u200bblockchain is perceptible. But in my opinion, there is a considerable problem that is intrinsic to the strategy that was adopted. Notably, the monthly cost of a space like this will be quite high, and the fact that a unit (or a few) in the United States is successful does not seem to guarantee that the model is validated. Unlike a common franchise business, the success of a cafe with these characteristics will depend a lot on its surroundings. Therefore, there seems to be a great risk inherent in the idea of \u200b\u200bexpanding this model. And without the expansion, the visibility that blockchain technology seeks to give would not be as broad.\n\nWe note that the proposed ideas are driven by the author's clear motivation to promote the use of blockchain to make the world a fairer and more inclusive place. The different ways of doing this, both with free and paid classes, in addition to the concept of having an incubator and all the partnerships made, show the energy that is being used in the project. But we have a perception that it would be possible to reduce the risk mentioned above by carrying out actions similar to this one, but without the physical environment factor in these proportions. But we can mention that the engagement of the project is very remarkable, the professionals involved also seem very competent and there is the positive factor of the curricula having been made available.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Regarding the ways to measure the success of the project, we see that the team was very detailed and chose very precise ways to measure the engagement around the proposal. Such parameters were not limited only to conceptual ideas of what would be implemented, but also involved numbers as goals to be achieved. The conversion rate of people into members, the number of portfolios created and projects helped demonstrate that the team knows how to monitor results well, given the premises that were established for the proposal. In addition, we also see that the ideas conveyed in relation to the perception of success are very consistent with everything that has been proposed about the awareness-raising role of the process.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 5, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The project has a relatively large scope of impact, identifying the problem of the challenge. The project targets many segments of society, so this project will significantly change the perception of blockchain in general and Cardano in particular for those who have access. However, you should also consider other risk factors that arise during project implementation. If many people are wishing to receive face-to-face training, while your coffee shop does not have the space, you should have a solution for renting another training place with a larger space. This will get a little more difficult when you expand this project to Europe. Mobilizing resources from the local Cardano community you host can be one solution to this problem.

If everything is free I think it is not sustainable for the financial statements. \n\nTo my knowledge, to run a coffee shop, the management of cash flow is very important.

I suggest your team can set the ratio for the short term, middle term, and long term. For example: in the short term (under 06 months) ratio is 0.75, in the middle term ( 12 months) the ratio is 1.0 and in the long term (more than 1-2 years) the ratio is higher.\n\nBy the way, this is my small suggestion, in general, you set the metric very clearly and I give your team my trust.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1344", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal offers an interesting approach to combining Blockchain and coffee to become a local community hub that provides high-quality information, demonstrations, and classes about Blockchain technology for anyone who wants to learn about it.
