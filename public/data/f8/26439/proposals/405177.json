Aside supporting media projects, the cafe also hosts several community spaces daily and therefore has a good following around which they can build and engage a community. The proposal delivers relevant Cardano related information to people through a variety of programmes and provides plans of ensuring community self-reliance with time through paid programmes. The proposal also addresses the MVH principle of the challenge, intends to make use of some already existing infrastructure and has shown that there is community readiness for the hub from the cafe's existing patrons.

It strengthens the bond between people in the community. There is a bonus point for this proposal is that the team has launched The ADA Caf\u00e9 since 2021 and has done several jobs for the Cardano community.

However, the proposer should mention in more detail the cost for each item. The proposer has indicated quite a lot of information regarding their team member with reference links. However, it would be quite difficult for the community to understand who are the governance team of this project and what the link between the listed projects. The information for the creative & community team is presented very well with a quite long list.

With their very detailed timeline, it is not hard for their team to track their work and control budget spend. However, it would be better if they could explain how the KPIs are measured and documented, how the community could audit their recorded document to understand the actual progress. The KPIs and success metrics of this proposal are not presented nicely, some of the information is hard to understand. For example: Twitter space increases 10%, ADA caf\u00e9 website increases traffic 1000% without appropriate time, such as in a month or a year.

I have to clarify that the project is running for 6 months now and they have achieved pretty good results. For instance, they have supported the launch of 11 projects on the cardano ecosystem. They operate as a business to business hub which helps the launch of projects like NFTs and so on. However I think that the goal of this proposal does not align with the challenge.
