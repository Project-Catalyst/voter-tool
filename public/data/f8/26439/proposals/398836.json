The hub's current modus operandi is to host information dissemination programs - meetups, discussions and other activities. This proposal certainly addresses the challenge to a large extent because it focuses not only on spreading information about Cardano but also on growing membership, although it is not explicit on how its members will be fully on-boarded into the Cardano community. It also addresses the ultimate goal of the challenge, which is, to set up \"local community hubs across the world where the average person can take part in their own language and with their own cultural understanding\". The proposed hub targets the Venezuelan community and will most likely deliver sessions in Spanish although it is not specifically indicated.\n\nThe proposal adheres to the MVH principle although it does not talk about the potential to scale and address future needs, neither does it touch on sustainability of the hub in the long term. Generally, however, the KPIs correspond with those of the challenge and will ultimately impact positively on the Cardano ecosystem. Proposers may however want to provide a bit more information to cover the aspects of scalability and financial sustainability.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Implementation of this proposal will be mainly through presentation sessions, online meet -ups and organization of community activities with ADA bounties which is good and will certainly yield some results however, a little more detail on the varieties of activities, discussion topics for presentation sessions etc. would be interesting and provide more perspective. An implementation plan is provided for the first 3 months, 6 and 12 months as well as expected milestones to be achieved however, this plan is quite general, and lacks details such as actionable tasks to be taken within these set timeframes.\n\nThe budget is concise, clear and reasonable to achieve the proposed tasks. Proposers indicate the need for additional funding in the near future however, they did not provide a plan in this regard. Risks have been captured but without concrete measures to address them. The proposal team have experience in blockchain development and the main proposer is a member of the team at bitcoinbay.co, and has provided link to LinkedIn account as well.\n\nGiven that this is not a complex proposal and the tasks that need to be undertaken are quite straightforward, it is feasible and can be implemented successfully although a bit more information and detail would have been useful in making a thorough assessment of feasibility. \n\n\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "KPIs are provided with quantifiable metrics for the 3, 6 and 12 month timeframes. Proposers intend to grow Telegram membership to 500, 2000 and eventually 4000 within these timeframes respectively. The overall goal though is to grow to over 1000 community members in the next few months and to have continuous community activity, and successful monthly, and eventually bi-monthly meetups with additional funding.

It also contribuites to challenge kpis as \"new users of Cardano that were onboarded\" and \"developers  this community-focused challenge bring into the Cardano ecosystem\".\n\nWhat I would bring here in more details is what the proposer considers \"next level \", as mentioned and what he would do to \"grow\" the community he created. It is a lot related to a communication startegy properly executed and acitivites thar will keep this engagement. Unfortunately, there's no mention to any adversitiment plan and the activites that will be performed are not detailed enough (it just mentiones vaguely \"provide community activities with ADA bounties\" in the roadmap).\n\nOne more point of atention is the challenge part of the proposal. the only challenge identified is keeping community fresh and alive but there's no plan to overcome this as proposer says it already happens \"naturally\". I understand that he wants to boost it but the way it is written can go against the value proposition proposal (if this is already happening naturally, why would this community need this fund? one can think that this hub doesnt need it that much). Here it is more an advice/perpective from a outside person looking from what is written than a problem of the proposal itself.\n\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There's a timeline with some milestones or deliverables  but not much details are provided on the acitvites that need to perfomed to get to them. For instance, it says \"grow telegram membership to 500\" but proposer doesnt say what he'll do to get these people in the telegram channel, which makes it hard to assess if the plan is feasible or not. More details on the acitivites perfomed could also be provided.\n\nbudget breakdown is fair, aligned with the plan and transparent. Total budget is really low, accouting for much less than the suggested limit of 5% of total challenge budget in the challenge description, which is then good. \n\nOne person committed is also enough. Taking into account that propsoer already runs this telegram chaneel, I see team is not an issue here. Linkedin links are provided. I would bring though more context on proposer background/competencies to make his capabilities clearer.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There are 3 suggested good kpis and one has target (they are time-framed in the project plan).\nAs suggestion, I'd stabish target for the other two as well (number of people attending each meetup and number of people participating in community activities). Imporant to notice that they do match what is proposed in the timeline. \n\nAn extra kpi that I'd add is measuing the feedback from the community both from new members and old members, to assess its evolution.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_298", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10778, "q0": "The proposal does not make it clear what the target problem is. It would be up to the proposer to describe in more detail the background and context of Venezuela's current problems. Venezuela has been going through a difficult time, both economically and politically, because of this there is a huge rate of inflation and capital controls, which has put pressure on a large part of the population to seek alternative solutions to the problematic Venezuelan financial system. Maybe that's the underlying reason for the problem, but I'm guessing since the proposal didn't make it clear.\n\nGoals/KPIs were established to reach 500 members on Telegram after 3 months and 2000 members after 6 months, they are good targets, but they would need accessory metric KPIs so that they can be better indicators.\n\nIncreasing the number of channel members alone is not a good indicator of impact, as these numbers can be easily inflated by bots.\n\nI would recommend including more KPIs/metrics to facilitate impact assessment, such as: number of meetup participants, number of bounties, number of bounty winners, and other metrics that could indicate whether these people are organically migrating to Cardano.\n\nDue to the plan being a draft without good details and the lack of appropriate targets for impact indication, I disagree that this proposal has the potential to have a relevant impact on the challenge.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The solution presented is still a draft. The idea of \u200b\u200bcreating a hub/meetups needs to be more polished and detailed. There is no plan, but a conceptual draft with ideas such as bounties, activities, trivia contests, but without details of what these activities would be like.\n\nThe proposer mentions 7 years orgazing Bitcoin meetups, but the proposer's Linkedin is almost completely blank, there is no information to support the experiences described. (https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoine-de-vuyst-49a74194/). The Telegram group contains only 58 members and has relatively low activity.\n\nThe information provided about the team is insufficient to indicate feasibility. I would recommend that the proposer include more sources and information about the work carried out in the organization of meetups and define the number of people needed to develop the proposal.\n\nThe budget was divided into three equal parts:\n\n $300 for the presentation of 6 meetups, which I consider a reasonable amount, however there is no information on how the meetups will be organized or how long they will last.\n\n$300 for running a community cloud node for 6 months (what is the purpose of a community cloud? this was not explained in the proposal) and\n\n$300 for activities and bounties (there is no mention of what kind of activities or bounties will be held, so there is no way to judge whether this amount is appropriate)\n\nI would recommend further detailing the activities referred to in the proposals so that the budget assessment is appropriate.\n\nThe timeline is simple, one meetup per month for 6 months, which I consider realistic and adequate.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is no clarity on the target problem of this proposal. The solution has a minimal structure and direction, but needs further definition in purpose, what activities will be carried out in meetups? What kind of content will be covered at the events? The bounties will refer to what?\n\nThere is a relatively simple timeline, but activities, meetups and bounties are not detailed, which makes it difficult to audit performance.\n\nThe established KPIs are relevant(500 members in 3 months and 2000 members in 6 months), but as I said in the impact assessment, the proposal would need more metrics/KPIs to be auditable.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_43", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10937, "q0": "A lot of important information is missing from this proposal. We don't know 1) why in Venezuela they are adopting more cryptocurrencies 2) if Ada is a viable option for them, and if not, how could it become 3) what target audience of the hub - the Venezuelan population is still a very large group and abstract 4) main: what activities would be developed in this hub? I believe that all these questions should be answered so that we understand the core of the proposal. From the way the idea is presented to us, it is not clear what impact would be generated. As much as the idea aligns with the challenge, the lack of explanations and development makes us not sure about the benefits that all this would generate for Cardano and whether the specific objectives of the challenge would be addressed. So the grade for this topic will unfortunately be low.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The roadmap provided is very shallow, we have two obvious problems. First, the temporal division is very extensive. Instead of dividing the total into months, the division used is much longer. For example, from the 6th to the 12th, only two activities would be carried out: increase the group of telegrams to 4000 and organize monthly face-to-face meetings. Why would it take 6 months for that? What would these face-to-face meetings be like? Where, how would the target audience be attracted, what content would be debated? Regarding the budget, a high value is not requested, but it is poorly explained. The presenter fee would be $300, but how many hours per month would this person work? What is a \"cloud node\"? The team's presentation is also inadequate, we don't know details about those involved. It would be necessary for them to present us with a brief curriculum with their past experiences and also what kind of involvement they have with Cardano. Overall, the whole topic needs improvement.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The KPIs presented are entirely numerical and do not adequately correspond to the monitoring of development processes. It would be necessary for the proponents to constantly update the Cardano community on the activities developed, the work of each professional involved and the partial results obtained. Not just goals, but also tasks and processes. The success would be for the monthly meetings to take place and the target audience to be well involved in the activities, but this scenario is quite shallow. We don't know how all this would reflect for the Cardano ecosystem, data such as: new members + increase in the amount of Ada in circulation and being delegated + new members in the catalyst + greater purchase and sale of CNFTs from the meetings should be measured. Again, I believe the whole topic deserves a good rephrasing.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10987, "q0": "This proposal falls within the challenge to be sure and is a no-brainer to support since the foundation of the community hub already exists. As a former assessor of tenders for a university, I see this as a quick and cheap win for Cardano and the Catalyst community. As the proposer described, Venezuela is ripe for blockchain adoption. The country is suffering from high inflation and economic uncertainties. Cardano needs to establish a presence or a point of contact in the country in order to have a chance for people to be made aware of the blockchain. To the majority of the population, only Bitcoin exists and this hub could well improve awareness of other blockhains that could benefit the population.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The beginnings of a community hub are already established with the existence of a Telegram channel. The plan proposed is what one would expect of the steps that need to be taken to enlarge the community and of participation. It's a meagre budget which could potentially have a significant impact in terms of numbers. The use of 'ADA bounties' works in two ways, it can increase participation and can lead to greater awareness of Cardano. The team members are described and one provides a link to his linkedin whilst Milangeli didn't. Despite this, I still provide strong agreement in terms of feasibility since both are veery active and are known in their telegram channel. Being in the Cardano community to promote awareness and share knowledge with others does not require a PhD nor a career in blockchain. It takes belief, an understanding of the technology and of commitment to invite others to Cardano's mission. This team has already accomplished the establishment of the community and I am in support of their goals to further promote it within Venezuela. Good luck.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "To be sure the team has provided KPIs to measure the impact of the funding should they receive it. But I would argue, and this is the basis for my agreement that this proposal is highly auditable, that they can achieve those numbers even without Catalyst assistance so why not help them. The telegram channel itself becomes the audit point and anyone from Catalyst or the community can join in and check on their progress via https://t.me/Cardano_Caracas. What ends up being positive reinforcement is that any act to check on their progress means being a part of the Caracas HUB and thereby promoting the community itself.
