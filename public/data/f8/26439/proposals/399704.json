The team consist of people with relevant experience. Some of them have a long experience with blockchain technology. This proposal is by far have the most comprehensive team profile, explained well and in detail about their work record. The budget detail is provided, however it could be broken into more detail, for example: 6 months of operation by the team- explain what the team does, the deliveries within the operation, etc. (It could be the work hour for managing or handling team meeting, organizing event, etc.). About the implementation, I\u2019m not really sure how they would implement this. It says \u201cAutomated Tool\u201d, but I don\u2019t see any explanation on how this would work, or the concept of it, other than \u201cit will help project to focus on their project instead of content deliveries\u201d. This proposal said that \u201cThe protocol works for your ecosystem delivering content to community spaces P2P in a borderless web3.0 community...\u201d, is that mean that Scalably will make a decentralized \u201clanguage translation\u201d freelance as a service? But then they said that this protocol have collaboration with top language tech companies, without specifying which companies is it. Furthermore, this proposal didn\u2019t explain their roadmap in detail, for example it could be better if they provide their milestones or goals for the 1st, 3rd, and 6th month.
