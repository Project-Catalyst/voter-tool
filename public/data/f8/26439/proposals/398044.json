It's about summarizing the Town Hall content into small podcasts about 5 minutes long, and translating that content into Vietnam's native language. I believe in several points that make this proposal a great potential for success, but we are going little by little. At first, I would like to reinforce that this challenge of hubs, unlike the challenge of new members on board, seeks to promote and popularize our blockchain for more specific communities; therefore, translating the contents of the main meeting of our ecosystem into Vietnamese is certainly making this information more accessible to the natives of the country, mainly due to the fact that a very long time (from 2 to 3 hours) will be converted in a few minutes. I believe it is a problem for everyone, not just the Vietnamese, to set aside so many hours in their work and study routine to regularly attend the Town Hall. So this idea corresponds exactly to what we are looking for in the challenge: to make information about Cardano more accessible to a particular community. This objective can be very well identified in the following excerpt, found in the description of the challenge, which talks about what success looks like: \u201cLocal Community Hubs across the world where the average person can take part in their own language and with their own cultural understanding\u201d . Another very positive point that I believe will increase the impact of this proposal is the fact that the Vietnamese community is very strong in our blockchain, I say this because I have already evaluated several proposals that said about the country. As I recall, it is one of the places where Cardano has one of the biggest fan base when it comes to its geographic region. Another proposal that can relate very well to this topic is the 2-minute review of proposals for Vietnamese, if memory serves, launched and financed from fund 7. Therefore, we have a lot of evidence that this specific audience should be a target for investments, as once we manage to strengthen a community that is already quite active in our ecosystem, it will be easier for us to win fans in places where Cardano is not so well established, in my sincere opinion. Therefore, I think this proposal deserves maximum marks in impact, the idea is very good and I would like it to be done in several languages \u200b\u200b(I would adopt a summary of the Towns Halls myself, because between work and studies, it is not so simple attend meetings every week). \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The script presented is, in my view, superficial. Although the proponent does not divide the activities into very long time intervals (when this is done, it becomes difficult to visualize the process, as there are many activities for many months, so we do not know when each thing will happen, if parallel activities could occur and etc), yet the level of specificity is low. In fact, the time becomes very long from 4 months onwards, where the next milestones are only expected for 8 months. I say this because there is no deep detail about the activities. For example, in the first three months, they are expected to establish \u201cworkflow/tools\u201d that help guide the work. What tools would these be? How would they be selected? What would be the work routine of those who will summarize and translate the Town Halls? It is said that from the third month onwards, feedback would be collected, KPIs that would serve as a basis for the team to adapt the work being done to the needs of its viewers. What KPIs exactly are we looking to collect? How would this information be collected? I think the script could be different, if it were divided monthly and all activities were well explained, the quality level of this part of the proposal would certainly be increased. Regarding the budget, the requested value is approximately 17 thousand dollars. This value is explained in great detail, but could still be better argued. For example, we have fixed costs, but we don't know why each quoted part has the amount that was requested. The site operations would cost about 1500 dollars, but why? Who would work on it and for how long? Regarding the cost of the Town Halls translations, I don't think the best way to calculate the final value of each meeting is by the number of words, even though the proponent has made the calculations that the average duration is 2 hours per meeting that approximately 18,000 words would be spoken in this... these values \u200b\u200bare not easy to check. I believe that no one will count the words, neither the team involved in the project nor the members of the Cardano community. Therefore, the fairest way in my opinion would be to establish an average price per minute. For example 1 minute would cost X in translation, you know? Therefore, I think the financing part could still be better. And finally, speaking of the team, this part of the proposal is really very good. We know the names of each team member (I don't understand about the @, would they be for instagram?), a small resume of what they've done so far, how they relate to Cardano and several links from their social networks, including their linkedins, where we can see their professional backgrounds in a proven way. The only observation would be to more clearly determine who would do what in this project. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding the audit of the process: it is mainly based on how many people visited the site, listened to the podcast, how many documents were translated and how the feedback from the target community is being. In my perception these are really the most direct and correct ways of perceiving if the small, gradual conquests are being achieved. However, two things come to mind: first, how will we have access to all this information? How could the Cardano community check these statistics? I think the team needed to make this clearer. The professionals that make up the team actually seem to be highly qualified people and involved in our ecosystem, so I conclude that they know the various ways to share information of this type, such as telegram or discord channels, for example. I also think that the focus here was very much on what was achieved and not on how it was achieved, that is, it is not described how the team's daily work would be audited. It is very important that this is also discussed. How can we know if, within X period of time, the activities were developed by the right people, in an adequate way, if there were any problems, any difficulties with deadlines? How can we resolve the possible impasses that will arise along the way? Therefore, I believe the team should also look for ways to demonstrate how the day-to-day development of the proposal has been. And finally, about the final scenario that is imagined: we know well where we want to go, as the bidder explains in great detail what would need to be achieved in the 1, 3, 4 and 8 month milestones. In my view, the detailing part leaves nothing to be desired in this final part of the proposal, as the proponent makes it clear how important it is to understand qualitatively what has been achieved, and not just quantitatively. My suggestion here is the same, how do we make all the information easily accessible to the Cardano community? Due to the nature of the proposal, my suggestion is that a large final report be made, containing infographics that can visually demonstrate the data studied, and that this be sent either via email, or by telegram, or discord, in short, any platform already used by the community. The bridge between team + data and community must be solid. I will give the maximum score for auditability because I believe that the bidder was concerned and explored very well ways to monitor this project, just make them more accessible to all members of our ecosystem. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 7, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Thank you, and we highly appreciated superb valuable comments on possible gaps in the proposal.  \n\" (I don't understand about the @, would they be for instagram?)\" after @username is ideascale username.

Hopefully, this round, we will be fortunate to grant the fund and delivery this exciting project to the Vietnamese community and potential as a pilot test for other non-native English languages involved in the Cardano ecosystem.   "}, {"id": 365, "q0": "With the aim of periodically producing translated materials that will serve not only the population of Vietnam, but like all those speakers of Vietnamese, we see that the idea of the proposal fits the objectives of the challenge in question. It is also interesting to note that the Townhall will be translated weekly, in addition to the production of summaries and texts, and the periodicity of production of all these materials helps to bring greater engagement so that speakers of the language are updated and more comfortable in expressing opinions. about the ecosystem. We can also mention that, clearly, this increases Cardano's visibility and can attract new ideas that reflect regional needs that are often unknown. We also see that the amount of funding being requested of $17,100 is reasonable for what you want to accomplish in the given time.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It is interesting to see that the project was not initially planned for a very long period (which could trigger a very expensive budget). The strategy of first producing materials for a period of 4 months was good for mitigating risks. Another positive point that we see is the organization of these actions over time. In the initial months, the first objective is the production of materials, so that only from the third month onwards, these materials begin to be disseminated. It is also worth noting that in this period, feedback is already sought and, if necessary, production strategies are adapted, showing the team's preparedness for possible changes along the way. In fact, we see that the professionals who make up the team have very relevant experiences for the project. Some of the attributes that the team has are experiences in the area of \u200b\u200bcomputing, translation, business and previous knowledge about Cardano. Additionally, we note that the CVs of the professionals involved were made available.\n\nRegarding the breakdown of the budget, it was interesting to see the division between fixed expenses and expenses for video. Which allows us to come up with the average monthly expense of $4,275. Given the tasks that will be carried out monthly for the maintenance, translation and publication of the materials, we see that the calculation to arrive at this value in general seems consistent, but the caveat that perhaps the cost per hour of work mentioned in \u201cexpense per video\u201d seems valid. $60 is perhaps a little high. Another observation that seems pertinent would be an allocation of capital aimed more specifically at the marketing of the project, seeking to give more visibility to this new way of obtaining knowledge about Cardano.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding the stated ways to check the project's progress, we see that the team stipulated clear ways to follow this. User feedback and the number of visits to the site were established as parameters, which are good ways to capture impressions about the scope of the project. It's interesting to see that the team even has well-defined quantitative goals about the expected impact of the project, and we can see this by the expected growth that was indicated, as in relation to the audience of the podcast, for example.\n\nRegarding the ideas conveyed in relation to the perception of success of the project, it is very cool to see here that the focus is not simply on achieving the goal of delivering the translated materials. We also observed a constant concern of the team in making refinements in the way of work being carried out, as well as introducing questionnaires in these translated materials to collect feedback. In addition, we also see that the verification of compliance with the KPIs will be considered, not only to assess the performance of this first stage of the project, but also to decide on a possible continuation of the same.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 6, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1370, "q0": "I think English is not the main language in Vietnam, so this is a reason a lot of Vietnamese can not approach the Catalyst Project. If they see any webinar including English, they usually ignore it. And the result is that Cardano Eastern town hall in Vietnam has very few people joining (maximum is 41) compared to Vietnamese population is approximately 100 mil.\n\nTo solve this problem we need someone who can do a translation job with clear, accurate, and easy-reading information from English to Vietnamese. If they understand something, they can easily accept it, and we can increase the number of Vietnamese who have knowledge about the Catalyst Project, and also increase the number of people joining Town Hall webinars.

I suggest this cost account for 10-15% of video creation ($36-$54) is reasonable.\nIn other hand, with the task \u201cSurvey analysis, reporting, PM\u201d to make voters have more insight, please describe more detail what information you want to survey and if can the methodology your team create a questionnaire and conduct a survey, these things can make your report is more reliable.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "One of the metrics I think your team can consider is \u201cNumber of people joining Town Hall\u201d or \u201cPercent increase of number people joining Town Hall\u201d.

The team behind the proposal also did a good job by providing some links that could help confirm exactly what is being demanded. Also, a budget for risk is also reasonable as we all can attest to the fact that prices of services and goods may not be the same at time of implementing.
