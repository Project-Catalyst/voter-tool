This event will help more people know about the Cardano community, thereby more people will join the Cardano community.

Another factor that I think will also have a big influence is the current epidemic situation, not excluding that countries will temporarily block back like China in recent days.

Meanwhile, the Cardano community in Vietnam is lacking in social events to engage and attract new participants. Thus the proposal gave the idea of creating the Cardano Runners Community Hub in Vietnam and then to the Cardano community globally. The first activity will be a virtual running event through the Uprace application (a famous running application in Vietnam: https://uprace.org/).\nThe proposed team will raise funds to organize a global virtual running event called \u201cCardano Incredible Race 2022\u201d within 3 weeks.

In effect the goal of this proposal is to bring many profiles such as developers, entrepreneurs ect. to the cardano ecosystem. And this is in perfect alignment with the challenge settings. Regarding the scaling of this proposal in future challenges, there are many ways to achieve it.

As a digital marketer who has run facebook ads and did other marketing activities online, I think that the budget is reasonable. I also think that the proposers know what they are doing as far as marketing goes. I feel like the proposers have outlined a detailed plan for achieving the goal in the most efficient way.
