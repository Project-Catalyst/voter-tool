Some changes seem to have been suggested because the proposer isn't aware that they already happen (e.g.\"Catalyst is currently limited to those who can implement their proposals\" is untrue; a proposer will often invite other community members to carry out some of the work, and proposals are often contributed to at the ideas stage by people who don't go on to be part of the delivery). Other suggestions in the proposal seem to stem from a lack of awareness of the range of proposals in Catalyst (not all proposals are about building a product at all, so the repeated focus on the building of tech products, e.g. \"Winning teams with the best demo products ...will be funded\" etc, only addresses quite a small fraction of the types of proposals out there, and wouldn't be applicable to large sections of the funded proposer community). But even disregarding these misunderstandings - the ideas in this proposal are mainly focused on changing things for people who are already engaged in Catalyst, rather than onboarding new people, so they are not a good alignment with this challenge. The proposer says that the changes will also make onboarding easier - but there is no evidence to say that the issues described actually do present a widespread barrier to onboarding. Without some sort of evidence that they are a barrier - even just anecdotally - I have no reason to think it's the case, since it doesn't resonate with anything I have ever heard either within Catalyst, or outside it amongst people thinking of getting involved; and the proposer doesn't present any evidence. Lastly, the proposer is suggesting an even faster funding process than the one we have currently; and, as recently elucidated at Town Hall and by several community members on Telegram and Discord, the community is already struggling with \"proposal fatigue\" as it is. If the funding cadence was reduced to 2 months, the additional work, stress and pressure of that would almost certainly have the effect of causing people to drop out of Catalyst - the direct opposite effect of what this challenge is supposed to achieve.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "I don't think the proposer intends to suggest this as a feasible proposal as such; it's more of an insight-sharing or a provocation. Most of the things needed to assess feasibility are missing (a timeline or project plan, a team - the proposer wants to hand it to IOHK and Catalyst in general to implement, which is un-assessable), but I think the proposer knows that. In terms of a budget, the proposer has just given a random figure, and they say that if funded, they would invite the community to vote on the actual figure. But this is not feasible within the current system; we can't ask voters to approve a project without knowing how much funding it will receive, and ethically we can't change a project budget after voters have approved it. This makes the proposal intrinsically impossible. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The approach to audit is basically centred on surveys and voting - the proposer would invite the community to vote on various aspects of the project, and would give \"regular updates\" on its progress. This is a novel approach to audit, and I don't think it's very valid - how can the community be sure that the updates given are accurate and truthful, so that those surveyed have accurate information on which to base their ratings? We at least need information about what the updates will consist of, and how they will be verifiable. Also I doubt we could be sure of sufficient participation in these votes to give a meaningful result. There are always a lot of votes and surveys in Catalyst, and people tend to get tired of them; many of them only attract a handful of responses. This wouldn't count as sufficient audit of a project.

But then watching proposal begin to pull back and unroll, I get a clear sense that this plan isn't going to be able to stay on its board.   It starts with mistakenly confusing Catalyst with Ideascale...it is important to separate one from the other when evaluating the experience.  It continues on to the naive assumptions packed into the \"Operations: Problems\" section that seems to think that the innovators on the platform AREN'T \"fresh young blood\" or that doubts about CAs qualifications have any place in a radically inclusive role.  By the time this proposal tries to stand up it is too late, as the solution tumbles over and over itself in the cascading wave of confusing \"fixes\":  incentives for unapproved projects, proposal delegation procedures (reminiscient of Plato's philosopher Kings \"I'll think it up, someone else figure out how to do it\" (which is the whole proposal, frankly)), full-employment for CAs, assessments before proposals are finished, itemization of proposals on smart contracts, sub-contributor contributions...  it goes on.  Ultimately what finally washes up on the beach in a heap of seaweed is a raggedy pack of abstract, disconected, foggy, sentimental \"intuitions\" about a better Catalyst process, which can barely get up and shuffle off.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "If I could express the solution offered by this proposal in a single word it would be: \"Somehow.\"  Despite the details and breadth that this proposal seeks to magnify and explore, none of it really plumbs more than superficially into the existing process.  I'll cover exactly one example of this and then move on.  The plan to fix the proposal assessments of CAs starts by realigning the existing criteria into General and Specific requirements.  General contains all impact and auditability concerns, specific contains all technical and financial concerns.  Note that team specific skills is left off the list.  I'll let you think about that for a second...and then we continue.  No explanation is given for this reorganization of approach...are we to assume this is simpler?  The general attitude throughout is that these suggestions are just better.  If we assume simpler is better, we are left to wonder why the very next step is to require certification of CAs to be able to assess \"specific\" things in proposals.  This issue, reputation and credentialing, is a fantastically complex issue with multiple teams in Catalyst working and collaborating across ecosystems to solve it, but it is a throw away \"somehow\" in this proposal.  As to why the missing team member skills is significant?  In the universe of this proposal, where proposers just come up with the ideas, and then delegate them to sub-contributors if funded, the notion of skills is a major blindspot.  These skilled teams, with their experience and funded proposals, who currently are the ones who push proposals through, who iterate them in collaboration with CAs, who collaborate in the uncertain environments of impact networks, who take on (and often experience) the risk of failure in Catalyst, in this universe, these people aren't hardly visible.  And there is a reason for that.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "\"Somehow\" is the calling card of this proposal, so obviously there aren't any milestones or roadmap for how to realize this vision.  How could there be when it leaves out the source of realization?  It isn't unusual for someone to come into the Catalyst environment and be overwhelmed, to get sucked under the waves.  For some people, it keeps happening, because Catalyst just keeps rolling over and changing.  If someone comes into this environment of uncertainty and change, and is unwilling to embrace that uncertainty, to recognize the risk and opportunity to thrive, to effectively *go with it* without knowing how it all ends, then they will find themselves pulled under more than most.  To truly work with the tides of Catalyst, you must work *with* them, not try to control and resist them.  When you do that, you stay afloat, and when you stay afloat, you have a chance to ride the waves to reach your goals.  It doesn't always work and you will fail, but resisting the change and uncertainty can only guarantee the spot where you are, and that too will fade away.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 6, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The problem identified by the proposal doesn\u2019t align with the challenge. The challenge was \u201cFaster and easier for new Catalyst members to take on suitable roles and responsibilities\u201d. The proposal has suggested that the Project Catalyst platform has some limitations which may disincentive members participating on it. It is a problem well identified but I believe it is better for the proposer to find different channels to pitch the solution.\n\nThe IMPACT section of the proposal is well written, despite the fact that there is a misalignment between the proposal and the challenge.

", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal doesn\u2019t seem feasible to me. First of all, the proposer has great passion but lacks relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal. I would suggest the proposer pitch his idea on social media platforms and gather a team of people who are passionate about the same cause and have the skills to implement the proposal. \n\nThe budget breakdown was rather random, although I see a point in making such decisions.\n\nNo timetable was offered, no plan for implementation and doesn't cover the resources needed. The proposal did consider the possible challenges and barriers faced in implementing the proposal. The practicality of the proposal is not outlined.

The metrics are clear and measurable. However, it isn\u2019t really clear how the metrics will be achieved, the setting of metrics needs a little bit more consideration. The proposal might have been too optimistic. \n\nI would suggest going slowly from building a team first. Set some milestones for team building, i.e. reach out to how many people to roadshow the idea, create a team of x number of people, research xxx, learn xxx, schedule how many meetings with Project catalyst to finalize the plan.

The author seems to be well aware of the current problems and proposes multiple different ideas to tackle these current problems. \nA big issue with the proposal itself is that it is very ambitious and tries to solve too many problems at once, this makes it quiet hard to follow along. It is also hard to see that all the ideas could be implemented if the project were to be funded. Instead, each section below \"Impact\" could be divided into their own separate proposals. This would leave more room for specific details of each feature and how the solutions could be implemented. Currently the proposal is written like a compilation of features and wishes but there is no clear path to success. \n\nAn example of lacking information is the topic \"Build a united platform\" - is this supposed to be done on Ideascale or another platform? Will it be built from scratch? Is this technically possible to be done on Ideascale? How can we be sure that this new platform/solution is fundamentally better than the already existing process? \nThe problem is that many topics in the proposal are general improvement proposals with too little details, which would leave a lot of things up for interpretation. \n\nAll in all, this proposal is very ambitious and brings up a lot of really good ideas that would greatly improve Project Catalyst but as previously mentioned, it is trying to solve too many problems at once.

The author does not mention any dialogue or contacts within  Catalyst or IOHK to successfully implement the suggested ideas. \nThe budget is not really a budget, it does not explain how the funds will be used to implement the projects mentioned in the proposal. Instead it is a timetable scheme for payments as compensation for writing this proposal. The idea of receiving compensation for writing a proposal and compiling suggestions is not strictly a poor idea, but in that case it is recommended that the budget is more thorough to make it more credible. For example stating the time spent and a \"hourly rate\".\n\nAll in all, the feasibility of the proposal is given a 1 star rating since it is not likely to be implemented successfully if it were to be funded. Mainly because there is no clear actor that is committed to take responsibility for a successful implementation.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The KPI's are relevant to a degree and addresses the challenge, but they are quiet general and also pretty ambitious. Information about the purpose of the survey should be clarified as well as what the voting of the UX/UI would result in.

The main problem with a main actor to take responsibility to audit the success of the project still remains as the biggest issue.

While painted in broad strokes and sometimes a bit too vague, at the core this proposal effectively addresses the challenge of encouraging and supporting meaningful participation from eager and capable community members. One of the more provocative, and I think compelling suggestions, is that there be an option for community members with great ideas to suggest projects, without needing to be the ones to implement them - the next step then being the matching of \"winning\" ideas to folks with the technical expertise to bring them to fruition. I think this would help increase diversity and inclusivity in the proposer pool, and welcome new community members coming with a wide range of experience and perspectives, outside of tech, business, and development, to become meaningfully engaged. I also think that the suggestion to have more training for CAs, and to match reviewers with certain technical skills to projects within that particular realm, are excellent suggestions too - althought they could be outlined in greater detail in this proposal to make it even more compelling.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This is currently somewhat difficult to assess; in the \"Feasibility\" section, the author states that \"the authority and capabilities to deploy this proposal belong ot the Project Catalyst team,\" and later in the section outlining team experience, that \"decisions are on Project Catalyst,\" and not members of the proposing team. The ideas proposed are sound and, if implemented, do seem that they would increase engagement, make it easier for community members with great ideas but lacking in technical expertise to participate in Project Catalyst, and create more consistency and higher quality amongst CAs. However, as it is currently written, it's difficult to determine who would be in charge of implementing this plan, and what relevant experience they have in doing similar previous work. It seems, from how the proposal is written, that the author is offering this as a suggestion - and a very solid and thoughtful one, at that - but not as a project they want to spearhead.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As mentioned above, the proposal appears to be a thoughtful, intriguing, and I believe very useful vision for how to reimagine Project Catalyst and roles for community members, with increased training, greater opportunities for a diversity of skills and assets to be brought to the table, a more inclusive process, and a more fair one as well. However, the Feasibility section feels murky; the budget is \"an example of how the new pattern [of a redesigned Project Catalyst] works only\" - it is not a clear outline of how funds will be spent, but merely an example of the author's vision for a new timeline for Project Catalyst. This is confusing and leaves the reader with a great deal of questions around how funds will be used, by whom, why, and when. Similarly, it would be useful to have greater detail in IMPACT, Section B, \"Solutions.\" As mentioned above, providing proposers with the option to submit an idea without having to be the one to solely execute it is intriguing and meaningful; I think that other suggestions, such as giving consolation prizes to all who submit regardless of project uptake, is a slippery slope that could actually water down the proposal pool with subpar proposals submitted just to claim a prize.
