There isn't really any mention of Catalyst until the metrics at the end, which means there was no discussion about what materials or support would be available for potential Catalyst applicants.  As just a casual meet and greet, it is difficult to understand how there is the potential for ROI on this endeavor.  What would be good to see here is some kind of mission statement for the meeting, such as to onboard 5 proposals by the end of the night, or to sign up multiple Ideascale accounts because of material prepared to show evidence of economic opportunity for CA work.  Bottom line there needs to be clearer statement  of intent regarding the challenge setting, and even just in general with Cardano.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There is no information provided for the teams qualifications or to give an idea of what kind of draw the event might have with them running it.  There is some logistical misunderstanding regarding the \"venue\" concerns, I believe.  I have never seen small event organizers get a free venue or to get hotels to distribute free food...why would they need exposure for themselves in their own hotel?  Because of this issue, I feel the budget simply isn't on target, as it has no funds allocated for the venues, and it is planning for 3-4 of these meetups.  The desire to start a Cardano Hub in Dubai is admirable, but this challenge really requires the focus to be set on Catalyst participation.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There really needs to be more information in the proposal on the intent to capture the information they intend to provide here.  If Catalyst enrollees from Dubai is a measurable, how are we setting that target?  Do we have any idea how many people we might reach or plan for?  Aside from reporting the scheduling and execution of the events, there doesn't seem to be much of a plan presented here for establishing these metrics.  Even a small event has a lot of organization around it, and just seeing that plan would improve the ability to mark out auditable beats in this proposal.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 2, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Dubai is a city of skyscrapers, ports, and beaches, where big business takes place alongside sun-seeking tourism.

It is unclear how the issue of missing retirement and investment options for expatriates will drive the expansion of the Catalyst community. The suggested solution of hosting meetups to introduce Cardano in Dubai venues has some potential to attract people and trigger them to bring new ideas and proposals in project Catalyst. However, the solution lacks clarity on how to achieve onboarding new members in Catalyst and it is too generic without focusing to the actual challenge.

This information is not enough to confirm the feasibility of the proposal so I would suggest that the roles and skillsets are clearly specified to run such activities. Also, the team members are mentioned by name and no roles are described.\nAlthough the budget is broken down in identifiable items, it misses a short analysis how the requested amount is derived. For example, what is the expected cost for hosting one meetup or how many meetups will be hosted in a month?\nThe proposal fails to provide a clear and detailed plan of the activities to be performed during the meetup. There is no timing, no reference on the contents of meetups and most important nothing is mentioned about project Catalyst throughout the proposal.

First would be the problem statement, with emphasis on \"...without pension investment options.\" This in itself does not correlate with key metrics of this Challenge setting. This Challenge is not to create buzz for people to invest in Cardano. This Challenge setting is to activate lurkers and invigorate new members to join and be part of the Project Catalyst process. A process that is heavy on education and creating innovation, which is far from this being an pension investment option.\n\nThe solution though, does give hope for it states that there is an effort on introducing Cardano to the wider Dubai Cardano community (which would be helpful if there are data/links that supports this) through education and sharing knowledge on Cardano. The format though is highly debatable, 5 minute sessions to explain blockchain or crypto would be very hard to do, this is something the proposer needs to work on by doing further research on Cardano's ecosystem. Being a Community Advisor with all its functions, at the very least would take around 15 to 20 minutes to explain.\n\nThen there is a heavy emphasis on partnership with hotels as key on delivering this proposal's solution. Taking this statement and everything in, I would start all over and recommend the proposer to be more involved in Project Catalyst. Simply starting reading other proposals, then getting into various community Discords. From there try to join in on the main Town Hall and branching from there. Just to get the feel of the community. Eventually when Fund round is closing in, start to get deep with all the process of Catalyst School. It is a long laundry list, that might take this proposer 3 (three) months to go through, but coming from my personal experience, it is highly recommended to do.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Although the proposer mentions they are quite experienced in hosting events of this nature, no database is provided to back those claims. Having some form of credentials would have help in gauging the capability of the proposer in delivering this event.\n\nThe budget is a source of confusion, $5K for 4 (four) events in Dubai seems quite challenging and raises questions whether the proposer would be able to deliver on their action plans and KPI's. There are even notions of flying in speakers, which further adds confusion on how will this amount cover all those costs. Again, I highly recommend this proposer to at this point, please do review similar proposals, and there are indeed similar proposals and try to learn from them. To see what can this proposer do to improve the likelihood of hosting offline events.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "There are metrics that would like to be achieved but there no leading action plans or budget use case that supports these claims. There is also no mentioning on the method they will report their progress to the larger community, let alone to IOG. Unfortunately a lot of work and studying needs to be done by this proposer. Recommendations I have already shared above. If the 3 (three) month period of understanding Project Catalyst might seem to long, than I would highly recommend to directly attend the workshops of Catalyst School on how to make and submit a proposal.
