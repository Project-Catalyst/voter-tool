I agree that design is an extremely relevant field for the Cardano ecosystem, and having figures that were specially created to circulate through our ecosystem, being the result of research and a meticulous work of professionals in the area, is a good way to deal with this design issue, and can bring positive results. However, the proposal is still a bit superficial, in my opinion. We are told that 20 unique figures would be created, however, what would be the themes portrayed in each of them? What message would these figures seek to convey? In what contexts could they be used? And how would that help new people who don't know Cardano, its technologies and differentials, to become active members of the community? I think what was lacking here was to explain, in addition to the process of creating the figures, how they would actually act within our ecosystem. It is unclear, once they are ready, where these figures would be made available or what the Cardano community would do with them. The objective of this challenge is to facilitate the entry of new members into the ecosystem, as it is a fact that for those who do not know Cardano, Catalyst, etc., to understand everything that goes on here, from our technologies to where you could fit in this diverse community. and complex, it is not a simple task. Could some of these figures be part of a guide on our blockchain? Would they have an educational role in the understanding process, and consequently, in the addition of new people to the ecosystem? It would be necessary to clarify how this figure would contribute to the achievement of the specific objectives of the challenge, which are, for example: new active members in the community, who buy and delegate Ada, as well as CNFTs, who work for Catalyst, who help or invest in the development of Dapps... Anyway, that are really active in the community and make an impact for the growth of the blockchain. Unfortunately, it is not so clear what the impact of these figures would be on our ecosystem, I think this proposal could better fit the challenge of new media, for example, because perhaps these figures could be added to the production of texts about Cardano that could circulate in different types of media (like websites about economics, for example)... I don't know, it was just a use that I thought was quite relevant. I'm not saying that it's a bad idea and that the production of these figures wouldn't really add to the Cardano ecosystem, but that it all doesn't relate so clearly to the goals of this challenge, with the attempt to attract new active members to our community. . \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The script is reasonable, because we know which phases would be worked on (research, design and art, in addition to the administrative issue), and we also know the average time they would take. However, I think these phases could be more detailed. In terms of research, for example, what sources do the authors of the proposal intend to use to acquire the necessary knowledge to produce the engravings? It would be essential for them to say what subjects they are thinking of approaching, there are 20 pictures, would each of them be about a different theme or would there be 5 themes with 4 pictures each? How will it be decided which themes would have how many engravings on? In terms of design and art, we are told that the proponents have other commitments besides the execution of this project, which makes us wonder how much time, in reality, they will dedicate to carry out this work. What would your work routines be like for making sketches, for experimenting with colors, textures, etc? How many hours per week do they plan to dedicate to this project? In the administration part, the bidders could have explained what exactly would constitute this step. What will be administered? The working time, the topics chosen, the availability of drafts? It gets a little confusing because the project wouldn't have a big team (it would be 2 illustrators, from what I understand), there wouldn't be so many different activities to manage either (I'll give an example to make it clearer - when we are designing a game, many and many things will be created and worked on, illustrations, narration, UI/UX design, programming, etc. In this case, I can visualize what the administration process would be like, because it is a multifaceted work, but in the case of this project, I don't it is very clear the need a thousand dollars directly for this part). Regarding funding, I disagree that the amount is well justified, asking for 9500 dollars, which would result in a total of 475 dollars for illustration, which is a very high amount. The parts into which the total amount would be divided should be better explained. For example, as I mentioned in the administration part, why do you need a thousand dollars for this? In the design and art part, they would add up to 6 thousand dollars, but we have no idea of \u200b\u200bexactly how much time the proponents would dedicate to the project, we know the total number of weeks. But do you agree that in a week they could work 3 hours a day, or 3 hours a week? If they had specified exactly how much time they would dedicate to the project, we could calculate the hourly value of their work and see if it would be fair value or not. Regarding the preparation of the authors, little information is given about them, we know that they have already worked for the Terra Cognita project, which is a game that was financed by fund 7. This is good, as it indicates that they already have some experience working within of the Cardano ecosystem. However, we would need to know more, for greater trust to be passed. What are your professional backgrounds, what are your previous jobs besides participating in Terra Cognita? Do they have experience with other Catalyst projects? As they are illustrators and designers, it would be essential that they attach a portfolio where we could see their previous work. So, about the duo, I think the presentation was superficial and didn't convey that much confidence. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Regarding how we could follow the development of the project, I think this part was too superficial. We are told that there would be 20 figures in total (as I mentioned before) and that they could be presented in blocks of 5 figures. However, this would correspond to the delivery of partial results, and would not exactly be a monitoring of the work process itself. When seeing see, it is essential that the proponents update the Cardano community weekly on how their work routines have been. This can be done by Miro, for example, as it is an online tool where you can post both videos and texts. I think it would be great if they created a panel on Miro and at the end of each week they would inform us, for example: what were the results of the work that week (in the research phase, they could point out some topics studied, in the project phase, they could attach some sketches or ideas for colors, textures, repetitions, etc.); it would also be important for them to explain about the work routine itself, that is, did they really fulfill the workload that was planned? Was there a problem where they couldn't deliver all the results they thought for that period of time? I believe that if this more detailed monitoring were carried out, instead of just seeing partial deliveries, we could also understand the work that was carried out to get us there. Regarding the final result, I think they were also a little superficial in building a successful scenario. It would be interesting for them to do some research to understand where their images were circulating, what uses were attributed to them by the Cardano community, how this contributed to the addition of new members to the ecosystem... in other words, in practice , how can the impact be noticed? If this research were carried out and the results were taken to the members of the Cardano community, I believe that in fact we would have a good auditability of the final results, a more qualitative analysis than quantitative analysis. I generally suggest that both natures (qualitative and quantitative) be explored in auditability, but in this case I think it's even more important to realize how these prints are being used than how many people are doing it. \n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 735, "q0": "This is a bit of a niche proposal, in that it kind of squeezes into the challenge through the back door.  This is a request for funding to create an Opensource set of 20 icons for use by the community to brand proposals with coordinated, consistent Catalyst imagery.  Here is where 'niche' comes in: you can find alignment with the challenge in either considering it to be a tool that new members can use to indicate better solidarity with certain roles or processes in Catalyst (such as a \"toolbuilders\" icon or a CA icon), but it can help in another way, by creating familiar landmarks for new members to recognize where they are...a CA icon included in an avatar image, or on a Discord server, or as letterhead on a document or media cahnnel can give a clue about who you are talking to, or about where you are, or about what you are reading.  It is challenging to consider how any of the category KPIs might apply in either of those cases but as you will see (auditability), it can be done.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team is a part of AIM, which has made much of the iconography we see around us in Catalyst.  As is made clear in the roadmap, this proposal intends to put the shine of professionalism on the project, from dedicated time for research, to allowances for iterating design and testing.  Additionally they will be using the designer/illustrator paradigm, where they divide this into two roles.  I have worked on business branding teams before, and being able to have the illustrator bounce iterations of a design off a designer rather than a customer is ideal.  It clarifies roles to keep the work flowing but allows for a lot of emergent creativity.  They indicate that like a lot of people being pulled in by the gravity of Catalyst, they have to commit their time wisely, so they note that while they believe the project could be finished in 8 weeks, they are allowing for a timeline of 3-4 months.  Should mean that they won't be disturbed by the sound of deadlines whooshing past.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Measuring impact is not even on the radar of the proposer, but it is possible.  Their assumption is that tracking the release of the icons, perhaps in batches of 5 will satisfy reporting requirements, which is true enough.  But since it is going to be opensourced, probably from a GitHub repo, there are GitHub APIs that allow you to see how many times your files have been downloaded.  Reporting this back to the community initially can bridge the gap between when they are released and the inevitable moment when we are using them everywhere (which, incidentally, is when there will be the most demand to update the old, tired things, lol).\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 4, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2504, "q0": "Although the idea of this proposal is sound and would add value to the community I am not sure whether it directly aligns with the challenge brief. \n\nHaving a coherent and aligned portfolio of icons available to the community would certainly be a valuable resource and benefit certain projects but I do not see it having a drastic impact on new member onboarding. \n\nHowever the need for good quality, professional presentation and marketing of projects is real.

Challenge, it would have addressed that Challenge better for we do need to create a repository that incorporates an unified message through brand. As the proposer has mentioned we do not have a proper brand. At it's current state, Cardano effectively only has a corporate identity not a brand. There are attempts to address this through the Cardano Summit, we saw a glimpse of it but other than that, Cardano is a melting pot of ideas that eventually leads to a bowl of soup of whatever.
