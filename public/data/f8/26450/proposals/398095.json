They plan to accomplish this by creating reusable educational material including workshops and videos, and then hosting several online gatherings followed by one big in-person meetup for their growing Cardano community at a South Africa blockchain conference.  Their focus through this will be in establishing a strong base among participants of general Cardano knowledge and more specific Catalyst knowledge that encourages them to become referrers and proposers, and to spread the word and educational material to others to keep the momentum going. Once the educational materials have been curated, created and organized, the potential to continue conducting these session, both online and in person is very high, and limited primarily by the ability to source funding for the time and personnel required to do the presentations.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team will need to start with exploring the existing educational resources available, including translations, and they indicate that to do that they will need to personally become more educated themselves about Cardano and Catalyst.  Here they are leaning into both a  referrer (Anushka) and a well-known Catalyst member (Allison) to make sure they are on track.  It isn't clear just how much of the loads of existing educational resources will meet the needs of the sessions they intend to conduct, but it is worth noting that there are LOTS of materials out there, and hopefully they would only have to adapt some of it to their use.  They expect to primarily create \"bite-sized videos\" so they may have to script all of their material from scratch, but it would address a Catalyst need, since a lot of the onboarding videos are at minimum 15mins and many run over an hour.  These videos make up well over half of the budget, and are the biggest factor in pushing this proposal budget up over a fifth of the total funds available in the challenge setting.  It would be nice to know, at that price, what they felt the breakdown was going to be per video so a better estimate could be made about just how much educational content was capable of being created.  It is worrisome, if not entirely clear, that the deliverables may be indicating as few as four three-minute videos, at approximately $5100 apiece....  Obviously this also includes much of the cost of the research as well.  The timeline is tight, and expects to be able to deliver the videos and 4 onboarding sessions over the course of 3 months.  It would be nice to see more details about how the participants will be onboarded as proposers, as most of what the proposal refers to is more basic Cardano skills like creating wallets.  Do they plan to dedicate material or time to sample proposals or covering what constitutes a complete proposal?  These are basic Catalyst concepts that the proposers are engaging in themselves, and they should be on the roadmap.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The deliverables for this project are well defined, and leave room for some expansion.  Besides the indicated videos and sessions (including a session recording that is meant for distribution as onboarding media) there will be ample opportunities for reusable slides for workshops, infographics, that kind of thing (possibly even signage for the in person event could be designed in such a way as to make the majority of it reuseable.)  But perhaps the most important deliverable is the promise of multiple proposals coming from the South African community to increase adoption and exposure of Catalyst and Cardano, but the team hasn't included any plan for how they might report and track that.  As it is also the most significant KPI for the challenge setting (Catalyst onboarding) it would be good for the proposer to include both a plan to follow up with participants and their attempts to submit proposals and a specific measure or KPI that could be referred to, to measure that.  For example, they could commit, under the existing budget, their own mentorship to help these hopefuls (modeling a mentorship that they could pass on to others) and track both the assessments and total grades these proposals garner, as well as funding sought and acquired.  Even after fully funding this proposal, the community would still care to know these results outside of the normal progress reporting and auditing protocol, or to be included in the \"completion\" video required for final audit.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 7, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Thanks for your feedback: \nImpact: You grasped the idea very well.\nFeasibility: The assumption is that a minimum of 20 videos may need to be created.

Additional stats suggested will be considered in the design thinking session to be help to refine the execution plan for this proposal. THANKS :) \n"}, {"q0": "Overly simplified, this proposal aims to introduce and connect people in South Africa to Catalyst. From my understanding of it, the plan is to get people already interested or involved in blockchain technology and introduce them to Cardano and specifically, Catalyst. Growing number of users in Africa will always be highly relevant, and the methodological approach that the team presents in this proposal invokes a lot trust and credibility for their plan. The idea of connecting 3 major blockchain communities in South Africa is pretty smart, and might open up future collaborations not only within Cardano but also other blockchains (if done correctly). \n\nThe proposer makes it clear that they plan to run this project from a long term perspective, so this initial phase would be laying a proper foundation for the project to grow for a long time. They present us with a clear problem statement (making introductions to Catalyst \u2019easier\u2019, along with onboarding new people), and a well thought-out and realistically crafted solution (Connect to blockchain communities, research and craft effective educational material, produce said material, invite people to use it). There is so much detailed information included in the proposal spanning from project design to considerations on what impact the implemented project will have on its audiences. \u2028\u2028There is a case to be made wether or not this should fit in the \u201dGrow Africa, grow Cardano\u201d-challenge, but considering the proposals heavy focus on onboarding active participants of Catalyst, I would (from my experience as a recurring CA) that it is in the right challenge category. \n\nOverall, I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses this challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Reading through the comments section and the proposal, we learn that the total budget has been lowered prior to the finished proposal, which in my (intuitive and subjective) opinion is a good decision. The proposal aims to achieve a whole lot long term, so chopping the goals and roadmap into smaller pieces and reapplying for funding during future funds will increase the probability of high quality and success. The proposal provide us with a clear and simple budget breakdown with allocations distributed on a 4 month timeframe. In order to make the feasibility and quality of the proposal even higher, I would suggest to add an estimate of the working hours for each budget section, along with how many people will be working on each. (For example, during month 4 we will have two people+1 blockchain expert hosting and organizing x amount of workshops. 30 hour preparation for each person and 5 hours for hosting the workshops).\n\nParts of the team is very well known within the Catalyst Community. However, in order to increase the credibility of the team I would suggest to add some verifiable sources that can strengthen and confirm the experience/competency of the team members (such as LinkedIn profiles, successfully implemented projects etc). The developing team seem to have a good understanding of what is needed in order for this project to achieve success, from preparations to finalized product. There seem to be a great need for a person with video editing skillset, but the team has chosen to take that responsibility themselves, which I won\u2019t argue with. As a teacher, I stand by the decision of increasing the proposal teams competency for future budget efficiency, and strengthening the core team. It is a long term investment into the project, basically. \u2028\u2028The proposal feature an extensive presentation and contemplation of potential challenges related to the project, giving the us both Challenge\u2014>Solution to the risks related to the project. Most challenges are related to skeptics of Cardano, or attracting people to the project. All potentially combatted by including some community experts, and connecting to a few existing Blockchain Communities in South Africa.  \nIf I were to make an addition to the proposal, I would have liked\n(From my experience as a teacher/researcher) to see an example of a curriculum or some bullet points of the topics that would be covered within the workshops. \nBased on the statements mentioned above, I agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Contained within the proposal is a clear roadmap on a 4 month timeframe. The section \u201dmetrics alignment\u201d brings a lot of valuable information to the proposal (in my experience as a CA, not many proposals have this level of extensive consideration of metrics). The proposals success will be measured in proposals generated from the workshops, Weekly townhall attendees, produced educational material, signups to ideascale, attendees of the workshops, etc. \n\nI am impressed of how the proposers incorporate the existing community support channels and resources (like Catalyst School) in their proposal. It will invite the community to follow the projects development, and incorporate the participants of the project in the larger Catalyst ecosystem directly, and not keep it to a small section of it. \n\nConsidering how many channels of communication that are public or very well known to Catalyst, I\u2019m unsure on what can be made to improve the auditability of the proposal. My intuitive suggestion would be to have a very clear channel of communication (like an official discord, twitter or telegram support channel), that attendees and involved people can use to communicate with the team directly, or follow the development progress of the project. Conclusively, I strongly agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.

We also have that the idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal, despite not being innovative, brings concepts to spread knowledge about Cardano. And with the greater number of users on the platform, as stated in the proposal, a greater number of project submissions in future funds is expected, causing a positive impact in the medium term. However, the budget is not very adequate or consistent with the proposal's execution plan. In addition, there are already tools from Cardano itself aimed at teaching new participants.\n\nAs mentioned, the idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal is interesting, but it is not innovative, also because this work is already carried out by the School of Cardano. Taking that into account, the amount of $30,000 seems high. And also about the budget, information was confused in the feasibility section, we see that it was reduced to not exceed 15% of the total budget of the challenge, but this raises a question about the possible losses brought to the proposal (it seems that the total budget before the cut would be $45,200).", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Regarding the amount that was requested, we can see that the authors of the proposal mentioned not having much previous experience with blockchain technology, and there is a need for the constant presence of other more experienced people in the subject in the meetings held. This creates some doubt around the future viability of the project if these specific people are not present.\n\nIn addition, it was not possible to locate the curriculum of the professionals involved in the project to confirm the experiences mentioned. Relative to the budget devoted to producing online workshops, $9,880 seems like a huge amount. Even with a total of 3 workshops, holding these events in a non-face-to-face modality could be less expensive. Most of the budget is allocated for the production of videos, $23,800, which would make sense, since the focus of the project is the production of educational materials. However, there was a lack of more detailed details on how the project would be publicized, it was not evident that any part of the total amount would be used for marketing investment.\n\nHowever, once again it is worth mentioning that the main activity of the project is already carried out in Cardano itself. Perhaps it would be more interesting to change the focus of the proposal; one possibility would be to reduce the total amount requested, and invest in researching new ideas that could be linked to the School that already exists on the platform.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Regarding the metrics that were established to measure the success of the project, we also observed that most of them only state that the previously established objectives would be met, but we were not able to see many parameters for monitoring the evolution of these objectives. In this sense, the use of some project monitoring tool such as Miro could have been indicated, in addition, a periodic public update of the stages of development would be important. But it is worth noting that some very relevant parameters were considered to understand progress such as the creation of new portfolios.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 0, "ng": 9, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thanks for your feedback.\nImpact: Existing contact is acknowledged and working through it has been extremely time consuming and confusing. The key for this proposal is to simplify the experience for future Catalyst participants. The budget is based on 3 full time team members for 4 months as well as 1 part time resource and expert input. A detailed spreadhsheet was compiled to calculate a budget using some assumptions as research is still in progress. Also note that accents and language used needs to be considered as we localise the content for South Africans. The South African accent is quite clear and can be understood by most english speaking people globally.\n\nFeasibility: The hosting cost included the coordination and a big part of the budget is to video, hire a venue, pay for food etc for the in person workshop. The proposal does indicate that Catalyst school and community site will be assessed for suitability of hosting content. Currently, these platforms offer lengthy videos and content with multiple links. The research phase will help us get clarity on this. See this as a 4 month budget not a once off budget. Longevity of the program will be maintained as our team will learn from the initial workshops and will be self sufficient thereafter. The approach of targeting the blockchain communities first allows us to not have to be experts that get involved as we will increase our network of professionals to support the community. \n\nAuditability: This will be tracked by the team and shared with the community in the regular project updates that is required by the Catalyst Program.\n"}, {"q0": "There are already several Cardano/Catalyst community driven resource and onboarding websites, with the specific purpose of familiarising newcomers to Project Catalyst. A simple Google search will point anyone in the right direction, and get a clear overview of what is going on.\nI don\u2019t see the lack of another project that would help accustom newcomers to all the information, as being the stimulus someone might need to actually get involved or to help better spread the news about it.\nHaving said this, I would encourage the team members to find an innovative way they could come about with their proposal. Just having compact articles, videos, workshops and After Town Halls doesn\u2019t mean they can actually be successful in bringing in new people. This is already being done, and new members are joining, each fund the number of proposals increases dramatically, by the hundreds - and the team\u2019s metric of having at least 20 new proposals submitted - not proposers or funded proposals - thanks to their programme is a very small number compared to the overall growth.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The timeline looks comprehensive, is divided in 4 months, provides detailed description of each procedure and with the budget allocated for each step mentioned at the end of each stage.\nHowever, the total calculated budget sums up at $45000.

As such, I cannot evaluate if the initial budget of $45000 was realistic or too large, or if the new, much smaller one, of $30000 is now under budget or still very large, and if they will be able to successfully implement the proposal with the new amount.\nBesides the incomplete budget, the team has not offered details regarding the team members, we are provided only with a first name and a short description of that person\u2019s role.

The solution was for the team to directly participate in Catalyst, then create training materials and organize seminars in 3 blockchain communities in South Africa. The solution is implemented in 3 stages, described specifically, clearly and in accordance with the requirements of the challenge: Phase 1: Research and detailed design of our solution; Phase 2: Create / Source learning content; Phase 3: Deliver 3 online and 1 in person meet up. With these 3 phases and also reaching out to 3 Blockchain communities in South Africa (SAFBC, SANBA, BAC), I find that the proposal has a reasonable idea and solution and can be successful.\nThe proposed solution will solve the issues of the challenge such as raising awareness about Catalyst, creating referral tools and services, increasing the number of members participating in Catalyst.

Basically, these are the activities of the Catalyst School's already active project, which, if I'm not mistaken, was financed two funds ago and already has very good and well-planned activities with the same objectives as this proposal, including some developments such as the individualized follow-up of people and also extensions such as the LATAM Catalyst School, that is, which is geared towards Latin America. I think that this proposal could establish a dialogue with the Catalyst School so that, as was done in the case of Latin America, a school could be created especially focused on South Africa. The proposal has some differentials, in fact, such as the holding of face-to-face meetings with the presence of influencers from the blockchain industry in the locality in question. I think that if this bridge were established, it would be avoided to work the same content twice, on the contrary, the united teams could help each other and innovate (such as these face-to-face meetings). Then, the proposal would be perfectly aligned with the objectives of the challenge, including two challenges: the present, of new members, and also what promotes the benefit of Africa and its inhabitants. In other words, my opinion is that it's a good idea but to avoid unnecessary work creating videos, written documents, graphics and so on about how Catalyst works and how to start working on it, the team should associate with the Catalyst School project; I also believe in the differential of these face-to-face meetings, this is a really innovative part. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The script is quite detailed. The activities for each month are defined and explained in detail. In this way, we have a very solid view of the process, with a complete understanding of what is to come and what would be necessary for the development of the project in practice. Regarding the budget, this part is explained clearly, but it could be better detailed; for example because the production of the videos would cost approximately 24 thousand dollars, along with the creation of other content (Workshop Content, Website, Marketing and Social Media Content). But we don't know precise information about each video: the exact size of each one, what kind of video it would be; and even more, as I said about impact, there are already several contents like this on youtube, videos made in the form of animation, by the way, to make your understanding as simple as possible. So I don't see the need to spend such a large amount on producing something that already exists. I believe that instead of saying how much a group of things would cost, it would be better if they explained the value that would be assigned to each one of them. In other words, I think the budget explanation is ok, but it could be even better. And regarding the team's presentation, we are presented in a very shallow way who its participants are, so we can't understand deeply who we are dealing with or if these people are prepared to successfully execute the project. It would be necessary to include a small resume of each, talking about their training, previous jobs and proving all this through some social network, such as linkedin, for example. Apparently as a permanent member that is understood about Cardano we only have Alison Fromm, in addition to the experts who would participate in the face-to-face meeting. It would be better if more people who would work permanently on the project had this knowledge, but one person is the minimum I consider necessary in this regard. Therefore, the feasibility is average, because while some parts (like the script) are great, others should be more detailed, as is the case of the team presentation. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This is the part that is best covered in the proposal, because we have useful information for monitoring the proposal both in this session and in impact.

We also know the notions of success, audience expectations and the exact reflexes that we expect to see in Catalyst itself, such as the increase in the number of proposals on Catalyst, participants in governance sessions, etc. I think that the team involved in the project could prepare some reports, in a period, and send them to the community, so that we can accurately follow the development of the project. As it is a proposal aimed at South Africa, it would be interesting if, for example, a survey was carried out with the local inhabitants, the people who would participate in the face-to-face meetings, for example, in order to understand the real impact of this project on their lives, if they became active members of the Cardano community, acquired Ada, learned to delegate, if they are participating in any DAO and etc. Another idea I can give is, if a partnership with Catalyst School is made, that this team also provides feedback to the community talking about things that were added to their project and improvements after this association.
