I believe Catalyst School, if successful, will solve the problem posed by the Challenge of converting ADA holders into active Catalyst members; improving the quality of the courses. proposer, CA. Besides that, I think Catalyst School is a place to gather documents and videos related to Catalyst and disseminate and retrain new members as well as current Catalyst members who are lacking in experience and knowledge. In terms of ideas, I find the idea good and meaningful.\nWrite a clear, easy-to-understand proposal on how the project will contribute to the building and development of Catalyst, Cardano.\nI realize that if this proposal is successful, there could be more valuable to Catalyst in the future.\nOne thing I don't see very clearly in this Impact section is how to address the risk that the project is facing. It is the risk of the number of people attending the courses or seminars. I see you mentioned the solution is to increase marketing, improve outreach strategies to attract more participants. I think if you describe the marketing plan more specifically, how to attract participants, the proposal will be more solid, and clear.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "First, about the team members implementing the proposal, according to the information stated in the proposal, I understand your team has enough personnel with good experience and skills, suitable to carry out this project. However, I can't check the accuracy of the information about the team members you provided, because I can't find any links or attachments related to the members' experiences. You should attach qualifications, CV, or Linkedin link of members.\nRegarding the budget, you list quite detailed the necessary costs for implementation. And it's great that you include an explanation of why the proposed budget is higher this time than before. This increases budget coherence. I wonder why you charge the execution cost according to the unit price of 50USD/hour and not according to the work item results.?! And in the budget section you mentioned Marketing costs but only costs for weekly Twitter, Telegram, Discord announcements, visual identity management costs... Is this a marketing strategy? You mentioned in the risk resolution section, is that right? Is posting weekly announcements an effective way to attract people to join your courses? I think you should have a marketing strategy and then make marketing costs based on that will be more appropriate.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "About the roadmap, I see you have written in the \"Feasibility\" section. You will implement this project in 6 weeks. However, I have not seen clear indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of each stage in the project. the route you stated.\nIn the \"AUDITABILITY\" section, you have a way to measure the progress and development of the project, but there are no specific numbers for each part. For example, how many conference videos will be uploaded to the Youtube channel? How much new content will be posted on the site? How many members will register for 1:1 support after 6 weeks? The community can check your progress through your website and youtube channel, but it is not your KPIs to see if you are performing effectively and on schedule.\nSimilarly, in the success measurement section, it will be much more convincing if you state how many workshop participants are expected to reach? how many 1:1 support courses are provided? Youtube video views? What is the expected number of website visits? What is the expected number of registrations on the website?.... Estimating the exact number can be a bit difficult, but it will help the project clearly define its goals and community as well as Catalyst's assessment. evaluate the effectiveness of the project.\nI hope Catalyst School will be successful in the future.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_823", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 7468, "q0": "This proposal is certainly in line with the objectives of the challenge. The Catalyst School is already a pretty solid group within our community, known for really being the best place for new people to get involved with the Catalyst process. The principles of this project are perfectly summarized in the excerpt \u201cWe onboard new members and help improve their skills along the way, in whatever way they decide to get involved with Catalyst: as a Proponent, Community Advisor, Veteran Community Advisor or without any specific role in the process\u201d. And we know how they do it too, through: \u201clive sessions and workshops, 1-to-1 and group support in many different languages, interactive website and other Catalyst-related workshops\u201d. During the description of the impact, the proponents position those readers who are not yet familiar with the project very well, explaining the main topics addressed by the School and how it is currently operating, that is, what practical activities are being carried out at the moment. The proponents also put us very well on the need for the School to exist: Catalyst is really a differentiated type of funding that has its own rules. In other words, the problem established here is that a person, without the proper guidance, usually cannot understand what Catalyst is or how to get involved, where to start, how to fit into this process that for those who are not yet used to it. it becomes complex. With that, this project very well meets what is asked in the challenge, as we seek to facilitate the participation of new people in our community, and one of the ways that anyone can participate in the Cardano ecosystem is by being CA or vCA, for example. So, by making it easier for people who don't understand very well to get involved with Catalyst, acting in any of the roles previously listed, it's certainly benefiting the sum of new members. Finally, I conclude that it is of fundamental importance that this proposal be funded, so that the professionals who make this initiative happen can be adequately remunerated and continue this work, so important for the overall growth of Cardano. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the proposal is very good. We know exactly what would be done in practice, as the proponents explain what activities would be carried out on a weekly basis. It is positive that it is already an ongoing project, and the professionals involved already have experience with what they do, so they will not start from scratch at this stage. The proponents state that some adaptations in the development of the project will be made, such as the reduction of the number of workshops, I believe that in order to have more people participate in the sessions and that they can be a little longer and full of content. We know exactly which topics would be covered each week, for example: \u201cweek 2 - Submission Phase: 1 x Introduction to Catalyst (After City Council and Swarm Session) and 2 x Proposing in Catalyst (After City Council Municipality and the Enxame Session)\u201d. With this, the visualization of the process is very solid, it is totally understandable how this proposal would develop in practice. Analyzing the funding requested, 17,800 dollars are requested, which in my opinion is a very fair value for the amount of service that will be delivered and also for the number of people who will dedicate themselves to the project. The payment of professionals is also explained very clearly, it is 50 dollars an hour for them to perform various services. The amount of hours each one would work on the project is also defined, that is, again it is very easy for us to understand this part of the proposal. They also define how each part of the whole (management, marketing, etc.) would cost in total, allowing us another angle of analysis for the budget. Finally, analyzing the team, I really think that there is a lot of confidence in the team's ability to deliver the expected results. I think this for two reasons: first, this project has been going on for some time, any and all members of our community can participate in the workshops, in the Telegram channel dedicated especially to School and see in practice that the project is really serious and constant in your deliveries. That is, the team is really responsible and has already proven this in service. In addition, the proponents attach a short description of each one of them, so that we can get to know them individually, know what professional areas they work in and some of their previous experiences. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Firstly, it is very simple for us to audit the school's activities just because we are part of the Telegram group they have. Second, they provide a very specific roadmap on what would be done each week, knowing exactly the activities that must be developed and the small goals to be achieved, so I think it is very possible for us to audit the process. In addition, the proponents state that: \u201cWe will provide progress reports to the IOG at the biweekly coordinator meetings and to the challenge team at the monthly meeting\u201d. Not enough, they also suggest various ways in which the community can follow your achievements, whether through their youtube channel, the official website or the contact list they provide. In other words, we are absolutely sure that it is possible to safely monitor the tasks carried out in a progressive manner. Talking about the final results, it is very possible that we also understand what success is, as the proponents state various objectives, such as the \u201cnumber of workshop participants (maximum and average), the number of 1 to 1 support sessions provided and the number of views on our YouTube videos.\u201d I usually say that it is necessary for proponents to force a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the activities they seek to develop, however, due to the nature of this proposal, in order to analyze the quality of the workshops and all the time of service that this group provides, it is enough that we participate in their activities. So, really the best way to measure success is by the numbers, by the reach that the group owes in relation to how many people became active members of the Cardano community and started to work on Catalyst in a guided way. Finally, I agree that it is a fully auditable proposal.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1270, "q0": "I believe this proposal effectively addresses the challenge by providing a smooth transition for ADA holders that attend the Cardano townhall meets to being an involved member of the Catalyst ecosystem.\nIt also helps newcomers navigate the Cardano Ideascale as a proposer, CA, vCA or just someone that is browsing through.\nPersonally, I have benefited from The Catalyst School videos immensely. \nThe only reason I chose a rating of 4 instead of a 5 is that specific information is hard to dig out from the videos since most of them extend to a length of one hour.\nIt\u2019d be really helpful to viewers if there were time stamps on the videos and if there can be slight editing to make the viewing experience more crisp.\nIn addition to that, the website navigation is not user friendly at this point.

I also could see that the team is trying to not committee same mistakes as previous projects, learning with experiences and taking previous actions to avoid the low attendance.

Establishing a budget to pay for each role and workload in hours is a very solid plan that may result in a reliable and productive team.

The inclusion of a timeline with some milestones and an implementation plan in Gantt diagram format would have allowed the easy auditability of this proposal. Apparently, the team also makes no mention of the potential risks the team might face in the process. It would be very useful if the team have a previous recover plan to keep track of the timetable. I recommend making an effort of forecast challenges with a risk matrix of probability and impact.
