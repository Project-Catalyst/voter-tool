Rather than onboarding to Catalyst, it is a more general Cardano onboarding proposal, and more specifically a new SPO onboarder, and more specifically not an onboarder at all, but an existing submit api infrastructure expansion to help nami and ccvault users (or any wallet that can choose a custom submit api endpoint presumably) bypass the api backends, like blockfrost.io to get onchain.  While a valuable scaling protocol, the service and suggestion here are for more advanced participation levels on Cardano, in particular for wallet users who want to speed up their transactions.  The average new member has no idea whether their txs are slow, and would be lost trying to change endpoints or messing with any parameters in their wallet.  As a scaling protocol, freeloaderz is an interesting module worth supporting imo, on the grounds that it comes at decentralization from a different way.  I have questions about the longterm scalability of the protocol for SPOS, but I do think there is long term potential here for wallet-developers (with end users not even aware of it in the long run).", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I would have liked to have seen team details for this proposal as, even though I know who the proposers are, that may not be the case for most voters.  What I can say is that they plan to spin up the node(s? it was unclear whether they were spinning up both usa1 AND europe1 OR just one of them...OR elsewhere they mention 3 servers) in 4 weeks and I have no doubts they can, as they are experienced SPO operators who help single pool operators with their setups all the time.  I am curious about whether this will be an aws or baremetal relay, which some voters may care about as well...  The budget doesn't clarify any of the issues, but we can expect the server setup to be $1k each which is borderline baremetal imo.  It would be good to see a roadmap here, breaking the serve setup into three parts, but as a 4 week project, it is understandable why they didn't feel the need to include it.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Again, a roadmap with the deliverables would have paid dividends here, but the team is essentially looking to spinup and install the protocol, and then finalize in 4 weeks, so, unless there are blockers, there won't even be any progress reports!  The big issue here is the lack of any KPIs that could help tie this proposal to the challenge setting...but I don't think that is possible.  I would have liked to see something along the lines of a current adoption or use rate and a target for this going forward, but I'm not sure the available SPO metrics could capture this.

It may just requires more explanation, and they do mention creating a DAO to manage the infrastructure so I believe the proposer and spo's involved will become frequent catalyst users if this is funded.
