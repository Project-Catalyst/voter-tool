The proposal\u2019s solution, which is to run monthly impact-related thematic events to attract and onboard newcomers, could make a difference by attracting more people to project Catalyst, thereby raising awareness.  More people will lead to more weekly sign-ups to Cardano Ideascale and increasing attendance to Townhall, Catalyst School, and Swarm sessions.

For example, while the opening statement addresses bringing in new members, the proposal's targets appear more aimed at growing Cardano's influence over climate issues.

Example; they mention \"Sharing Info and Education\". What info and what education do they seek to achieve?

Or perhaps to be involved in the Project Catalyst process, for the goal to onboard is not for the sake just to onboard, but for them to be engaged, involved and build on Cardano. From a technological standpoint, I do wonder how can this topic benefit Cardano. Inherently Cardano indeed is a \"greener\" technology than that of proof-of-work, but other than Veritree, the potential of regenerative farming, carbon neutral NFT's and perhaps a hint of traceability, I have not seen further use cases of Cardano.
