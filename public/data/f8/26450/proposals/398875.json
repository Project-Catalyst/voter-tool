A solution for this problem would align well with the guiding question of: How might we increase awareness of Project Catalyst as the most active open innovation platform?  Developing an on-boarding plan for those interested in entrepreneurship, work, or governance will help to make progress towards the key metrics of both the innovation process and general onboarding sections of the challenge.  The proposal is geared towards creating an onboarding process for a preexisting Cardano community, Innovatio.  The target audience is entrepreneurs, developers, and consumers all of which could lead to more quality proposals, community advisors, and voters.  The proposal seeks to address the challenge by increasing awareness and adoption of Project Catalyst, increasing engagement in the Innovatio community, and increasing awareness of different Project Catalyst communities, tools, and projects which align with the guiding questions.  It also indicates that it will reuse and leverage existing content and activities produced by other communities in the ecosystem which also aligns with the guiding questions.  \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has blockchain, finance, engineering, marketing, and legal expertise.  It appears to be more heavily weighted in engineering.  Part of the plan for funding is to hire a brand ambassador which will be helpful to achieving the goal of attracting entrepreneurs and early adopters.  \n\nPlan activities are listed as creating a weekly newsletter, creating infographics of the Catalyst ecosystem, and developing animated videos for an Instagram ad campaign.  What\u2019s missing are the details on how many infographics and animated videos are to be produced and what the content will be about.  \n\nThe proposal indicates that we can expect to see infographics and videos beginning in week 3, but doesn\u2019t provide any further details or timelines.  The budget is small, simple, and is very clear in what it will be used for.\n\nThe proposal indicates that there are no significant challenges that it faces, but this only raises questions to how deeply this was thought about.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Auditability is weak.  The proposal indicates that it will evaluate interactions and impressions on social media posts though it doesn\u2019t say how they will be evaluated and for what. It says that it will measure people actively talking about Catalyst or Cardano in the community, though it doesn\u2019t indicate how that will be accomplished. It says that it will measure Catalyst community projects that are active within the Innovatio community, again it would be good to understand how this measurement will be made.  It says that it will measure the number of infographics and diagrams to understand the Catalyst ecosystem, it's not clear if this is measuring the new infographics that they plan to create or existing ones in circulation.  What's lacking here are clear metrics and KPIs.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1375", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2739, "q0": "This proposal has a primary goal of increasing awareness of Project Catalyst and promoting meaningful participation by exposing the Innovatio community to various media they will produce related to Project Catalyst.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers provided a clear plan including timelines for completion of this proposal.
