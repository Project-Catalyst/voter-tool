The proposer can not understand the right paint points of them, so the proposal can far from reality. I very much appreciate your solution, such as your team will create content with suitable language for each community in Eastern Asia, because English is not a parent language of these countries, so this is one of the huge obstacles to make many the voter can understand what proposer wants to do in their project. In addition, we need proposers to appear in social channels more and more to talk about their plan, what are their proposal, so the voter can give them the advice to adjust the proposal and no need to wait for CA round to make an assessment, and I see your team have mentioned in this proposal, it is a good direction.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I see your team member is quite talented and has a lot of experience in the Catalyst Project.
