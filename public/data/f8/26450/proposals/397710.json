The solution to this problem was to create visualizations of the Cardano and Project Catalyst ecosystems with diagrams and charts through a contest. (The proposer provides research evidence on the ability to learn faster, better with pictures, visual diagrams). to make it easier for newcomers from other communities to learn about Cardano. The suggestion perfectly fits the challenge, I agree with this solution. The proposer poses the problem, is written and presented clearly and coherently, and so does the solution. The proposal also addresses possible risks such as whether the rewards are attractive enough to attract participants, I completely agree with the proposer of a possible challenge as Cardano is a large platform, has a lot of specialized knowledge, to systematize the knowledge of the entire platform with diagrams and graphs is a huge amount of knowledge. The proponent also offered a solution to this problem, calling for third parties to sponsor and advertise to get more funding for the contest. I suggest adding sponsors to clarify the feasibility of the solution. The Cardano and Catalyst communities provide participants with enough background knowledge and skills to create images, the solution is to be able to compete in groups, which I think is a good solution. The proponent also recognizes that the project may be behind schedule if the number of participants is large with one person doing the work with all the contestants.

This challenge aims to encourage new people to become a member of the Cardano community, often Ada holders do not know Catalyst or make use of other technologies in our ecosystem, as well as increase the engagement of those who are already part of the community. Despite being a very incredible universe and full of opportunities, the Cardano ecosystem is extremely complex, I say this because I am already in Catalyst for 4 funds and to this day I have difficulty understanding how some things work and how I could participate more actively in the ecosystem, in addition to being CA and vCA. Therefore, the creation of a visual map will, in my view, be a very big step for us to facilitate the entry of new people, and for them to understand in a simpler and more organic way in which part of the ecosystem they fit. It's great how the author of the proposal presents a research to justify the relevance of the project; it is often much easier to learn through pictures than through massive participation in events, workshops, meetings or through reading a variety of long and often complicated documents. I believe so, it is a proposal that interacts directly with the objectives of the challenge, mainly in terms of locating people. Maybe it's not one of the proposals that attracts people the most, but it's certainly one that has a fantastic idea of \u200b\u200bhow to help people orient themselves. If it's already a challenge for young people (I say this because I'm from that part of the population), I imagine it can be even more confusing for people who grew up in the age of technology, don't know very well how to use online tools and so on. It is also very positive as the author seems to be aware of the possible problems to be faced, and with that, he starts to outline solutions, demonstrating practicality and maturity. Therefore, I believe that this proposal will have maximum impact if funded and done well. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap is very detailed, we understand the phases of the project and what small tasks each would consist of, forming a very clear and explored chronological order. The only thing that was lacking was the notion of time, unfortunately the proponent does not say how long on average each of these activities will last, in which months it is expected to obtain such partial results, etc. This would be important for us to have 100% understanding of the process, because we understand very well what will happen and how (for example, he explains in great detail about the contest, what would happen before, during and after, and what requirements would be necessary for participation and etc, as well as possible project extensions); if this were combined with a monthly or even weekly notion, it would be perfect. Regarding the budget, I think it is a very fair value for the project, and it is perfectly explained; we know how much of the money would go to contest participants, for marketing, for documentation and so on. It would be interesting if the proponent explained their marketing strategies in more depth, as people are the basis of the success of this project, and it is necessary to attract them. Regarding the team, I think we would need to understand who the bidder is. He doesn't introduce himself, doesn't claim how he got involved with the Cardano ecosystem, what is his current relationship with it, that is, is he a developer, designer...? It would be important for such information to be included in the proposal, as well as a means of proving it (such as your linkedin profile). The rest of the members would be the winners of the contest, in fact, there is no way to introduce them at this point in the project. But I wish the author had at least taken the time to present himself in great detail. Therefore, the two suggestions I make are: the proponent could situate the script in relation to time and present itself better. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Incredible. The bidder auditability is actually very good, one of the most detailed parts of the project. It gives us several KPIs that can be measured as time passes. It is a very qualitative analysis, that is, we know what we are expecting and the impacts that this will have on several fronts of the Cardano ecosystem, especially the human one, which is the focus of the project. I believe that this is in fact the best way to audit the proposal, it would be useless to set several numerical goals without understanding how this project would be unfolding for people and what paths it would be tracing. As we have a lot of information provided, I think that if financed, the proposal would be ready to be audited from the first moment, it is enough for us as a community to perform this role. Some members could be chosen to closely follow the project, they could participate in the contest phases and the unfolding of the phases and bring the information to the rest of the community. I think that a partial delivery of results would also be interesting, that is, if we could see how this graph would be born, as the parts were increasing and developing. Finally, everything the author says would greatly facilitate follow-up, enough information is provided to seriously and continuously monitor this project. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 6, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal is aligned with the goals of the challenge setting.

The creation of the most appropriate visualization will take the form of a public competition aimed at the Cardano community.\n\nThe project is entirely focused at the community and its involvement in the creation of this solution - a visualization of Cardano ecosystem. The main amount of the funding will be distributed as a prize fund (and not fully utilized by the applicant) in a competition held among community members, in order to select the best solution. I lack an explanation of how community members will be involved in the voting and if not who will vote and evaluate the quality of the visualizations.

Its focus on providing an easy way to onboarding new members and accelerating their responsible assumption of roles in Cardano's ecosystem.\n\nThe applicant has identified three risks for the implementation of the project - the amount of the rewards; number of proficient in the visual community members; unrealistic evaluation of the work load in the project - proposing concrete measures to overcome them in case of manifestation.\n\nAccording to the described benefits, the project has a great chance to benefit the community and to serve for the further development and evolution of the ecosystem.\n\nWhat I would like to see is a clearer description of the ideas for sustainability, adaptability and plans for future development and evolution of the visualization map so that it can be updated according to future changes in the structure or environment of Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project activities are clearly described and detailed.

As I mentioned above, I do not find any plans here for further editing of the visualization in the future in order to bring and up to date picture in case of changes and evolution of the ecosystem itself.\n\nThe distribution of the budget is made in such a way that most of the funding will be awarded to the participants in the competition for the creation of a visual map of the ecosystem (at best, these will be active members of the community).\nThe budget for the remaining costs is detailed with the estimated duration and hourly pay for each work and task, corresponding to the proposed timeline of the project.\nWhen presenting the budget, the applicant also foresaw the possible changes in the ADA's exchange rate against the USD when calculating the value of the prize fund.\n\nThe applicant provided examples of his expertise in creating visuals.

I understand it might have its benefits, like developing the members who will submit their proposals, and creating the best possible model. On the other hand, there might not be enough proposals, and even enough good proposals.

To enter the competition would require a significant amount of time from any given entry. A lot of this skilled work would be in vain as only one design could be implemented.

The proposer first suggest a visual model rather than the usual data repository, something with minimal descriptive text, yet hyperlinked to all the relevant knowledge resources, but then takes it a step further by proposing to run a community contest for visual creatives to try and make the best visual map.  Since participation and engagement are two of the challenges of creating accurate, robust knowledge hubs, this project is getting off on the right foot.  Besides addressing the challenge setting eloquently, satisfying no less than 5 of the challenge setting goals, this project will obliquely approach an underrepresented group in Catalyst: the creatives and visual thinkers.  The proposer also makes a good case for the value of just such a visual representation to exist alongside the existing onboarding material by including research that shows strong links between good visual aides and better retention of information, better orientation within onboarding experiences, and more intuitive understanding of relationships between resources.  In the future the protocols established with this project could also help create other engaging resources, such as ELI5 and ELI65 visual explainers, or niche tutorials for finding ones way through communication channels.

His experience as both an organizer of information protocols as well as an electrical engineering background (apparent in the 'flow' of the proposal which reads much like a circuit map) indicate substantial strengths, with links to projects he has worked on as proof.  The budget almost seems like a typo, as in too-low, but when you see how thoughtfully it has been applied, it is clear it is adequate to deliver the stated results.  The proposer notes that there is some risk that the rewards suggested for the contest may not be enough incnetive to draw enough participation, but in my opinion the first place award of $3000 is very attractive, and the fact that the top 5 entries will all receive compensation means that the incentives should prove adequate.  The proposer even thought to include a way of calculating the rewards to take into account the moves of the underlying ADA asset, apportioning the rewards as a percentage of the budget, rather than a hard $ value.  On top of that, space has been provided in the budget for marketing and hosting, and despite the nature of the project as discovering emergent value, budget has also been wisely set aside to help participants gain access to some tools that may prove useful in establishing their visualizations, such as subscription Miro services.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Of the hundreds of proposals I have read, this may be the finest version of a roadmap I have seen.  Everything is there:  all milestones appear in both the roadmap and budget, the timeline resolves to two-week sprints early, with the associated KPIs provided alongside the phases where those KPIs are measured or realized.  Catalyst projects need to have auditable reference points at least once a month:  this project provides 6 auditable events in the first 4 weeks, 4 in the next 4 weeks, and then a steady beat of two KPIs per month until the project is delivered.  Because the project requires masive community participation, there is no doubt that it will be easy to keep track of, and he indicates here several way of tracking and submitting communication regarding the project.  It is worth noting that among the KPIs provided, there is also the rarely seen in the wild KPI for measuring impact beyond the scope of the proposal, and in an otherwise humble proposal, the number almost seems incongruent.  The proposer would like to see 5000 unique views per fund, and would like to see that reached across all of the next 5 funds...  in other words, massive and lasting impact.
