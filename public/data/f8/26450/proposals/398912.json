For me, the key element (and this aspect is in excellent alignment with the challenge setting) is that of the Lead-->Mentor-->onboarding.  As they mention in the proposal, this isn't a new idea, as UNESCO and others have had a go at a blockchain based youth cohort.  What separates them from the rest is this onboarding protocol, very common in small local outreach efforts, here scaled up.  The beauty of scaling mentorship is that it never loses its effectiveness, that one to one relationship is always just as powerful of a force, whether you have 2 mentors or 20.  This component, with the oversight element provided by the lead, which will homogenize the services offered and make them transferable as mentors matriculate out of the program, will provide the support necessary to keep young mentees on track.  Typically in a youth program, when you lose track of someone, that is when the material passes them by or goes over their head, and they have no one to slow it down and tailor it to them, but with the mentor set up, this risk is averted.  Kids will stay with the concepts until they can master them, and in the process understand how they will be able to approach Catalyst with vigor and direction.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team thought of everything for this proposal, with a fantastic timeline and budget laid out that make clear the path to their goals.  In particular the breakdown around establishing the voting element for the youth to participate in is well thought out.  As I am reading through how they wish to build up the youth over time, establish respect for the governance protocols and then finally top it off with their own wallet and a chance to vote in Catalyst Governance, it occurs to me that they could very well set themselves up a DAO governance token at the root of their initiative.  It would give tremendous opportunity to do hands on teaching even if the wallet issues surrounding ADA price fluctuations end up being a burden.  They already have the team to build it out, and it is clear that they are thinking about all the right governance framework concepts to build something like that out.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "First, I love that they open with the idea of making all resources and presentations created opensource.  Lots of programs can do that, but few think to make it an essential part of their roadmap as opposed to an afterthought.  I would suggest they consider building a GitHub or Gitbook repo for all of the material, in addition to the existing google folders.  I really love their goal of creating a replicable model for onboarding youth, and nothing speaks to that more than the opensourcing.  Combine that with a timeline for a replicable DAO...  oh yeah.  They have many funded proposals, and checking the funded proposals reporting sheet, they are all up to date and current, so that gives me confidence that the KPIs they lay out (they are all in the Feasibility section...I would have liked to have seen them bulleted in auditability) will be no trouble to track.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 6, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Youth are the most important and dynamic segment of the population in any country.

But how will the project measure the relationship?  Also, 'youth tech leaders' is listed, but how will you determine what a 'youth tech leader' is.  I expect a KPI to be measurable and specific.

Simply put, their proposal seeks to specifically onboard the youth onto Cardano through a specific platform that seems to be a hybrid between a Town Hall with their After Town Hall events and Catalyst School workshop sessions, though this is not 100% correct for there are other things they seek to do. It almost seems the team are trying too much and lack focus what is their core solution. There is a lot of effort to explain their actions that coincide with key metrics of this Challenge such as; onboarding CA's, onboarding vCA's, onboarding proposers to increasing daily sign-ups, though it is unclear how they plan to achieve those key metrics. The team only mentions what they will do that align with those key metrics.\n\nBut what really confuses me is why are the only focusing on onboarding 10 individuals (please challenge my assessment if I read this incorrectly). Add to that, through their budget, they seem to want to groom these 10 individuals into some Youth Ambassadors. A great portion of their budget actually goes to giving those 10 youth voting power worth around 5000 ADA. Equivalent to $5,000 or potentially $15,000 ADA. It is unclear what happens to this fund after their initial batch of youth. Rather than $15,000 ADA sitting in wallet, unfortunately it would probably be used more effectively by proposals coming from Africa. Or by proposals that just seek to onboard the general masses.\n\nI do understand that there is a lack of youth in Cardano, but a simple tweak in every communities approach, offline or online would actually bring youth. One approach can be by collaborating with universities, which would perhaps yield more onboarding numbers, such as setting up a University \"X\" Cardano Hub. To attract them, we could collaborate with a Cardano base game or cross-chain with already established game from Ethereum. Or even perhaps just focus on the aspect that one can buy a new laptop from just participating in one round of a CA.\n\nThis proposal is not a cost effective approach to onboarding.

A lot of this proposal is about answering questions that do not actually add further clarity to their solution. Their solution is as following ; Lowering the barriers of entry into the blockchain, onboarding youth into the Cardano Catalyst Community. How do they seek to do that? By enabling youth and blockchain professionals to connect meaningfully, access professional guidance and expert mentorship.\n\nUnder that simplified premise, they will deliver on their intent. That part was never in questioned, it is more towards how the seek to deliver that plan that is either not concise or too concise in areas that do not assist them. An example budget, they ask for S30,000 for 1 (one) year, yet how they breakdown this budget does not mirror well with their action plan. It is more of a lump sump budget and not a detailed budget.\n\nGoing further deeper into their budget, they state they would need $12,000 for program management, this is most likely the project/program manager aspect.
