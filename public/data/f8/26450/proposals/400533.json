With the success of these events, we have the direct impact of local people learning more about Cardano's technologies and the indirect impact coming from these people's contact with other French speakers. Also, given the descriptions of what will be accomplished, we realize that the requested amount of $6,000 is doable.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "We see that the project's feasibility is quite convincing despite the fact that there is not a very complex plan behind the actions, which is normal given that the focus is on conducting face-to-face and online workshops focused on two main locations. In this way, the great differential would be the background of the creators of the project. In this regard, we see a previous experience on the part of professionals involved in promoting events that belong exactly to this niche, that is, the exhibition of Cardano materials for French speakers.\n\nIn addition, the number of events to be held has already been defined in advance, as well as the subjects that will be addressed in these events. Regarding the details of the budget, the amount spent on the organizers of the events and on logistics seems to be consistent, but it is worth noting that it would also be interesting to establish a cost in relation to the marketing of the project. It would also be nice if the CVs of the professionals involved in the project were made available.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The metrics established to understand the success of the proposal are also very clear and direct. We know that the objective of the project is to generate engagement around Cardano, by disseminating knowledge about its ecosystem, and here exactly the consequence of this dissemination is measured. For this, it was established how many new members are planned to reach in the first and second quarters, in addition to a monthly average of new active members. Additionally, it seems aggregating if, after the event, the organizers asked the participants if other French-speaking people, but not necessarily residents of the target regions of the project, also contacted them to ask about the event. This would be another way of mapping the scope of the project.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 3, "ng": 10, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 705, "q0": "This proposal intends to bridge a learning divide that is preventing French-speaking West African communities from adopting Cardano in meaningful ways.  If you search through twitter threads for influencers of Western Africa crypto adoption, you see a familiar paradigm:  price, price, price.  When Cardano is mentioned, it is FUD or worse, and the conversation only goes downhill from there.  The proposer seeks to continue their work to find a way across that divide and introduce the real crypto concepts that Cardano represents, and to measure their success by onboarding proposers, CAs and referrers into the Catalyst community.  The budget covers 6 months worth of outreach in the form of weekly workshops, both in person and virtual, across two cities in Western Africa (the cities have a combined population of over 3million), with a focus on how to participate via Catalyst in the Cardano blockchain, and on what that economic opportunity looks like.  ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has the backing and experience of WADA behind them, so they have a good pool of resources and a solid knowledge base grounded in the fundamentals of Catalyst.  In addition, the team itself is both experienced in speaking knowledgably about Cardano and crypto, as a provided paper attests, and in holding workshops of this type, having already delivered 5 to the proposed region.  On that note, it would be nice to see the results and KPIs of those meetings.  They have included a presentation that shows a well organized workshop with well over half of it dedicated to the proposal process itself, along with plenty of advice and best practices for creating high quality proposals.  Again, knowing the results to date for any proposers they referred or influenced would probably be a feather in this team's cap, and it is unfortunate it hasn't been included here for easy access.  There is clear knowledge presented about the process and timeline that it needs to occur on, and the pace of delivery seems wisely considered:  four workshops per month gives plenty of time to gather participation, especially with a lot of the workshop content already well in hand, while the plan to move between the cities and between on and offline events gives lots of opportunities for different levels of participation with a real chance to onboard members over time, with regular, repeated exposure.  While they don't provide an estimate of the kind of particiaption levels they are targeting with the workshops, they do seek to be onboarding approximately 5 people to Catalyst on average from each workshop.  The budget is very economical, with the team betting on its experience delivering these workshops to keep all costs on track and the project sustained.  While I think this budget could have fairly asked for more, I applaud the proposers for pledging to do more with less.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The provided timeline is easily auditable, with events occurring once a week, so progress reports on up to 4 events should be no problem to manage.  In addition to the included KPIs for onboarded member targets (100 over the course of the 6 months, on average, about 4-5/week), it would also be great just to track the total workshop participation and see if that increases or hold steady.  If the workshops have static limits, such as 10 participants, then perhaps the team could create a metric to track demand.  It would be interesting to see the ebbs and flows in this kind of demand to plan this type of outreach even better, and as communities begin to think of Catalyst Funding Cycles as growth cycles...a time to plant, a time to sow...  a time for outreach and onboarding, a time for mentoring.  Because of the connection to WADA, it is expected that the community will be kept abreast of the project, and that we will be alerted to any proposals resulting as the fruit of this grassroots work.

They have proposed the idea of organizing weekly French-language events (including meet-ups and educational seminars) in person and online. This is a viable idea that any community can implement to grow their community. It solves the question: How do you disseminate Cardano platform value to people? In particular, this makes even more sense when in French West African countries that do not have Cardano communities, people lack awareness of blockchain solutions. Cardano can lay the groundwork for this problem. I'm excited to see the group's proposal come into practice, which will give the people here access to new technology, the Cardano community will also be expanded. \nAfter identifying the problem, they have solutions to solve the problem very simple but highly effective. They created Whatsaap and Telegram groups for members to discuss and stay in touch with each other. These are popular social applications so this tool is also close to each resident here, favorable for connecting and increasing the number of members. In addition, they have a very professional Youtube channel to share content about Cardano in French. With the above solutions, they aim to introduce the Cardano platform to new people, create a space for French-speaking Cardano members to socialize, discover competent people from the capital Ouagadougou and the city of Bobo Dioulasso in Burkina Faso, organize quality education seminar events,  introduce new members and submit proposals, and 12 events will be held in 6 months. The team's solution is clear, detailed, and the community has the ease of tracking and evaluating the results of their work when joining the community group they have created.\nI also empathize with the risks they have shown and I believe in their solution. The risks are identified in the proposal: many community participants think they urge people to invest in cryptocurrencies because most people here and I believe many parts of the world think blockchain technology is just a cryptocurrency investment and don't believe it has a huge practical application. Given this risk, there is no way to improve understanding of the field through the educational workshops they have given so that people have an accurate knowledge of the Blockchain industry, including the Cardano platform. \n* I rated: 5 points\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team's proposal outlined the time to perform the work very reasonably and have detailed goals for each task.

These plans will be updated on Whatsaap and Telegram so that they can easily check and track the progress of the project.\nThe budget proposal of the $6000 group accounts for less than 20% of the global challenge budget, they already have a budget distribution for each job and department. Specifically allocate their budget: $2500 for event logistics, location costs, food, etc.; $3300 allocated to the salaries of local event organizers and workshop organizers; $ 200 - Ada give-away. However, I would like to see a more detailed budget distribution in each category so that everything is transparent, easier for the team to implement. In addition, to ensure the safety of the proposal during the implementation process, I want you to propose a contingency budget for economic instability, slippage, inflation ...

In theory, the proposal meets the objectives of the challenge well, because these meetings would basically be workshops that would address initial and in-depth topics about our blockchain in the future, with the intention that the premise that blockchain is just a way of investing in cryptocurrencies is undone. In fact, this prejudice is rooted in most people, except in places where blockchain is already a well-known and strong technology, such as the United States and Europe. In this African country, I believe that the level of prejudice is very high due to the lack of education of the population, so it is essential that this type of event is created and changes this reality. However, I think there was a lack of detail to better understand the idea, for example, we are told the thematic axes of the meetings. However, the specific issues are not mentioned. Within the introduction to blockchain, what specific topics would be covered? For example: what is blockchain, what is Cardano, what are cryptocurrencies, NFTs... And how will this information be taught in an accessible way to the target audience? I think in theory it is a proposal that perfectly fits the objective of bringing new members to the Cardano community, mainly because it is about a country where our blockchain is unknown and there is a lot of deep-rooted prejudice. However, in my opinion it would be important for us to know more details about how things would happen, how these teachings would be addressed, through which language would be passed on, who the speakers would be, how they would be able to draw the attention of the target audience and the like. In short, details about the project itself, as it would happen in practice, in everyday life. Therefore, I will give it 4 stars, because I trust the potential of this proposal and it is very much in line with the challenge in which it was launched, but it needs a more in-depth explanation. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I do not agree that the feasibility of the project is very good, the information given is quite basic. As I said in Impact, not much detail is presented about the practice of the project. The script is quite superficial, dividing the tasks according to the passage of months. The problems are that both the time interval between the phases is very long and the explanation of what would happen in the phases is very superficial. For example in the first 3 months, we basically know that the workshops would be to introduce the blockchain, talk about the opportunities it presents and how to participate in Catalyst. But, as I mentioned before: how many meetings will there be, who will speak, what are the specific topics of these 3 thematic axes, what is the numerical expectation of audience, how to engage them, in which parts of the two cities these meetings would take place... And online dating, how could this be possible considering that the target audience does not have a good internet connection? As with phase 1, the following should be better explained. In phase two, the topic \u201cmore details on the Cardano blockchain\u201d will be addressed. What details? What was not said in phase 1 that would be talked about now? On the budget, 6k USD is requested, which is a small amount compared to most proposals. But the splitting of parts could also be more specific, for example 2500 USD would go towards a number of things: \u201cevent logistics, venue costs, French materials, food etc\u201d. Basically the production of events. But how much would every little thing like that be? What is the average rental for the place? The donations in Ada would go to who, the participants of the event? And finally, talking about the team, in fact it is a duo, we know their names and a small resume of each, but it was necessary to explain their individual role in the project (will they be the speakers?), how much each would commit to the project, it would also be interesting if profiles of their social networks were attached, with facebook or linkedin, where we could see their previous achievements in a practical way. With that, my conclusion is that the feasibility needs to be deepened, mainly in the script part. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability of the project is pretty superficial too. As a measure of progress, the goal is to add 20 participants to the Cardano community per month, and for final results it is expected that 12 workshops will be held with a total of 160 new participants in the community at the end of the events. However, these ways of measuring success are entirely numerical, quantitative. It would be more interesting if qualitative aspects were also analyzed. Auditability in my view should be divided into two parts: monitoring the process (partial results) + monitoring the goals (final results). About process monitoring, this is not so easy to do as we don't have a detailed roadmap. We only know what will happen, in a basic way, as I said, it would be necessary to establish some phases, with well-defined deadlines. With that, we would have more material to monitor, if what we want happened and in the right way and at the right time. The duo that promotes the events should prepare monthly reports, where at the end of each month the partial results are presented, and this should be very accessible to the entire Cardano community, either through online tools such as google docs or miro, or if the document sent directly to our Project Catalyst telegram group. The final results must be explored in a richer way, both in terms of numbers, which are indeed indispensable data to understand if they were achieved, but they must also be analyzed in a more humane way. Are meeting participants really active in the community? If yes, how? Have they learned enough about Catalyst to become CAs and vCAs? And those who study and work with technology, how are they associated with our projects, are they working on the technical parts? Seeing that it is the obligation of the proponents to update the Cardano community, I would like meetings to be held in order to analyze together the final results of this project. This has space to be done in the specific rooms after Town Hall, for example. It is not necessary for all participants of the weekly ecosystem meeting to participate in this, but at least some. In this way, I believe that auditability can be done in a more adequate and complete way. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 4, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Auditability: This CA is asking for something that is not required and at the same time disregarding the clear metrics for success outlined in the proposal.

Mr Laurentine has conducted 5 Cardano Project Catalyst workshops and has recruited new members in the Catalyst community. Whilst Mr Kodjo, an entrepreneur, a network and security engineer and a lecture has authored an article on blockchain services. These two persons would definitely have key roles in bringing in quality members in the Cardano community. \n\nThey plan to hold 4 in-person  workshops for the first 3 months and 4 for the second 3 months  and 2 workshops online for each period. The 4 workshops will be held, 2 each in two cities. \n\nThe topics for discussion focus on uses and opportunities in the Cardano system, and about Catalyst and how to get involved and contribute. \n\nFor the activities, the proposal will spend for the cost venues, logistics and meals, the cost of event organizers and speakers.

I consider these are clear KPIs and goals. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_968", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Host French language events and provide educational workshops to inform the communities about the Cardano blockchain solutions.", "experience": "hosting multiple in-person and online Cardano Project Catalyst workshops with French audiences\nAssisting new members in joining the catalyst community\nTranslating documents for Catalyst School\nAssisting WADA with simultaneous interpretation during Cardano online workshops"}
