My main question about this proposal is just what kind of impact does the proposer envision coming from these developers?  I can imagine professional teams of developers making proposals for projects, but when I focus in on the cohort, the image gets fuzzy:  aren't these developers, by definition, already busy on projects?  Is there a phenomenon where development teams in companies are looking for more projects to take on?  Where is the business or shareholders in this plan, and do they need to be onboarded to the training, if not the proposal?  Maybe the proposer's approach is to look at teams or companies that could pivot from how they are approaching their current projects, and adopt blockchain/DLT solutions going forward.  What kinds of businesses does he have in mind for these conversions?  What conversions does he see being compatible with Cardano, and what kind of projects are these developers bringing to Catalyst? I am generally curious if the materials he creates is intended to be opensource.  If he successfully were to build out a targeted educational onboarding ramp for one or more of the areas above, having that model available to others (especially people within companies that see opportunities for their peers) and offering consultancy on the model might be a good scaling model that could be adopted.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The qualifications sound pretty good, and the linkedin feed back looks really good, in terms of an educator taking on this task.  The budget seems perfectly reasonable, but we must make assumptions about just how many presentations are expected to fit under it (2-3 seems reasonable at this price, but who knows?).  Where we need to see a lot more buildout in this proposal is in the development of the materials.  As noted, I don't think there is a lot of value to be had in just presenting the option of Catalyst to software teams, unless we define this cohort very specifically.  Once defined, their needs and relationship to Catalyst funding may be much easier to suss out, but it also gives us knowledge about how many targets we can expect, what kind of timeline this happens on, etc.  The included timeline doesn't really tell us anything...presentations will happen, but that does that mean?  At least 2 per month due to the plural, but we shouldn't have to figure it out like that.  Again, what I want to know most is who the target is here, since software developers doesn't narrow it down.  If you have that, you can determine everything else.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Again, we really need to know what the targets are here.  Is the project complete after two presentations?  Four?  More?  The early reporting should be functional enough, as the proposer can report the collaboration numbers for the educational material (including defining the target cohort) and then present the material as a deliverable for the month (and opensource, ideally).  But it gets sketchy after that:  if two presentations are reported for month 2, is the progress on track?  We need numbers here.  A final suggestion: if the proposer doesn't know in advance who can be approached with this program, perhaps a version of it that pivots to research, by structuring a couple of different types of material and then seeing what kinds of situations and problems software development teams are bringing to the table, and then use the feedback to iterate the resources and THEN execute this protocol, with a solid base for the numbers.

The proposal only states the general work as above without giving a detailed plan of the specific work to be done such as: how many presentations will be held, how long the presentation will take, how many participants and how many software engineering companies will be held and the content and topics will be presented at the presentations; through which channels do the communication; Consulting, training content... The proponent should detail the specific, clear work to be done for each phase to ensure project success and community monitoring.\n- Because the project's roadmap is being presented in general, the budget is also general, the proponent only states the project start-up is 1,800 USD, from the first month to the third month every month is 1,800 USD, so the total required budget is 7,200 USD. Due to the lack of cost details for each specific job, the reasonableness of this budget analysis cannot be assessed. The proponent should detail the budget for each specific job such as: how many hours it takes to compile documents, how much does it cost per hour; How many presentations are held when visiting companies, how many hours each session, how much is the speaker cost/hour, other related costs such as drinking water, materials, logistics...\n- The project staff is an associate professor with experience in connecting Universities and Companies into innovation projects, the editor of important scientific journals.
