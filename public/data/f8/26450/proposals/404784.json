The reason I rate this a 3 stars and not a 5 is because while the \"why\" of this proposal is rock solid, the \"what\" and \"how\" are unclear, and the connection hasn't been fully made between Checkpoint's content and rolling out of merchandise, content, and metaverse experiences, and this brief's goal of increasing engagement of Cardano community members in roles that suit them well, are meaningful, and contribute to shared success. I do think this proposal has some excellent ideas for ways to draw a new target market into the Cardano fold - people who are already passionate about gaming and interested in learning about its philosophical and social implications are so well suitd to become invested in, intrigued by, and active participants of the Cardano ecosystem. But the connections between Checkpoint's offerings and this challenge's request need to be made more explicit. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer, Tamer Asfahani, has a strong track record of creating innovative and high quality work that pushes to engage Web 2.0 media consumers through Web 3.0 experiences and content. Based on his backround in journalism and the success he has had in creating a vibrant example of a Web 3.0 media hub, I think he and his team are well equipped to carry through this proposal. It also appears that they are already using Cardano to create their tokens and sell NFTs to readers, and will be creating Cardano-focused content whether or not this proposal is funded - although the funding will help them to do it better, sooner, and more deeply. This is further evidence that this proposal would move forward by virtue of its relevance to the existing Checkpoint space and the proposer's enthusiasm for Cardano. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I'm disappointed to give this a 3 instead of 5 star rating, because I think that this proposal offers some truly exciting, well structured, naturally mutally beneficial, strong solutions to bringing new members into the Cardano space, and educating them about Cardano. However, after reading the proposal multiple times, I am still left asking questions about what exactly the proposal is offering to do. What is clear is that Checkpoint, founded by the proposer, is an innovative media hub using Web 3.0 experiences to engage readership in new ways, pushing the envelope for what media experiences can and should look like, using the chosen medium (ex: metaverse) to convey the message, rather than just descriptive words in an anachronistic article. It's clear that Cardano is valued by the team at Checkpoint, as they are building on Cardano to offer NFTs, tokens, and more.  However, I'm not exactly sure what the proposed project is! In the summary of the solution, for example, the proposer writes, \"Checkpoint champions Cardano, has an established non-crypto audience, is respected in the games industry and is trusted by its readership.\" While this makes a strong case for a partnership between Cardano and Checkpoint, it tells me about why Checkpoint is a natural fit for creating content about Cardano, but it doesn't tell me what Checkpoint is actually going to do to address the brief's challenge. Will they be producing a podcast about Cardano? Creating Cardano experiences in the metaverse? Interview Cardano users? Later in the proposal, these are vaguely addressed, as they describe how the proposed solution will address the challenge. The majority of this section is spent making the case for why Checkpoint is in a unique, qualified position to educate gamers about Cardano (which is true) - but when it comes to the actual solution, all they say is \"by using our platform, real-world applications and interviews with industry shakers, we can help break down the barrier between blockchain and normal users. We combine this with our metaverse offering...\" - and I'm still unclear. So, they will be doing interviews? And doing something in the metaverse Cardano-related - but what, exactly? How does using the platform and real-world applications meet the brief challenge (and what, exactly, does the latter even mean?). In the budget section, a third of the budget is allocated for \"Competitions for our non-crypto followers,\" but I'm not sure what this actually means, and would appreciate greater detail and clarification. Similarly, there is $3,000 allocated to AMA sessions in the Checkpoint Multiverse - would these be hosted by folks working deeply with Cardano? Would they be Cardano-specific AMA sessions? How would they specifically meet the challenge of the brief? Again, I can infer how they could, but it would be better if I didn't have to guess. If this was made more explicit and clear, I think this would be a really knockout winning proposal.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1597", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1474, "q0": "The problem statement of this proposal rings true and is consistent with the challenge\u2019s aim to increase awareness of Project Catalyst as the most active open innovation platform.
