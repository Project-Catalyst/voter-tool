So what does Lidonation do?  In networking terms they are what you might call a \"weaver\":  this is a role in an ecosystem where the participant seeks to strengthen the connections that have developed in a network, by engaging those connections more deeply and relateably, which in turn exposes these connections to even more connections with which they have shared or common purpose.  On its deepest level this is part of the phenomenon of building trust within communities, and Lidonation engages with this principle on a regular basis through its twitter spaces, outreach, translation services and more.  As engaged Catalyst members themselves they are well aware that no matter the value of a project, its alignment with a challenge setting helps us capture its impact, and so they have correctly identified both two glaring issues (unengaged ada holders with Catalyst voting, and unengaged Catalyst voters with the other roles of Catalyst they could hold), and an opportunity in their own work to inform and educate these cohorts to address this issue.  By dedicating existing resources to exploring Catalyst (primarily with their growing social media community via live events like twitter spaces), and creating new resources (primarily articles and documents for their Cardano onboarding website), they expect to create an even stronger engagement and connection between those they reach and Catalyst.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Because the team is already creating the content they are seeking support for, the understanding of what is need to deliver on this project is readily apparent.  The budget will expand the number of shows they are able to host, more than double the amount of hosted content they create, which includes best practices for engaging in Cardano and Catalyst, and being a proposer and CA within Catalyst, and bring their website UI/UX into alignment with the quality of information they are providing.  They anticipate being fully funded for the next 3 quarters, and they have broken down where that funding is targeted.  One thing I want to highlight is that their current work often results in 2 hour shows with the community, which isn't unusual for the format, and that in addition to specifically preparing material to be able to do one of those shows dedicated to Catalyst each week, they are also planning on building out a \"micro-podcast\" to reach members of the community with much more targeted, concise information regarding Catalyst, which makes the deliverables for the show much more accommodating to different needs of the onboarding cohort.  Again, their understanding of what is needed, and how they can fit what they do to it, is another vote of confidence for the ability of the team to carry this project out.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal was a pleasure to read, and combined both a qualitative understanding of Catalyst as well as a more quantitative understanding.  This latter is the focus of their provided KPIs which seeks to measure what they can control:  articles and resources created for the onboarding website, delivery of the planned podcasts, and fulfillment of a contract to bring in a web developer for the site.  This last one could probably be dropped and accounted for in engagement metrics with the site, before and after improvements have been made.  They are hyper-accessible on social media, and deeply engaged in several roles within Catalyst, so it is to be expected that the community will be able to stay up to date with the project and be supportive of it.  Along these lines, the team has committed to delivering 4 \"Governance Marathons\" for each fund, which marks major milestones where the participation they are driving emerges as speakers, hosts, cohosts, presenters, proposers and voters all gather for a 24-hr, asynchronous celebration of Project Catalyst Voting.  As a bullet point addressed to each 3 month \"development sprint\" for the connections they are creating, it is a fantastically creative way to report on the progress of the initiative.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 7, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 7432, "q0": "This proposal is certainly in line with the objectives of the challenge and I also believe that it is under the command of a very competent group, which has shown in practice that it is capable of successfully carrying out projects related to the Cardano ecosystem. This is the LidoNation group, which already has a library with a lot of content about Catalyst, whether introductory content or posts about the structure of a good proposal; as described here, they also foster debates about Cardano on Twitter, obtaining a very considerable audience (about 100 people a day). The proposal in question is to expand the content that they are already creating, through the creation of new formats and subjects that involve Catalyst and Cardano. I think one part of the breakdown that pretty much sums up what they intend to do is: \u201cInclude a new article format by conducting interviews with other Project Catalyst participants in various roles. We will publish these interviews as condensed articles. Through our participation in previous Catalyst rounds, we have built a solid network of Cardano connections with a variety of backgrounds, so we definitely have people we can reach out to for interviews.\u201d That is, they will promote the greatest connection between people who participate or have participated in Catalyst, which in my view is a very innovative way (I haven't seen this suggested before in proposals) to help new members understand this vast and complex ecosystem. They also intend to create a small podcast, officially hire a developer for the site and take other steps forward in relation to their projects that are already underway and from what I could see they have already had a good success. On top of that, they will develop new tools to teach about blockchain and also spread the values \u200b\u200bof Cardano, because, despite the Cardano project being mainly economic, it also has a human bias. In general, I think the idea fits perfectly with the objectives of the challenge, as it will expand a project already underway, which helps new people to understand well what Cardano, Catalyst is and how to get involved in this universe. What we are looking for here is just that, new ways to add active members to the community, who not only own Ada but also participate in the various activities and opportunities provided in our ecosystem. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal's script is not conventional, but in the end, the proposers deliver what is necessary for us to know with solidity how the development process of this project will take place. At first, they objectively inform us what will be done in the first 3 months and then until the 6 months of the project. If they had stopped there, I would say that it would be preferable for the explanations to be backed up each month, that is, it would be better for them to define what activities are being planned each month to be done, not each quarter. However, they provide further explanation, inform us about the milestones they are aiming to achieve and also how each front of the project will work to achieve their goals, being these fronts: \u201cArticles, Twitter Spaces, Lido Minute Micro-Podcast/video, redesign website and Twitter Marathon\u201d. Therefore, I consider that we are very well situated in relation to the project development process, as we know exactly what will happen so that every little thing is achieved, what necessary activities are coming. Regarding the budget, approximately 8 thousand dollars are measured, which in my opinion is a very fair value for the scale and impacts that this project is likely to generate. The total amount is divided into some parts, namely: the creation of new articles, preparation and posting of content on twitter, creation of the podcast and the last part that I did not fully understand but I believe it is focused on design. The values \u200b\u200bof each of these parts are explained in a satisfactory way, although they are not as detailed, we were able to have a good understanding of how this funding will be used. Finally, let's talk about the team, we don't need to be afraid that they won't work with motivation and won't deliver the positive results to us because they are already developing many materials about Cardano, they have already shown service in five proposals that were previously funded, therefore, a lot of confidence in the team is conveyed right away. However, to further reinforce this trust, they attach a small explanation of who they are and also their linkedin profiles, so that we have concrete proof of the information that is said. So I think in this part of the project we really don't have anything to worry about. In general, the feasibility of the project is excellent, deserving maximum marks. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Regarding the auditability of the project, the proponents explain how each of the parts of the whole can be audited. In these explanations they say how far along the project is, but I still feel it could be clearer if somehow they will update the Cardano community with regular feedback or if we should go after such information (which I don't think is a good idea given the amount of proposals funded on Catalyst and the need to audit them all. I think the team should prepare monthly reports and make them available in a direct and simple way to the Cardano community. That way, it would be enough to access these reports and check which ones progress was made that month. Ideally, these reports would contain not only partial results but also a small description of the work routine of all professionals involved in the project, whether they faced any difficulties, etc. Regarding the results At the end, they describe several of their goals, but as I commented on the progress, I would like it to be clearer as to how the Cardano community could verify whether such things have come true or not. As there is a greater amount of information, I think it would be appropriate for a meeting to be held, it could be after Town Hall, in specific rooms to monitor the auditability of the projects. At this meeting, team members could expose to the community how the advances are being perceived, whether articles, podcasts and twitter spaces were launched, and also inform the approximate amount of new community members from all this. It would be very interesting if some of them could participate in this meeting, reporting their experience and how the project helped them to get to know and understand the Cardano ecosystem; they could also inform what activities they are currently involved in, how they are operating within the community. In summary, my opinion is that it is a very auditable proposal, it is enough that the bridge between the team and the Cardano community is better clarified. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1371, "q0": "In the digital transformation era, I think content is king if someone can create good content, they can take the attention of people and attention is gold.

There you update all the previous Project Catalyst recommendations. In addition, you have organized and co-hosted 8 of Cardano's \"Twitter Spaces\" each week and the number of participants is more than 100 people per session. A really impressive number that many projects want to have. So I'm not surprised you've got five projects funded.

Especially in response to the development of the project, you have planned to create podcasts called \"Lido Minute\" that bring together many of Cardano's topics, of which 25% are devoted to Catalyst in conjunction with Cardano Youtuber \"Jcypto\" and community center adacafe.io. Your solution also aims to solve the problem of the challenge, which is to increase the number of voters, increase the total number of votes, increase the number of participants in Town hall; at the same time applying for leadership positions, CA growth, vCA, increasing the number of proposals by 4-5 stars and the percentage of excellent reviews.\n- You think the project has a low level of risk and point out that the biggest risk for you is someone in the group who was in an accident (which you likened to \"being hit by a bus\").

Their solutions in itself does generate exposure on the metrics they have selected but that does not guarantee further engagement. And to achieve what this Challenge sets out to be, you need both metrics; exposure and engagement.\n\nThe use of articles, Twitters Spaces and Twitter will be further enhanced by engagement platforms such as; Zoom, Discord or even Telegram (I can not seem to find their Discord and Telegram). Through these platforms, the audience Lido Nation has gathered can have continuous day-to-day two-way interactions. Where they can continuously build on conversations. Although they state they have daily Twitter spaces with 100+ participants (although this number is not represented in the Twitter Space attendees for some reason, a bug perhaps), Twitter Space is still limited in being a one way interaction platform. Yes, you can submit questions but it is hard to teach and collaborate on Twitter Space.\n\nI am assuming the team already understands this, for in their website they state they have a Zoom session every Friday.

Therefore we can deduct for ourselves whether it is appropriate or not the budget asked for. And indeed it is appropriate, most likely underbudget for they state this amount is to fund their efforts for the next 6 months to end of year.\n\nSeeing that their solutions are heavy in building exposure, through articles and community engagement through Twitter Spaces and Twitter, there is no doubt that they will successfully deliver on this expansion of services proposal.\n\nThis is due to the fact that they have already been building a library of articles and relationships with various community members such as Bullish Dumpling, ADA Caf\u00e9 and etc. And again, add to that their participation in Governance Week shows clearly their attitude and intent. Their Twitter Spaces is also a constant event that has been happening with or without budget.

The proposer has also failed to fill (it seems they forgot) the methods on how will the community gauge progress in these following actions; Articles, Twitter Spaces and Lido Minute Micro-Podcast/video.
