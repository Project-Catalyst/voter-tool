From my understanding it seems the intent of the proposal is to focus on the general onboarding (as stated in the challenge description), but with the potential of further developing into highly active members of both Cardano and Catalyst. The proposal is meant to gather the learning resources that already exists within the Cardano Ecosystem, and collect them into a virtual learning hub. The proposal idea is definitely in alignment with the challenge criteria, but I would have liked to see more specifics on what makes the platform interactive with the new onboarding members. To clarify, how will the facilitators of the platform interact with the general public? Will there be \u201dguides\u201d for helping people use the platform, or will there be teachers hosting their own workshops? In my opinion as experienced CA and Catalyst member there is great value in gathering resources in one place, and using already existing (and credible, of course) resources is a great way to make the ecosystem more unified and coherent. The proposal addresses the challenging aspect of keeping up with the rapid structural updates and development of Catalyst, which speaks of a good understanding of the Catalyst Ecosystem. \nDespite the proposal missing some details of how they aim to carry out the proposal (except for marketing and creating the learning hub with gathered resources), I would still agree that this proposal addresses most of the challenge criteria. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The development team (two people) seem to inhibit enough expertise for this proposal to be successfully implemented. However, there is no links or references that verify their experience or expertise (LinkedIn, previous projects that were successfully implemented, etc). This information is important in order to measure the probability of the proposal being implemented. We do get a budget breakdown that is clearly presented, but it could also contain a bit more information. For example, will both team members be working on marketing, or how will the work be divided between the team? How many hours are estimated to be put into how large of a timeframe? \nConsidering the budget for developing this project represents roughly 5% of the total challenge budget, I would deem the amount realistic for developing the intended proposal into product. As I mentioned under \u201dImpact\u201d, there could be more details added containing how the proposal aims to present and run the hub. In my (intuitive and subjective) opinion, the proposal feel like more of an over-arching idea rather than a detailed plan/product. (I will happily stand corrected if people disagree). Overall, due to the reasons stated above, I disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This proposal would benefit greatly by the inclusion of some detailed measurements of success or KPIs. There are mentions of what areas to educate new members on, but I have a hard time understanding how that information would relate to auditing the success of the project. Maybe it was misunderstood, somehow. In my opinion as a CA/vCA for several funds, I would have liked to see information on for example: \u201dBy this time during development, we would have hoped to have had X amount of participants using our platform. 3 months later, we hope to have X times more, etc\u201d. \u2028Currently there is no mention of a total timeline in the proposal, so adding a roadmap with included milestones on a timeframe would benefit the quality of this proposal greatly. Maybe also give a short description on how/where the team will communicate with the Cardano/Catalyst participants? Will it be via social media, the platform itself or other places? \u2028Conclusively, due to the lack of information provided in this proposal, I strongly disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_349", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 4, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 712, "q0": "I love the idea of a hub built around videogame style interactive learning modules for Cardano and Catalyst, but it is important that this be either really well described, or have a good sample of work to base the model on.  There are many educational \"hubs\" for Cardano already, so differentiating yourself is step one, and providing some details on those differences is step two.  The proposal indicates the gamin will be part of the architecture, but no clues what that might look like (kid games?  FPS?  Sandbox), or of the implications to the technology stack for what they might choose.  I do like that well over half of the topics they listed fell under Catalyst.  Something I would like to see from anyone who seeks to create community educational resources, especially onboarding ones, is what is the plan to keep them current, to keep them maintained.  Education hubs and knowledge depots come and go in Catalyst, and either they succumb to sprawl, with so much content you can't find what you are looking for, or they become abandoned.  I am starting to come to the conclusion that the number one concern of any educational resource is their plan for sustainability.  This team seems to have a sense of that, because, almost as an afterthought, they add \"stay up to date\" in the last sentence of the proposal.  But no real explanation for how. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The first thing I want to see on any project that lists videogames on its roadmap, is the technology stack, but there isn't one included here.  It isn't totally clear, but it is possible that the games are for a later phase of the project.  For the online hub itself, I want to see some idea of the layout or general look and feel.  The team includes a link, but as of 3/20, it was just a start page on wordpress.  Ok, I can do a lot with a timeline and a budget, so I'll parse those.  No luck on the timeline, but the budget is present.  I would have liked to have seen more line items here, more breakdown of specific items, especially as one of them is labeled \"world building\" and I just talked myself out of needing to see the tech stack on this, but if world building doesn't refer to a game, what does it refer to?  A dedicated timeline, with the actionable steps clearly spelled out, and a budget with more than two line items is desperately needed by this proposal.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "We know that the deliverable here is some kind of an online community hub, but the scope really hasn't been established, and the timeline for its delivery is unknown, so I have no idea what the proposer can report on to achieve the monthly progress checks. Without a timeline for delivery, the funding tranches can't be set, so that is the first place to start. And if a better roadmap gets laid out, spelling out specific steps in a community buildout, those steps are a good start for useful KPIs.  Additionally, it is always recommended to opensource a project, which makes most auditability work a breeze, and gives high levels of transparency.  Because the rollout here is the community hub, it is expected that staying in touch with the proposer shouldn't be a problem either.

Another community hub with a different approach might simply dilute Catalyst community making it harder to reach consensus. I would suggest refining this idea and proposing it in funds directed to general Cardano onboarding rather than Catalyst.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Although team has relevant experience, lack of timeline makes it hard to evaluate if a 2 person team with declared budget could achieve stated goals with sufficient quality. \nPlan is very general, with no timeline or milestones.

This might also create a bigger sense of community, as the members will have a place to share information, discuss important topics and share their knowledge with newcomers.\nHowever one of the challenges that should be considered is that, as in any participative environment, there needs to be some kind of mediation to make sure everyone is following the guidelines. Those open forums are prone to hate speech and bullying, and I believe there should be some focus on creating strict guidelines to avoid it.

Some guiding questions would be uncovered, but other fronts would be addressed, such as improving the onboarding process and exploring the use of existing materials and content.\n\nIn this context, the author can further develop his proposal to seek to reach other fronts proposed by the challenge.\n\nA point to think about is the similarities with other community or hub structures, such as forums that already exist. I understand that there is a clear difference in the proposal, which would be due to the format and interactivity of the content, but it is a point that is worth exercising thinking to understand which deficiencies of a format that can be covered by another.

The author only informed that regardless of fund allocations, the proposal will be carried out. Regardless of that, we need to know the steps involved in this process of developing, implementing and managing the Hub.\n\nAnother improvement that can be pointed out for this proposal is to better clarify (1) how the structure of this Hub will be, (2) what kind of information will be used for the onboard of members (3) what kind of support the new members will have during their passage by onboarding.\n\nRegarding the risks, the author pointed out one of them.
