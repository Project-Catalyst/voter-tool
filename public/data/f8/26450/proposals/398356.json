But when you look at the guiding question of how we might increase awareness of Project Catalyst as the most active open innovation platform, it makes sense.  The proposal seeks to address the challenge while at the same time addressing a valid economic necessity for a particular demographic.  By targeting the homemaker as a potential source of community advisors, the proposal taps into an overlooked group that can leverage the opportunity for remote work with flexible hours. Targeting this demographic can greatly expand the pool of people participating across all key metrics for the challenge.
