Our objective here is to fund innovative proposals that would attract new members to the Cardano community, be they future proponents, CAs, community mentors, etc.; and also encourage passive Ada holders to be more active in the community. These indicators can be measured in several ways, such as the number of digital wallets created, votes in the governance phase, etc. The idea here is to promote some face-to-face events, which would be held in places such as hotel auditoriums and convention centers, from what I understand, that have as content subjects that address the Cardano ecosystem, the differential and advantages of our blockchain. These meetings would take place in Brazil, in the cities of Bras\u00edlia, S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. They are targeted because they are some of the largest cities in the country, with a high number of entrepreneurs, potential investors and Catalyst proponents. The problems I identified here were about the detail of the idea. It is not clear how many events would be held in all, how the organizers would be able to captivate the target audience to go to the face-to-face meetings, without necessarily knowing anything about Cardano; how many people are expected per event; where these events would be in each city (the bidder cites Rotary Club and Mason Lodge, but I searched and didn't find exact locations for this, Rotary Club seems to be an association and Mason Lodge I really couldn't figure out what it is); and, mainly, which themes within Cardano's universe would be addressed, in which order and by whom. Knowing who the speakers would be would be essential to guarantee the success of the proposal, because I believe that in order to captivate a lay audience on the subject, we need people who are both experts in Cardano and charismatic enough to hold the public's attention, in addition to having a good didactic to teach in an accessible way from a young computer engineer to an older investor. Therefore, the idea is good and aligns with the objectives of the challenge, but to receive a maximum grade it would need to be explained in more detail. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I don't think that part is explained satisfactorily. Starting with the script, we are told that there would be 12 events (1 per month, then). But it is not said in which cities they would be in which months, for example, month 1 in Rio de Janeiro, month 2 in Bras\u00edlia and so on. Nothing is said about the pre-production process of the events, and no type of script is established for each event, if it would only consist of the lecture followed by a networking session with drinks, from what is understood. We don't know the average duration of these events, if it would last an entire afternoon/night, how many hours, etc. And in terms of expenses, some things I found a little disproportionate, 1400 USD is requested just for the rent of spaces, and since one dollar is approximately 5 reais, that would be 7000 reais for just one shift of space use, I think which is a very high value and does not correspond to what is charged in practice (I say this because I am Brazilian so I know the average rental price). The price of 500 USD for the lecture is also high, but then I don't know whether or not it would be disproportionate. Regarding the rest of the expenses, I believe everything is ok, it is possible to understand clearly what the requested money would be used for. And finally, with regard to the team, we are shown who each team member is and their main professional attributions, but it is not specified what exactly they would do in the project. The description of each is, in my opinion, very short, they could have detailed more about their resumes, even if they have attached their linkedin profiles, the information about each involved is still very superficial in the proposal itself. In other words, in general, I think that the absence of a script itself, a very brief description of those involved and some doubts about the need for the budget (for example in the price of rents) make me think that the feasibility is ok, but There's a lot to improve too. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I think measuring whether this project is being successful is even simple, as the proponent suggests, most of these results could be understood based on the number of event participants and creation of digital wallets. This is enough for us to understand if the event itself was a success, but it would be possible to go further in monitoring the proposal. Basic data from the participants could be collected, such as their email or telephone number, and the proponent could carry out a survey after the events, in order to find out how these people are in relation to Cardano. Have they become active participants in our community? Are you participating in Catalyst, whether as proponents, CAs, voters? Bought and delegated Adas? Did they somehow spread the knowledge obtained on the day of the event to third parties? I think that with a small questionnaire with those who participated, the impact of these events on our blockchain could be measured more deeply, we could understand if the impact had the desired depth. Other than that, I think that any member of the community, who lived in the cities that would host the events, should participate and provide feedback to the rest of us on how the day of the event itself went, if everything went as planned, if the people interacted well and made contacts, exchanging experiences and so on. In other words, according to the proponent, it is possible to audit the proposal, but this could be done with even more quality through other initiatives. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 8, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "1-looking into brazil population 214 million i can confirm that this proposal address the challenge\n\n\n\nhttps://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/brazil-population\n\n\n\n2- and looking in the news about Brazil i can see that authorities working on  regulating crypto and people have much interest in crypto is very positive for the success of this proposal .\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/brazil-moves-to-regulate-cryptocurrency-5219982\n\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/12/why-brazilians-are-turning-to-stablecoins-like-tether/\n\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Looking on the team experience in crypto and economic and one of them being old winner of a proposal in fund 7 made me choose 5 stars , but i changed to 3 stars only after looking into Linkedin profiles and see that the whole team lives in USA and none lives in brazil which open an important inquiry not addressed in the budget of the feasibility study :\nhow would they connect with Brazilian coworker that will organize the event locally  especially that there is no mention in the budget for this part ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "i agree with auditability plan cause logically all events would be recorded and broadcast on social media ,,,   so views and comments and likes would be a clear auditable thing on the success on the proposal .

Events like the one suggested in this proposal, while beautiful to behold, must make particular claims to align appropriately with the challenge setting.  It is not enough to say that the intention is to create a lot of new Catalyst members, the team must provide concrete ways that will happen, and by which that impact will be measured.  This Cardano event in Brazil makes the claim to onboarding Catalyst members, but unfortunately only provides a single metric (Project Catalyst accounts created...Do they mean Ideascale accts? Catalyst app installs?).  And while they indicate that hopefully it could lead to more proposals being submitted from Brazil, they lose sight of the fact that this challenge requires them to provision that hope!  If the proposal team were to include the details for dedicating a section of their proposed events to onboarding to Catalyst and how to make a proposal and how the funding mechanism works, it would immeasurably strengthen the alignment of this proposal to the challenge setting.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "If one only considers this proposal as an events proposal, rather than an onboarding one, it starts looking better.  The budget may seem large for an event budget, but it covers 12 events over 12 months, across 3 cities, which makes it exceptionally attractive.  The previously funded team are building identity around event management for Cardano and the team members indicate good experience for taking on these roles (need to update their website, tho...).  The budget breakdown is the strength of the proposal, with everything you could imagine for an event budget covered.  However the timeline just broadly says 12 events in 12 mos, without really breaking down how even a single month might be carried out.  Events can be tricky to logistically follow through on, and it would be nice to see a plan, even though event plans tend to do their own thing in the end.  Additionally there isn't a clear connect between the roles of the team and what they bring to the execution of the events.  They refer to their connections for venues and keynote speakers, and while the venues make sense, there is really no indication of what kind of keynotes they will be able to secure.  It would be useful to have more in depth information on the team, as that would settle many of the concerns here.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Presumably every month is a deliverable, with a networking session being deliverd and reported on for auditing purposes.  From those events they intend to track wallets created and number of attendees, YTD, as well as tracking social media hits and engagements.  I'm firmly agnostic about that last metric there, but I get it.  What is disappointing is only learning about the number of Ideascale accounts created from these events.  Over 12 months you would hope the impact woud be there to be onboarding proposers and referrers, maybe CAs.  Distributing Catalyst material at these events and tracking that could be a useful metric. How about participants who successfully vote using the Catalyst app?  As far as the community keeping track, outside of social media, the main way to keep the project transparent will be staying up to date with the monthly reports to IOG.  Outside of wishing there more concrete examples of measuring up to the challenge setting, this proposal should be able to be tracked and stay on track.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 4, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Impact/ Alignment:\nWe understand your concern in this segment and are happy to provide ways to add clarification. You mentioned that this mainly focuses on the Project Catalyst aspect of the project, not Cardano. However, these two work in tandem because allowing Brazilians individual to enter Project Catalyst would diversify the pool of thinkers that further contribute to the Cardano ecosystem. Furthermore, it would be necessary for individuals to obtain Cardano wallet addresses, in order to interact with ideascale and project catalyst voting app. This would ultimately lead Brazilians to begin to create and submit catalyst proposals. Individuals will only be able to contribute to project Catalyst by having a deep and thorough understanding of the Cardano ecosystem which we will provide at these events.\nFeasibility:\nThe budget we have selected in not large when you take all the factors of having these events into consideration. Hosting one event per month in one of our cities has taken already immense planning and execution to fit the budget we have set. Things that need to be considered are venue rental, cost of speaker, security, media connection, NFC\u2019s for direct wallet creation, catering, raffles, and marketing for our events. We also need to provide lodging and transportation for our guest speakers. As soon as we get funded, we will be posting our schedule for the next year in many different social medias including LATAM Townhouse, Discord and Telegram. We will do this in hope of having members globally join us for our events. However, I would be happy to share that our first event will be hosted in Sao Paulo, followed by Rio, and lastly Brasilia. This will be a quarterly cycle. As for our guest speaker, we have already secured Professora Gilvania da Silva Vilela who is Computer Science Professor who has focused on blockchain technology. Overall, it would also be premature to secure venues and more speakers without first receiving funding. We have allocated one month from our first event to finalize our venues and speakers. Please take a look at our updated website to see our first event that was held in Ecuador.\nhttps://defidiscussions.com\nAuditability:\nWe\u2019re grateful for the feedback that you have given us, it allows us to improve. We think adding distribution of Catalyst material and tracking would actually be a great metric, we will implement this. By onboarding them to Project Catalyst, we intend on them having full access to proposals, voting and potentially becoming CA\u2019s. Furthermore, we will be partnering with Merchify to closely track KPIs by using NFC to directly manage the flow of data. We will upload our data to LATAM TownHall Discord and Telegram so that we can have the community participate and verify our work. Additionally, you\u2019ll also be able to track us through Facebook Live, Instagram live and photos on our website from our events.

Unfortunately, the proposal does not address this problem, it only states that having these events in different cities in Brasil will contribute to a large number of attendees to create ADA wallets, become active Catalyst proposers and start participating in the eco-system, sometimes incentivised by a raffle with prizes in ADA, that are not counted in the budget.\nHowever, for being able to motivate people to join these events, the subject has to be compelling enough, the speakers need to be able to draw people to the events and for now, the proposal doesn\u2019t offer any kind of details on these subjects, just a mention that \u201cdue to having an expansive networking connection, we would be able to get around these issues with ease\u201d, but there are no further details that would enable the community to verify these claims.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The plan is lacking many details: the theme of the events is not described, the names of any of the speakers is not known, the marketing of the event is not described, the sites where they would take place are not named. \nThe budget is broken down per event, each section having the same budget, no matter the location and speaker involved.

However, to facilitate this part of our journey we have connected with local schools and businesses to integrate our plans with ease. In S\u00e3o Paulo, we have partnered with Faculdade de Tech S\u00e3o Paulo, Colegio America, UNINOVE, and with EAESP Business School. In Brasilia, we will partner with the Venancio Joias to use their clientele base to host our network events in tandem with their client events. In Rio, we will have a heavy presence due to our connection with the Rotary Club and Mason Lodge. Due to Richard\u2019s close ties with these two groups, events will be easily conducted with members and their guests. As for your concern with the raffle of ADA and merchandise, that is something we are putting our own money into upfront in order to not pull more money from the budget. We have secured our main speaker; Professora Gilvania da Silva Vilela to assist us during our events. To expand on the incentives to attend our events, attendees will receive free internet at our venues to register for our wallets and gain full access to our schedule to attend future events and to the Cardano ecosystem. Secondly, attendees will be able to have dinner and refreshments while having the ability to network with local Cardano individuals in their community. Lastly, attendees will win prizes from Defi Discussions which include, apparel, prizes in ADA and other cryptos, and a free course in development by our partner Ayllu.\nFeasibility:\nThank you for sharing your concern with us, the feedback allows us to further improve and take more factors into consideration. We would be happy to clarify the feasibility of our events in this response. We have selected three different cities in Brazil to host events, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Brasilia. These cities have been specifically chosen based on our partner Richard\u2019s network connection. In Sao Paulo, we will be working closely with Faculdade de Tech Sao Paulo, Colegio America, UNINOVE, and with EASP Business School. For Rio, we will be working in tandem with the Rotary Club and Mason Lodge which Richard is closely involved. These two clubs are heavily influential within the community and have agreed to assist with our events. In Brasilia, we have partnered with the Venancio family and Venancio Joias to host events with their large client base. As for your concern with the budget, an important thing to consider is the conversion rate from USD to Real which at the moment is: $1.00 = $4.74 real. This allows for immense flexibility with location selection. Lastly, we may not have a great presence on LinkedIn, but we are true to our word. We have already hosted our first event in Ecuador and Paraguay, please visit our website to see the events we hosted along with the gallery. Additionally, we also have hosted a Facebook live for our first event, please take a look! https://defidiscussions.com\nAuditability:\nWe have placed heavy emphasis on being completely transparent with the community that has funded and trusted us. While our base verification of attendees, wallet creation, and the number of people onboarded is crucial. We have also decided to provide the community access to our events by hosting Facebook Live videos, Instagram live, Youtube, and photos of our events as proof of our work. We are working on a partnership with Merchify to track the number of users using blockchain technologies. As for your remark relating to the creation of Catalyst accounts, this part is crucial because it works in tandem with our idea of allowing individuals to link their wallets to their Catalyst accounts allowing them to submit their own Project Catalyst Proposals under the guidance of Defi Discussion LLC. We mentioned in our proposal that individuals who attend our events would become recipients of Project Catalyst Proposals. Please look at our website for proof of our work so far in Ecuador and Paraguay.

It clearly address the challenges as events in different of the main cities of Brazil might help to onboard new members and address challenegs kpis as Growth in the number of Community Advisors and Veteran Community Advisors, Swarm session attendance, Catalyst School session attendance and Weekly sign ups to Cardano Ideascale. I also appreciate the idea of having a dedicated time for networking. Now the pandemic has diminished, it is esserntial to resume face to face events and expand community outreach. Moreover, Brazilian community is huge and has a great potential of expansion, specially in these cities. Risk management seems also well done, with them properly mapped and with a mitigation strategy.\nThe only thing I missed here is a proper communication plan. How to really convince and bring people to attend the events when they dont even know that Cardano exist? What is the target audience here? Maybe it would be good to restrict, a least in the beggining, the target audience (let's say, for instance, for university students) to learn on this process, improve and then broaden it little by little. For me, communication is key here and is the only reason it didnt score 5.\nThe event could also be broadcasted online with breakout rooms for discussions and network but I understand that would make the project more expensive.\nLast, it is very important here to rcollect feedback throughout the year, to assess improvement, and run lessons learned in the end, for other people who wish to hold events in Brasil, so they have a starting point.
