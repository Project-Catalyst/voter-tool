How the sessions will be uploaded to Swarm YouTube?

The proposers aim to improve this issue by hosting 6 workshops where people can come together and brainstorm ideas for proposals as well as create the proposals. These sessions would not only provide a good space for proposers, but it would also allow community advisors and voters to also come see proposals in progress and provide preliminary feedback that could help improve the proposals. It is important to have many perspectives during the development phase of a project because many minds can come up with unique solutions that a single mind couldn\u2019t come up with. Also, as I mentioned these sessions would bring in CAs, voters, and proposers. The outcome could mean that people who were only voters may become inspired to take up other roles in the catalyst project by becoming CAs or proposers themselves. Thus, catalyst will flourish and become a more vibrant space because of this proposal.

The proposers are all active members of the cardano catalyst community which gives me confidence that they can make these sessions effective for people of all backgrounds with catalyst. Additionally, the proposers have experience with teaching and providing feedback to proposers, which will be important during the workshop sessions. One thing that the proposers mentioned is that they are spread thin over all of their catalyst projects, which is a slight concern for me because I want to know that the proposers can dedicate enough time to make this proposal happen successfully. I don\u2019t know what this means for the potential feasibility of this proposal, but I hope that the proposers can make it happen because it would be a huge benefit to the entire community. With regards to the timeline, the proposers did not give a specific timeline, but they did provide a breakdown of the different tasks that will be completed over the course of the project implementation. For example, the solution manager role will make the process more inclusive, the facilitator will guide the workshops so that participants can get the most out of them, and the community manager will conduct the outreach to get more participants, just to name a few roles. All of the listed roles have an amount of time associated with them which connect to the budget. The proposers chose to divide the budget up on an hourly basis to cover the costs of running the sessions. As a result, I can easily tell where the funds will be going. I do have experience providing feedback to proposers, so given my experience, I think that the requested funds to cover the hourly rate are sufficient.

The proposers listed many good quantitative KPIs that the cardano community can use to track the progress and success of this proposal. For example, the proposers hope to increase the number of individuals who want to contribute feedback per session by two each time, increase the number of views on the YouTube videos from 33 to 40, and increase the average watch time of each video from 7 minutes to 12 minutes. I think that all of these metrics will provide useful insight into the success of this proposal because they give a glimpse into the improvement that will show incremental gains in the participant base. The proposers already have a spreadsheet tracking the proposal journeys and listed a sample closing summary from a previous fund, which I assume they will continue doing into the future to help people audit this proposal. Both documents were easy to read, which makes auditing it much easier. Overall, the goal of the proposers is to help raise the average star rating of proposals from community advisors over 3.8 stars. Over the next few funds, the entire community can look at the retrospective statistics and see if the average CA score increases, potentially indicating that this proposal was successful at contributing to the challenge setting.

Though it might seem limited, it really goes in-depth in those 3 key metrics which  ensures the participants have been given every possible opportunity to be able to compose a strong and holistic proposal. For each and every part of a proposal is discussed together with the moderator until the very last point of the Auditability section. Is it effective in addressing the whole Challenge? Perhaps not, but where it makes up and in spades is its impact in creating the embryo of quality proposals. Something that the Project Catalyst process is still struggling to achieve.\n\nI believe we are at an infliction point, where the ideas are becoming similar and we are starting to throw money at the top solutions. This proposal should be one of them. The only downfall of this proposal, which fortunately the proposer has identified, is the heavy reliance on the moderators/proposer individual capability in project/time/Miro board management. From iteration to iteration I can see there are improvements, but what this proposer needs is more budget to either groom the next moderator or somehow transfer the Miro board process into an dApps.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has time and time again, delivered on his KPI's.

The proposer also continuously provides feedback to CA's by giving risk assessments that differ from Fund to Fund. This brings confidence to CA's that the proposer in the next Fund round will provide us with an even better solution.\n\nThe timeline provided is quite simple, unfortunately so. Though I do understand the proposer intent in choosing that timeline, it would have been great if it were also stated in the proposal and given a step-by-step timeframe. Therefore the proposer would have a general structure which acts as a foundation to build upon. Leaving it free flowing allows complacency to creep in.

I do remember though the ratings that I gave this proposer and it was definitely lower than what I am giving now.\n\nWhat metrics target does the proposer intend to achieve and how will the proposer intend to measure those metrics are still fairly similar, which I have no particular issue with.

I recommend iterating on this, which could help sharpen feedback capturing approach as well as backloop to your service approach.\nSince the service is focusing on making proposals successful, the question arises of how you set your benchmark of achieving a overall rating of 3.8 for assessed proposals. This can be of value to understand since it is a measurable outcome of your work you are providing. The question I would ask is: statistically what is the likelihood of a 3.8 rated proposal to get funded (versus on one that has a rating of 4.5, for example)? Statistical answer is key and guides you towards a rating goal, furthermore it can backloop directly to what you need to focus on (aspects of proposals) that mark a difference i(average quality vs high quality proposals). It is also a question on how you want to position your expertise (and grow) to establish the capabilities on assessing the proposers.

It would be a massive waste of money to pay (a pretty overpriced amount) to have a video series proposed that is not known about or used by any substantial amount of people.

The channel itself doesn't have any customization for layout or much intentionality for use of thumbnails.

Through the workshops, passive ADA holders could become active catalyst members, it will educate and increase proposers, advisors etc. I do believe it will have a positive impact. The project has been funded since Fund 6, so they have been building on their own skills and I think they just need to work on the making people more aware of it. They have a YouTube channel with 22 videos - Well done. It has been viewed 145 times at the time I checked. It means that even after the live workshop sessions, more community members watching it.

I have to assume that one or more of the current team members are doing most of the work that will need to be handed over to the extra two team members they are hoping to acquire through successful funding of their project. The budget is mainly for their hourly rate, and the hourly rate is a reasonable rate if I look at what others proposers charge. They are already doing this successfully, and it should be a good idea to fund them to continue this project. Anything worthwhile needs time to grow to succeed.  I do find the videos a bit difficult to watch, because I think of the Miro board that moves all over the place the whole time.
