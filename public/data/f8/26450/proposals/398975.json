So he proposes to set up a team on linkedin where Cardano can be promoted in an organized way for the generation and publication of content and invites members of the community to join. Unfortunately it is clear that the author did not have the opportunity to complete this proposal, it is not possible to make an impact evaluation if you do not know the target population to be addressed through linkedin. This social network is very large and in order to have the best results it is necessary to define the target user and plan the content and outreach campaigns from there. It is also necessary to evaluate the appropriate impact by having well-defined metrics and, if possible, framed in a time range. I invite the author of the proposal to take my feedback and that of the rest of the community so that he can present a robust proposal for the next fund. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "In terms of feasibility there is no information available to make a proper evaluation, so I recommend to the voters not to approve this proposal. Now in the spirit of inviting proposers to prepare for the next fund, here are some ideas (beyond those already in the proposer's guide) that I can think of in terms of feasibility to address this type of problem. First of all, have someone on the team with a marketing backgroung, if possible who knows everything that has to do with Facebook, Google and Linkedin adds and allocate a budget item not only for the cost of advertising, but for the planning and maintenance of the campaign. I would also recommend a member with a background in online content creation, the best way to do engagement is to create valuable content for the target audience, so with your knowledge of the ecosystem combined with a good professional in this area would be a good start. Talking a bit about the plan, it is necessary to create a funnel workflow thinking about the steps that this target user would have to go through to become part of the community. Now the team has to define what it would mean to be part of the community. Wallet creation? Registration in Project Catalyst? Active participation in Discord groups? This would have to be defined by you. It is also necessary to think what would be the main risks for the money invested in campaigns to be as profitable as possible, some risks are the clearest of course that the potential new risk does not complete the workflow funnel, from there you would have to think countermeasures to reduce that risk, and so for all the general risks that you identify.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "In the Auditability section there is also not enough information to make a complete assessment, so now I focus on presenting suggested metrics / KPIs for the proponent to consider for future funding.
