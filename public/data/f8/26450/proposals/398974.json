This proposal certainly meets in theory the objective of bringing new people into our ecosystem, as we know that in most cases Cardano is unknown (except in places where blockchain is already more widespread, such as the United States and Europe). This would certainly be beneficial for Cardano, since in addition to new workers in the projects, the investment in our blockchain would probably also grow, either by the increase in the purchase of Ada, Ada being delegated, CNFTs bought and sold, number of digital wallets created and etc. The problem is that it is not explained exactly how these 100 new members would be onboarded into the community, in the feasibility part there are several actions that would be taken, such as \u201cactive pre-onboarding campaigns and information about the value of the catalyst / welcome meeting\u201d. must be powerful, share Cardano's vision\u201d and many others. However, the problem I identify here is that these actions are not well located in time and space. We know which team involved would be the East African decentralized alliance, which leads us to believe that the project would be in that geographic region, but in which country? Who would be the target audience, that is, which people exactly are we targeting to create this group of 100 people? How long would each of these actions take and when are they planned to take place? In short, I think the idea is a good one, but putting it into practice is still a bit confusing through the information given. With that, I'll be neutral about the impact. This part of the proposal could give more confidence with the details I mentioned a little while ago. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "As I explained on impact, I think the script here is good in the sense of letting us know what is going to happen, but not in what way or how. It would be necessary to understand how long this project would take to happen. The explanations provided for each of the two months are very superficial, it would take more detailing of the activities, it would also be great to understand for weeks what actions would be developed. I would also like to know which alliance members would do which things, and where, for example, the meetings would take place. Since they will be face-to-face, where will they take place? And what group of people will you organize, with the aim of also receiving whom? How would the teachings on Cardano be transmitted? What topics would be covered and in what order? I believe we would start with the basics, such as what is blockchain, Cardano, NFT, digital wallet and other more primary technologies of our ecosystem. But unfortunately the bidder does not specify any of this information. Therefore, I believe that the roadmap should be reformulated, including deadlines and more detail on each of the actions. Regarding the budget, I also think that this part should be better explained, despite the fact that the money requested is very cheap compared to the other proposals, this does not exclude the need for detailing how much will be used. For example, most of that money would go to the host. He or she would receive 1600 USD. But why? What would that person do? What tasks would she be responsible for during the month? How many hours of work would she do a day? Would your journey be Monday through Friday? And finally, about the team, we are told that they would be the members of the East African decentralized alliance and that they have launched several proposals previously and some of them have already been funded. However, it would be necessary to know them individually, so that we have a real idea of \u200b\u200bwho we are dealing with and if they are qualified for the project. We would need to know their names, CVs, how they relate to Cardano (we know they are part of an active group in the community, but what are they doing?), what roles they would play here (from what I could understand it would be just one person from the group working on the project, but who, and what would she do?). That is, all the detail that is provided about team members Victor, Antony and Angela. Anyway, it's very complicated to trust a team that we don't fully know. Therefore, I think that in terms of feasibility, the proposal is not bad, but some things should be reviewed. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Regarding the progress of the project, I think that auditability is possible, because the proponent lists several activities that must be fulfilled so that we can consider that the planned things are actually happening. As we have such activities in a linear order, it is easier to monitor this. What is really missing is the issue of dates and deadlines within the months. If we had an exact idea of \u200b\u200bhow long each thing would last, we could better understand the whole. It would be important for the proponent to define, for example, that by the 15th, half of the promised activities would have been fulfilled. It would be great to know the exact days the meetings would take place. Another suggestion I would like to make is that some member of the Cardano community, who was native to the place where the project would be focused, follow the entire process, both the online parts and the face-to-face meetings, and bring this feedback to the rest of the Cardano community. through any of the various communication channels that we have. And about the final results, unfortunately this part is very unspecific, we know that the goal is to ship 100 new members to the Cardano community, but how would we know that this result was achieved? It would be essential for the proponent to prepare a final report, when the project has been completed, gathering all the data that demonstrate that the goal has been met: how many digital wallets were created, how many people attended the meetings, if these people actually entered the Cardano ecosystem , and if so, in what way... Anyway, we need to know in detail how this all happened. Preferably, someone participating in the project also gives their opinion on everything, telling their account of how this initiative reached him and how it reached his colleagues, for example. Therefore, I think that auditability is good only in relation to the process, and even in this part it is not ideal because the dates are absent, the temporal notion given is a little vague. Unfortunately, about the end goal, not enough detail is given so that we could really safely monitor the consequences of this project. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 8, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 446, "q0": "The proposal addresses the challenge well in that it focuses on onboarding a significant number of new people (100) to Catalyst in an underrepresented part of the world, and it also focuses on the challenge-setting priorities of attracting quality people, and onboarding them to active participation in Catalyst as proposers, advisors and mentors, as well as simply ADA holders and voters.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The \"describe your solution\" section doesn't explain what the proposal actually is and what it will do, so it's only by piecing scraps of information together from the other sections that I can begin to guess what's happening. From the timeplan, it seems people are to be onboarded mainly as proposers; and from the budget (Zoom licence; meeting venue costs) I can guess that some onboarding sessions will be on Zoom and others face-to-face; but it is not clear who the 100 people to be onboarded are, how they will be identified and reached, how many sessions in total there will be, whether they're all large meetings like a Town Hall, or some smaller sessions; etc. All this will affect feasibility, so a much clearer explanation is needed, and a reviewer should not need to guess by piecing information together. The time plan needs to be more specific in parts - e.g.\" Easing transition by being communicative and giving new members information and tools\", it would be helpful to know *which* tools, *what* information (I guess it must be resources that have already been created by others, since there is no budget for creating new material - but it would be good to specify where they will come from, and what experience the team has in using them and explaining them to others, because all this might help us understand the project's feasibility.) The budget (total $2,100) doesn't match the total requested ($2,500); but apart from that error, it is reasonably clear and well broken down. The team seem to have the skills and experience needed to achieve some kind of onboarding; but since we don't know what they will actually be expected to do, this is hard to assess. It would be good to include some information about the team's links to the communities they want to reach and how they will use these connections to attract people to the sessions. Overall, from what I can tell, the basic idea could be developed into a feasible proposal; but as it stands, it's not feasible. One big concern is that the core of it seems to be onboarding proposers; and because this proposal team do not demonstrate that they can write a good proposal themselves, I am not convinced they can train and support others to do so. But the project sounds like an important and valuable one, and it does address the challenge well, so I hope the proposers work on it and and resubmit in a future fund. If they could give themselves a \"crash course\" in proposal writing, then they would be in a very strong position to help others do so, because they would have a really good understanding, from experience, of the process of learning how to do it.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "No audit metrics have been defined; we don't know what will be measured or assessed, and the \"audit\" section is basically another version of the project timeline.  I'd like to see the proposers define 4 or 5 measurable things that would show whether or not they have achieved their \"what does success look like\" - so for example, the number of people attending, number of people actually submitting a proposal, number who say in an evaluation that they found the sessions easy to engage with, etc. But as the proposer hasn't included these metrics, and will not be measuring these things, the project isn't auditable.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1157", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 660, "q0": "This proposal is for a classic outreach campaign to spread word on Cardano in East African communities via...well, just about anything you can think of!  Online meetups, face to face sit downs, public venues, even phone calls are covered here in an attempt to reach as many people as possible over the course of 4 months.  They make specific mention of explaining the opportunities of Catalyst, especially the roles of proposers and CAs, and plan to use a catalog of past funded proposals to get their audiences thinking about specific ways they could be jumping in to submit proposals and jumpstart Cardano in their communities.  Through these 4 months they hope and expect to onboard one hundred new members to the Catalyst community from East Africa, with every Catalyst role under consideration.

WIth four funded proposals out of the gate in Fund7, and many more teams developing and polishing their skills, there is no doubt that they know how to get the word out.  Modeled on the hyper successful WADA group in Catalyst they are quickly mastering the roles.  In fact the most disappointing thing about this proposal is not getting more information about the team behind this.  We have an idea of their results, which is good, but who are they and how do they see all this happening?  The timeline they have laid out has done a lot of the talking for them, rolling out ten key points, from principles they wish to uphold (high energy introductions, multiple and easy communications channels) to specific points they want to be sure to get across (in depth knowledge of the roles of Catalyst, up to date on important parts of the process like TownHalls and Swarm sessions).  There could be more details about what events they plan to do when, but given the multitude of types of connection they are seeking to form, a lot of what they do appears like it will be highly emergent.  They do indicate they will have a large introductory meeting to kick things off, so I imagine they envision a lot of the meetups and connections to be as a result of that initial networking.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The main KPI the team has presented, the onboarding of 100 Project Catalyst members is short and to the point.
