After Town Hall was the embryo of a lot of communities, and there is no doubt it will continue to be so. 100% yes, After Town Hall meets all the key metrics in spades, albeit indirectly (which is more of a testament of the peculiarly written Challenge key metrics).

The rate of onboarding onto Project Catalyst to my understanding, never stops growing, which would mean there might be new people who are perhaps lurkers that have not known After Town Hall is actually a community thing.\n\nPerhaps their entry point was through Catalyst School and they focused on being a CA, and when coming across this proposal, they might assess it negatively, something that we all do not want to happen. With that said, the timeline and action plan are far from being detailed. This also carries onto the budget format, it takes time to digest where the funds are going.
