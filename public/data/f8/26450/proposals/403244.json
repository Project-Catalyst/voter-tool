It would address many issues regarding onboarding new Catalyst members in a creative emergent way that could address things that maybe don't lend themselves to more direct solutions.  I do think that there needs to be some serious \"guard rails\" on a resource like this, as the nature of Catalyst is to have so many things you need to know as to be utterly overwhelming (thus the need for proposals like this and the whole reason the challenge setting was dreamt up in the first place).  But if the list is properly curated, delimited and maintained, I see it as a popular place for newcomers and oldtimers alike to get a sense of the hubs of interest and opportunity that are driving Catalyst forward at any given time.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It should be understood that the goal here is not the imposition of any particular list, but to fund a process for discovering the nature and properties of such a list, and then to provide that discovery to the community as a v1.0 of the list.  Having said that, the version imagined as a starting point isn't going to work.  One of the risks of these kind of pathfinding/mapping resources is that it sprawls.  A map of the world doesn't possess the resolution to correctly inform decisions about how to get to a grocery store, and even the beta version of the list provided here is clearly infected with an advanced case of deadly sprawl.  To bring it into focus, it needs to be delimited, and my suggestion would be to make it more \"Ten things you have to learn in Catalyst....\".  Really dial it in and see what kind of resource that creates.  The second issue facing resources like this is stagnation.  Someone puts a lot of time and energy into capturing the network state for a brief moment, and then two weeks later it is out of date.  Two months later?  Two years later?  Perish the thought.  As important as curating the list and giving it visibility is having a clear protocol about how and when it is updated, and who does it.  Ideally you automate it somehow with all of those parameters (maybe tie a pool of guides and educational articles to a machine learning algo like the kind that senses what topics are most verbalized across multiple communication channels, which results in the guides associated with particular keywords to be linked up in order of their popularity.  And if a keyword has no guide?  maybe a flag to the community that they need a new resource), but within the scope of this proposal the proper tack is probably to create an incentivization scheme, such as a token that accrues to those who maintain it (and the work to design such a scheme would pay off by being horizontally applicable to any number of resources that need to be kept up to date.)  Without those elements clearly outlined (delimiting characteristics, maintenance protocol) this project is missing critical infrastructure to be executed.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "To the degree that the proposer has provided a process that can be seen through (though I don't believe it would have success, as noted above), there is definitely an auditable plan here.  Running the surveys results in implementable data (likely too much data, in fact, but I repeat myself) and reportable milestones as the list is built out and prototyped.  Creating a community facing hub (gitbook recommended, github highly recommended) is a critical step that can be reported in increments.  Because the data is being sourced directly from the Catalyst community, there is no doubt that the project can be held accountable and kept on track.  I really appreciate how the proposer envisions the \"success\" of a project like this:  though he includes some somewhat arbitrary KPIs, the real contribution is in the educational communities of Catalyst being able to refine their offerings, and to tune them to the emergent needs of the community.  I wish the proposer good luck in measuring such a qualitative measure, while saluting him on the worthiness of it.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 7, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1275, "q0": "\u201cNew users in Cardano have trouble knowing what to learn and where to get help.\u201d The proposal has identified an important problem that I face myself when joining Cardano. The proposal suggests a solution would be to establish a list of competencies. This is closely aligned with the challenge. The process involves survey the community and reaching back to the respondents. There is a closed cycle, and one can obtain first-hand experience, different perspectives and collective knowledge. The proposal also mentioned creating living document periodically updated. This is important as Project Catalyst is constantly developing and changing. \n\nI appreciate the fact that the list is a guide for new users as well as a good source of information for content creators. And can help close the gap between learning resources and learners. \n\nThe proposal has described the initial steps of the project and also mentioned possible ways of development in the future. Future considerations can also include developing ways to incorporate existing materials, survey new users on what learning content they need to further inform content creators. \n\nLastly, I cannot see how the list will address the different roles available on Project Catalyst. Or will the list specifically target different roles? I would imagine that being quite important. One solution could be to create different lists. One that contains general knowledge that every role needs, and other lists for specific roles: challenge teams, proposers, advisors, mentors, voters.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team consists of members with a background in educational technology, course development can be helpful. There is a LinkIn profile and website to verify.

I understood that you want the survey to be interactive, but can\u2019t that be achieved with existing tools? Like Google Form or Survey Monkey? \n\nSimilarly, for publishing the list, why not use a platform with a Cardano community? Since that will bring more audience more easily.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal has set metrics for measuring performance in 6 months time. The metrics are clear, concise and measurable. Perhaps it is good to think about what will happen afterwards?

I am willing to see this list appear in orientation documents for new members. This is very meaningful and important. \n\nAlso, perhaps you could research what similar resources are available at the moment. I have seen some lists on twitter and github.

This is a senior researcher posture.\n\nI had the opportunity to work on market research projects for about 4 years, the beginning of my career, mainly understanding purchasing behavior, message absorption in different media and product usability. I would like to contribute with two points about the presentation of the plan. (1) I missed the presentation of a timeline, to understand the time and depth that the author intends to reach at each stage, as well as understanding the deadlines as a whole. (2) knowing that the author wants to serve different groups that work in the community, according to their particularities, I would like to have a view of how he intends to deal with these specificities in the research.
