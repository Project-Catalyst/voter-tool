It particularly addresses the suggested guiding question of \"What additional roles are needed?\", which not many proposals in this challenge are looking at; and it addresses the issue identified in the challenge-setting of ensuring that people are capaple to fulfil their roles, and filtering out bad actors and building reputation for CAs and the proposed new COs. It also indirectly addresses improvements to onboarding people as proposers, since it aims to look at the idea of making the CA role function more like a supportive mentor for proposers. I recognise that the proposal addresses all these things *indirectly* - this proposal is about doing research and community consultation into the feasibility of all these things - but I support this approach, and feel that the proposer has justified the idea that approaching things in this way would have the best impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project looks feasible in terms of budget; and I like the fact that although the ideas behind it are quite far-reaching, this actual proposal is simply a feasibility study to research it further and produce a whitepaper, and then survey the community on the results. This seems like a good approach to maximising the feasibility of big changes in Catalyst - research it first and secure community involvement. I also like that the first of the 3 surveys will be done before any research is begun, in order to establish a baseline. All this gives me confidence that the proposer knows how to do valid research. But one key thing missing is that no information is given about the proposer's background and skills. I would particularly want to see some evidence of skill and knowledge in survey design: we see a lot of surveys in Catalyst, and not all of them are well-designed (sometimes to the point that it would be problematic to draw any conclusions from them at all) - so given that this research is about the possibility of quite a major change to the Catalyst process, I would want to see some definite evidence that the proposer knows what they are doing, can write a survey without loaded or leading questions, etc. If the proposer doesn't have a relevant academic or research background, then writing a more detailed explanation of how they will approach both the research and the surveying of the community would have served the purpose. I also feel that given the research is going to cover quite a number of elements and will propose several changes to the current CA system )from the introduction of COs, to time limits and changes to pay), there would need to be some community outreach other than the surveys, to make sure people fully understand the contents of the white paper before responding to the survey. Maybe a couple of After Town Hall and/or Swarm sessions to explain? Also, I feel that allowing only 2 hours per survey to draft, issue, compile and report is too little for a survey on quite complex issues. Another more minor issue I see is, although the proposer has identified a couple of risks, they are not well elucidated, and there is no mitigation suggested. Taking all this into account, I can't fully agree or disagree that the project is feasible.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The suggested audit metrics boil down to \"has the whitepaper been produced, and has a proposal been submitted in fund 9?\" which is certainly auditable as far as it goes, but is not really enough. I think a metric about the quality of the whitepaper should be included, even if it is only the number and range of the sources consulted; and, if the Fund 9 proposal to be worked on is going to be a \"community\" proposal, I'd like to see some additional metrics to measure who gets involved - how many people, geographical spread, from what sections of the Catalyst community, and particularly whether the CA community and CA subcircle have engaged with the process, as it is most relevant to them. Additionally, the Audit section mentions \"**Successfully** drafting a community Proposal\" - I would like to see the proposer define what \"successfully\" would mean here. Is it still successful if only a small amount of community engagement with the proposal-drafting is achieved? Or if the community rejects the proposer's ideas, and wants to draft a proposal with an entirely different approach? There is also an issue in that the \"What would success look like\" section does not relate to this proposal itself (i.e. the drafting of a whitepaper) but to the end result of a future proposal, and the adoption of the ideas that that the whitepaper will discuss. Measuring succcess for this project should not pre-suppose that the community, or in fact the proposer's research, will actually confirm/support the proposer's idea of how to modify the CA process; the measures of success for *this* proposal shouldn't be about the success of a putative *future* proposal. Overall there are some auditable elements, but I can't fully agree or disagree that the proposal is sufficiently auditable.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1157", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 5, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1273, "q0": "The proposal identified the problems that the current Project Catalyst system is \u201cdifficult to navigate\u201d, \u201cdifficult to onboard\u201d and \u201ccannot scale for an increase in proposals\u201d. These problems align with the challenge. \n\nThe solution proposed was to introduce a new role in Project Catalyst, a Catalyst Observer (CO). Where COs will do a first round filter of proposals based on a triage system and find Ready to Prime Time (RPT) proposals which will be assessed by the CAs. Moreover, there is a time frame of three cycles with increasing compensation. There is an attachment with details of how compensations can be calculated, which show the work and careful thoughts behind designing this solution. \n\nI am afraid the proposal did not manage to convince me that the proposed idea will solve the problem stated. Simply introducing a new role will not make onboarding easier. First of all, there need to be channels for new users to discover there is a CO role. I think having CO filtering out proposals can make the project catalyst platform more efficient, but I am doubtful as to how much CO can learn and develop from this process. The proposer have not identified the root cause of not having a clear path for onboarding. \n\nI want to also see justification of the design of the three cycle time frame. Three cycles might be too long a growth time. With an increasing number of proposals, Project Catalyst urgently needs new Catalyst members to take on suitable roles and responsibilities of CA and VCA. Having three cycle growth time might be too long and they cannot keep up with the fast evolving ecosystem. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There are some identification of challenges and risks. Indeed, the identified risks are really challenging and will cause huge issues if not carefully dealt with. For example, the acceptance by the community. The proposal did not mention how it wanted to overcome the challenges and risks. \n\nBrief mention of entrepreneur, risk management experience. Lack supporting evidence, for example LinkedIn profile. I am not sure if the team has the relevant skill and experience to put forward the proposed idea.\n\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into different components that are closely related to the proposed idea. There is a realistic timetable to complete the research, drafting and re-editing of the white paper. The proposal mentions \u201chow things will be done\u201d including what the research will cover.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The timeline was for future funds. It is nice that the proposer has a bigger picture in mind and has split the task into different stages. There is a lack of metrics to measure the progress of the action proposed in this round of the fund. \n\nThe Metrics/KPIs are rather qualitative and not quantitative. It is better to include some metrics that can in some sense measure the qualitative description of what success looks like. For example, easy onboarding could be measured by the number of newly registered Catalyst accounts. Although there might not be a direct causation, the number should say something. \n\nFinally, one of the goals of CA for unsuccessful proposals is to give advice on how the proposal can be successful in future Funds. Will CO be able to do the same. According to my understanding, there is a current system for filtering out incomplete proposals. How much more will CO do in addition to the existing filter? And most importantly: Does CO have enough knowledge to judge a proposal? Will the introduction of CO disincentive CAs and VCAs as they will inevitably receive less reward as a portion is given to the CO.

It does worry me if this new filter could eliminate proposals that are not ready, but with the assessments could evolve to a more substantial proposal in subsequent funding. I have seen many excellent proposals that haven't obtained funding but have matured since then. An alternative for that is maybe expanding the CO role to some sort of consultancy to those proposals that are filtered out.\nWhile the risk is relevant, I would have liked to understand how they would mitigate it. Maybe there could be some sessions to explain the new role to the community and clarify any concerns.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The timeline seems to be a plan to submit a proposal, rather than a timeline for the creation of the proposed role.\nI think it would be interesting to understand more of the feasibility of the implementation of the CO role, so I could see if the final product is actually feasible, and not just the preliminary research.\nThere isn't much information on the team, it could benefit from more details on their background and links to verify their credentials.
