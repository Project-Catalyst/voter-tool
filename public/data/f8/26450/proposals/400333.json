Although this site is a good idea and no doubt has some positive effects on the Cardano ecosystem (particularly for smaller stakepools), it doesn't address engaging people with Catalyst as proposers, voters, CAs, etc; in fact, the word \"Catalyst\" does not even appear anywhere in the proposal text. If there is a way that it would address Catalyst onboarding, the proposer has unfortunately not explained it; so reluctantly I have to rate this as \"no, it doesn't address the challenge\".", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal has some good features on feasibility. The proposal team clearly has the knowledge needed to deliver it; and it looks reasonably well-planned: I like the way the proposer has linked their timeline and budget together so we can see what costs will be at each stage. The proposer has also accurately identified several risks; and although their mitigation could be expressed a bit more clearly, it *is* there. But the most important element of the planning is not very clear: the actual purpose of doing the site upgrade is not spelled out, and the description of the \"proposed solution\" describes the site itself, rather than the upgrade project for which funding is being sought. There is some mention of attracting new site users - but if this is the only aim, then I would say that more would need to be spent on marketing to make the proposal feasible. There are also mentions of \"project goals and KPIs\" and \"clear targets\", but these do not actually appear as such in the proposal - it would be particularly helpful to see the targets spelled out, so we can see if they are reasonable and feasible. In other words, the proposal doesn't say what problem it will solve, or why it's necessary to do these upgrades; this makes it hard to assess whether the proposal will be implemented *successfully* (i.e. will it succeed in achieving what it's supposed to?) or to fully assess the feasibility of its goals. Without sufficient information, I can neither agree nor disagree on feasibility.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "On audit, the proposer suggest measuring basic site usage and the implementation of new tools and updates, which is a good start, and transparent. But I would like to see some thought given to \"cause and effect\" - in other words, if there is a change in the site usage, how far can we attribute it to what has been done in this project in terms of upgrades and new tools, and how can we know that it wasn't caused by something else? And, since the proposal says that what success looks like would include \"To help educate new users on the importance of selecting a Stake Pool and help make Cardano a healthy ecosystem for future generations\", I'd like to see some way of measuring that - how will we know if site users *are* actually being educated on the importance of selecting a stakepool, rather than being mainly people who already know all about it? So although the suggested audit measures will give some useful information, the actual success and point of the proposal can't entirely be audited, so I can neither agree nor disagree that the proposal overall is auditable.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1157", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 694, "q0": "Unfortunately this intriguing proposal for a SPO tool that benefits the smallest pools just doesn't line up with the challenge setting it has been submitted in.  Presumably the author believes the alignment comes by considering new SPO, or new stakers looking for small or single pools, to need onboarding help in the form of their tool.  But the challenge setting is dedicated to onboarding new members to Catalyst specifically, by increasing or improving proposals, educational resources for Catalyst roles, that sort of thing.  The  pool tool itself (poolpeek) seems like a really great idea though, so the team is encouraged to polish it based on any advice they receive and see if a better funding opportunity presents itself in Fund9.  In the current fund, a better setting would have been either the Dapps and Integrations, possibly Cardano Scaling Solutions, and of course, Miscellaneous.  As far as the impact this proposal could have had, the ability to connect the poolpeek tool with wallets so they can find and track and save their favorite charity pools or single pool operators would be a welcome addition, as much for the connector as for supporting small pools.   The ability torun rotating, free ad space is an obvious solution, if not the most mercenary one, and you could imagine such a tool allowing for \"get to know the SPO\" type advertising as well.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "While the prototype site is up and looks nice and navigates well, there really aren't any useful details regarding just what is being worked on, what is finished, what specifically will be built out with the funding...are we talking about integration with wallets via a dapp connector?  Does the project require team members beyond the 3 SPOs behind the team?  What skills do they have as a team that are applicable to this project?  There is no timeline provided, just a general statement of \"3-6 months\" that doesn't help us understand what the steps are along the way, or what gets delivered when.  There is simply no way to tell what the team could deliver or what they couldn't.  For example they suggest installing a chat bot will help...but no clues are given as to how.  Will it be a Q&A AI?  The website indicates a place for a pool wizard tool, so maybe that is what they are referring to?  The layout of the proposal needs to be revisited to clearly show, at a minimum, actionable tasks and their order, a funding breakdown tied to deliverables and a description of the specific architecture and technology they are trying to implement.  Knowing what they want to accomplish is only the first step of a plan:  how they plan to accomplish it is important too.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A rough schedule of 3-6 months without any particular milestones or their order is all that is presented, and the listed KPIs come up short, especially in light of the challenge this has been submitted in.  To the degree that we lean on the provided KPIs to gauge progress...well, they are lacking.  Knowing the visitor traffic to the website really doesn't tell us anything about adoption of Catalyst or Cardano even (it really signals little more than interest), and it doesn't even help understand to what degree the stated goal of decentralization has been acheived.  If submitted to a different challenge, the best KPIs for a proposal of this nature would have to be rate of change to registered SPOs for the service, effectiveness of the free advertising in both getting eyes on SPO pages and securing stake, and perhaps user satisfaction for the the chatbot or wizard, whichever they are planning on implementing.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 5, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2741, "q0": "The category of \u201cNew Member Onboarding\u201d relates specifically to Project Catalyst.

Removing ADA from exchanges and into self custody is an important step for new users of Cardano.

I do not see how this will gain massive traction, though the proposer states that this is not the intention. The intention is create a fair playing field. Is this effective? Perhaps not, for the regular ADA users would like to be involved in a SPO that is producing blocks. Just an idea to the proposer, perhaps they can tweak this tool to allow searching SPO based on their mission or value added back to the community. Perhaps, a search engine that helps us find out which SPO is donating to a charity. From there we can dig deeper into this SPO to see what that charity is all about.\n\nAs interesting as this idea is, unfortunately though this does not meet the key metrics of this Challenge. It would perhaps fit better with this Challenge if this website was to provide a search category to find which SPO's support onboarding onto Catalyst or Cardano. Then the proposers initial intent will also coincide with this Challenge's key metrics. At it's current state this proposal I reckon would fit better in the \"Developer Ecosystem\" and \"Dapps and Integrations\".
