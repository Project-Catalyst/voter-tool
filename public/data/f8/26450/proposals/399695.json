However, I have come to the conclusion that this was a far too common misinterpretation to be a significant penalty in the is challenge IF the proposer does have an idea for onboarding users to Cardano (for Catalyst is a part of Cardano, no?  Eventually all roads lead to the same place....).  And that is certainly the case here.  The challenge setting in particular suggests multilingual support, and this project is meant to do a HUGE amount of translation of several of the core onboarding elements of Cardano, particularly the PlutusPioneers Course and the AtalaPRISMPioneers course.  In addition there is a Haskell and Cryptocurrencies course, so it is clear that the target here is French speaking developers. They do not intend to target developer's directly, such as with workshops, but rather to bolster the work of facilitators like WADA (who is supporting this proposal) in order to make French speaking workshops far more effective and comfortable, and in increasing West Africa Cardano uptake.  If they explicitly add Catalyst material to this list, there would be no questions about challenge alignment.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has some excellent qualifications, with no less than 3 french speaking developers on hand to do the translations, as well as a managing member of the team with educator experience, that will help make sure the finished product is up to standards as a teaching tool.  In addition they have WADA resources supporting them for marketing and for engaging their onboarded developers form other projects in the materials created.  The timeline that is laid out covers funding for a full 12 months, for a team of four to deliver 3 main translated courses.  The sprints can generally be thought of as 3 month groupings for each project, with a 3 month organizing, preparing phase to kick it off post-funding.  Being an AtalaPRISMPioneer myself, I can say that the largest portion of the work is going to be subtitling or dubbing the fantastic \"Fireside Chats\", where the majority of the real learning in that course is happening.  The budget breaks the funding down by deliverable, which will coincide well with the funding disbursement, and it seems logically related to the size of the different courses, with the Plutus course getting the lion's share of the resources, and the overall project management getting the smallest share.  They indicate some concern regarding actual uptake and use of the resource, but with WADA scattering the seeds of Cardano through West Africa at the rate they are, there is no doubt in my mind that these materials are in demand, and will be needed sooner than later.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As the deliverables amount to 3 things over 12 months, the team indicates a preference to release updates and progress on parts of the resources through GitHub and youtube as they are created.  This should not only make it easier to report, but should benefit its intended beneficiaries, who can be using the materials in an almost beta fashion.  I expect that the process will actually result in better realized time horizons as they get feedback on what is working and what is efficient, what is needed and what can be bypassed, to create the best versions of these translations possible.  They provide some general metrics for accounting for views, which are useful, but it would be great if the community could be kept in the loop on whether the materials are helping organizers, hackathons and workshops to assemble and deliver their own projects faster, as I feel like the real impact of this project will be in making the jobs of those conducting the onboarding processes easier and more efficient.  Developer onboarding can be a long-tail event and we need to be careful that we are measuring the right things at the right time.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 8, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 6846, "q0": "The impact of this project is: \n- to increase awareness about the Cardano by providing translated resources (Haskell and Cryptocurrencies Mongolia 2020 course, Plutus and Atala Prism pioneer programs material) in French: this will allow new members from the French community to learn more about Cardano and join, and once within, take certain responsibilities.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Proposers are part of the Wada team, which is for my knowledge, an organisation supporting groups and individuals involved in the catalyst.

It seeks to provide various key Cardano materials to be translated into a certain local language of their community, which is French. This proposal will of course be useful for other French-speaking countries.\n\nAlthough the proposal does not directly address the key metrics of this Challenge, it does have an indirect impact. Through localized content of key Cardano materials, this hopefully will initiate a trickle of Haskell developers. Haskell alone is widely identified as a language that is somewhat hard to understand, due to that the, proposers will not only translate but also collaborate with WADA to educate local developers. A double effort that many non-English speaking communities face.\n\nUnfortunately though, their initial intended content they seek to translate are not provided links for us CA's to have a quick look at, to verify that indeed it is a content needed to be translated on. Plutus and Atala PRISM Pioneer programs are easy enough for us to look for but this \"Haskell and Cryptocurrencies Mongolia 2020 course\" is something I find new, and perhaps others will too. Translation and education is a key factor to increase adoption of Cardano. We need more developers on Cardano.\n\nA worthy mention to note is that the proposers are thinking ahead and anticipating traction of this program, therefore they have coordinated in advanced with WADA to be their distribution channel for all translated contents.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Reviewing their core team (including LinkedIn profiles) and their initiative to build relationships with WADA, on paper this proposal should not only gain traction easily, but also be successfully implemented. Knowing WADA itself are a group of developers throughout West Africa, that are a proven and credible Cardano community, getting their translation to the French-speaking individuals has potential clear roadmap.\n\nTheir timeline though is quite time consuming. Perhaps this correlates with the difficulty to understand and then translate the teaching of Haskell and it's caveats. It will take them a year to finish this proposal. If it is as they proposed, the comparison between budget asked and output offered seems unbalanced. Knowing 2 of the 3 courses, they are doing a lot for a small sum over a long period of time. Not to equate quality with high budget, but it does raise questions of their project management, did they get their numbers right? Is it enough to achieve what they intend to do? Is this proposal a multi-stage proposal? At it's current state, it is impossible to answer that. Hopefully with the assistance of WADA, their KPI's can be achieved.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers are using GitHub as documentation tool for all their progress. GitHub is a widely accepted method of documentation amongst developers and would be a great way of tracking progress by the community and IOG. They will be also providing a YouTube channel that contains educational material on the translated content. Having a YouTube channel does ease the effort it takes to see their developments. A major critique from my side would be the numeric metrics. Since their using YouTube, having a yearly/monthly numeric target of videos would have made gauging the effectiveness of this teams much easier. Numeric metrics act as milestones gate keepers and without it, anyone can be lulled into a situation of complacency, not implying this team will do so but metrics do have their functions.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_635", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8813, "q0": "The proposer that raised the issue was that the Mongolian Haskell and Cryptocurrencies 2020 course, Plutus and Atala Prism's pioneering program document (Video/Documentary) lacked a French version. The solution was to create a streamlined and more accessible version of all three courses in French to reach a wider French-speaking audience. They explain that migrating to a new programming paradigm or language can be difficult, but it is even harder in a language other than the mother tongue. Documentation that does not consider local realities is difficult to understand. According to them, this solution will attract more developers to the Cardano ecosystem and make it easier for them to participate and learn. I agree that this proposal will help more French speakers to know and participate in the Cardano ecosystem. I do not rule out that these new people know and join the ecosystem as Catalyst members, however, the proposal does not address how this project will help new Catalyst members secure It's faster and easier to get the right roles and responsibilities in 2022.

I find that the numbers given are not informative enough for me to judge whether it is reasonable or not.

In my opinion, this KPI is not enough information to evaluate the progress of the project.\nThe recommended overall goal is to have 21 subscribers and 700+ views for all videos.
