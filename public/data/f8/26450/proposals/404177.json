Despite having a population of billions, East Asia is underrepresented in Catalyst due to a lack of localized content and Townhall participation. This proposal aims to get existing Project Catalyst Fund series content translated into the respective local language of the communities represented in Eastern Town Hall. Passive ADA holders might become active Catalyst members as a result of increased awareness of Project Catalyst as the most active open innovation as a result of the introduction of many languages to the Catalyst ecosystem. In the Catalyst ecosystem, this idea will also encourage the usage of existing text, video, and audio assets. This proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has demonstrated his knowledge and competence in block chain, especially Cardano, over time and has the essential skills to carry out the idea,\u00a0\u00a0 knows the right\u00a0\u00a0team members required to carry out the plan, and\u00a0creates a budget that is broken down\u00a0in order to fulfill the goals. A realistic schedule for finishing the work is also included in the proposal, as well as a clear and actionable implementation plan that indicates what is being done and how it is being done.

As a result, the issue solution suggested stands a good possibility of being implemented.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal offers enough information to audit and evaluate the project's progress toward its stated goals, since it elaborates the implementation techniques and success measurement criteria, thanks to the well-developed material from the effect and feasibility categories.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1501", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6322, "q0": "The problem with this proposal is that East Asia is underrepresented in the Catalyst because of the lack of localized content and Townhall involvement. Their solution is to build a system to translate documents and proposals into different languages in East Asia. The goal is a streamlined process for translating the content and initially translating the content into the local language. They also tested a simple method using Git tools, GitLocalize, and GitHub Actions. The project announced that they have put the semi-automatic translation process to the test in Vietnam and Indonesia, the analysis data of the community translation team from Indonesia is very good. They give proof, which is completely verifiable. Besides, they also introduce some risks such as creating a system that balances community participation, high quality translation and translation speed. And the solution will be to create multiple iterations of trial and error. I find this solution reasonable and doable. Adding to the risk is that a reasonable reward/remuneration system needs to be gradually adjusted.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "- The project offers a clear roadmap. They do it for 3 months and have specific jobs like translating 4 topics per month at docs.cardano.org, expanding formats for translations to include video subtitles...\n- The project's budget is divided into 8 sections with specific and detailed works. I find this detailed budget breakdown to be perfectly reasonable. As for the 8th part, the provision of $1,000, equivalent to 6.7%, is a bit less than the risks mentioned in the previous section. The project when implemented should be cautious in spending.\n- The project implementation staff consists of many people, divided into two teams, the core team and the consultant Team. The core team consists of members who are fully qualified and experienced to implement the project such as: Andreas Sosilo - Cardano Foundation Ambassador in Indonesia, Cardano Indonesia Community Manager, Eastern Hemisphere City Hall Team; Angela - Haskell Plutus Instructor, Eastern Town Hall member, Gimbalabs PPBL, CA, VCA, Plutus Pioneer, Atala Prism Pioneer; Jack - Haskell Developer, Music & Video Producer\u2026A 3-member consultant team, in which Andy Sibuea is an IT & Blockchain educator, Eastern Catalyst School member, Felix Weber is a Cardano Ambassador, founder Catalyst Swarm / School\u2026With such a strong team, the project can easily succeed.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Indicators are given very clearly such as main index, activity index, community index.

Interesting KPI approach considering the ORBIT model - which is an adequate framework to measure attraction of new members and maintaining them - in view of building out strong community networks. It is clear that East Asian underrepresentation in Catalyst can be elevated by having access to translated, relevant material.
