But more detail could have been provided on the math of how this incentive would have been distributed. More information could have also been provided on just who the members of this team are. This missing information won't prevent the proposers from providing this incentive, but it does present a significant transparency gap that must be taken into account, rendering possibility for success here quite unpredictable.\n\nOne more note: Under the risks section, the proposers do identify a concern that if not enough Ethereum users take advantage of the incentive, they will end up with funds left over. It would be good to have, and share, a contingency plan for those funds.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Since the blockchain is a public ledger, and this proposal is all about the movement of assets as an incentive, of course this proposal is auditable by traditional means. However, it would have been encouraging to see a commitment to report progress on TVL and project redeployment on Cardano from the proposers. It's simply good to be specific in the section, and without specificity it's difficult to see how more than an uncertain, three-star rating is justifiable.

Proposing to use up 18% of the entire funding pool in Great Migration, every dollar asked for is then provided as liquidity into the projects that decide to migrate from Ethereum to Cardano. As there is no timeline, I assume that all the funding is expected to be paid out as one batch and distributed to projects migrating. There is no mention of repaying IOHK the funds or making them available again after the liquidity pools migrating no longer need them. This is an incredibly inefficient and clumsy way to provide incentives for moving existing Ethereum Defi to Cardano. \nI suggest using a chart that plots \"$ invested\" against \"$ migrated\" to understand how low this proposal would score in terms of efficiency and impact. I strongly disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposers are a highly respected, established company, but they do not seem to understand decentralized finance. They should continue building great products like Milkomeda and help scale up Cardano. Collecting venture funding and splashing it out on Ethereum liquidity pools will require skills in the area of risk assessment, risk management, smart contract stress testing (which some more prudent proposals value at 25k for a bug bounty program) and understanding of the vulnerabilities in cross-chain bridges. Not mentioning these risks and demonstrating understanding of the capital inefficiency of their idea makes it highly unlikely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is no mention of the treatment of the funds once distributed as \"liquidity\", no timeline and no key metrics to assess the Catalyst investment. As the liquidity is (hopefully) unlikely to be consumed fully, some planning for the tracking, auditing and return or reuse of the funds must be provided to explain the auditability of the proposal.\nThere is one performance metric TVL of projects on Milkomeda that depend on liquidity but is has nothing to do with the total TVL migrated in relation to the liquidity provided to the project and not usable to audit the success of the proposal.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1405", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Nowadays, farming coins monetization is the trend of crypto finance in general. The proposed group raised a critical, large-scale problem by taking advantage of this. It provides farming incentives for users to move liquidity from Ethereum to Cardano. This will promote Defi's development in the Cardano ecosystem.\nThe solution proposed by the proposer, I found that it identified most of the problems of the challenge and the logical argument. Their key here is to use the money to provide farming incentives through connection with Milkomeda, incentivizing users to transfer liquidity to Cardano. They argue that the AMM DEX is only effective if there is enough liquidity to match the transactions when migration becomes higher possible. Moreover, the Cardano ecosystem has just launched a smart contract and is still struggling with the Defi segment. I think this is a necessary recommendation for this ecosystem. However, it is still impossible to avoid risks when implementing the project. The team has identified 2 main risks and has solutions to minimize these.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal group did not provide a specific plan or timeline. To explain this, they say that they can use the money immediately after being funded. However, they cannot predict how long the incentive will last as it depends on the level of liquidity attracted. Although the budget is less than 20% of the total budget, the expenses are not listed, and there is no specific division plan. Instead, they say that the entire budget will be used as liquidity. I think that is unreasonable, not transparent. Because when creating any project, there must be a plan, roadmap, and estimated costs to give the amount of funding.\nThis proposal provides general information about the members only. There is no job assignment, no description of each person's capacity and experience, and it isn't easy to have a basis for identity verification. Stay behind the project is the dcSpark Company which has relationships with Cardano (through our many years of work for Cardano) and the Ethereum ecosystem (through the Milkomeda project). Both dcSpark and Milkomeda have many capable and experienced developers but are unpopular. I think the Team should provide information; the identity of the people directly involved in the project will be more accessible for those interested.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This is a brand new project that has never been funded before in Catalyst. How they measure project progress and development is dependent. They do not give specific figures and KPIs. Instead, I want them to set clear goals, provide particular metrics that they think will be achieved within a certain timeline. This will make it easier to measure and determine the project's success. However, many successful projects have been implemented on Milkomeda before, and dcSpark has made achievements in working on Cardano, so I am confident that the project will be successful, bringing many benefits to the Cardano ecosystem.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1631", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proponent identifies a real problem within our ecosystem and adjusts to the challenge settings.\nIt is true that Cardano is struggling in terms of TVL, because it is just the beginning of this stage. So any help in terms of liquidity can help projects grow and gain traction for the future.\nThe project is, basically, a request for liquidity that can have a positive effect so that more people migrate from Ethereum to Cardano through an apparently reliable medium such as Milkomeda. So it is clear that it can add value to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThe proponent describes two potential future problems and answers one of them satisfactorily.\nThe first problem is \"Ethereum users don't take advantage of the liquidity incentive\", and the answer says \"We think that with our connections, we can get enough users onboard\". While I don't doubt the veracity of this, I think there should be a solution in case this happens anyway.\nThe second problem is real, but the answer is satisfactory: this liquidity would only be an initial aid, a bootstrap. Then it will depend on the projects to retain that TVL.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Although, at this point, we all know about the technical capabilities and the seriousness of the members of dcSpark, I think they should not neglect important details when showing the links of the team members.\nThis space is made to make projects compete on equal terms and for the community to vote which of them will bring greater value to Cardano. Therefore, this oversight is sufficient justification to lower it one point in this category.\n \nDue to the vast experience that the team has in the development of projects within our ecosystem, it is expected that they know the type and number of team members they need to carry out the proposal.\n \nThe budget is very easy to understand in this project, so it makes sense that there is no breakdown.\n \nThe same happens with the timeline.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A roadmap with milestones is not provided. Maybe this makes sense because of the type of proposal. But one does not stop feeling that a greater effort was lacking when facing this field.\nAn example would be to list in more detail how you would contact your connections, what specifically you would offer them, how many of them would have to accept in a certain period of time for the project to be considered a success.\n \nThe problem is clear and the solution is clear. Given the long history of dcSpark and its members in our ecosystem, there should not be an auditability issue. But it is true that greater clarity and enumeration of the KPIs would help the entire community to follow the success of this company with greater confidence.

In this case, they are requesting funds in order to use them as liquidity for projects that will move from Ethereum to Cardano (via Milkomeda, the sidechain). The idea is to incentivize projects which would like to move to Cardano for lower fees and other benefits, but would be reluctant to do so, since we don\u2019t yet have liquidity on Milkomeda (and projects like AMM DEX\u2019s need that in order to function).\nIf this works, it would of course be a huge boost to the Cardano ecosystem. Every project that moves from Ethereum to Cardano is a big win. \nThe proposers identified two risks with this proposal: that Ethereum projects don\u2019t make use of this incentive (which is unlikely in my opinion) and that Ethereum users might just remove their own liquidity after the incentives dry up (this again seems unlikely, since if they decide to move to Cardano, they will want to function here long-term, they can\u2019t just move for a few incentives then go back to Ethereum).\nMy only concern here is that we are not given details of how the funds will be used exactly (what form these incentives will take). It would have been useful to have an idea of how many projects the requested amount can support, how they would be given these incentives etc.\nThis seems like a good idea, but I cannot score it a full 5, due to missing details on how exactly the funds will be used. Score: 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is no timeline provided, but that\u2019s understandable as this depends on when projects decide to port over to Cardano, which is not in dcSpark\u2019s control.\nThe budget is 90000 USD, which in my opinion is not even that much for what the proposers intend to do here. My only concern is that we don\u2019t have a clear action plan for how the incentives will be implemented and we don\u2019t have an idea of how many projects we can probably attract with this sum.\nRegarding the team, as mentioned in the beginning, the people behind this proposal are a company called dcSpark which is well known in the Cardano ecosystem. As a recommendation, I think it would be useful to always share a link to your site (https://www.dcspark.io/) so that voters can easily see who you are and maybe to list a few of your achievements, just to make it more convincing. dcSpark has worked on developing infrastructure for Milkomeda, so I believe they are very capable of implementing mechanisms to incentivize people to switch to Cardano from Ethereum, but again, I cannot score a perfect 5, because we are not informed of what form these incentives will take. Score: 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "For Auditability, as in other dcSpark proposals we are provided with very little information on how progress and success can be tracked. These basically rely on how many projects deploy on Cardano through Milkomeda that depend on liquidity availability. What would have been useful to see are some specific targets (like an estimation of how many projects can be incentivized to switch) and also to provide information on how we can verify how the incentives are used, how efficient they are in convincing a project to switch over etc. \nThis being said, dcSpark has worked on Milkomeda for a long time, and I think that the community can obtain the auditability information that we need from them if this proposal gets funded.
