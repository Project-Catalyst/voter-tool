While it is a commendable action, this idea simply does not fit into the challenge. By creating educational podcast would not help facilitate projects and dapps to migrate from ethereum to the Cardano network. This challenge is about creating a path for dapps from the account-style method to the UTXO method. I dont see any of your plans that might benefit or contribute to this campaign. I suggest that you try to submit your proposal in other challenge such as miscellaneous challenge that might fit with your proposals problem statement and solution should you try to reattempt to submit your proposal on the next funding. Therefore this proposal is not align with the challenge.  ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposer is a PhD student that has done some research in the past few years who also loves to educate people thru his podcast. With such passion, he might have the ability to successfully implement the the project. He also identifies the required manhours and resources needed to execute the plan where he requested the budget breakdown for his equipments. Most of the requested funds are for his tools to create content and also his living expenses which doesnt give much impact to the community as a whole especially in our pursuit of creating an easy transition for account-style method to UTXO. Furthermore, the budget allocation to service his cost of living is not sustainable. Try to develop a business model for your proposal in order for you to keep generating income from doing what you love. Moreover, the plan provided by the proposer also has no relation to creating or improving the process of the great migration. Should the proposer reattempt to submit another proposal in the next funding round, it is advised to choose a challenge that fits better with this project. In conclusion, I disagree that this proposal will be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "I find that this proposal lacks roadmap with milestones for achievement. Include a clear timeframe of your plan implementation for the community to audit your progress on your next proposal. Furthermore, the success metrics are not clearly defined. Creating content alone is not enough without the audience. On your next proposal, include how many people that you aim to reach and also within what timeframe. In addition, the proposer did not mention where the community can keep track of the progress. The proposer did provided with his website link so it is presumable that all of the progress will be recorded there. With the above assessment,I find that the information provided is not sufficient to be audited.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1321", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 4, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4900, "q0": "\"In this solution description, the proposer has defined clearly their current project's contents and strongly highlighted the positive impact and wish to make greater contribution to develop Cardano ecosystem. The writing style of the proposer is pretty easily understandable. However, in this part, this solution could be illustrated in a better and clearer way if the proposer can give more detailed explanations about how the project works technically and other functions and features of ADATOMS. \nThe demonstrations on how this solution addresses the challenge is explicitly clear as the proposer answers each and every question of the OSDE challenge. They somewhat proved that the project's values serve the community development, it is sustainable with top quality education, and also there are ways to collaborate with others. Yet, personally I think if the proposer can point out clearer and more detailed on how and how many developers, projects, artists, etc. would join in this project, then the persuasiveness is way stronger. As I have mentioned that the proposer answers questions belonging to OSDE challenge while somehow this proposal is classified as The Great Migration from Ethereum challenge. In this case, the proposal seems to having worked with EVM-based developers and projects and now wanting to build integration with Cardano. In order to fit more with the assigned challenge, the proposer could present the benefits of this new migration towards Cardano ecosystem. \nIn the foreseen risks, the proposer have stated clearly their current troubles and problems; however, it would gain more impact gradings if they could tell more on how the fund and aid from Cardano can help them solve out the problems and how it helps contribute and make the current situation of the project better. \"", "q0r": 3, "q1": "\"In the detailed timeline and plan provision part, the proposal has provided a great list of the products that they have done before, which is a good evidence for the feasibility of the future of the project. However, the list of already made products would be more suitable if put in the solution description or the auditability part in my opinion. In this part, so as to make it better, they should provide their plan to develop, widen and broaden the existing project; the planned methods and ways to collaborate with experts and other projects. They do mention the plan to have institutional collaborations in the future and it should be elaborated in a more detailed way such as which institution or university they would collaborate, by when in this year they would successfully gain that. A more explicit plan with specific tasks and time limit accordingly would create a more feasible proposal.\nOther than that, the proposer has shown a very strong passion for the project and yearn for contributing to the community, enhancing the education of science and finance for the community. \nThe budget breakdown is clear in term of its usage purpose. The proposer also expresses his longing for the fund and how it affects not only himself but the migration of Ethereum - Cardano and the impact on community from his project scale. Yet, the budget should be broken down intro smaller numbers for each spendings. For example, the 16000USD paid for his whole year expenses needs to be more specific and clarified in smaller unit of time such as PhD costs 7200$ per year (3600$ per semester).\nThe profile of this proposer is well-written with his list of experiences, degrees, research as well as connections and achievements in Cardano ecosystem, which all related to the implemetation of this project. \nIn general, the writing style of this proposal should be more formal and professional rather than a friendly spoken style in order to make it more persuasive, according to my point of view.\"", "q1r": 3, "q2": "\"The key metrics of this proposal is visible and easy to be measured as they are the number of lectures that the proposer can produce. The clarity of this proposal could be hightened if the proposer can add the time limit for those measurable results. For instance, 'Finishing the DeFi-ning Education! series (currently at chapter 4, still about 7 more to go)' in 3 months.\nThe success of this proposal is illustrated with a great confidence from the author. It is vividly clear but as the proposer is asking fund to improve the quality of the products as well (funding for better devices), the proposer could describe some more on the quality improvement of the products. Additionally, the author could illustrate more about the better collaborations with other experts or educational institutions in order to upgrade the project that create a bigger impact on community, or the success in the migration from Ethereum such as the numbers of users that will be beneficial to Cardano ecosystem. \nBesides, SDG rating adds a minor plus point to this proposal.\"", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1796", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5061, "q0": "The goal of F8: The Great Migration is to make it easier for developers and projects based in EVM to migrate to the Cardano Ecosystem.
