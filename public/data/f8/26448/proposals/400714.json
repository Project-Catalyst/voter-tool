There isn't much detail about Milkomeda, the current state of their work on Cardano interoperability or any other information that might be relevant. The proposal looks like a pre-first draft. Since this is the second batch, I would expect a lot more detail on the process and the results of the first batch. But there isn't even enough detail if this were proposal was for the first batch.\n\nThe funding is requested to teach startups Milkomeda environment but there is no information on how that would align with the challenge. From discussions within the community I've heard the team has been working on Cardano interoperability but they've been historically working on EVM based chains. On their website we see they have hit Cardano Limited Beta Mainnet and are about to do their Public Beta on Mainnet. \n\nSo the underlying product is very much in the space of Ethereum migration but the team has not made clear at all what type of outcomes can be expected, what benefits will projects experience, why/how Milkomeda makes migration from Etherum possible, why teams would prefer this setup etc. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "It is difficult to assess the feasibility of this proposal. There isn't any detail on the personnel, the work, the time or the budget. All we have available is the company name dcSpark. A visit to their website reveals a capable team of 30+. A former Co-VP of Engineering at Emurgo is a Co-founder and CTO, CEO Nick is a past Emurgo CTO and they have other members with Emurgo and IOHK experience. It looks like a competent team.

They could hypothetically accept and graduate startups on the same day. This is obviously not enough to measure the success of anything. Acceptance of 5 startups isn't even progress. It is the very beginning of the project. Graduation of 5 startups could be a good tracker if it was supported by some information on what the qualities of graduating startups would be. Under what conditions would a startup graduate? Could they fail to graduate? These are all relevant and missing from the proposal. \n\nThere are no specific deliverables presented. The only thing resembling it is how the proposers have outlined success for the project: \"Startups finishing the program and having a prototype\".

The proposal does not provide any budget breakdown. The proposal only stated the budget will be divided within startups into two chunks, depending on the completion of their KPIs.

The proposal also does not provide any personal information like background or past experience for any of the members.

I think that treating a 75k USD budget in such broad terms is definitely showing a lack of professionalism and a very red flag in my opinion in terms of the project\u2019s viability. \n\nA similar approach applies to the timeline, and we only know that a few weeks are needed to identify and filter startups, without any information on where there is a system behind this process. After identification of participants, 6 weeks would be necessary to deliver trainings, perform hands-on programming, mentorship, and technical support.

Although I know about dcSpark and Milkomedia track record (that they indeed do deliver and bringing EVM compatibility into Cardano), unfortunately the proposal isn\u2019t very well written. They didn\u2019t cover the reasoning behind why accelerator program is needed, other than they\u2019ve mentioned \u201cdApps adoption in Cardano is slow\u201d. Compared to Ethereum, dApps launching 5-6 months after its smart-contract upgrade with the new novel eUTxO architecture is considered rather normal or fast. Ethereum launched back in 2014, first dApp is MakerDAO in 2015, then it got hacked in 2016 and creating a hard-fork Ethereum Classic because of the dispute. DeFi in Ethereum only becomes mature in 2020-2021, so it took years to actually develop not only working dApp, but also a safe dApp on Ethereum. While on Cardano, it took around 5-6 months after its smart-contract upgrade, and it is already equipped with formally verifiable security within the smart-contract code using Haskell and Plutus. Again, this proposal could be better if they include the reason or metrics that they use, as to why they think that development in Cardano is hard or slow. E.g \u201cthe toolset is still not widely available, hence dcSpark creating a mentorship with expertise from dcSpark team to accelerate Cardano developers\u201d.

The budget, being the most important part (because Catalyst is a program to request funding), is missing in this proposal.
