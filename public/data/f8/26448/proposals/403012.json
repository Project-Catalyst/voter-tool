I can't quite agree that this is a good fit for the brief, but I'm willing to give a half-star for the benefit of the doubt.\n\nProposer would improve this score with me by addressing the \"Migration\" element of the challenge category's brief more clearly.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Two of the proposers have broad experience, the third somewhat less. The details of the plan for actually building the thing are somewhat vague, which is the way one would expect for a commercial venture as this appears to be.

There isn't much detail on the features in the proposal, but a look through additional documents gives us good information: \"GoingUP is professional networking platform for creators and builders in web3. We enable you to easily discover, connect, collaborate with diverse professionals in the space and we help you tract your interactions to build your reputation on-chain.\" There are also designs and a feature list available: a portfolio of past projects, discovery of DAOs, contributors, new projects, on chain reputation, badges and tokens. \n\nThe product the team wants to build solves a critical problem in decentralized coordination. It allows DAOs and decentralized communities to get work done, find new work and network. I believe it to be a worthwhile problem to solve. I don't believe it aligns well with the challenge however. The challenge's is about migrating users and developers from Ethereum to Cardano. The proposal does not mention how this project would accomplish that. \n\nThe proposal does state integration with Milkomeda and Cardano yet the website doesn't mention either. The MVP video shows Metamask integration working so we know the product is chain agnostic (it works with Ethereum and Cardano). That might help with challenge goals if there were some incentive built in to migrate users from EVM based chains to Cardano but no such thing is mentioned.\n\nThis proposal would be a better fit for DApps and Integrations challenge. As it stands, I don't see any alignment of the proposal with Ethereum Migration. It's a shame because I think this has great potential.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposal doesn't provide details on the features of the product. There is some information available on the website but it is more about the intention rather than specifics. There is a roadmap available on the proposal and on the website. The roadmap on the website marks mid March 2022 as an MVP launch and white paper release. Neither were available on their website, Discord or Twitter as of 22nd of March 2022. A short MVP video was made available after I asked on Discord (thank you proposers for the quick response). It only showed a Metamask integration (not a Cardano wallet) and basic website functionality. So nothing much to go on at this point.\n\nThe budget is lacking details. 75K has been set aside for developer work. How many engineers, what skills are necessary is not known. 15K is set aside for user base building. The remaining 35K USD is unaccounted for. The proposers don't mention how they will use this amount at all.\n\nThe team is made up of 3 people. It is an experienced, capable team bringing together business, design and technical backgrounds. But only one is a software developer and this is a highly technical project. It is a product with smart contract integrations that are non trivial. The software developer has experience in Solidity smart contracts but  The proposers will need extra support in building the product. They don't mention this as a challenge or give any plans as to how they'll implement their solution. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal doesn't provide clear deliverables. The roadmap is a guide towards what we can expect when but it's lacking specifics. We expect an Alpha Mid March and a Beta in April. What will be the difference we don't know. There will be \"Full integrations with sidechains Milkomeda & Cardano\" in May. What does that mean? Does that mean we can take payments in ADA? Does it mean we have NFTs as badges on Cardano? It's not clear. Nearly all targets in the roadmap are unclear in this way. In July we expect \"Creation of a new professional identity and reputation standard.\". In September: \"Development of on-chain professional identity infrastructure and smart contracts.\". What these mean are unclear to me as a software developer.

The Solution section is described in great technical detail. This provides an overview of how the project affects the potential audience in particular and the Cardano ecosystem community in general.\nThe solution proposed by the proposal is also very suitable for the Key metrics of the challenge because it helps attract more projects to join the Cardano community.

Due to the project not being live and only just started based on the roadmap and implementation provided this proposal is only somewhat aligned with the challenge brief that is looking to migrate existing DApps projects to the Cardano ecosystem.

It is hard to state with any confidence that the team understand the architecture required to implement what has been proposed and the trade offs they may be making for one decision over another.

It would have also been useful to compare with metrics from other competing solutions whether they are web 2.0 or web 3.0 solutions to help the assessor and community understand the bench marks in which the teams own KPIs are derived.
