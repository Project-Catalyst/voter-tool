However, I did find another proposal in Fund 8 already under development (Bring Bored Apes* to Cardano) which similarly addresses this problem from a different angle - the fractionalization of shares on cardano of cross-chain NFTs - specifically targeted towards \"investment grade assets\" like BAYC. \n\nAnd while this proposal states that a major success would be transition of an important (presumably high value) asset to cardano, the proposed solution lacks any clear incentive to promote that migration, other than to set up a token for this purpose in months 4-6, a time at which the project states that it might need another round of funding.\n\nOverall, great idea, however a more developed economic model detailing incentivized migration may help you to capture more attention at this stage.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "While this proposal does contain a breakdown of budget and timeline for delivery, the proposal also specifically mentions a lack of discovery as a major risk to success.  And while the proposer is clearly advertising for a vacant Community Manager role on the team, I would have felt more confident in the team's ability to deliver knowing that an experienced community builder was already identified and had contributed to the development of the feasibility.\n\nThis team might benefit from quickly identifying a potential team member to fill that vacancy to compliment their tech talent, or alternatively, consider joining forces with another team having a stronger grasp on commercial feasibility but lacking the necessary technical skills to develop/implement a useful tool such as the one proposed here.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The biggest risks that I perceived in the auditability of this proposal came from gap between your roadmap vs your own metrics for success.\n\nI do not believe that the road map alone provides a lot of substance for tracking progress in the early weeks, when development work should dominate the initiative.  The roadmap does not include a strategy or timeline for recruitment of the key team member you still need.  Also, the technical solution is based on smart contracts, but makes no mention of code or security audits, which I would think are of higher importance than audience growth in the initial phase.\n\nI don't think it would be fair to measure your success based on asset conversion rates at this early stage either.  A functioning product and interface with test user volume might be more important in delivering a solution to can achieve mass adoption later down the road.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1224", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "We\u2019ve had a bridge that can move ERC-20 token into Cardano native token, from SingularityNET (although it is still in development, and soon to be released). Now, this proposal will create a bridge but with NFT. The idea is, to use smart-contract feature to lock original NFT on Ethereum, and then re-mint it on Cardano with the same value. And it\u2019s also backward compatible, meaning you can re-mint it back to Ethereum blockchain. This idea and solution will solve the problem of this challenge, which is to migrate project from Ethereum to Cardano in a seamless way. They will also leverage Milkomedia technology, which is an EVM-sidechain compatibility infrastructure on Cardano. Considering the impact it will bring, this project is able to scale in the future.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal explains in detail about their implementation, from deploying a test-smart contract for the testnet with EVM-solidity (Milkomeda) alongside with Plutus smart contract, they\u2019ve also planning for reach out for the community engagement. This proposal have a clear roadmap in detail, from 1st month, to after 6th and 7th month. They\u2019ve allocated their budget for each person / role, and provide the detail. However, it would be more useful if the proposer also included expected work hour for each week, so the budget allocation could be justified (not overworked or underworked). For the team, they explained each position and person that will be working on this project, from developers (one of which is an SPO already on Cardano), and another open position for Community manager (to handle their shortcomings in marketing area). Overall, this project have a high chance of making it a success, given enough experience from the team and also the detailed proposal. Hence, I will give it a 5 star", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal have their roadmap explained in detail. A clear understandable description of the targeted problem, which is to make migrating NFT from Ethereum to Cardano easier, is also explained in detail. However, it would be better to set a target number of assets that is successfully converted into Cardano. That way, the community can indeed verify if the project met their goals or not. Since they\u2019ve mentioned that they will handle the marketing and community engagement, I\u2019m guessing that they will have Twitter for this project to update their progress for the public.

Is that the team is aware of endpoint to both chains where one locks up the NFT and the other mints it, and vice versa. However i do not see a clear technical description of how the team plan to achieve this. They do mention they have some experience in Plutus and EVM, but go on to talk about using Milkomedia and a single smart contract (is this per NFT?).

Allot of the time imo is spent of promotion, although i dont underestimate the need for good promotion. only one line item in 1 and 1-2 months regarding smart contract developemnt and testnet. I would have liked to see how they verify function of the smart contract (as in formally - when dealing with any value) or what their plan is here when talking about a smart contract for Ethereum and a minting mechanism for Cardano. Im lacking enough technical insight here to warrant a reasonable understanding of what they need todo. Further, in this mechanism they would need to trust some glue software that checks the EVM SC and then mints the CNFT.. i dont see this discussed and/or as an attack vector for security.

The timeline is reasonable with points broken down in month slots showing how the project will progress. The budget is also reasonable and presents a low risk to the fund budget.
