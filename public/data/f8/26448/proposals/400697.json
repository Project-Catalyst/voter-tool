This directly addresses the challenge setting \"The Great Migration (from Ethereum)\". The idea is impactful and aligns with the challenge setting, but this assessment assesses the proposal. The proposal is overall lacking fundamentals and the proposers are advised to look at other previous funded proposals in order to align their proposal with the successful ones. The core of the proposal is well aligned and impactful though so it will receive a generous rating of 4 stars in terms of impact.

The proposers are once again advised to refine this section completely in order to achieve credibility. The only credible (and in turn feasible) thing that the proposal have, is the team behind it. As its the proposal that is assessed, it will receive 2 stars in terms of feasibility.

It would be nice to work out how the idea of Bridge liquidity for top protocols will add value to the Cardano ecosystem and what impact it will have on the Cardano ecosystem. I would also like to see some KPIs that would be in align with outlined challenge settings.

The funding will not be owned by dcSpark and will stay in the protocol indefinitely. This proposal has the potential to help increase the TVL in under utilized protocols that are trying to get initial liquidity for them to function. As a result the execution of this proposal could help DApps that are migrating to Cardano from Ethereum have an extra boostrapping event to incentivise more people to use those protocols. The proposal could be effective at initiating the usage of top protocols based on EVM compatible chains to be used within Cardano.

However, you can find their information at https://www.dcspark.io/ which details the team information and the projects they are working on.

It is clear the proposal team can execute against this proposal and have the existing network connections to both find and reach out to suitable contenders for those that could receive the $10k incentive.

It would have been useful to identity which projects they are referring to. It also would have been beneficial to consider how they will determine whether that $10k incentive made a different in terms of bootstrapping some of these protocols to get adoption in the Cardano ecosystem. As an example they could have suggested tracking some of the information before or after or between other protocols with different TVL amounts and reported on the impact of this proposal. Finally it would have also been good to see the proposers allocate some budget for either themselves or someone else to have capacity to better report the success of this proposal to the community so it can be more effectively audited.
