The proposal would be improved by explaining more of the technical plan, but given there is already another similar application, it's hard to deduct any points for this.  I wish there was a clearer story about how the requested ~$70k will pay the creator, but it also seems that he must have a plan for that.  I like that most of the allocated rewards are going right into the protocol for incentivizing people to learn on Milkomeda + Cardano.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Very clear objective ways of seeing results, on themes aligned with the spirit of the challenge category.

Milkomeda is already helping bridge Ethereum and Cardano users. The tipbot would be super effective incentivizing Ethereum users to first bridge to milkomeda and then learn more about the Cardano ecosystem. I myself, would be interested in learning even more about the milkomeda blockchain and how it compares to Ethereum. If addressed effectively and there can be a big audience for this TipGenius, we could see huge amounts of Ethereum users migrate over and normalize bridging between ecosystems. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the experience of the team, there is a high chance that this will be able to come to fruition. The founder of TipGenius has created this proposal so that he can give these funds to the community. I like seeing this because lots of the fund that could be given to this proposal is going to be distributed to the community. This is what we like to see in the Cardano Ecosystem.

I like reading through the fund breakdown because it shows where the potential funds are going to be used. As I explained earlier, it will be successful to audit because they will be giving the funds to the community members who are learning more about different projects built on Cardano and Milkomeda and ultimately to gain a greater audience. This could be a lot of Ethereum users, and others that like Cardano, but have never heard of Milkomeda. For this reason, I give this section a 5 out of 5 stars.

Proposer has provided features of the solution and given examples to make it easier for people to visualize the project.

This proposal will work mainly with Milkomedia protocol, that provides EVM compatibility into Cardano.

It could be better if the proposer could explain how Tip audit costs can costs for $3000, breaking down in detail could give us an idea how the budget will be used. At a glance, $25 for one tip seems a lot, but actually fair considering that every bite-sized tip will consist of video and complimentary description about the tip. In terms of feasibility, one person with technical knowledge to handle creating these tips will be sufficient. This proposal could be a 4 to 5 star if they\u2019ve broken down the budget allocation for the Ada incentives, e.g how much will the users get when learning a certain tip?

The idea behind the tips are to reward participation and education of people using the DApp protocols. The value of being able to provide information at the point of usage of DApps is clear and could present a good learning opportunity for those that are new to these applications. However, with the usage of tips in the learning process the proposer has introduced an incentive for people to create multiple accounts and abuse this system. Especially if this tip system rewards people for simple tasks. The proposer does not mention the identification methods or concerns of multiple fake accounts (sybil resistance) with bad intent. Considering the importance of the incentive system and how it is applied this makes it difficult to give confidence that this system will produce the right outcomes without further information and evidence. The concept itself of applying tips to the site as a tool that these applications can use makes a lot of sense - perhaps that being suggested to these applications to integrate is all that's needed. The user already has some incentives to understand the protocols they are trying to use if they are going to interact with a DeFi protocol that gives them value (either via swapping / farming etc). There is great opportunity with the concepts outlined in this proposal but the finer details, incentives and identity behind it require sufficient through and evidence to produce a high confidence on the impact it will have. The proposer does not mention the risks of identity and multiple accounts in the proposal risks section which is something else that can be addressed in future proposals.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer outlines a roadmap of the number of tips that will be added to the different projects. It would have been beneficial for the proposer to go into more detail for the 'Implementation of incentivized learning program infrastructure' as this is the most significant part of the proposal in terms of execution and likely complexity. The website and functionality for the service already exists for some previous products which helps provide evidence that the team is able to execute on a technical level. The proposer also states they were part of the Plutus pioneers program. The proposer would have benefited from sharing more professional background such as a LinkedIn profile and also any repositories that showcase their Plutus development skills.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Number of tips created, total number of users educated and number of wallets that received incentives payouts that are still active after 6 months were provided as KPIs.
