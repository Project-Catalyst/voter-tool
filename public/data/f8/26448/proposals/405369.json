", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team has a clear track record and impressive results in their track record, I completely think they will be able to handle the project, my main concern is about budget, even though there is no specific limit to how much you can ask, you are asking for 20% of the challenge\u00b4s budget and voters sometimes dislike that. For future reference I would suggest splitting the proposal in parts or phases, even narrowing it down to its basic functions.

NFTify is a no-coding NFT marketplace builder platform; Cardano integration with NFTify aims to help anyone launch their NFT marketplace within minutes, get more transactions, and generate NFT generation on the Cardano chain. This will help promote the chain users and its adoption among NFT creators.\nI found that the proposer gave very detailed, clear descriptions of the solutions to solve the challenging problem. It integrates a Cardano-based NFT marketplace building platform to empower all NFT creators with all the tools they need to establish their own brand in 3 easy steps; and sell NFT quickly, completely free, non-technical, and customizable. It's been widely promoted during community events and, more recently, the upcoming Blockchain Expo in Japan in May 2022. In addition, they will be announcing the forthcoming Cardano chain integration with NFTify and educating existing NFT creators/projects on the Cardano chain also participated in the event to open a store on NFTify.\nEvery launched project cannot ignore the threats and challenges encountered. In this proposal, the proposer presented some risks and ways of mitigating them in very detailed, clear, logical arguments. Competitor risk. The challenge of converting users, limited development resources, and limited business development resources.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer presented a detailed plan with a product roadmap and clear user development milestones and specific goals. The budget of this proposal is 20% of the total budget for Challenge; all expenditures are detailed and explained: $30,000 for the Cardano chain integration into NFTify; $70,000 for Marketing & Business Development. Reading the team members' information, I see that they are all people with long experience in the field of blockchain, information technology, and software development... I checked their identity efficiently through Linkedin.com. However, I have not seen the proposer mention their achievements, and there is no specific job assignment for each person. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This is a brand new project that has never been funded before in Catalyst. Auditing is a crucial part of evaluating the project's success. With this proposal, the proposer came up with a KPI for the number of registered stores and stores with sales of more than $1,000 per quarter, easy to measure, easy to check. All activities are publicized to the community through the project's blog and Youtube channel. All stores created and transaction volumes on Cardano chain data can be shared in the Cardano NFT community monthly and quarterly. \nThe project has been successfully experimented with, and the proposal's success is easily determined. NFTify was established in July 2021. Currently, NFTify supports the Ethereum network, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon, attracting nearly 10,000 users. The success of this proposal is to promote the NFT application in the Japanese market generally and particularly in the Cardano community. Besides, gain awareness after integrating with Cardano and Blockchain expo and see a significant increase in the number of registered NFT stores from Japan; 20% of the new stores created on NFTify by 2022 belong to the Cardano chain. I am confident that this proposal will succeed and thereby contribute to the sustainable development of the Cardano ecosystem.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1631", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4222, "q0": "This proposal is fantastic and adequately meets the challenge objectives because it seeks to integrate Cardano to NFTify - a no-coding NFT marketplace builder platform that enables anyone to start their own NFT marketplace in minutes. This could be a solution to the problem of a lack of an NFT marketplace builder platform that integrates Cardano to assist in the rapid launch of new Cardano-based NFT projects. To make the problem more explicit, more detail regarding the problem statement and more examples would have been beneficial. This project was both interesting and necessary, in my point of view. We can learn about the details that relate to the most fundamental aspect of the project. Three simple steps are well-described for anyone to create their own NFT branding.The proposal clearly articulates how it would provide value to the Cardano ecosystem, who will benefit from it, and why it is vital. The proposal's key metrics correspond to the challenge settings. In my opinion, the project will do wonders for the development of the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The budget is clearly laid out and divided down into identifiable items. I believe it is reasonable to meet the given goals and reasonable for the current salary of each respective role. It does not, however, specify how much the item would cost. It would be useful if they could provide more specifics, such as the cost of Community events/sponsor NFT events to announce Cardano chain integration in two key markets, the United States and Japan. The team planned to spend $20,000 on each market, but to the best of my knowledge, the currency values in these two countries do not match. I'd recommend specifying the pricing of this field separately. On the positive side, the proposal includes a reasonable timeframe for completing the work. It outlines the development steps, allowing us to view a precise, implementable strategy. Very professional and transparent attitude. The team is extremely experienced, and the proposal included a lot of necessary evidence to validate the expertise, such as experience data and work references. Furthermore, the team has been involved in the catalyst ecosystem for a long time. The proposing team was also conscious of the project's threats and challenges, and they came up with alternative ways to verify it, in a well-explained and thoughtful manner.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team presents a relevant roadmap and asks for a reasonable budget. Even though the road map is not presented in a typical manner, it is possible to understand how this proposal will be implemented, and since everything will be posted on \"Sprint releases,\" which is their platform's way of communicating feature updates, it is completely possible for the community to track what's being done and to follow up with the progress. The success definition, if specific, with a goal of 20 percent of newly formed retailers on NFTify in 2022 being on the Cardano chain, is completely fine.

Since this proposal has come with the aim of integrating their existing product to Cardano in order to build a stonger ecosystem, which has been stated clearly at the first place, their solution illustration is the presentation of their platform with highlights in their advantages and convenient features. The illustration is quite informative with complete list of steps, functions an how their product operates and that helps a lot in achieving the persuasiveness for the proposal.\nThe proposer has proved their proposal impact when describing how the integration between NFTify and Cardano profits the ecosystem. In addition, they even give out some metrics and some ways to measure the effectiveness of their product. When mentioning the 10,000 creators using their platform, they are indirectly showing a key metric that serves the purpose of this challenge as they are the number of people that Cardano can gain advantage from. Plus, when they engage the blockchain Expo event in Japan into their plan, it is a proof for their planned marketing method.\nAnother merit of this proposal is that after demonstrating each foreseen risk or challenge, they immediately show a clearer explanation on how they would cope with those risks.\nApart from the aforementioned strengths, as this proposal is classified with The Great Migration from Ethereum challenge, I see very little link and desciption on how their solution address this challenge. It could be better if they can accent that connections to the main purpose of the challenge. Otherwise, I can see that this proposal more align with the Dapps and Integrations challenge. If this is the case, then my grade for this proposal's impact is 5. \"", "q0r": 4, "q1": "\"The proposers seem to have a lot of experiences in the field as long as a long-term roadmap for their product as the key deliverables are extremely clear. Besides, they also have impressive KPIs for user growth milestones for the whole 2022 year, which shows that this team is quite professional team. The budget breakdown is divided distinctly and coherently with their proposed solution since it is separated into budget for development the integration and budget for marketing and business development. As what I can see in their proposal, I understand that they are proposing solution and asking budget for a period of roughly 3 months, if I'm not mistaken; however, in my opinion, they could clarify the specific amount of time that they request fund. The user growth roadmap counts till the end of 2022, while the product roadmap and the budget seems to count up to the end of Q2 2022. This is just a minor thing that I believe they can do to make their proposal better but it does not much affect the content or the feasibility of the project. \nTheir team members' profile is demonstrated quite competently as they all have a prolonged experiences in the field; plus, they are seemingly to be a wholesome team with each individual be in charge of a specific role and position contributing to the implementation of the project.Still, their competence could be proved more and they can heighten their proposal's persuasiveness if they can provide some more details about the skills, or the outstanding products that their teammates possess. \"", "q1r": 5, "q2": "\"In this part, this team of proposers have purportedly built an system to update publicly all of their product's results and progression in particular time of the year; hence, they can apply the same way to report all of their development progress on Cardano integration.
