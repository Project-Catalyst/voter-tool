This is done by series of guides and consultancy session. The Great Migration challenge goal is to make it easy for DApps to move from Ethereum to Cardano. While the proposal consultancy service and guides aims to on board these projects both inside and outside Cardano, the 20-25 projects throughout the project is limited impact compared to the scope of this challenge. Also the proposal falls short on explaining how they could identify the unreleased and under development projects in ETH. This segment is their focus market but they offer very limited information on how to locate these projects and convince them.

Also It is not logical that success after 3 months and 6 months contain the same number of audience reached by the guides ( audience of thousands). By the conclusion of project, they expect 20-25 projects will book their free consultancy service with 5-10 onboarded by migrating to Cardano. This signifies that the project impact is limited and the project lacks in scalability. The proposal will improve if it could provide consistent information and can include more concrete auditability like feedback gathering from migrating projects so it could make a case that their consultancy project can have positively and meaningful impact.

However, from an artist or NFT creator perspective, how can these characteristics be easy to understand? This is one of the aspects that this challenge addresses and this project describes. The main problem to solve is how to generate interest of artists and developers planning to release NFT projects on Ethereum to have the migration to Cardano. The way this proposal communicates the solution in two parts: 1. By delivering a series of guides based on interactive infographics and text content. 2. One-on-one consultancy sessions with NFT creators and developers. The sessions provided will cover topics according to the inquiries and needs of each project or situation. This means, that the members who will be assessing the sessions have to demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge according to the need of the requesters. The team also provides a list of several potential topics and subjects to be implemented or assessed during the sessions, as a guidance for project content. I personally consider that the metrics and goals of this proposal is aligned with the purpose of this challenge. The focus will be attracting the unreleased, in development project from ETH to Cardano. In addition, they are planning on offering free consultation and information about the advantages of Cardano over Ethereum to already existing projects that are created on the ETH chain, which allow to scale future challenges for crypto bridging experiences. \nScore given: 5 \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "FEASIBILITY:\nAt this phase, the proposers offer plenty of evidence, experience and references based on the professional skills that are needed to demonstrate the correct implementation of the proposal in evaluation. All the LinkedIn and Twitter links are verifiable, describe the team professional abilities, and have online public access. In my opinion, the team possess vast experience related to the NFT ecosystem and interaction with Cardano and involvement with Project Catalyst. Also, they have previously assessed consultation and shared their experience with different NFT projects, to assist on the improvement and success of the NFT community in Cardano. In addition, they offer an implementation plan with different areas that will be addressed in the process (such as: market research, guides, marketing, consultancy sessions, presentation, and marketing results). On the other hand, the budget is outlined and broken down into identifiable elements. They specify the activities, topics, and rate costs according to the hours invested. I believe that the budget required is reasonable to achieve the goals in an adequate manner. In addition, they have provided previous proposals the team have been part of. I can observe that the proposers have been progressing in the way they describe the information and how they organize the content and links. This demonstrates the willingness for improvement and the sense of collaborating with the Catalyst ecosystem. Finally, the proposers clearly explain into detail all the technical aspects, language and technological to take into consideration when implementing the process. They offer topics that can be discussed and addresses when providing consultation, the time and aspects that will be considered when creating the content for the website and guidance for NFT projects, available links and references from their experience as professionals and previous projects and collaborations that have taken place. This presents a clear idea of how involved the team is and the time, they have invested in helping for the Cardano ecosystem growth. \nScore given: 5\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "AUDITIBILITY:\nThe way they will assess the progress and provide evidence will be through a public GitHub site that will show the latest standards of the project implementation. As well as the NFT Guild compensation and assessment will be viewable for verification on this site. In addition, the NFT project assessments will be tracked, according to the weekly progress. The community members and public in general could corroborate the project process on the discord account linked to this proposal. The roadmap has a time horizon, with specifics explained in the feasibility phase (based on the information of gathering phase and specification phase). These metrics also identify the potential success of the proposal, as well as, all the links provided from the team professional skills, previous works, consultations and NFT experience within the Cardano ecosystem and Catalyst project involvement. Moreover, the discord account (which hosts 176 members), offers diverse information about the NFT Guild project, and community interaction the team has created throughout the process. Finally, this proposal is a vehicle for \u201cNFT Verification Tool\u201d, which offers more validity to the solution that addresses this proposal. I believe that the team delivers sufficient ways to measure the progress of the implementation process from the website update, Git Hub public site, discord channel, links and references attached. It does successfully address the challenge of providing tools for educational content, advantages, and easy ways to understand why Cardano is a great technological blockchain for NFT project creation and crypto interaction. \nScore given: 5\n\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1557", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4085, "q0": "This proposal idea is providing 1 on 1 consultancy & onboarding sessions for in-development ETH NFT projects supported by a series of comprehensive & appealing guides and through that getting the interest of artists & developers planning to release NFT projects on ETH and onboard them smoothly to Cardano.

A lack of interest from projects to engage in exploring and considering Cardano as a viable blockchain to launch on is going to be a real challenge for this project and I\u2019m glad to see they at least have an idea of a solution for it.
