It tries to address it in a more indirect way, by tackling a supposed general information vacuum surrounding Cardano/Catalyst.  \nThe real barrier for migration might be of a technical nature. \nEffectively, the proposers suggest that the Migration can be facilitated if the Ethereum projects \"have information, support and direction by the [Cardano] community for a more efficient onboarding\". While, I do not dispute that these three components are important, I think that this proposing team did not tackle the main gist of the Challenge sufficiently well. \nThe Challenge even specifies that the metrics can be improved by \"funding projects that directly deploy something, or projects that help build tooling to make it easier to deploy\". This is not part of this proposal. \nThe challenge has a metric: \"Number of projects that migrate\" and \"Number of users of these smart contracts once migrated to the Cardano ecosystem\"\nThis proposal does envisage helping an estimated 20 potential projects, but does not specify that these are projects \"that migrate\". It may seem a detail, but its a crucial detail for this challenge. \nHelping to overcome the technical difficulties of transfering from ETH to Cardano is not directly addressed. \nThe challenge itself specifies that many technical solutions are being deployed to accomplish this Migration such as KEVM, IELE, ERC20 Converter and Milkomeda to name a few. The team behind this proposal does not claim to have knowledge of these bridge solutions. \nThese projects - KEVM, IELE, ERC20 Converter and Milkomeda - are key for transfering technical projects from Ethereum  to Cardano and any team that proposes to \"provide information, support and direction\" - would benefit from in-depth familiarity with KEVM, IELE, ERC20 Converter and Milkomeda - IN ADDITION to being familiar with Cardano's general inbuilt advantages (PoS, energy efficiency, Catalyst etc.). \nWithout Solidity and Plutus experts and detailed familiarity with the technical transfer from an EVM-based blockchain, I see only limited benefit from general information, support and direction by the [Cardano] community. My assessment is that the impact will be limited, as the proposal currently stands. \nThe team does specify that it will guide newcomers through available solutions - however I didn't see the technical capacity inside this proposal and relying for this support on \"coordination with IOG tech teams\" seems a suboptimal solution, for a proposal in this challenge.  \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I think that this proposal as it currently stands - from afar appears to be feasible but this is partly due to its vagueness in some aspects, making it partly feasible through lack of specificity.  \nThe team has proven competencies regarding the types of general deliverables that it intends to provide. The general idea is to research and develop a model to onboard newcomers and evaluate what makes a a successful onboarding process. \nThe proposal has a realistic timetable and I think the budget breakdown is acceptable. I question the estimate of 20 potential projects listed in the budget: \"USD 19780 for estimated over 20 potential projects represent less than USD1000 per project\" \nWhere did this estimate come from and what is a \"potential project? \nThe proposal lists a lot of activities geared towards \"New members\". The proposal also states that it wants to \"use the Cardano4Climate community, network to the catalyst & Cardano ecosystem, and projects in order to build a model for onboarding new members through a catalyst active community.\"\nA weakness - in my eyes - is that \"New Members\" is effectively an undefined category that seems like an umbrella grouping that encompasses \"newcomers\". By addressing \"New Members\" I see a danger that the proposal's criteria for \"members\"/\"projects\"/\"newcomers\" are very loose. It seems this gives the proposer freedom to classify anyone in this category of \"New Member\". I am not suggesting that this is the intention of the proposer, but this vague language has left too much room for interpretation. \nWhat is a New Member? A project that has definitely decided to migrate to Cardano from Ethereum and is making the transfer? Or is it a project that explores the possibility of migrating? Or is it a single ETH developer interested in the Cardano ecosystem and a new member of Catalyst, but not building anything on Cardano? Many possibilities spring to mind. \nThe project has a goal is onboarding at least one project per month - however, many projects are being onboarded into Cardano at the moment. Does this mean a project from another blockchain? A project that is migrating or \"just visiting the onboarding sessions\"?\nIf the proposal is resubmitted in a future fund, I think the plan could be more ambitious and daring, by actively searching for EVM-based projects and addressing/targetting them directly, even before they consider a move. \nThis proposal starts from a new members (again - what is a new member?) survey - which supposedly means that it targets projects that have decided to make the leap or are toying with the idea... \"Understand how they got to Cardano, Catalyst and Cardano4Climate.\" Maybe a survey of Ethereum projects not wishing to migrate would be equally useful? \nIf this proposal is not voted in, I would suggest to the team to identify potential candidate projects in other blockchain ecosystems and to develop a pitch and to approach them directly. Also possibly publish criteria how would you approach and convince an EVM-based project to migrate, which might be a complementary approach to waiting for newcomers to arrive. \nThe proposing team has a lot of members with non-blockchain developer/technical capacity, but would probably benefit from having the technical know-how to support Ethereum Developers (account based blockchain model) in order to transfer to a eUXTO-based transaction model on Cardano. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This project is on the surface seemingly easily auditable, but improvements could be suggested to make the auditability better and the result clearer - the clarity seems to be fuzzy. Usually imprecise language seemingly allows for a big picture auditability, but the end result may prove to be too blurry to benefit Cardano. \nThe team proposes to deliver a knowledge center with research, docs, ppt focus on the Great Migration. This seems to vague, in my opinion. I would like to know what will exactly be delivered in the Deliverables and KPis - for the funding. \"Research, docs, ppts\" - is simply listing words that have no specific weight. \nPromotional materials - is also something that I see as a very generic deliverable and seems to be lacking in auditability. Anything can be deemed a \"Promotional material\". \nThe 24 \"one on one meetings with projects\" would probably be better and easier to audit if we could know what classifies as a \"project\" for the purposes of this proposal. Why not publish the names of some projects that you see as candidates for this proposal, right now?\nIn general, I would advise a more coherent vision, a tighter ship and a better focus on ensuring Migration of specific projects. \nIf this proposal were to facilitate the definite Migration of five existing EVM projects to Cardano - that would be a success. \nI am not sure what does \"The goal is onboarding at least one project per month\" mean? What is onboarding specifically?  Is it a project that has definitely migrated to Cardano, or a project that was a newcomer to Cardano before this proposal and attends the sessions with the proposers? Or is it a project that has gone through the Meetups & session management (regardless of the end outcome/migration). \nThe problem statement starts from a point of view that addresses projects that want to migrate \"For projects that want to migrate, they need to have information, support and direction by the community for a more efficient onboarding\". However, projects that want to migrate have probably made the decision already. \nHence, I would advise the proposers to think about expanding the problem statement to additionally address those projects that haven't considered the move yet - in case the proposal is not funded in this Fund. Attracting \"non-newcomers\" to make the leap, might be an even greater prize. \nThe commitment to transparency is laudable and the availability of communication channels is excellent. The presence in Catalyst is exemplary and the recording of meetings and educational support seems commendable. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_35", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "On one hand, this proposer is correct that projects and users migrating from Ethereum to Cardano will need \"information, support and direction\" from active community members.
