It's a tough call, but I'm downgrading by one star for this consideration.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The size of the proposal text and many details do strongly suggest that the writers of the proposal have a plan that will be executable.\n\nBecause there are no explicit links to any references about the proposers, I'm not able to feel strongly in agreement with the success being \"highly likely\".", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of progress and success on this is less granular than I'd prefer, depending quite strongly on essential progress-reporting.

To compare with existing platforms in the physical art world, Masterworks has already become a popular domain for fractionalized ownership of paintings.  And as the NFT industry expands, this proposal presents a modern solution that will add value by promoting liquidity to collectors through a distributed ownership model.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal appears to address most of the core elements that would be required for successful delivery. \n\nWhile I lack the technical capability to evaluate the development complexity of this kind of project, my experience hiring UI/UX teams helps me understand that the budget requested is a reasonable reflection of the timeline/manpower/workload presented, especially since project initiation was self-funded by the team, and it the team has also articulated a plan to continue later phases beyond the immediate scope of work (i.e. self-funding or externally funded).\n\nI believe one major hurdle for a successful implementation of this project will be designing a governance system that both supports the complex world of fractionalized ownership and is easy/fun to use.  The proposal may benefit from including more details about how such a governance system would operate, at least as a framework or with references to how other existing platforms have tackled this.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "With an organized roadmap, implementation of task scheduling tools, and a detailed vision for short/long-term success, the proposer has presented a clear basis for measuring achievements as they are relevant to this proposal.\n\nThe proposers have also detailed their history of involvement in Catalyst community contributions, long-term holding positions, and participation in a number of other proposals (both successful and unsuccessful).

As an example they mention bringing Bored Apes NFT community to the ecosystem. This functionality would provide a new use case within the Cardano ecosystem and as such could produce a large impact for certain NFT projects that migrate to the Cardano ecosystem.

Risks for the project are very well described and covered. The proposers did not provide any links to Github repositories or their professional profiles such as LinkedIn to give further confidence that they are able to execute the proposal. In future proposals it would be great to see more information just to verify the team is fully capable of executing the proposal - some indication has been given with the information provided and collaboration however more sources would provide better evidence for a high chance of feasibility", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A roadmap of phases with each deliverable is provided. In the attachments there is a breakdown of the hours and labour costs to justify the budget. The KPIs focus on the deliverables of the project and mention 'High value NFT' market using this proposals execution as a core focus point. It would have been good for the proposers to mention which projects fit into this category to understand what the addressable market would be and then the comparisons of what penetration of that market would make this a good return on investment for the community. The KPIs against the roadmap seem achievable and the proposal offers plenty of clarity behind their intentions and show a good understanding of the market.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_758", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "A multi-chain web3 platform giving ADA hodlers the scope to trade shares of investment-grade EVM NFT assets directly on the Cardano network.", "experience": "Team includes: Senior Information Security Systems Officer w/ Cyber Warfare Technology and techniques.\nActive traders - all currencies since 2015.
