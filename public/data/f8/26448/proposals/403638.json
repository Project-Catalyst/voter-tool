Still, the idea is unique and clever and shouldn't be casually written off.

He could certainly create the quality caricatures for the community. His asking price is fair, if not modest. There is strong reason to believe this project would be implemented successfully, and he would deliver on precisely what he's offering. The net effect of his work as it relates to the challenge is where things get a little fuzzier, but this is a question more appropriate for the auditability section...", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The challenge is looking for KPIs in the form of number of projects and users who migrate from Ethereum to Cardano. The KPIs and goals described by this proposal are a number of cariactures produced, paired with posts on social media. This doesn't quite synch. It's possible that Mr. Cohen's work could compel people to leave Ethereum for Cardano, but there's no real way to measure this. So unfortunately I can't honestly say that this proposal is appropriately auditable. Mr. Cohen should pursue opportunities in the future to contribute to marketing-oriented challenges when they arise. Perhaps a big single proposal, with caricatures on a collection of different themes such as this one, might be more appropriate.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1275", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1748, "q0": "Proposal with the idea of creating a caricature showing the advantages and relevance of Cardano compared to Ethereum, reaching the Ethereum community.

As long as it is done with good will and good taste\u2014there is a danger that caricatures are misinterpreted as ill-will in the Ethereum community\u2014this is a proposal that has the potential of creating viral sensations.\n\nOf course, the internet is unpredictable and virality is impossible to predict or pre-build. Even so, I would say the proposers are too modest saying, \u201cnumber of viewers is difficult to estimate, but we foresee to pass a million impressions overall, 100s sharing on social networks\u201d.  With a sheer $10,500 total budget, this is the simplest, inexpensive and potentially most influential media campaign I\u2019ve ever come across.\n\n12 weeks and 12 NFTs. The proposers point out that each successfully sold NFT could allow the campaign to continue a little longer. If only one person can own the original while copies are being circulated all over the social media for a week by tens of thousands of Cardano fans\u2026 just imagine the spread and imagine the auction prices for those originals!

Although Mr Cohen is the only one who could even conceptualize an approach like this, let alone draw it, I appreciate the fact that he is ready to tap into the wisdom of the crowds and develop the storyline and details together with the community. He understands and underlines the fact that the generated interest needs to be channeled correctly to be used as a force for good.\n\nPeople who come to Cardano as the result of seeing the caricatures/cartoons, need to be welcomed with open hearts and open minds in the right channels, at the right time. These channels will be in the social media messaging, on his website and in a brief outlined for the press. With all this understanding packed in a concise proposal, this is a very strong approach. Since Mr Cohen charges only $500 per drawing, the budget remains low and in fact already includes some money for the media and social media marketing required.\n\nThe only thing to improve would be to more clearly explain the role of Mr Assaf Liran. It is mentioned he is an online marketing specialist so I guess it\u2019s safe to assume that he will be responsible for spreading the message.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The plan is as clear and detailed as the proposers want it to be. It is intentional that they have left some room for community brainstorming. They are ready to listen to the community to finalize the plan, themes and storyline for the cartoons.

And in this case an idea that would lead Ethereum users to understand what they are missing by not using Cardano.\n \nThe proposer only lists some topics that he could cover in his comics and that he could receive help from the community.
