What sets this proposal apart from others and thereby unique is the utilisation of key principles of Cardano in encouraging others to move over, not as token projects but as creative individuals & their followers who may want to seek a better ecosystem. This is a very novel way of looking at things and as the proposer described, was bourne out of a real-life necessity. The proposer intelligently locked on Cardano's key characteristics of security, low transaction fees and their promise of better authentication and validation which is critical to every artist. It reads very compellingly. Granted there are so many aspects that could occur in the industry that could dampen their solution's impact (competitor, etc) but the NFT space is large enough for a few solutions and it will grow larger still. I completely agree that despite not using a 'converter' this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. The only improvement I could suggest is the possible mention of their AI/ML solution being applicable to other NFTs besides visual art. We're now seeing a proliferation of vids, animation, music, real estate, etc but I'm sure if this version 1.0 proceeds to completion, it would be an area this team can focus on.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal and the solution are very clearly described and the team behind this project presents their aligned credentials and even provided links to their profiles.

As a former assessor of tenders for a university, these are highlights in a proposal that makes recommending a team easy. Achieving their work goals for the last two months also gives confidence that the budget described is on point. It is also an added bonus that they described the results of the proof of concept as it paints a picture of the chances for success which is high. I have no doubt this team will succeed in building the AI/ML to the desired standard and I can see the main challenge is the encouragement of artists to move across to Cardano and for that, I wish them luck.

The KPIs presented are in keeping with their goals and could be easily published to the community after each achievement. Where this proposal could have improved and gained a five-star rating is with the publication of social channels or code repo where readers can easily follow the project whilst reading it. I've read the proposal more than three times to make sure I didn't miss these details but sure enough, other than linkedin urls and news articles, there were no social channels included. It is recognised that the VeraNFT site is part of the build and would not be available until months later but at least securing this domain would have added to the bona fides of this proposal. As it is, readers are asked to trust the information as presented and whilst I strongly believe in this proposal and its goals and credentials,  providing channels to ensure the leap of faith the voter is asked to make is not too far, will always be an advantage.

This means that following a 1 - 2 hours of strategy implementation with a (more expensive) social media manager, we'll still have close to a full week of work (or rather 1/8 of a week of work, for eight weeks). I've also budgeted $5k for my project management efforts, and some of that time will be spent assisting the social media coordinator and the CNFT artist liaison. \n\nI do realize a lot of money is being asked for and allocated to back-end development of the project, but this is a highly technical solution our lead dev will be working on full-time for 9 months, with the help of an additional data scientist/back-end developer working on the project part-time.
