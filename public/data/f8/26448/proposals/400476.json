The chosen metrics look very good as well, reflecting forethought that is HIGHLY likely to influence the project's design in the direction of success.\n\nWhen considering between 4 and 5 stars, I am considering the strength of the technical plan, which is not very clearly described.  I might take off a half-point for that, taken in isolation.  This is an improvement area for the proposers, and alone this wouldn't detract from a strong-agree rating.  \n\nNot having identified any technical risk seems it could either be overconfidence or \"they've already made strong progress and don't feel risk\".  The budgets also seem very modest.  Their thoughtfully expressed strategy goes into the mix here too.  Taken together, these 4 factors make me think that this is an iteration (to \"Website V2\", as they say) that won't cost a great deal, that they can continue to iterate on - not much interesting that might be said about it.  \n\nTough call, but I'm falling on the side of this being highly likely a success!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Great metrics, a clear sense of going for objectives that are relevant and directly in service of the mission-brief.  Yes sir.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1139", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 0, "ng": 9, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5827, "q0": "The Mint City team has identified that NFT projects in Ethereum are struggling with the high gas costs and a saturated marketplace. They have created an easy-to-use solution that is especially attractive to some fairly new Ethereum-based projects who are past the initial change resistance. What the team fails to mention is that usually passionate artists and entrepreneurs don\u2019t want to bother with anything extra: they just want to create (and get paid for it). I would say this is the actual challenge the team is solving: making things easy.\n\nJust a glance at their website (https://mintcity.app/) is enough to convince me that these guys mean business! And they want to make the business easy for the creators. Right now the website is nothing but a front page with marketing talk. But as part of this proposal the team wishes to build a functioning Website through which automated project intake becomes possible. All in all, this proposal is exactly what is being asked in the challenge: a gateway to migrate.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This is a strong no-nonsense proposal developed by a highly capable team who have relevant experience and prior achievements. See, these guys are not at it the first time. Four of them already have a somewhat successful Cardano NFT project CryptoPetz in their resum\u00e9s and Bart is a development reinforcement from the Netherlands. Although I haven\u2019t been able to take a look \u201cunder the hood\u201d, it seems the team is doing an exceptionally good job in making NFT minting easy and offering avenues for NFT distribution.\n\nAs a fan of the highly advanced RMRK NFT technology, I\u2019m not saying CNFTs are the only solution for projects struggling in Ethereum, but the way Cardano is offered here as a gas-saving alternative is definitely tempting. I like the fact that they are offering consultation and go beyond art NFTs, addressing use cases in P2E gaming, exploring NFT utility and other concepts.\n\nThe budget is outlined clearly. Lion\u2019s share of the budgeted amount is reserved for marketing costs. And it makes sense. The team has built a functioning set of solutions and has proven what it is capable of. Now it\u2019s time to get this service off the ground. This Catalyst funding could give them the needed nudge for the coming months. Whether the business model is viable is yet to be seen. I would assume that right now a lot of their time goes to attracting new projects to use their service. Once the ball gets rolling, however, projects will start contacting them.\n\nTwo major risks have been identified: worries of value dilution when dealing with established projects and overall change resistance. The team has made a strategic choice to not focus too much on the established NFT ventures and they cater more to those who haven\u2019t made it big yet. The change resistance is mitigated through educational one-on-one conversations with project leaders, aiming to inform them and alleviate any doubts they might have.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The plans, timeline and budget are clear. The set goals are ambitious but realistic. As part of this proposal the team will finalize a more functional website, create consulting materials and onboard at least 24 projects. Their other metrics focus on quality, promising zero rug pulls, zero metadata mistakes/recalls and zero payment issues. The proposal states the goals for April-September 2022 although possible funding starts in May only. That shouldn\u2019t be a big problem for the team, however, because they are already hard at work.\n\nTracking progress might be a little difficult, however. The team has not mentioned anything about reporting on progress before the website is ready, materials are created and the projects are onboarded. The latter, obviously, cannot be discussed in public before agreements are ready. That\u2019s understandable. But it would be nice to have some mechanism for the Catalyst community to stay up-to-date on what the team is up to. Apart from this, it\u2019s a pretty clear cut proposal that will surely bring in fantastic results.\n\nSee also their second proposal: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/400473", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_289", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7756, "q0": "There are currently NFT minting services on Cardano already available in the market, e.g NFT-Maker.io. They\u2019ve already had a working product that this proposal is trying to make, that is to make minting NFT on Cardano as easy as possible. However, this proposal - namely Mint City - is not just creating another minting service, but also focusing on how to bring projects that are launching on Ethereum to switch over to Cardano. They do this through engaging and establishing a trusted relationship with the new and existing Ethereum projects, to demonstrate the capability of Cardano technology first hand. Mint City is specifically aligned to the challenge KPIs in every aspect by helping migrate NFT projects from Ethereum to Cardano. Ethereum NFT projects will later have an easy bridge to enable a shift to a more cost-effective and user-friendly ecosystem in Cardano. This proposal will bring more NFT projects to Cardano, hence will be able to scale in the future.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal has provided their Mint City team profile, and we can verify their profile on LinkedIn. Their team consists of people that are working at Microsoft, to a seasoned Systems Engineer with relevant experience regarding Plutus development. They\u2019ve also had their website running, however, it\u2019s only a single landing page website and only a little information available, which is currently lacking considering their current objective. This proposal listed their services and feature that have been done, but I can\u2019t seem to find what they\u2019ve claimed easily on their website. There\u2019s only one option to interact with the Mint City website, which is to contact them through email and it\u2019s not seamless or convenient. NFT-Maker.io already has their website well structured and a great user experience when navigating through their website. Although they\u2019ve mentioned that they\u2019re working on the V2 website, it will be great if they also plan to revamp their UI/UX for a great user experience. This is important because Mint City target users are the people outside of Cardano and are on the Ethereum ecosystem, which already has a massive user-friendly ecosystem and platforms. My suggestion is to improve the user experience for the Mint City website so it can communicate to the user what are the feature and services you\u2019re creating (take NFT-Maker.io for example for their UI/UX). Back to the proposal, the budgeting is well explained, although it could be better with breaking it down further, e.g What does consulting material does, what is it for? Is it another 3rd-party consulting firm? Then what does Business Development and Marketing Labor budget for? My point is, breaking down the budget details could give us evidence that the team knows what they\u2019re doing and not just throwing money at people with experience, then hoping they could deliver to create the product because you paid them well. In terms of \u201cwill this project become a success\u201d, I\u2019m not convinced since they don\u2019t have a clear timeline/roadmaps in detail. Overall, a great goal and objective, great team, but lack in detail about their roadmap and detailed plan, hence I will give it 2 star. It could be a 3-4 star if they\u2019re able to explain about their plan and implementation in detail.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "They didn\u2019t provide a detailed roadmap and timeline. They do provide the metrics, however, it\u2019s a metrics/goal within a span of 6 months. Explaining metrics/KPIs in detail with a clear timeline would be great, because every project will report their goal and milestone every other week or month in a call with IOG, to track the progress. They didn\u2019t specify any Github or another publicly available platform for the community to check their progress, giving a Github repo link is the minimum for a technical proposal/project. Or, if it\u2019s a private intellectual property, providing a social media hub is important too. Overall, it could be better with providing milestones and timelines in detail, and a portal to update the progress publicly.

The proposal points out that the gas fees for setting up and trading on Ethereum are very high, which hinders projects from developing on it and linking with other blockchain platforms. The author outlines the advantage of Cardano for connecting with trusted projects on Ethereum. The solutions given are very logical and explained in detail, clearly and convincingly to the readers.\nSolution: About Technology is designing a web3 service based on friendly interfaces from Web2, provides an intuitive full-service CNFT minting suite; About marketing: Through strong relationship building and demonstration of reduced cost and market saturation, promoting reliable projects and future development; About Consultative Approach consulting services for PFP, Play-to-Earn gaming, on-chain, and off-chain utility, and other NFT concept projects; Competitive Pricing: offer low-cost upfront pricing for those who prefer to pay before minting.\nThat's what I summed up in your solution. In my opinion, these are important explanatory details that focus on the core of the proposal's problem.\nThe project identifies appropriate KPIs such as the number of Eth projects transferred to Cardano, the number of pilot projects, the number of bridges established between the Eth and Cardano platforms. It is clear that the authors have identified the KPIs and challenges they need to achieve.\nIn the risky part of this proposal, the proponent mentioned being conservative among Ethereum boards before Cardano and outlined solutions for it.\nLike Create one-on-one talks with key members of eth councils, talk about the dilution of supply in eth NFT projects. Besides, along with the transfer of large established projects from Ethereum to Cardano, emerging projects that have not yet developed are also promoted to the Cardano platform this time.\nThose are very active and innovative solutions by the proponents that will greatly impact the Cardano ecosystem and enrich it, I support it.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project budget is divided into each work segment:\nDevelop and manage, advertise and market both clearly listed hardware and software.

The project development team has a certain experience, the proponent offers 4 members with different job skills, the roles of 4 people in the proposal are also clearly described, the person in charge of the business development business, who is in charge of developing frontend and backend software. I found the project team capable enough to execute the technical part of this project, besides they also provided linked links to easily identify project members.\nIn this proposal work items are detailed, parts completed, parts in progress, and parts planned.\nUnfortunately, this roadmap does not come with a specific time, so I do not know in what month or year the project will be completed or at what stage.
