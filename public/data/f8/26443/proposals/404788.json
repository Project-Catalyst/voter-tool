The technical process is sufficiently described and understandable. While it will have an impact on the ecosystem, I\u2019m unsure of the challenge setting, which is about the usage of Atala PRSIM, interoperability, self-governance of emergent communities and circular the circular supply chain. This does not explicitly exclude the proposal but raises questions. In the proposal Atala PRISM is more of an afterthought and not the main idea. The proposed solution would also work without Atala PRISM. It is not clear how the proposers would like to integrate PRISM: they state that they would like to sit down with IOHK/Cardano Foundation and talk about ways to integrate PRISM, but this is all the information a reader gets regarding PRISM. Additionally, none of the proposers seem to have any experience with Atala PRISM. I believe that this proposal is in general a very good one, worth considering, but the challenge appears not to be in the right category.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer show a good understanding of the problem space and present an interesting solution. The budget required is 100% of the available budget of the challenge and therefore the allocation should be very clear and understandable. The same should be true for the timeline. In both areas the proposers only make rough estimates (\u201c$150,000 First year of development from a team of developers\u201d or ~180 days for \u201cdevelop smart contract and decentralized blockchain ledger..\u201d). I my opinion these statements would be enough, when dealing with a $10,000 project, but not here. The proposing team has many years of experience in business, development and the blockchain space at first glance. But after a bit of additional research in other projects and proposal they are or were involved in, I got a bit more skeptical, about the quality and professionalism of the work they delivered so far. This should not a bad rating, but I \u201cNeither Agree nor Disagree\u201d, having arguments on both sides. To get a excellent rating here, considering the amount of money on the line, more detailed information should have been provided by the proposers. Then there is the topic of the ICANN registration, which is indeed a big risk. I would prefer separating this risk out into a separate proposal before getting $500,000 USD, which then can\u2019t be used for the initial idea.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposers would like to get a peer review on the different steps of the proposal, which is a adequate idea. A bit more elaboration on the goals (KPIs) would be helpful. I understand that with such a big project not all details could be planed in advance, but a few more word than \u201cachieving a highly adopted global identity management solution\u201d would be good. E.g. How many domain registration do you except in which timeframe? What is the state of similar projects on other blockchains? Why is .eth not a official TLD? What where the problems? There a many unanswered questions which should have been answered when writing a $500.000 proposal.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1184", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 8288, "q0": "Yes, this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. The proposers are seeking to create a self-service identity solution where users would use a smart contract to register their wallets and link that wallet to an individual in a human-readable format. They will use the ICANN system that has done this for the internet via the IP addresses. Each IP address provides a unique set of numbers that are specific to that computer. However, these registrations would not be persistent over time and require renewal on a bi-yearly basis. I would have like the proposers to make the case why the current options are inadequate and how their solution addresses them. Although they attempt to do this, there seems to be information missing. \n\nI think the proposers could have done a better job fitting this proposal into the actual challenge. While there is discussion of using Atala Prism for the identity portion, this appears as a secondary objective. The primary objectives, as stated, are for the system to be used for \"human readable address for wallet mapping, to as much as full DNS registrations for a corporation\". The linkage to DIDs and why they are necessary for this is not clear enough. As written, voters are left to make these connections on their own which leaves it open to interpretation. \n\nHowever, after doing my own research on ICANN and the benefits it provides to the internet 2.0, this proposal would apply that same approach to internet 3.0. If successful then certainly there would be a significant impact on the community. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Given the experience and plan presented it is neither likely nor unlikely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. This proposal is seeking the entirety of the funding for this category but they have not made the case that it is deserving of being the only proposal that could be funded, or that their solution is actually focused on identity, rather than an add on. \n\nThe roadmap does provide a measurable timeline with activities at each step but these are very high level and somewhat abstract. Over the next year, the team plans to complete the ICANN registration process but their ability to complete this task is not adequately shown. While they acknowledge the need for external support (IOG, CF) there is no indication on the willingness/desire of these groups to participate. Moreover, the team could provide a better explanation of what is required to complete the ICANN registration, including how long they expect it to last. The budget simply asks for a lump sum without any sort of breakdown of effort. \n\nAlso, given the amount being asked for, the team should do a better job at showcasing their credentials, which are essentially absent from the proposal. The undertaking also seems like it would be too large for a team of two to handle, but there doesn't seem to be identification of other team members. Showcasing how you will grow the team to meet your goals would help grow the confidence in feasibility. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The information provided is neither sufficient nor insufficient to audit the progress. Although the team commits to using all open source tooling in their proposal there are many aspects of this proposal which leave some cause for concern. Particularly, the measurements of success and KPIs are not actually defined in a measurable way, but instead are high level objectives that are not fully realized. The team commits to defining and measuring the milestones through peer review, what this looks like and how it will be done is unclear. Given the amount of funding being requested, these items need to be explicitly stated. For example, one measurement of progress and development is \"depth of Atala Prism Implementation\" but there is no discussion of what is meant by depth, or how deep it has to go before it's measurable. \n\nThere should also be some discussion of how success will drive the adoption of DIDs. Given that I am still asking this question at the end of the proposal, it is not clearly articulated within the proposal itself. How many users implementing the system equals success? Are all users the same? Would an individual users be as valuable say as a company that uses every feature of this system? What does your \"partnership with IOG/CF\" look like? How will you measure if that relationship is a success? \n\nThe commitment to use github and keep the project open source is very welcome and provides some confidence in the community's ability to audit the proposal. However, I would encourage the proposers to put a little more explanation behind some of their claims with tangible ways to measure the results in order to increase the auditability score.

The tacking on of an SSI component at the end of the project rings hollow, given that most of the content of the proposal violates many of the central tenets of SSI.  This is a request for funding to register the .Ada domain with ICANN, which is a ridiculously expensive $250,000 price for something that amounts to a vanity address.  The other $250,000 is for a massive server buildout to support a domain registration service.  This is a legacy idea that is built on $ fundamentals not Ada fundamentals, and it is disappointing to see it in the Catalyst space.  If this were something along the lines of a true-peer-to-peer network build, where sacred principles of SSI were upheld, then pursuing .Ada might be useful, but far more likely the whole DNS framework would be scrapped in favor of something more robust, secure and decentralized, that could handle transport agnostic protocols, end to end encryption, etc. (in this vein, the proposer is encouraged to look at projects like Urbit, if they are looking to take up a massive mandate for change).  Absent a reworking along those lines, the distance from the challenge setting and the dubious value to Cardano at large makes this a difficult project to get behind.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The budget ask, of 100% of the challenge setting raises the bar incredibly high for the qualities this team is bringing to the table.  Disappointingly, the only team details are a link to their GitHub repo, and two team members with no provable experience.  Looking into the repo on the premise that the \"proof is in the pudding\"  I didn't find what I wanted to see here.  Definitely no SSI or deep Cardano dives here, lots of NFT based repos, an interesting Quasar repo that I have bookmarked for later...  Again, I need to see some sign of those SSi fundamentals:  radically opensource, decentralized, privacy prioritized, etc.  There is a little here (and what I see, even when opensource really seems geared at things like tools for the inflow of people who want to build mobile apps and things like that...not throwing shade, just pointing out that decentralized ID is a completely different animal than these ways of looking at things), but I'm not seeing $500,000 worth.  The timeline and budget have some things they make clear, somethings not so much:  the ICAAN registration and DNS server build are front and center, while the Atala integration is in the murky background.  I have a sense of what they are saying, that there could be a way to establish conflict resolution protocols (for buying expensive domain names, presumably) by implementing smart contracts that read or output DID information (and there doesn't seem to be any indication here that the proposer understands the limitations that DIDs and smart contract communication have right now), but for this kind of a budget, the research and implementable plan need to be clear and actionable.  As presented, the proposer may very well discover that this plan for Atala isn't even executable.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The metrics and KPI included here are an indication of where the rest of the proposal is at:  how do you measure the \"Depth of Atala integration?\" or \"Ongoing peer review\"?  I'll assume the latter is a 3rd party audit of the smart contract (which isn't included in the budget) but the KPIs really are where the clarity and feasibility of a plan speak:  if it is possible, then it can be defined, and if it can be defined, it can be measured.  The sloppiness here calls into question the execution of all but one metric, which is perfectly clear:  \"Completing ICANN registration of TLDN.\"  The overall success metric, of a global identity management solution here makes no sense to me, in its incongruence with the body of the proposal.  Identity, in the context of DIDs and SSI, means privacy and security, and what it seems to be taken to mean here is more akin to identification of a twitter handle or wallet address.  If the proposer shifted their thinking of the identity of the wallet holder not as the address generated, but as the key that spawns that address, then the difference might be more apparent.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 5, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2577, "q0": "This proposal is made to solve the problem of helping Individuals or Businesses to self-manage their global identities, be safe and easy to use, and avoid data theft on their blockchain wallets.\nThe goal of this project is to create a smart contract to register a domain, lock the domain into a wallet, have a built-in expiry date and build an API for DNS updates.\nThis solution will not only put in place a check and balance system, but it will also scale on this for full user identity and external internet domain mapping; effectively making it like domain registration.\nWith the solution creates an easily accessible registry ledger.
