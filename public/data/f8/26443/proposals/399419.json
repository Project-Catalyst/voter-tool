The idea is that there is a Republic in a bohemian grotto in Lithuania, called Uzupis.  The Republic is a bit of a joke, though it does have a few actual trappings (its own currency pegged to the price of beer, the ability to stamp passports, a flag with a hole in it).  The requirements for citizenship in this grotto?  None (this isn't true, but the only requirement \"that you visit Uzupis once in your lifetime\" is impossible to enforce, since only the dead can be proven to have violated it).  Anyone can declare their citizenship in whatever way they like, so as a marketing/education gimmick, it is actually a pretty interesting way to get people practicing with DIDs, in this case citizenship DIDs.  Just to clarify, this is not a recognized Republic (though every once in a while someone will get excited about some \"real\" nation engaging with Uzupis in a mutual recognition treaty...nothing ever happens.), so no worries about dual-citizenship or anything like that.  The result is just a toy DID, probably with less value than your 23,000,000 hoskytokens.  Still, as a creative onboarding mechanism, I'm intrigued.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "For an unserious toy, the proposal sure takes seriously the approach to rolling it out.  There are plans to spend time drawing up the certification protocols, plenty of time for marketing and support workshops set aside, and decently robust development budget.  My one issue there is that the development budget calls for what looks like a whole issuer, verifier, holder setup with apps and some kind of issuer/verifier dashboard.  There is no need for all that.  Unless the proposer is trying to bootstrap his own SSI solution here (the budget says not likely, the scope of a project like that says not likely) a partnership with a community developed wallet like RootsID is the way to go. One caveat is teaching users to be issuers of DIDs...in that instance it may make sense to have an issuer mvp, as I am not sure how beginner friendly any of the current resources are for that This is in alignment with the intent to educate, as well, since it is better to practice with a tool you will be using, rather than a mvp practice tool.  Another thing I would have liked to see in this proposal include a discussion of the trust registry for these DIDs.  It has to be remembered that unlike a testnet DID, these DIDs actually mean something in the real world outside Cardano (not much, I know, but not nothing), so being able to explain and teach the nature of trust registries is possible in ways that aren't possible with testnet DIDs. (There is also a slim outside chance that a particularly creative trust registry might be able to create unexpected value for these DID holders....).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The carefully crafted proposal starts to sort of mail it in here (maybe that is warranted) but it is worth pointing out that the milestones certainly ARE trackable for progress.  Holding the 6 workshops over the 6 months gives one solid measurable per report, the delivery of the credentialing protocol (with trust registry!) is another.  While the app/dashboard development is certainly reportable (opensource?  its not clear) a partnership and integration would be just as good.  Ultimately this project will be measured by the workshop attendance for early interest and the use of the citizenship DID protocols to indicate how many people are learning to use DIDs and identity wallets.  The proposer indicates that 200+ is the target.

Will take this on-board and improve on the same."}, {"q0": "The proposer comes from Nairobi, but seems to live in Vilnius (see LinkedIn / other research): That\u2019s an important information, missing in the proposal. This way he is able to interact with the persons involved in the Uzupis community face to face, and therefor has a much better chance for impact. He should have also included if he has some personal or professional relationship to the Uzupis community. This being unknown reduces the [Impact] rating in my opinion. Generally, I think it is a great idea to start with those small, but relatively known communities. Other good examples would also be Lichtenstein, Andorra, or Christiana (Copenhagen). These small countries/communities often have a relative far outreach, compared to its size. It\u2019s a good place to start telling the story of Cardano and DIDs. Therefor it is a very good fit for the challenge and leaves room for further improvements in future proposals.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer laid out a realistic and sensible plan with workshops, Zoom events and an extended test period. The budget is overall also realistic. If the proposal gets voted for and will complete the goals as defined, I would suggest an additional proposal with a higher marketing budget to connect to established media outlets. The proposer is quite aware of the challenge and the benefits this might bring: \u201cthere is a risk that not many people may warm up to the idea but I believe that it is a quirky idea well worth exploring.\u201d. This is, I believe, a very realistic view. With enough experience in the Cardano community (Prism Pioneer, Veteran Community Advisor) I\u2019m confident he will be able to explain and sell the story very well. In combination with the technical experience (Full-Stack-Developer) and the sensible project plan this should be a feasible project. The required amount for the developers to design and build the app might be underestimated, but not in a severe way.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is good to understand and has an interesting approach to accelerate the usage of DIDs.

This could have been discussed beforehand, or if it was, it should have been mentioned. \n\nI am also decreasing one star because it is aiming only to affect a small community, thus compared to global or worldwide proposals, this one addresses the challenge less effectively. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer claims to have the required skill and experience, but no verification links are posted, except the linktree.  \nAlso, the question is, since the proposer is currently alone, how successful he will be hiring the required members (kotlin dev, mobile app dev).\n\nAlso, nowhere in the proposal is mentioned, if implemented successfully, when and how will be a collaboration with Uzupis administration set - if we want them to accept it, and thus increase DIDs adaptation. Or do we want to have credentials that will not be accepted?\n\nThe roadmap is set to one year, divided into 3 parts, where the funding is requested only for the first six months. I consider 4 goals per first 3 months as low detail, it could have been estimated for weeks. The same applies for the next three months. Three months is a large scale, and we have no idea about the proportion of set goals. \n\nRegarding budget, it is requested 14 219, and is divided into specific tasks. It is not clear, how much of these tasks will be performed by the proposer, instead of those where the hiring is planned. \n\nGiven the size of the budget, I consider the budget reasonable. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer states that the progress of the proposal will be trackable on the webpage (what webpage? to be created?) and his linktree. We can assume that some documents will be uploaded, but it is not stated in the proposal. Also, some weekly reports could have been stated. \n\nRegarding the success of the proposal, I am still wondering how the adaptation of DIDs will be performed, because I could not find a single mention of it in the proposal. At the same time, the success will be hosting a workshop in 6 months. Well, you can host one right now. \n\nSuggested success metrics:\n\n1.

While not an exact fit with the challenge brief, it seems the proposal is focused on the self-governance of emergent communities. Where I struggle with this proposal is the impact it will have on the broader ecosystem. As written, this project is solely focused on the Republic of Uzupis but it is not clear how the efforts would be extrapolated to other areas/regions. \n\nThat said, one could make the argument that adoption of Cardano DIDs via any sort of government body would be a good start at moving towards mass adoption, however, this link is not made explicit in the proposal but rather keeps it's focus very narrow. Voters may not have confidence in making this leap given that the proposer does not seem to indicate this as the goal. \n\nI would encourage the proposer to make these links more explicit throughout so voters can better understand the intended impact. As they are currently not included I am not certain whether the project would be impactful or not. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented it is likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. First off, the proposer does an excellent job identifying the key components of the plan and providing a detailed roadmap for how to achieve them. By breaking down the plan in a digestible manner, voters can easily follow the progress and development milestones. \n\nThe primary focus of the proposal is on developing the website portal to issue DIDS and educating of potential users. The proposer provides clear steps to be completed over the next twelve months from the development of the training materials to the onboarding of additional staff to help reach the end goals. I would have liked a targeted discussion on how the proposer plans to attract new members to the team. \n\nAnother feasibility component missing is the willingness of the government of Uzupis to pursue this activity. Have you reached out the local government? What has the response been? What are the demographics of the area? Have you gaged community desire for this idea? \n\nWhat can give voters confidence in the feasibility of this plan are the credentials of the proposer. Not only has the proposer been participating in Catalyst as a CA and vCA, they also have completed the Atala Prism cohort through IOG. This means that the proposer can start immediately and voters do not need to wait for them to learn these components first, as is the case with other proposals in this challenge.

Do all eight workshops need to be held in 6 months to be a success? What if you do 5? How many people need to attend? How many people would need to adopt the DID before you would determine it a success? \nI would encourage the proposer to address questions like this so voters can measure the final result against specific targets.
