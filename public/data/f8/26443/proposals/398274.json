The group will verify each others participation and they will receive a NFT to serve as a proof of their participation and achievement.\nThe concept envisioned by the proposal is according to the challenge and will impact the challenge parameters positively. \n\nOne question that arise when reading through this is why the proposal is going to mint NFTs as proof. I would have expected Atala Prism credentials to be issued instead of NFTs. The Prism infrastructure also has functionality for the verification of credential signatures, while verifying NFTs currently needs a lot of manual work. This question holds me back from giving top rating for impact. If proposal is voted, I would recommend changing this approach when doing the course POC. If not voted this round, I would recommend changing the proposal to make use of PRISM credentials instead of NFTs before resubmitting in a new round.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers display having the qualification and experience needed to do a successful course.\nBudget also seem reasonable, but a little low as I will come back to. It is very clearly broken down into identifiable items.\nTime table is realistic. The proposers have also identified a crusial risk, namely attracting participants. Proposal has connected with Cardano School but only budgeted for rewarding each participant with 25 ADA.\nI have confidence that them proposer team will be able to run this project without difficulty. I am though a bit concerned about attracting participants. I know...learning something new should be reward enough, right? But the participants contribute to the success of the proposal and I think the community would vote this proposal even with a slightly higher budget for rewards...perhaps 100 ADA to each participant. I do fear that 25 ADA is too small to attract participation and hence the proposers will need to attract participants (contributors) using other means to get them interested. If resubmitting this in a later round is needed, I would recommend increasing the reward budget to increase feasibility for successful participation.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal clearly defines timeline for the project and has relevant KPIs that will supply the community with insight into progress and successful delivery of the proposal.

Where DIDs, VCs and SSIs get interesting is when we start to discuss the protocols and frameworks around their issuance and the basis of the whole process.  This cheerfully named \"Studdy Buddy 3.0\" proposal jumps straight into questioning the very foundations of how we approach the concept of \"validation\" for something like learned skills.  The intriguing suggestion here is that our peers who are learning alongside of us have both an insight and reciprocal incentive to act as validators on behalf of a learning path that they are also travelling.  This proposal looks to leverage that idea and run a pilot program to test the concept.  This kind of testing of premises is utterly CRITICAL to decentralized notions of DIDs and VCs which currently tend to fall back on legacy institutions as both regulators and verifiers, as holders of the critical trust registry infrastructure that underlies any DID scheme.  This is a small experiment in the big landscape of VCs and the humongous landscape of SSI, but the results speak less to KPIs and deliverables and more to the phenomenon of found truth.  Can we avoid the politics, corruption and ossification of legacy institutions when assigning trust and value to a human being's learned experience and whole self?  It is my pleasure to recommend this proposal for funding to the voters of Catalyst, so that we can find out one small, critical piece of the puzzle, and where it might fit in the big picture.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Lend Michael A. Cenkner, the author of this proposal, your ear on matters concerning education and credentialing, and this experienced and passionate educator will soon have you pulled into his world of curiosity and possibility.  The protocols he outlines in this proposal are clear and well-defined, and they map out a clear method to approach gathering the information needed.  The budget is a steal, with frugal attention to detail and a sense of urgency to hit the ground running in the first month.  The timeline allows for space once the process is underway, and wisely doesn't rely on static cohorts, but rather has a more asynchronous, flexible approach.  The goal is to create and capture \"learning artifacts\" which will be determined by the educational group he assembles, but will likely consist of video recordings.  There is a conceptual issue as the artifacts are established, which is figuring out how they relate to a validation or verification process (they function as \"proof\" but how do we represent them?).  Time has been provided in the timeline to ruminate on this problem, in collaboration with the educational cohort, but the answer is an emergent deliverable for the proposal, and  not something which can be specified in advance (though it is anticipated to be a token or NFT...obviously a VC is on the table).  The only real risk assumed in a research proposal of this nature is that an initial group of learners can't be assembled, but he addresses this both via a rewarding mechanism and by ceaseless outreach for collaboration.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is a very clear road map provided, broken down into broad strokes characterized by month, consisting of an onboarding phase, an information gathering phase and a retrospective.  The suggested KPIs cover the field pretty well:  how many \"pods\" are able to be setup on the budget and in time, how many \"artifacts\" are the students able to create.  There is a suggestion to track the numbers of \"facilitative messages and updates and notifications\" but it is unclear if this is relevant or related to the structure of the learning environment.  Certainly it could be tracked in relation to the internal data of the project, not sure if it is relevant outside of that.  A nice synergy is that the learning artifact outputs will effectively satisfy the monthly KPI/Progress reporting requirements for the project, so it is expected that the community will be able to stay up to date and the project stay on track.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 6, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal attempts to lay a ground for the truly decentralized model for learners to peer-validate \u2018what they know & can do\u2019 by utilizing Cardano\u2019s network and its digital identity platform.

I think there is potential with the proposal, yet as it stands right now, I don\u2019t see it fitting this challenge, since its focus is not on DIDs, but more on developing a system of learning and validation, that could possibly work better in a different challenge.

I could not find the long-term vision. \nIf it is supplementary, we are talking about education after education. If it is going to replace it, there might be some risks.

These individuals will be able to provide direct feedback on the success and feasibility of the project through iterative discussions.

When you create the final report how will you relay your findings to the broader community who are working in this space? This type of additional exposure could open the team to further auditing processes that refine their solution. Since we can assume that this solution will need to work with other solutions that are similar, an environmental scan of what is already in development may avoid the duplication of work. \n\nOverall, the team does a good job at identifying how the community can audit their proposal.
