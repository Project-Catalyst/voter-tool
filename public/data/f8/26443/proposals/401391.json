I am NOT sure, but I think... there is something to this idea.  My general sense of it is some kind of token swap between wallets, carried out over twitter that is either a proof-of-life exercise, a (non?) anonymous voting exercise, or some kind of abominable, stitched up amalgamation of both, shot through and coursing with lightning, slowly opening its watery yellow eyes... (\"It's alive!  ALIVE!!!)  My only piece of advice is for the proposal team to consider having a good proposal writer either join the team or help them suss out how to turn this into a readable text, instead of a copy/paste mashup.  Until then, it needs to stay safely strapped to the editor's table, instead of out in the countryside, looking for understanding, and terrorizing unsuspecting CAs.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I caught a few glimpses of the beast's inherent humanity...  there is a desire for transparency, and some support from the community.

Perhaps...a soul?", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I have no idea of what to say here.  The budget is for 16K for some relay nodes...not exactly sure why, but this can certainly be measured and counted as a deliverable.  Additionally, 10K s for the minting and distribution of 5k tokens (I KNEW it was a token issuance of some kind!  Ha!), so I guess counting the tokens is a measurable.

The proposers seek to use verified IDs for proof of life and work in Cardano, but what this actually means is in practice is not well identified. In the problem statement the team suggests that onboarding will be accelerated by these IDs but they do not provide any sort of insight into why this would be the case or how it would be done. \n\nI would encourage the proposers to add in better supporting evidence for their solution and why this solution is needed. There is no discussion of the current state-of-play or the problems facing the current solutions that are in place. If the suggestion is that this solution succeeds where others fail, this comparison should be included. Moreover, further elaboration on the application of this proposal to the broader ecosystem would also be helpful. If you are using pre-identified communities why are they not listed here?

There is no indication of a timeline or roadmap to complete the efforts.

I am left without a clear indication of what the team is even trying to do. The team should also include links to their credentials, other than saying \"experience in Cardano and usage\" there  is no way to tell who the team members are or what skills they have to complete the work. \n\nAlso, the majority of the budget is for \"internal set up of node relays, IP domains, and insurance\" yet there is no supporting justification or reasoning for these amounts. Is this something that needs to be built from scratch? Would existing node-relays not work? If not, why not?

The measures of success are also not tangible and I'm not sure how the project could be audited or measured. Saying \"more users try techniques\" is a lofty goal but without a number of users, number of different communities, number of techniques tried, there is no grounding for the measure. Finally, it is clear that the proposers did not draft this proposal along the new format but instead have cut and paste this proposal into the new format. I would encourage the proposers to do a better job at answering the questions as outlined and providing their supporting evidence on how they address each.
