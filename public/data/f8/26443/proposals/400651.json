The group suggests that there has been no in-depth study of the application of DiDs to the metaverse but that the community would benefit from such study in the pursuit of standards. \n\nAssuming this is in fact the case, then yes, there would likely be a positive impact for the Cardano community. What I am left wondering though is whether the group looked beyond Cardano for examples, particularly as several other chains have their own metaverse projects that may have addressed this issue. It would be beneficial to indicate to voters that this is the case, further justifying the need for your project. If that is not the case, and such information does exist, this could be a redundant project. Without any sort of indication whether this is true or not (besides taking their word for it) it is difficult to determine the impact this project would have. \n\nIn order to get higher marks, the proposers would need to include a breakdown of the issues they are looking to explore. Saying \"application of Atala Prism to metaverse ID in a more interdisciplinary and in-depth way\" leaves a slew of questions that need to be answered. What exactly will you be looking at? What disciplines will be required to do so? How will you strive to have your standards made the norm vis-\u00e0-vis others working in the same space? Not knowing this information reduces the potential impact it could have. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unfortunately, given the plan and experience presented it is unlikely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. First off, there is essentially no plan given. All that voters are offered is an indication that the team will work to identify standards but are provided no details on the what or the how the task will be achieved. What methodolog(y)ies be applied to your research and how did/will you decide on which approach to use in your studies? \n\nSecondly, the team provides a website to link to their members but the only person identified is the same individual that is listed in the proposal itself, what about the other team members? If the team commits to partnering with Aizu Lab, then that lab should also be identified within this section so voters can confirm their credentials. Sadly, this information is completely absent and therefore insufficient to know whether they'd be a success or not. Moreover, the proposals mentions that the team's weapons are PR skills and Marketing but how this links to the study of DiDs in the metaverse is not made. \n\nLastly, given the price tag of $50k, I would expect more details on the budget and how that money will be spent. Is this amount appropriate for research? The community requires/deserves more information than just listing a lump sum. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "No, the information provided is not sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. It is not clear what the community could audit. While I am grateful that the proposers commit to weekly written reports and Eastern Town hall participation regarding development status, there is no grounding to any sort of baseline from which to measure. How will you measure if the research component is a success? \n\nThe proposers do provide some indicators by which they will measure success (two public tools or standards; discovery of repeatable patterns in use-cases: publish ID specification standards or tools in the metaverse; the number of issuers, holders, and verifiers; the number of verifications performed on credentials in production) however these are more goals than success measurements, except for the 2 public  standards or tools. This lack of clear measures makes it difficult for voters to know whether they will be able to measure how this project delivers on what it set out to do. \n\nIn order to increase the score next time, I would encourage the proposers to put more explanation on their plans. By better articulating what you plan to do, including the milestones and deliverables, the community can more easily follow the project. As written, the plan provides none of these details and so the community is left without necessary information. \n\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_66", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The issue here is that there are no standards drawn up in a formalized way for Atala use cases in the Metaverse.  The suggestion being made by the proposers is to partner with a small systems development company in Japan --AizuLab-- to research and document these standards.  While I agree that this is a generally worthwhile goal, I really don't know what the nature of the standards are they are trying to grasp, and I'm not sure they do either.  There are very diverse areas to explore that would require different strengths:  SSI compatibility, interoperable standards with other chains in the space, different communication protocols, etc.  Any of these would be a full subject for standards in its own right, so I would personally like to see this project dialed in a little bit tighter to the particular standards scheme that they feel qualified to evaluate, as well as an idea of how they would explore and document the research already done in the opensource frameworks of Hyperledger, DIF and ToIP.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Unfortunately no timeline was provided, or budget breakdown.  What would have been ideal is a description of a drill down methodology, over 8-12 weeks on how they would parse out the links between metaverse and Atala, and then methodically document existing opensource repos on those subjects, and then lay out a plan and execution to fill in the gaps with fresh research.  The team details are not readily apparent from the proposal, the AizuLab site, nor the Metafrontier site.  If I had to identify a strength among the skills as I see them, it would have to be a very, very strong marketing element.  It makes me wonder if the goal here is something more akin to marketing research?  Maybe that was lost in translation?  Regardless, based on the intention to write standards, I would say that the proposal could add the timeline listed above, key team members for conducting the research, and of course, a good budget breakdown that clearly itemizes the research and documentation costs, as they are the key deliverables.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The team intends to release biweekly reports, and participate in Eastern Townhalls in order to keep the community up to date on the research (and hopefully to clarify many of the noted issues).  They indicate a website where comments and questions can be submitted.  I would also like to see here the repos being opensource for the documentation, as standards will need to be public and able to be duplicated and forked, so if they do that it adds another whole layer of transparency and auditability.  In fact, I would say that as the documentation as the key deliverable, all tracking really comes down to progress on them.  The inclusion of a roadmap indicating different documents (even if just generalized ideas of them) would give a good idea of how long such a project might take (need to know in order to disburse funding) and how to get it completed.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 4, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Functionally working blockchain tools have embedded a lot of work in a lot of cases and a long term goal achieved, it is useful to develop strategies, tools and channels to expand its impact potential. \u2018Atala PRISM is a great tool\u2019 a decentralized identity solution built on the Cardano blockchain that needs amplifiers to scale.

Well, there is no detail about what is meant by \"study\" but if we replace it with the word \"research\" then it would be inaccurate because there are many types of research running even in Cardano Catalyst. It is true that these are not related to the metaverse, but in the proposal, there is no information why it is different than regular DID research.\n\nMore information is required regarding - what is a laboratory study of DIDs? Why it is necessary? How is it related to professors and students? Why do we think something must be studied by professors or students? What can we study about it?

Atala PRISM + Metaverse + Japan = this proposal really knows how to flatter a lady.   However, I've been talked out of my ear like that before.

Going forward there is only fog that does not allow to visualize neither the possibilities of success nor the possibilities of failure.  It does not talk about strategies or mechanics to go along the way.  The budget requested (10% of the total budget of the challenge) would clearly support two, maximum 3 teams with less fascinating proposals but clear in their purpose (interoperability, integration with other systems, etc).

Sorry, less of 24 hours, because according to the proposal: \"If possible, we will participate in bi-weekly Eastern Hemisphere meetups to demonstrate the status.\"   These situations lead me to reflect on whether in reality, when we present proposals or projects, we are aware of the role of KPIs. But more than that, of the essence that constitutes them. Why KPIs always go at the end of every project, as a signature, after we launch our version of reality to the reader.  KPIs are a promissory note we sign for the performance of our proposal, which will later be charged to our sense of honor and reasonableness, to our ability to deliver what we promised.  KPIs are the signature on a letter of commitment to the faith of those we seek to believe in us.  They are the skin in the game, the meat on the grill.  Therefore, KPIs are not a mere accessory. Their degree of thoroughness denotes not only how likely we are to deliver what we have promised, they denote the degree to which we are willing to keep our word.
