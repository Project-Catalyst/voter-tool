They have previously been funded to create a strategy and present it to city officials, as well as to onboard Japanese developers via translation of core educational materials.  The current proposal connects the two ideas together, hosting a hackathon event to leverage the educational materials and bring a cohort of Japanese developers into Cardano, presumably tapping some to help execute their project.  The relation to AtalaPRISM is that PRISM will be one of the core education points, with the goal of being able to introduce to the city officials a program for on-chain track and trace of locally created goods, as well as a certification standard for a skills-matching service for developers.  This track and trace program is not the subject of this proposal, but could be expected to be a follow up if the hackathon is funded and succeeds.  If successfully implemented, the hackathon proposed here could certainly address the need for more Japanese developers on Cardano, and their target of 5 companies and 200 participants would be an excellent pull for a hackathon.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This team has acknowledged that as it moves towards its goal of a smart-city style tech solution, it has encountered blockages in the form of being able to work locally with Cardano pros to flesh out the vision around such a startup.  This is actually a good thing, since it indicates not only that they can identify and acknowledge strategic issues, but they have pivoted to address the issues in a way that reflects the values of Catalyst:  rather than out-source mercenary programming work, they are seeking to increase education and learning networks in order to spread the positive impact.  It takes longer, but the rewards reaped should be more sustainable. I do have concerns about the budget amount.  At 100k it represents a fifth of the total funds available for this hyper competitive challenge, so you are looking for a lot of synergy and impact.  We have already talked about the mid- to high-level impact provided, so when we look at synergy throughout the budget, we want it to be good.  For starters, it is dedicating $20k to learning resources...you would like to see this fleshed out more:  hopefully the previously funded proposal has created a lot of this material, and you would also like to see some anticipation of producing material that suits scaling these efforts into likely proposals for DID/VC infrastructure in Fund 9 and beyond.  But neither case is clarified here.  At $40k the hackathon organization itself is hefty, but may be locally competitive.  It would be nice to see that cost broken down to understand where the impact is being realized.  A full $10k for project management and $20k to retain instructors also seems like a big ask, given that we haven't been provided much detail regarding who is to be retained or what jobs the included team members will be taking on.  A big add that could solve a lot of these issues would be a dedicated roadmap with milestones and deliverables...the included timeline is minimally helpful.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team has been previously funded twice, and are familiar with the current tracking and reporting requirements.  They also maintain several public communication channels for communities that they serve, so they are accessible on discord and telegram.  The suggested metrics for a hackathon are fantastic, and their expectation of pulling 40 course completions from the hackathon cohort would be quite good.  Another thing they could have included was whether they were able to fill out their team for developing their own solutions they are working toward, as this proposal is part of a longer term workcycle they are trying to deliver on.  Finally, a useful KPI that should be included in a project of this nature would be to opensource the learning materials they create for the Hackathon.  They probably couldn't distribute lecturer's content without permission, but they could make that a condition of payment.  This content will be created, it would be good to know what they intend to do with it beyond running the event.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 6, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5479, "q0": "Through this proposal, the team members want to organise Japan focused hackathons and training programs for ATALA Prism that will attract new engineers and enterprises to the Cardano blockchain, expanding not only the community, but the developer base at the same time, as the trained developers will enter the Cardano community and start building for a variety of projects.\nAs such, I find the idea behind the proposal to fit the challenge and have a positive impact on the Cardano (developer) community in coming up with potential new ideas on ATALA Prism.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan and timeline are very succinct and could benefit from added information, relating to the steps needed to finalise the proposal. How many sessions, what topics for the sessions, what kind of educational documents will be created etc. \nThe budget is loosely divided in percentages only, but there is absolutely no mention of number of hours needed, staff necessary to implement the proposal, how many lecturers will be retained, how much they will be paid with, how many hackathons will be held and what prize there are. All these numbers are vital for the assessment of the proposal, otherwise, the budget cannot be taken into account.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The progress of the proposal is loosely described, there are 3 numbers described - number of students, number of students who complete the course, and companies participating in the hackathon. More info could and should definitely be added. Somehow, the text for success definition is a copy/paste of the KPIs, and that is not enough here as well. If the proposal will be resubmitted for a future fund, I highly encourage the proposers to rewrite the two sections and have different answers for them.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_20", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8260, "q0": "Yes, this proposal effectively addresses the challenge by developing curricula of educational materials, and organizing a hackathon to train new blockchain developers to work on Atala Prism related projects. The success of this project would likely have a significant impact on the entire Cardano ecosystem by increasing the number of active developers working in this space. Many of the proposals in this category speak to the lack of developers and by creating an educational program that is open and accessible to a broader audience this team could be providing a solution that would not only benefit this project but others within this same category. \n\nA strong indicator of impact in this proposal is the benefits its success could have from projects already underway by this group. The team does a good job at positioning this project within their larger efforts and identifying the value proposition of being successful here. The integration of businesses in the hackathon alongside developers may also foster a multitude of relationships into the retail world, further expanding the reach of Cardano. \n\nThe team will also attempt to build a consortium of entities interested in globalized commercialization that can work and grow together, which will drive the impact of the proposal by removing existing silos and standardizing best practices. This consortium would also be able to explore multiple use cases in specific sectors and across the entire space more easily given the functions and benefits of DIDs. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. The team provides a detailed overview of the success in Catalyst so far and offers updates on the current status of each project as they relate to this one. What is advantageous is that the team seems to have put a lot of thought into the current obstacles that may challenge the success of those projects and therefore developed this proposal to address them. \n\nOver the first two months, the team will focus on the development of the educational material and curriculum. What I would have liked to see in this section is how they plan to identify and engage the experts you will rely on for the development of this material. Will it be from within Cardano or will you be looking more broadly? Do they have a high level overview of what will be looked at? \n\nThe credentials of the team are very strong and definitely suggest that the team is able to carry out the activities highlighted. They also appear well connected to the Cardano and business communities within Japan. The budget leaves a bit to be desired and could also articulate more clearly how the money will be spent. For example, if 20% is for retaining lecturers, how many will this cover? For how long? And if the Hackathon is 40% of the overall budget how will you divide that 40% between the organizers and winners? This type of information would improve confidence in the feasibility of the solution. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal. The main success indicator for this proposal will be the completion of the hackathon which will be easy for the community to know if it happened or not. The team hopes to have at least five businesses competing in the hackathon besides the developers. \n\nWhere I would have liked more information for auditability is on the development of the educational material. Given the major component this represents, including their success indicators (200 students, 40 of which complete the course) there is seemingly little opportunity for input on the materials developed. I would have liked to know how the community, through Catalyst or IOG, could be engaged either as content creators or validators. The project would likely benefit from this sort of scrutiny to ensure their products are accurate and reflect the best practices/standards.
