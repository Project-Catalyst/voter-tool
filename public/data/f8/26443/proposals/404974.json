The budget seem a bit low with only $25 an hour for developers. Time estimated may be enough but also seem a bit low (80 h * 2).\nIf proposal isn't funded this round, I think the proposal would benefit from connecting with some potential developers and ask them to join your proposal team and help you with defining what needs to be developed and to detail the proposal with some estimates for doing the required job. By having more clarity in the estimates and also linking to developer resources with relevant skills, your proposal will get higher feasibility rating.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Proposal lacks some clarity about exact workings of the prototype.

If this proposal is not voted in this round, I would recommend more clarity into what the pilot is going to deliver and what the plans for the prototype is. This will make it possible for the community to measure if proposal delivers as promised.

The idea of a game being able to onboard SSI users is really an ideal learning environment for it:  you can silo the interactions, and create internally consistent worlds that can teach the concepts better than the complex interrelationships of real life can allow for.  For example, trust registries can be very complex (heck, the whole concept of trust can be complex!), but anyone who has ever played a video game with factions has an innate idea about how trust registries come into being and what kinds of scripts they follow.  Also, games allow you to put a lot of learners in a \"test-net\" environment where they can experiment and take risks that RL just doesn't allow for.  And one thing is for sure, with where SSI is right now, education is still the best path forward.  Back to the trust registry a bit, the team suggest here that they are considering an \"emergent\" trust registry of peer validation, and I have to say I love this idea and I hope they stick with it even though it is risky.  Within a game is ideal, again, because you have some control over what breaks, but in general I really like this approach.  A protocol will still need to be designed, that won't be emergent, but the authenticity of the DIDs will be emergent, and will grow stronger with each validation (much like on-chain tx, but I digress).  For incentivization to adopt SSI and critical experimentation with trust registries, this proposal's impact get's the highest marks.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The educhainment team looks well suited to this task, and I appreciate that they are not ramping this up into a full SSI rollout.  The Atala SDK is still tentative at this point, and design protocols are critical to SSI, so getting the project started with a big research/PoC phase is perfect.  The timeline seems to be squeezing this into two months, but there is no reason to rush, as long as they are ready to propose in Fund9, which could be as soon as they have the design implementation ready, and then be prototyping while developing the Fund9 proposals.  This also allows for the RootsID wallet to move along...they won't need every functionality that RootsID is working on for SSI in this fund, but they will still need the onboarding help (which they also intend to seek from the Atala team).  Delays are the big risk for this project, but the budget doesn't seem like a holdup to this part of the development cycle.  A good team, a reasonable budget, a short, solid timeline that makes the deliverables clear... this project won't have many roadblocks coming from inhouse.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Tracking the repo for the prototype is excellent (opensource!), but they should also include the research and design in the KPIs, especially if they want to keep the funding flowing (if they manage to keep it all under two months, this won't be an issue, but color me skeptical).

The main purpose behind the project is to bring exposure to SSI technology and it is therefore deemed to be placed in the right challenge setting.

A problem is identified as lack of exposure to SSI tech, which will be somehow fixed by a language playing a multiplayer game because DIDs will be implemented.

The language learning process is quite burdensome and overwhelming with few opportunities for self-taught education and immersion. While there are standouts like DuoLingo and Rosetta Stone, these are unidirectional and do not allow users to interact in a truly immersed way. After reading the partner proposal (the actual game itself) the proposed solution here seems like the answer to the shortcomings of these other tools. By taking it one step further and linking identity to the player's success, they are able to learn in an interactive way while being incentivized and rewarded for getting better. Contrary to the other tools listed above, these results and rewards are tangible and will be exportable to real world scenarios. \n\nIf the proposers are successful, then certainly this innovative learning method would have a major impact. This dApp could be the entry point for millions of language learners that currently sit outside of the ecosystem, further driving adoption of DIDs and Cardano writ-large. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. The team has a partner proposal submitted to cover the continued development of their language learning dApp, and so this proposal only covers the introduction of DIDs into that dApp. Due to the specific nature of the task being proposed here, the plan is quite short with a narrow focus, however, the team articulates the work to be completed over a two month time frame and commits to having a working prototype for testing and refinement by the end. \n\nSince this component is part of a larger whole the feasibility of the project is somewhat dependent on the other piece, so the plan is likely subject to change should their efforts there not come to fruition. However, after perusing their website and the links provided the team seems well on its way to delivering what they set out to do. \n\nFinally, the team makes it very clear that this funding is only to hire two developers who will focus on the task of integrating DIDs into the Aedou dApp. They propose that it will take ~80hrs of effort at $25/hr. Given that the game is already somewhat operational, this seems more than reasonable to complete. Perhaps a description on the process to attract these developers would have been helpful but by leveraging the existing Prism-Pioneers program there will likely be many devs seeking to join.

As highlighted above, this is an add-on to a broader proposal that seeks to integrate DIDs into their language-learning dApp and so the outcome of this proposal is a yes/no answer to \"were DIDs included in their dApp\"? This makes it very easy for the community to audit. However, I would have liked the proposers to add in a measurement of the \"number of DIDs issued in the dApp by x date\" or a similar KPI so it's success could be easily known. \n\nVoters can also have confidence in the audit process for this proposal given the commitment to post updates via github, an open source repository. This suggests that the proposers are open to scrutiny and community feedback throughout the process, a good sign. Another strength of the proposal is that the solution will be introduced in a closed setting via the app whereby the dApp creators will have control over the development and implementation of the DIDs in the game. Within the dApp the proposers will have a captive audience who will provide their own audit functions on the success of the DIDs and whether they are able to port them beyond the dApp. This will force the proposers to respond to any issues that arise in the moment, allowing them to refine their product further.
