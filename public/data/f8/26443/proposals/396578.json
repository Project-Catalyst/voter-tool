To ensure a broader range of functionality, the team will develop and implement presentation exchange protocols to include more complex situations and streamline user experience. A major challenge facing the shift to digital identity is getting people to see the benefit of switching from more legacy systems to digital, however the focus on improving user experience can work to mitigate this while increasing adoption. \n\nThe RootsWallet team has a variety of proposals in Fund8 that address different components of their plan, which are all standalone pieces but that work in concert within the final solution. This may increase the impact of the proposal itself by not making it success dependent on the others, rather the components are complementary. \n\nAnother significant impact factor is the team's excellent job of partnering with a variety of different projects across Catalyst that will act as use cases for its functioning. By developing additional presentation exchange protocols the team is providing it's collaborators the option to deliver more advance DID capabilities, while documenting the entire process for future adoption by other projects. This means that the solution being presented here will not only impact the RootsWallet team but instead will have cascading effects across each of the projects, further driving overall impact. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. The team has shown their track record and ability to deliver in multiple ways throughout the proposal. The documentation on RootsWallet shows that it is largely developed and the team is now shifting focus to its optimization and feature development. The beta version is to be launched during Fund8 and the features to be added upon successful funding. This indicates that they are well on their way to delivering their solution which is a good sign for voters. \n\nThe plan as outlined appears reasonable and the infographic of their staged approach offers a good representation of where they are within the process, including next steps. Each milestone and deliverable highlighted is then broken into its smaller components with descriptions of the tasks required; a level of granularity that implies the team's intricate knowledge of the necessary steps. \n\nAnother strong feasibility indicator is the Team's explicit commitment and participation among bodies that are working to standardize processes and best practices, including the Trust over IP network, and the Decentralized Identity Foundation. By working closely with these partners and aligning their development decisions to the latest information, the team is likely to have a final product that is effective and useful. \n\nFinally, the team's commitment and collaboration to a variety of partners within the Catalyst ecosystem also strengthen the feasibility of this proposal by having direct use cases which their solution can be tested against. This group will also work as a sounding board for the documentation developed and allow the team to make refinements that are clear and understandable for end users, which is the principle challenge for adoption. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. In line with all their other proposals, the team commits to being open-source by default, which includes transparent tracking and reporting through a public repository. The team will utilize github to track github issues, project views, commits, and development sprint percentages of progress. This approach is always a welcome sign in a proposal as it indicates the team's willingness to face public scrutiny and feedback.\n\nAnother strong audit feature of this proposal is the workflow alignment with the standardization bodies and partners. Each of these entities will perform its own audit function on the proposal itself as they look to integrate the solution within their own projects, a benefit of this approach is the iterative nature through which the solution will be developed to ensure that the final product is actually useful. By maximizing these relationships all teams are more likely to succeed and support each other to become their best versions.

In this one they have laid out a project to develop Presentation Exchange Protocols to enhance the RootsWallet (their PRISM SDK identity wallet).  Think of these protocols as expressions of the relationship between the Verifier and Holder of something like a DID.  In fully implemented SSI, a Holder should be able to pick and choose what Verifiers see when verifying a proof that the Holder has the proper DID, and Verifiers can pick and choose what they ask for when requesting a proof.  In order to do that, the Verifier and the Holder have to \"talk\" to each other: at a minimum the Verifier needs to be able to describe the requirements that it considers to be the proof of that DID, and the Holder needs to be able to describe what it has submitted to meet the requirements for that proof.  The Verifer presents its requirements, the Holder presents its submission to meet those requirements, the two exchange those presentations...voila, Presentation Exchange Protocol.  The proposer says these protocols \"matter the most\" in SSI, and that is a fair statement.  Without them, verification is all or nothing, and in order to have selective privacy you would need to break SSI up into a vast number of discrete IDs, leading to redundancies and wastes of processing power.  Having these protocol standards in place will help anyone building with these tools to bring that functional versatility to their wallet experience, and beyond the protocol documentation, RootsWallet will be developing and implementing their version of it.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The challenge here is the moving target that they are trying to hit, but to the degree that they can keep it in their sights, this should be a pretty straightforward project.  The team is going on 3 funds now of being supported by Catalyst in creating a homegrown SSI solution, and the team are all PRISM Pioneers, with credentials heavily tilted to the development side.  They lay out the timeline clearly and in conjunction with their development schedule, with phases outlined by the week and an overall delivery schedule of 12 weeks.  They have provided a nice buffer of time at the beginning to get the documentation of the protocols right, which is good.  As mentioned the standards being set for these Presentation Exchanges is a work in progress across DFI, Hyperledger and ToIP (or at least, that is where the most robust, thoughtful work is being done...sometimes these things show up from elsewhere) and so there is likely to be some iterations of the protocols as they are getting into development.  The budget is the standard one shared across all of their proposals in terms of hourly developer compensation, and the hours listed, particularly for the 8 weeks of development sprints and testing, are accurate (and I should note it leaves room on the weekly for other hours being logged from their other projects.  I sometimes worry about teams that are spread across too many projects, and after reviewing all their proposals in SSI and Accelerate Decentralized Identity, I got curious and put the different sprints in a spreadsheet.  Lo and behold, all the hours fit a standard (for Catalyst) workweek, fitting together like a puzzle.  The team has clearly mapped this project out well.)", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap has been clearly stated with discrete phases that line up well with the beats of an audit:  documentation and delivery of the standards first, workflow design next, big development sprint with testing(in Agile on GitHub with sprint burndown for meeting %complete metrics for those progress reports), and finally project documentation and a deliverable wallet.  With all the code and documentation going opensource into Github, this is not only an easy project to track, but other projects will have resources to lean into if they desire (and there are many AtalaPRISM Pioneers who have an eye on these repos, I assure you).  The proposer's experience with Catalyst is showing with this auditing profile.
