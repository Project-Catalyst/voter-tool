From the Decentralized Identity Foundation, \"The Universal Resolver resolves Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) documents across many different DID methods, based on the W3C DID Core 1.0 and DID Resolution specifications.\" Currently, no driver exists for Atala, so this project seeks to change that. \n\nGiven the central role of identity in many transactions that occur across the internet, the integration of this driver in the Universal Resolver will make Cardano DIDs easier to integrate in these transactions. In order to accelerate adoption of Cardano DIDs, solutions need to appeal to a broad audience of developers and users, by integrating Cardano within existing tooling and libraries these solutions can be used across a variety of use cases. This is likely to have a major impact given the heavy reliance on the Universal Revolver as the de facto method for platforms resolving DIDs. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. The proposer has already built a similar driver to the one being proposed which gave them insight into the requirements for this project. The benefit of this is that the proposer is able to clearly articulate the specific components and steps to be resolved. It is obvious that this knowledge is within the bailiwick of the proposer. \n\nAnother strength of this proposal is that it only last four weeks and from what is presented, this seems completely reasonable. The proposer's experience as member of the first cohort of Atala Prism Pioneers also adds weight to the feasibility given their pre-existing knowledge of the Atala system, including it's requirements and technical specifications. This also provided the proposer with a broad network of peers who will be able to help with bringing this project to fruition. Moreover, the link of funded proposals that the proposer is also a part of shows their commitment to realizing DIDs on Cardano. \n\nFor a price tag of only ~$6500, the potential upside of this project is huge particularly as it seems so easy, at least as presented. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal. The proposer clearly grasps the necessary requirements to complete the task and provides voters with a very simple and easy-to-follow plan. The project will be open source by default as it will build on the Universal Resolver Driver, which is also an open source initiative. This means that all documentation and coding will remain open source and can be fine tuned as needed by the broader development community, giving strength to it's auditability. \n\nThe proposer also commits to providing the community regular updates through github issues, project views, and commits. Given the open-source nature of github, this is another way the community can audit the proposal. With only a four week window to completion, this project also will be very easy to audit by seeing whether the universal resolver for the Atala DID is complete. \n\nExcellent work.

Definitely a must have.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has already experience in developing a comparable solution and is deeply involved in the SSI-Topic.

In true SSI, no one assigns you an identity, you assign it to yourself.  In this instance, the self is the Cardano blockchain, and the identity assigned is did:prism.  The Universal Resolver can allow did:prism to interoperate with any other identity that it understands.  It understands identities when it has the \"drivers\" in its protocols that give it all the relevant information to understand it.  Rodolfo has correctly sussed out that while the Resolver can introduce ether to bitcoin, and they both have IPFS on speed dial, Ada isn't invited to the party, so the answer is: create the drivers for did:prism so that Cardano has full SSI interoperability for identities.  A simple problem with a simple solution.  The only problem with this proposal is that it you haven't voted for it yet.  Let's fix that, shall we?", "q0r": 5, "q1": "3 weeks.  That is how long we have to wait for this critical connector to allow Sovrin and BTC based DIDs to interoperate with Atala.  I know, I know, however will we make it?  All I can say is that we couldn't ask for a better community member to be taking this task on.  He has already delivered a similar set of drivers for Cardano Sidetree, and he provided enough documentation here for the Resolver that I could probably develop the drivers myself, and I haven't written code for twenty years.  His 3 week timeline has more details than a couple of 12 month budgets I have seen this fund, and the budget is straightforward, broken down by the hour for 4 deliverables.

Dang it, still have to wait 3 weeks....", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Easy to audit this one, too.  He has more deliverables than he has weeks in his timeline, which is just plain greedy.  Some proposers don't even have ONE good KPI and this guy has to list 6.  Well, I bet he isn't accountable to the community, is he?  Oh, completely opensource.  With all repos in Github, and a running version hosted in the cloud...  Fine, fine.  BUT, he probably doesn't know his way around the auditing protocol, eh?  That'll trip him up for sure.  What?  He has 5 previously funded proposals, all 100% up to date?  AND the timeline barely requires a single audit before completion?  Alright, alright.
