While DID and Atala Prism is still relatively new and while I am not an expert in DID technology (but definitely interested in the model) the proposer clearly articulated why the proposed solution is important to be able to serve the challenge goals. It basically provides another fundamental technology that will help to develop the challenge objectives. While the proposer well explained the relationship between RootsWallet and WAL-CLI it could have been helpful to also include Atala Prism and a digram including the various solutions. Another way to explain it to nontech people (like myself) is through a simple use case. (I review the proposal as it is the last day and you have only three reviews - so giving my perspective, I am active with Catalyst for about 9 months now)\n\nWhat is missing for me is the long-term vision of the project and financing model. What will be the goals within 6 or 12 months and further? Would it be a service for the community or product/features that could be commercialized? How many applications will use the solution within x period? How it will be offered/ promoted? This is why I gave only 4 stars. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "While I am able to review the technology solution, based on my experience as CA & VCA since fund 6, I can evaluate the proposal based on the information provided. \n\nThe proposer provides evidence that he knows well the subject and provided information about his involvement with Catalyst as well as with Atala Prism as part of the first cohort of the Atala Prism Pioneer Program. The proposer provided LinkedIn of the two key members. The proposer already got two proposals funded in fund 7 and it could have been good to share some progress report if any as they are related proposals. The proposer knows, in an identifiable manner, the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal. The information provided in the proposals as well as the coordination with other related developers https://www.rootsid.com/rootsid , indicated good knowledge of the subject. \n\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items and seems reasonable to achieve the set goals and offers a realistic timetable to complete the work. The plan describes the resources necessary to implement the proposal. Again not being a tech person, I evaluate it based on the way the information is provided and not on a deep tech understanding. The proposer has considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "A roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement is well presented. The deliverables are presented within the roadmap. It would have been good to have a separate section summarizing the deliverables.

Overall the community will be able to audit the proposal through the Github links and open source approach of the prospers. A progress report on previously funded proposals could have been helpful here to reflect audiatability going forward (however taking into account that funds were provided less than one month ago). \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_636", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 613, "q0": "There may be some questions about the difference between this proposal and the other RootsWallet Presentation Exchange proposal.  That proposal was more focused on a verifier--holder relationship and of characterizing relationships, while this one is the secret sauce for the Issuer, which is the next step up from the root of trust for the platform.  As such, these protocols allow the Issuer to overlay a transport agnostic protocol for defining similar characteristics and requirements to to verifiers and holders, so Issuer--verifier/holder.  The issuer has more possible states, and interactions with it create a much larger state map to contend with, so this chunk of the SSI puzzle is larger and just as critical as the other.  Without these protocols, an Issuer loses the ability to present different requirements for the same credential exchange, which breaks true SSI which requires the ability to send a credential in multiple verifiable ways to the same party based on why they are asking for it.  These are the types of modules that take broad digital identity concepts and start to slice and dice it with enough complexity to allow for true self-sovereign identity, with its attendant privacy, security and functionality.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The timeline and workflow were so well detailed that the protocol almost compiled while I was looking at it!  These timelines that RootsID has been including in their proposals really raise the bar for me when assessing other proposal's implementations of known protocols.  The team has already been working on the CLI for the Issuer wallet so this integration is not a new issue but one they have been preparing for.  The budget is for a full 3 months and is broken down into hourly rates for the different sprints, so it is easy to parse, with the hours lining up well with the tasks.  There are not really any issues that they should face in execution...they mention the standards can change, but these Presentation Exchange protocols are pretty solid, and the kinds of changes that can be expected (having protocol differentiate between null states, for example, \"server failure\", \"timeout\", \"cancel\", that kind of thing) shouldn't have any bearing on rolling out working code.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Opensource means never having to say \"you're sorry but you can't find it\".  They have included links to the repo it will be tracked in, the workspace they will be using to assign tasks and built an announcements page for the repo to curate the commits for anyone following along.

The proposal attempts to address the missing components that are necessary to fully realize a DID ecosystem, which their solution is designed to do. \n\nI think the proposers could have done a bit better of a job explaining the exact problem they are seeking to answer and how their solution fits. For example, they say that having WAL-CLI being compatible with RootsWallet will close the existing gaps but it is not clear why or how it will do this. I am left wondering what exactly are the gaps you are seeking to address? \n\nTo get full marks here, I would have liked to see the proposers explain the potential of extrapolating their findings to other groups working in a similar space.
