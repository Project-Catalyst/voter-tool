A key phrase can't help because the wallet is more than a pointer to the blockchain, it actually is filled with stuff.  In a full SSI environment, the ability of Issuers to respond quickly to requests to replace SSI compliant DIDs and VCs is half the battle, but there will always be a need to make backups of the digital identity data where that kind of agile response can't be expected (which means everywhere at present, though some .gov type credentials are getting to be pretty quick).  If you just export the data, and then lose the wallet that encrypted it, you will end up with an unusable blob.  The current business solution is to use third party providers who can store the backup in a recoverable way, but now you are not SSI compliant (but this is so important that many use it just to have the backup functionality).  The RootsID team is planning on implementing the most SSI of the limited (but changing rapidly) landscape for solutions here, the HyperledgerARIES protocols.  In this protocol non-selective data is encrypted and wrapped with an encrypted key, to which you have a passphrase (paper wallets can be implemented as needed, of course).  You can't isolate data or pick and choose, it is all or nothing for the export, but the export does become software agnostic at that point.  To import, you can only use a fresh clean wallet, so it is a complete restart.  Another benefit of solving this problem is the ability to run the same wallet content on multiple devices (doesn't have to be the same wallet software).  A critical solution that will make RootsWallet an even better SSI solution, and not just a toy for collecting DIDs.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I'll be honest, though I love this project and all its progress, this is one area where I am not confident of their success.  It is probably the most challenging of the Beta protocols they are adding to RootsWallet, IMO.  What I am confident in is that they picked the right path, true SSI, and didn't opt for a shortcut here.  Also, I can get on board with the ARIES protocol, it is probably the most reliable solution, if limited, though it is iterating at a rate that may prove difficult to develop alongside.  But with this as their choice, I look at the budget and feel like they have really committed time and resources here, so I suspect they feel it will be a challenge as well.  I would have liked to have seen those development sprints mapped out a bit more, as it would have helped me understand their approach to the protocols as well as how the timeline was going to fit the 13 weeks (the included timeline was for the whole project and lacked details for this particular development path and the budget roadmap, while fine for cost, was not clear for the development sprints).  I also would have liked to see more explanation of the \"cloud storage\" part of the timeline, which I assume is included in this proposal.  If the suggestion is that a 3rd party solution is under consideration for the backup/recovery function...I suppose that would get a resigned sigh from me.  Less than ideal but understandable.  However I believe, if present, they see it only as an available option, not to be implemented from the wallet protocols, and thus not violating the inherent SSI of the RootsID project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As an opensource project, and with excellent repos already set up across the length and breadth of RootsID, I expect nothing less than more of the same:  project transparency, responsiveness to public issues and audits, and continued engagement with the AtalaPRISM cohorts, many, many of whom are working on projects right alongside RootsID.  In fact, one thing I appreciated about this proposal was the inclusion of the list of no less than 16 grassroots partners in Catalyst that will be releasing their community experiments and solutions using RootsWallet as their foundation.  They have included a robust list of KPIs to choose from, have shown a willingness to add auditors to the Jira tracking, and plan on releasing updates bi-weekly rather than monthly.  If the problem is solvable without roadblocks, I expect they will be able to keep it on track and up to date with the community.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 10, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Wow, what a review!  Your thoughtful and detailed comments do not go unnoticed and will even help our execution.  Thank you for taking the time to be so specific and express your preferred features.  We will do our best to make it a reality :)\nThe traditional cloud will be an option.  But our long-term plans (starting with this proposal) will be a decentralized solution that the blockchain/decentralized/SSI community can be proud of.  It will be a whole ecosystem of security including technical and governance agents working together to form a security blanket for identities.\nAll that to say, this will be a step towards our vision of removing the anxiety of losing ones digital identity.  Queue the calming whisper voice 'Helping you keep your self-sovereign identity 100% safe and secure', lol.  We'll get there :)"}, {"id": 8254, "q0": "Yes, this proposal effectively addresses the challenge by developing an open-source credential wallet (Roots Wallet) that can be used across a variety of applications, while maximizing the security and safety of the Cardano blockchain. What is exciting about this project is the impact it will have not just for the proposal itself but for all the partners listed. A reason why this is so significant is because it shows that their solution takes a very broad objective as it's goal (using credential wallets as the user access point for decentralized ID) but then uses their partners to test the effectiveness of their solution. This type of cross collaboration of products working towards the same goals not only reduces the redundancy of duplicating work but also allows the team to focus on the specific functions needed for the projects to succeed. \n\nThis specific proposal is impactful is because it seeks to include a store/use/backup/recover option for users. This is significant as it reduces the likelihood of a user forgetting their password and being completely locked out of their account - as is the case currently with crypto wallet-only solutions. As Cardano looks to be adopted by the average person, this type of safeguard can make for a more pleasant and less stressful experience. \n\nAnother strong indicator of the impact for this team is the inclusion of the Butch Clark, the Technical Liaison for DISH, and the overall team lead for all DISH blockchain-related development. As Dish brings millions of users online the RootsWallet may be their first interaction with digital identity, and by having the team lead as a sitting contributor to the proposal (and final solution) there is a high potential that the solution will be adopted once live. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. This proposal will focus on including the store/use/backup/recover option into the existing wallet. Given that the RootsWallet is already well under development, the integration of this component seems highly feasible. \n\nWhat I appreciate most about the plan is the clear staging by which the team plans to delivery. Their infographic highlighting the roadmap is very complex but does a good job at identifying all of the moving pieces within this project's multi-faceted approach. The team clearly showcases their capacity for integrating the storage features into their wallet through their credentials and videos provided. \n\nAnother strong feasibility indicator hinted at above is the open collaboration approach the team is taking. Rather than working in isolation on their solution, this collaboration will allow the team to better understand and implement solutions that are necessary for users. The prioritization of functions by these partners will allow the team to deliver a product that is effective and useful. \n\nFinally, the budget is broken down in alignment with the deliverables and clearly shows how the funding will be spent. The team and plan appear will equipped to deliver a successful project and voters should give serious consideration to funding this proposal given the potential return for the broader community. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal. What is a strong indicator that the community can audit the proposal is the open-source nature of their solution. This open-source by design approach indicates that they are open to scrutiny and community feedback in order to refine their product. The use of github creates an easy way for the team and community alike to track the success of the project. The team commits to publishing github issues, project views, and commits, as well as a development sprint reporting. \n\nAnother very strong audit indicator is the partnerships with other projects in this space. This type of collaboration creates its own feedback loop where documentation and development decisions are put to the test across a broad range of use cases to identify errors/bugs and find solutions. The diversity of partners will also force the team to remain agile and attentive to all moving parts given the demands placed on them at any given time. It can be assumed that each partner proposal will also undergo auditing, which would include the success of the RootsWallet integration. \n\nWhat could be an interesting caveat to include in future funding rounds is the process that Dish will use or is applying to audit the solutions on their own end. How will the team maximize these external audits opportunities to support a smooth implementation. This is not necessary and therefore does not affect the score here, but it could be beneficial. Excellent work overall. \n\n\n\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_66", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Thank you very much for the detailed and specific review!
