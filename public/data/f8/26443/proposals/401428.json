I'm not really seeing what the role of DIDs and VCs are in this implementation.  Presumably the proposer wants either Identity wallets that make transactions, or transaction wallets that can hold identities (not as easy as it might sound).  Even if the solution is two wallets interfacing with eachother, or an Identity wallet working with a transaction backend (a user goes to the trouble to have an identity wallet, but not a regular crypto wallet?), I am still not seeing the incentive for the DID.  Tx history is already available to both parties, and DIDs and SSI don't give access to that information for others unless the protocols call for it, but that would be a massive privacy bust.  One of the solutions that the proposer says they are pursuing is to make the whole experience better for end users, but I fail to see how adding complex DID mechanisms as an overlay to just a plain, anonymous, crypto-wallet transaction makes it better.  The claim here is that it adds security, but what security is provided that you don't already have with crypto?  Digging into the FOS whitepaper they include only muddies the waters even further.  With multiple technology rollouts stacked on one another I saw glaring weaknesses that are never addressed, particularly the need to onboard stakeholders that in my mind would have absolutely no incentive to onboard to the technology. They give the example of scanning a QR code to pay for a cup of coffee, the implication that this would work for everyday stuff.  No mention of where the QR code comes from or what funds you tapped to pay for it, but ignore that for now.  The real issue is that this \"Infinity\" protocol has to be the system both parties are using, not just one.  That means either the coffee shop is running their BTS protocol, or your freaking bank is.  The implication throughout the whitepaper is that banks will be running this.  How else to get the transaction qualities he is suggesting?  The other implication is that big exchanges like Coinbase will be using this.  Again, what possible incentive do these guys have to abandon Visa, or standard wire transfers?  Fees?  They don't pay fees, they COLLECT them, users pay fees.  And of course users want something else, that is why they adopt crypto and see promise in ideas like this, but unless the other side also adopts it, these everyday use case just aren't going to happen.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There isn't enough explanation of just what the technology stack is as presented in this proposal.  After doing my own leg work to dig up their past proposal and find their whitepaper to try to understand their references to \"Infinity\", I have come to the conclusion that DIDs are not something that can integrated into the stack as they are describing it, and furthermore have no role in the stack.  The included timeline gives no actual architecture buildouts, no descriptions of what is needed to create the decentralized ID wallets.  The wallets, a UX, and Infinity development are all listed as if they were standard line items ,and the budget doesn't help either with little granularity and costs broken down into just monthly salaries.  For the claims provided of executing POS transactions out of an Identity interface of some kind, with no suggestion that both parties need to be using all the same protocols, and explicit suggestions that they certainly don't need to be using the same currencies (implying crypto is on the table), the technology explanation simply needs to be made clearer, especially the part about the DIDs.  When you take into consideration that this is a one man team (maybe with one friend added) the scope also seems to start seeming like too much.  The budget doesn't seem unreasonable for a mid-level project, even as just one phase of funding, but I would have liked to see much more granularity, especially around the development sprints to give an idea of what exactly is being built out here...", "q1r": 3, "q2": "They tell us that the execution phase (basically all of the development work, I think) is broken into submodules, but they haven't been included.  It is possible that one missing element may help explain much of what doesn't line up here.  They don't list any relevant KPIs except for the release of a Beta to test, but that isn't until almost 2 months into the project.  Also, that beta seems to be the deliverable for the project, presumably with some successful testing layered on, but they don't indicate exactly makes for a completed project except to note that it will be used by end users.  Something that would be handy here might be the expected test cohort for the Beta, or the onboarding of specific businesses to be running the POS, or a target for how many businesses they want running it.  The onboarding of the businesses and whoever is the holder of DIDs, especially is the make or break element to the underlying protocols, so a deeper explanation of their incentives and how many could be onboarded with those incentives would be a KPI for sure.  They indicate they will be keeping the community up to date, and the whitepaper suggests that they will be seeking as much funding through Catalyst as they can, so no doubt they are incentivized to follow through.  The biggest concern is the unknown state of the underlying Infinity architecture, the reliance on that for this proposal, as it was only just funded in Fund7.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 8, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2552, "q0": "This proposal seems like a great idea to bring businesses more potential growth from the Cardano network and ecosystem, but what makes it differ from the already existing Atala Prism? Having businesses and personal transactions on chain with identifiable credentials is reassuring to the buyers and sellers, though it may be more difficult finding those interested to partake and the adoption into another Cardano based system (Infinity). What's the key differences with this app compared to the existing Atala Prism app already developed? The proposer seems to have a better understanding of the challenges than the average person might come to realize in with the future use case of said app developed. Explaining this to a business owner on how they could potentially benefit from using a Cardano based application, might leave them scratching their heads. With an easy to use App for these individuals who want a secure and verifiable way for transactions and identity, will this app have any educational tools that explain it's importance to adopt blockchain technology over other resources? As we're still early to mass adoption on a global scale, it's unclear how this app could be implemented or advertised; at least to a broader audience beyond the existing Cardano community.

Credentials of one individual/proposer is not necessarily enough information to realistically accomplish the timeline given to be completed.

Are these members not yet acquired or has there been contact with said future developers for the completion of all phases? It would be beneficial to know what credentials they may have in regards to App development and UX Design and the creation of a \"user friendly\" interface upfront. Having some type of website that may outline such plans would be better to have within the proposal to follow the progress of the timeline defined or at least the existing infrastructure behind the capabilities of the app. With these details, it would be easier to say these are reasonably achievable feats to be finished within the set parameters from the proposer.

Basically, each phase depends on one's previous success to move forward, starting with planning within a 2 week period for an estimated cost. This period of planning could be explained by the proposer for the Catalyst voters to better understand what might be involved that merits such costs. Furthermore, the proposer understands the risks and challenges in developing the backend services this app will require, but any new unexpected challenges that may arise are not mentioned nor any solutions to them. Having a link to the Infinity Project of Catalyst Fund 7 would provide a better understanding and seems essential to this proposal's success.

The proposer suggests that the development of a dApp build on the \"infinity backend\" will allow identity to be integrated into personal and business transactions. Unfortunately, the proposer gives no indication of background on the infinity backend, what form this dApp would take, and how identity would be integrated via Atala Prism. This makes it challenging for voters to have confidence that this project would have an impact. What would be the motive for people to use your dApp compared to others being built? \n\nAnother piece of information missing is the linkages to existing efforts on Cardano. For example, the proposer suggests they will leverage payment networks being built on Cardano but none are identified and there is no evidence that these projects are not already undertaking similar efforts. In order to increase the impact score, I would encourage the proposers to provide more specifics as to why their solution is needed (such as due to a lack of viable options). In its current format, the proposal suggests that such a gap exists yet does not justify that claim with any information for voters. \n\nFinally, the proposers should provide a better mitigation strategy for their identified risks. Given that there are several components pivotal to the success of the project (a clear technical understanding of Atala Prism, Self sovereign identity (SSI), verifiable credentials (VC) and decentralized ID (DID).

This lack of information may have voters questioning the feasibility of this project as there is a level of trust needed, that I'm not sure has been met. \n\nAnother reason why I am only giving moderate scores here is that there is no explanation of what the dApp actually is, how it will operate, and how it will be placed into the hands of people who need it. It's good to say that identity will be linked to transactions through the dApp but is that enough? How will the identity be issued? Who will verify the identity?
