The differences would be to bring terminology to the forefront instead of as an addendum to the coding protocols, to succinctly deliver the clarifications on things like trust registries contained in the numerous fireside chats, and to bypass the testing and Q&A sessions by providing workshop style support for anyone wishing to put the GitBook to use.  I mention the Pioneer course because one of the aspects of it was to work with the Atala SDK, and with this proposal's goal being for someone who accesses the GiBook to be able to execute the basic DID calls and VC verifications, there will need to be some version of the SDK to run.  They indicate a partnership here with RootID project, a Catalyst project in parallel development that has a testnet wallet that is essentially the same thing as the Atala course SDK, so I suspect this is what people will be using to clarify their understanding from reading the GitBook.  This kind of hands on education could help many, many more people become comfortable with the complex world of DIDs and SSI, and to add the multilingual component to it just makes it all the more impactful.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "They have taken responsibility here for the first English version and then the first three translations (which appear to be languages the team may have experience with), so I don't think the team is biting off more than they can chew.  They have given themselves 6 months to complete the project, and the only issue that I have with the way the plan, timeline and budget come together, is the description of the workshops.  We don't really have details to figure out if these are live support events, or more static learning resources such as videos provided for the GitBook.  Either way it would have been good to see more of a breakdown of how these were to be delivered and what their measure of success was.  This lack of detail also creates a lack of clarity around the Wallet partnership, and whether they envision the wallet experience being a part of the GitBook hands-on process, or a separate deliverable tied to the workshops, or even just a general link for anyone to follow of their own accord.  The budget doesn't clarify any of this for us, as the workshops are only included in the Design phase, though they may be part of the marketing budget line item as well.  A reworking and clarification of the timeline/roadmap would help put this otherwise excellent proposal at the top of many lists.  In fact, I would say that just the GitBook and translations are a solid project, and if the hands-on wallet experience can be included, whether as a walkthrough in the GitBook, or as a series of workshops leveraging the GitBook material, than that would just be a bonus.  In general I would say this proposal is very close to a top rating with just a little tightening up.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It would be good to see a fair number more milestones (this comes back to reworking that roadmap) or deliverables, as the auditability section is a bit sparse.  The general educational resource and translations side of things is very tight, as they will obviously be available as opensource repos, and the community can immediately begin to work on more translations of the material.  But the Wallet/Workshops side of the proposal has a lack of clear vision that makes it hard to picture exactly how we might measure their success.  Again, tightening up the descriptions, timeline, budget to better account for the addition of the workshops, and how the Wallet experience is threaded through the project will provide the key indicators that this project is able to stay on track.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 6, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5601, "q0": "The proposer would like to offer an online course for SSI. Basically, there is not much material currently available, so the idea for a course is quite reasonable and useful. However, we are still in a very early phase as far as SSI is concerned. We are still far from a general adoption phase and the added value of translating a course into languages other than English is relatively minor. If someone is not fluent in English (most of us are not native speakers) and then learns about SSI in a course, they will not be able to do anything with the knowledge, because all the technical material is in English as well.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I would have liked to see more attention paid to the course content. To create and think through these properly is the essential part of the work. The rest of the timeline is very rough and lacks clarity.

However, having a basic understanding of blockchain is important given its foundational nature to DIDs, and specifically Atala Prism on Cardano. By developing an introductory course to DIDs that can be delivered to different multilingual communities, more individuals from diverse backgrounds can come to gain the same knowledge. \n\nThe reason why I am not giving full impact marks here is because there are several other projects within this challenge committing to developing similar introductory courses. If all these projects do their courses in isolation the impact on the broader community of each specific project may not be as great as the information would be spread out. I'd encourage the proposers to think how they could partner with existing efforts/projects to align efforts for greater impact.

While they identify SSI/DIDs as the focus, what specific components will you be looking at? Since blockchain is pivotal to DIDs, will you include basic blockchain education? What types of materials will you provide: worksheets, modules, videos, games? How will you verify the information with the community? \n\nI commend the proposer on identifying other contacts who will become partners to get the material into the hands of communities looking to issue and verify DIDs.

As mentioned above, there are several groups intending to work on an introductory course and it will be vital for these groups to work together to ensure accuracy and accessibility of information. This type of effort should welcome peer review and community challenges, particularly as \"an accessible and standardized approach for any community to learn about and use the SSI/DID technologies\" is quite subjective.
