For a lot of people, the idea of finally having control of their advertising data, without having to forgo those relationships with straight up advertising abstinence, is very attractive.  What really gives me hope about a platform like this, when it comes to consumers, is where it talks about educating its users about the value of their data and privacy.  Straight education on this subject is lacking, with almost all useful information in a package deal with how malevolent our business leaders are and how untrustworthy our institutions are.  And while there is work to do there, it wasn't until I found the SSI space that I was able to get clear information about the real value of a consumer's privacy, and the real potential to own the digitial identity that was being swept up by everyone but the consumer, to not just hide it away behind a VPN, but to own it.  As a business owner, I can say that the legacy ad-tech behemoth adds zero value for most market participants.  Millions of businesses are desperate for a way to dialogue with our customers in a meaningful, reciprocal way, both sharing in the value of the relationship.  Like the learning for the consumer, ad-tech hides all the real value to businesses as well, with every customer engagement hidden behind algos that assure us we are being heard and that when someone does X followed by Y they always choose Z over A, so our ad money is coming back 500%.  I don't have a huge multinational business, but I know that the best person to tell me if they are interested in my product is the customer, and in the world we live in now, I want the access to them that has been shut away from me and hidden.  Businesses want to set their prices correctly, they want to iterate their product and give it more value.  My only caution is for the users of a platform like this to be patient, as a lot of businesses with a lot to offer on a platform like this may be squinting and stumbling around a bit when they first come into the light.  They have been looking at the shadows on the cave wall for so long they may take a bit of time to adjust.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This well constructed team is really starting to pick up steam.  They have begun to come under the wing of IOG at this point, to give you an idea of how much support they are getting in approaching this project in a way that meshes with the values of the ecosystem.  The budget isn't small, but they are bringing in top developers and project managers to bring this penultimate stage home, and the rates reflect that.  I like that they have an iterative timeline for the development in place, meaning they will be looking for feedback along the way, which is huge.  The success of this really rests on the early participation of users more than businesses (the longterm success will be from business adoption...I believe many user-side platforms are going to spawn from this and there will be some dilution there), and the company has wisely limited the initial business participants for the proof of concept rollout.  The timeline is very clear, and really has been since fund 6, with a clear vision and patient approach.  Their 6 month timetable is really more like 5 months, as the deliverable is present as a PoC in the finalizing stage, which means this project isn't slowing down at all.  As to the integration of Atala under this proposal, I have only one small note of disagreement, and it is their item#6 for uses, where it refers to the users Data Vault...  They don't talk about the data vault at this point in the roadmap, but it is highly unlikely that Atala will be their answer for that, for a technical reason regarding being able to backup/restore the encrypted data.  There isn't a lot of obvious solutions for that out there (and you could do an implementation of ARIES on Atala for a fix that isn't terribly versatile) so this isn't what I would call a serious issue, except in terms of principles going forward, which is general risk factor and area of caution:  Profila needs to give careful thought to any parts of its solutions that rely on trusted 3rd parties.  That stuff will just hold it back in the long run.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "With opensource protocols in place, and GitHub repos to parse, I decided to take a look and see how they had done on projects they had already been funded on.  Out of 5 projects that I found going back to fund 5, they are 100% up to date on their reporting. Every project.  Am I worried at all that they will lack transparency?  Nope.  Am I concerned that the scope of the project is ready to overwhelm them, or that this phase is not going to stay on track?  Not at all.  They have the same solid timeline and roadmap format, the same development model, a team that gets stronger everytime they propose with more support and oversight.  It looks to me like things should keep making progress and we could be seeing a beta by Q4 at the latest.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 8, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 8263, "q0": "Yes, this proposal effectively addresses the challenging. It's primary focus is to put users back in control of how their data is used, and to be rewarded for companies using that data. By having credentials available through Atala Prism with the security features of the blockchain, companies and users will be able to manage how their identity is used across the web through a variety of easy-to-use applications. This one-stop-shop reduces the need for users to input their same information across numerous platforms, as is the case with most companies now, but instead provides a clear line between company and each specific user. The blockchain will also allow any sort of incentivization or rewards to be paid directly to the user without requiring additional information. \n\nThe team will also maximize the features of Atala DIDs by using zero knowledge proofs so companies are not privy to personal information that is of no relevance to their objectives. As it currently is, users provide vast amounts of data to these companies but once submitted have very little control over how it is used and by whom. The limiting of data to only those pieces that are required can give confidence to users that they will not be taken advantage off by existing marketing and sales tactics. \n\nAnother strong indicator for the potential impact of this proposal is the work that is already underway and the relationships that are already built. One example is the proposer's work with Radisson Hotels. If these brands are already committed to testing this idea, the potential upside of having household names participate in this solution is massive and would likely give massive returns to the ecosystem. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. The team already has a significant number of Catalyst-funded proposals regarding their proof of concept for their app. A strong indicator for the feasibility of this project is the fact that their application is already complete and the addition of Atala Prism DIDs will provide additional functionality while improving the reach of Cardano. This also implies that the team can hit the ground running and does not need to wait to develop the necessary skills. \n\nThe team's plan also has a built in peer-review process whereby the team will undergo scrutiny from developers within and external to the ecosystem. The benefit of operating in this way is that the more people who get eyes on the project the more likely it is for bugs and errors to be found and fixed. This approach is also strengthened by the team's commitment to participate directly with IOG to develop and test their product in line with Atala specs and technical requirements. \n\nThe team does a good job at exposing their credentials with easy to follow links that can be verified. From what is provided, the team clearly has the skills to complete this work and are likely to be successful. Their experience with major brands also is a good sign given their plan to link with major retail player. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal. The success of this project is quite simple to audit given it will be easy to tell whether they were able to integrate Atala into their application, however, I would have liked to see more specific indicators for this specific component. As currently written the majority of the success indicators are on the app itself and not necessarily the Atala DID component. \n\nThe team commits to using github to track their progress, which is an open source repository, making the project open by design. They will also make regular updates on a weekly and monthly basis to the community through existing reporting structures such as the Catalyst Coordinators, and new venues such as their newsletter. \n\nWhat is most exciting about this proposal is the external audits that they will undergo by partnering with major brands, such as the Radisson Hotels. These use cases will certainly test the functionality and limitations of the application. This type of iterative feedback in the development and implementation stage provides opportunities for the team to address problems as they occur, which in itself is a sort of auditing process.

Having already received funding from catalyst six times prior, starting with fund 5, the problems solved by Profila are inseparable from the mission of Cardano. Self sovereign identity (SSI) is a core value of our community and the use of DIDs (digital identification that is managed and controlled by the individual rather than corporations or governments) enables the end user to control who sees their information and exactly what information they will have access to. Profila will use Atala Prism integration to allow users to create their own SSI which can then be monetized by selective advertising in which the individual will choose which brands will have access to their information, while still retaining anonymity. Advertising revenues will be shared equally (50%/50%) between the individual and Profila, The onboarding target for years end is 100,000 individuals to generate DIDs in 3 different geographic regions in Europe and the US. Successful implementation of this project will also greatly benefit the Cardano ecosystem as adoption of Atala Prism would be accelerated significantly. Adoption rates would increase amongst individuals and companies wishing to market their brands in this innovative process. KYC is required of the individual but will not be shared with the businesses that are advertising their brands. Zero Knowledge Advertising (ZKA) is the terminology used by Profila to describe the preservation of individual anonymity whilst providing access to advertisers/brands using financial incentives as a reward for participation. In order to protect the advertisers from fraudulent misuse by unscrupulous individuals, KYC is necessary, but the individual's identity will be shielded from the advertisers through ZKA. Both web based and mobile based (iOS and android) applications will be accessible to users whether they be individual entities or businesses/brands. Profila is seeking $67,500.00 in funding for a 6 month development period. The vast majority of this funding will be used by developers, with the remainder being earmarked for legal and project management work. The budget includes 20 days of funding for Atala Prism experts led by Carlos Vargas, but surprisingly there is no line item amount specified. It may be open ended, and thus unspecified, but it would be helpful for clarification of this budgetary item. However, it is important to note that additional funds are anticipated to be generated by the issuance of the Zeke token. The initial sale of Zeke is slated for March 21st. A 3 tiered token offering releasing 28% of the 500 million Zeke total supply will commence with a seed round, followed by a private round on April 1st and concluding with a public round beginning on April 15 of this year. Zeke is a Cardano Native Asset which can be purchased with ADA, ETH, BTC, USDT, CHF, USD, and EUR. The tokenomics are as follows: 28% public sale, 24% ecosystem and referral rewards, 20% marketing and development, 15% team, 8% service providers and advisors, and 5% token liquidity and listing fees. Although not explicitly stated in the proposal, the tokenomics suggest that end user revenue will be paid in Zeke (Zero Knowledge Token). Overall, this project demonstrates a perfect alignment of the problem addressing the challenge. Thru integration with IOHK and Atala Prism, there is tremendous upside.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given that this project has received prior funding 6 times in the past, has an extremely strong team, and has unshakable alliances in the community, successful implementation seems unquestionable. This is part 2 of a prior funded proposal that creates SSI (self sovereign identity) through the use of DIDs (digital id's) produced through the use of Atala Prism. Enabling individuals to receive revenue while maintaining anonymity is a unique and rewarding construct that will most likely gain a significant foothold in the rapidly changing digital economy. Having received funding for three consecutive rounds indicates that the Cardano community is deeply invested in the success of Profila, and had they not been achieving road map goals and KPI's, it is unlikely that they would continue to secure funding in each successive round. The team is quite strong with very successful and experienced international players with a history of excellence and implementation of blockchain based businesses in the past. The architect of the current proposal, Michiel Van Roey, is a Fullbright Scholar, Erasmus Scholar and has extensive experience in Intellectual Property, Information Technology and Knowledge Transfer. Michiel is a European qualified business lawyer who has worked in the US and Europe. Cisco ,Benelux and CERN (European Center for Nuclear Research) have retained MIchiel's services as an attorney prior to his co-founding of Profila, Having successfully represented these entities, there is little doubt that his involvement in this project is an indication that this project will be a stunning success. The core team at Profila is stacked with highly capable experts who collectively have over 135 years of experience in their fields of expertise. This is perhaps the most experienced and qualified group of professionals I have ever seen associated with any blockchain technology enterprise. The advisory board is also stacked with qualified personnel and includes interviewer extraordinaire Bullish Dumpling. The industry partnerships of Profila are no less impressive. IOHK, Catalyst, MIcrosoft, MLabs, Revuto are some of the extremely impressive industry alliances that this group has forged. Some of the educational entities that Profila has brought onboard include the University of Madrid and Luzern University. In conclusion, I cannot find any reason for this project to be anything but uber successful.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Ample KPI's, community and organizational communication, and AMAs define the methodology by which this project should meet and exceed the criteria of auditability. As the budget request is for a 6 month period, bi-weekly and monthly reporting is planned to be the mechanism by which the key metrics and KPI's can be audited by project Catalyst and the Cardano community. The only minor shortfall I can see from my perspective is that the line item funding for an Atala Prism expert is left blank. $47.500 of the $67,500 funding request is specified as follow: $18,000 for 20 days of work by a senior developer at $900/day. $20,000 split evenly amongst a web/backend developer and an app developer, each budgeted for 25 days and $400/day. $9,500 for 10 days of legal and project management work at $950/day. 20 days of work from and Atala Prism expert from a team headed by Carlos Vargas is the sole line item that is not accounted for and it is unknown if the $20,000 of the budget request that is unaccounted for would be sufficient funding to cover this expense. However, it must be noted that this project is currently in the seed phase of funding for the Zeke token, thus other funds should be available to complete any budgetary shortfalls this project may have from the total funds requested. The project proposal states that in addition to monthly Github updates which can be viewed at their Github repository, there will be bi-weekly updates to Catalyst coordinators and the Profila Cardano newsletter which can be viewed at https://ico.profila.com. Monthly project updates and KPI reports will be filed with the Catalyst team and be available for public viewing as well. Periodic AMAs are also promised, so a rigorous audit of the progress of this audacious project should be easily attainable.
