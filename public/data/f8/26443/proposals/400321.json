It goes beyond the domestic confines of this topic to focus on expanding markets in Africa and Asia. Protecting customer and supplier information to solve data security and payment problems is extremely necessary. The proponent chooses this topic which brings both great challenges and human values \u200b\u200bto the industry. healthcare, while making a significant contribution to the expansion and development of the Cardano ecosystem . . .\n\nThis solution focuses on the Cardano Payment System which aims to process payments between customers and service providers to provide standardized, secure, secure, and anonymous money to customers. , avoid the risks associated with cash payment processing and cash transportation, and limit the use of pricing and payment solutions based on prevailing exchange rates. In addition, the payment system is verifiable and traceable to track and verify payments to suppliers and maintain the confidentiality of customer records.\nThis system provides benefits for saving money on record management, saving money about records management, reducing payment processing time, increasing efficiency in inventory control, increasing profits. Profit cuts many costs. By using cryptocurrency, eliminating cash payments minimizes theft and other losses.\nThe proposed solution will enable clients to preserve capital and obtain faster and easier legal responses, reducing regulatory fines and the risk of adverse business operations. At the same time, improving the security of assets and allowing assets to be moved from one location to another almost instantly, reducing their dependence on cash, the risks of storage, and transportation. Transfer cash and Have better and faster access to accounting records.\n\nIt can be seen that this proposal is not only open to the healthcare industry to develop based on the cryptocurrency blockchain platform, but can also be extended to all other industries, and of course when the system develops. the development opens up expansion opportunities for the Cardano ecosystem. ..\nAlthough they face many challenges, they always comply with relevant regulations. The current barriers, just need time, they will quickly be overcome. Because this is an international company, board approvals and issues regarding the integrity of the payment processing and medical records systems may be delayed due to regulatory requirements. regulation and supervision in each area of \u200b\u200bcompetence.\n\nTogether with a staff of more than 25 years of expertise in compliance, control, audit, regulation, investigation, security, government/legislative, gaming surveillance, healthcare and Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Customer Activity (KYC) controls. I believe They will overcome these current challenges, to bring the project to success, open up new paths for healthcare and Cardano, and spread value to industries. Other services applied successfully. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponent has given timeframes to implement the project, but it will be more complete if the timelines are detailed and specific at each point in time. According to this introduction, I also understand that developing a clearer solution roadmap is highly dependent on the agreement and settlement in cooperation between Pinnacle Consulting & Advisors and Salud and they are needing some time to develop a proof of concept solution. the concept for the medical record system and payment processing system.Hope they will have a quick solution giving a clear and detailed roadmap for the next solution.\nThe project budget is detailed, by the requirements of the challenge. The budget is divided into 3 parts with explanations for specific uses. The total budget for this project is $80,000. Including:\nContact support: $25,000\nSurvey: $35,000\nLegal Assistance: $20,000\nA strong team, with professional qualifications and extensive experience, is assigned to be in charge of a specific field. The attached personnel file helps the community to easily look up and track information. This shows that the Team has carefully and thoughtfully prepared, as a dedication in the field of healthcare for customers.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This project has not provided specific metrics, it is not difficult to assess the progress of the project. It can be seen that the construction of a roadmap for using Cardano, related to blockchain development for the record. healthcare is facing regulatory hurdles in different countries or regions.\nAlong with the efforts and preparation of the program crew. I also hope that they soon get Salud approved records system and at least one regulatory body. If that's the case, it's certainly easy to build a clear and specific route for the next time.\n\nCardano solutions and workflows demonstrate the ability to effectively document benefits, successful proof-of-concept for systems and service providers in other healthcare in the United States and internationally.\nThis project is a completely new project, based on what you guys have done Successfully in the US and internationally, I give you spiritual support for this project. I also have enough confidence that this project will successfully expand to Africa and Asia, creating a premise to expand the project to other countries around the world.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1534", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 8275, "q0": "Yes, this proposal effectively addresses the challenge by seeking to improve the Salud Healthcare service provider's operations through integrating DIDs on the Cardano blockchain. The team does a good job at explaining the existing problems caused by medical professionals needing to carry cash, such as theft, loss, and lack of traceability. By integrating Atala Prism DIDs into this system, the team plans to mitigate these problems. \n\nOn the whole, it appears the greatest benefit will be realized by Salud Healthcare through increased administrative and overhead savings. The new blockchain-based system will also allow better oversight and tracking of revenue flows both into and out from the company. The increased transparency will also likely benefit users of their services as they can be paid directly without money needing to physically change hands.\n\nThe impact on the Cardano ecosystem is less well documented in the proposal, but from what is written it is implied that this real-world use case would be an excellent proof of concept for other international health service providers who are looking to follow a similar approach. If successful, this project could create an influx of new bodies or even sectors entering the blockchain space, with a specific eye to Cardano. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the experience and plan presented it is likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. The work to be conducted in this proposal will actually be carried out not by Salud Healthcare directly, but through Pinnacle Consulting and Advisors, to build a proof-of-concept for Salud's medical records and payment processing systems. \n\nThe consultants provide a link to their website which highlights their skills in this area and ability to undertake this work. The teams, including both Salud and Pinnacle, even go so far as to add their resumes to the proposal, which lends further credit to their ability. The majority of the work to be undertaken will be research to identify which solutions are viable to be integrated into the Salud system. The two groups will work together to analyze and assess the possible solutions and developing the necessary data set to test out these solutions. \n\nThe reason why I am not giving full marks here is due to the uncertainty of the regulatory environment in which this solution will operate. The international focus of the proposal is both a strength and a weakness. A strength because it could mean acceptance in a multi-national company that could be extrapolated to other similar entities. It's a weakness due to the strict and sometimes contradictory regulatory environment at the international level that may create unforeseen, and potentially unsurmountable, obstacles. This latter point calls into question the feasibility of this proposal and would need to be more fully addressed to obtain the final point. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. Over the next twelve months, the community can expect the proposers to provide a roadmap for using DIDs for medical records, a list of solutions that could be implemented, and a risk matrix including regulatory hurdles. This research will likely be of great interest to different projects operating in this space, however it is not clear when and how this information would be provided to the Cardano ecosystem. \n\nGiven that the teams are working under non-disclosure agreements, there could have been a better description of how the team will update the community. If the information found is proprietary then what will you make public facing to allow others to use these findings? \n\nThe fact that the project is tying their success to being approved by regulatory bodies, both in healthcare and financials, indicates that they will also undergo external auditing processes by these bodies. Much like the last point, this could be made more explicit to voters so they know how you will update and share this information.

The proposal team will investigate how to incorporate this into the operations of Salud Healthcare and its customers. It is difficult to see how this fits with the goals of the challenge. There is a mention about Health Records, but no mention of using Atala Prism for digital identities or verifiable credentials. Only mention of Cardano as a payment system can be found. Would also recommend providing more information about what the project gains are for Cardano community. \n\nIf resubmitting this proposal in a future funding round, please emphasise more clearly how the proposal fits into the challenge goals.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal gives good insight into teams relevant background and experience and the proposal is supplemented by a nice Youtube presentation video. Project budget contain travel liaison support, investigation and legal support. The project also identified the risk for regulatory roadblocks. Pinnacle Consulting has a process to follow when mitigating this risk, but it is not easy to understand what the following means; \"Our mitigation efforts involve the routine access, historical experience and business and regulatory environments that Pinnacle Consulting & Advisors has with international affairs, regulated businesses, regulatory bodies, state legislators, the attorney general\u2019s office, and local elected officials.\"\n\nWhen implementing blockchain technology into the health care business, I foresee lots of regulations concerning data privacy that must be tackled and have low confidence for a successful implementation.\n\nThe neutral Feasibility rating for this proposal is not because I lack confidence in the proposal teams ability to create the documentation of the roadmaps. It is neutral because of lacking confidence in being able to implement changes in Salud operations.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Proposal gives no way to audit progress, only deliverables after project completion. Would recommend adding ways to monitor also the progress in a future proposal.\nThe proposal would benefit from more clarity around the deliverables.

There are two aspects to this: one is comprehensive research into how the healthcare provider currently operates and where the opportunities for blockchain arise, the second aspect is comprehensive research into being able to present these blockchain solutions to various regulatory bodies around the globe and gain acceptance for them. Where the impact comes into alignment with the challenge goals is in the establishing of a use case for Cardano (presumably PRISM but it may be an interoperable approach like INDY) in regards to a medical records protocol that passes muster with various regulatory bodies, especially the ones in Africa and Asia.  As primarily a research project, the impact isn't going to be felt immediately, or likely for 6-12 mos at best.  Rather, it will be felt when later healthcare or similar enterprises set out to  expand into their communities or other nations with a blockchain aspect securing their settlement and records layers, and find a Cardano path already paved for them.  If successful this proposal will have blazed such a trail for one willing participant, and will be able to approach others with similar goals, in a Cardano adoption long game with verified credentials as a major feature.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team around the Pinnacle consulting firm includes a lot of relevant experience, and they appear to have already done the early research into identifying the best places in their markets to try to leverage crypto and Cardano.  Their budget is fairly straightforward, if not very granular, with 3 budget items, each taking roughly a third of the total funding of $80k.  The timeline, likewise, isn't very detailed, laying out 3 major phases.  The first phase, which includes this proposal, also involves pinning down the nature of the solution to be delivered, in collaboration with the healthcare provider, which provides an explanation for why the roadmap isn't more detailed:  they have to complete the research to be able to know what to build.  In terms of delivering the research, they have laid out a clear sense of what problems the healthcare provider expects to face, and the possible avenues of exploration, so they are off to a good start, and it seems like the know how they want to approach the problems and deliver the research solutions.  Of the solutions they expect to pursue, they correctly identify enterprise crypto wallets as a requirement, and have indicated a good approach to developing and rolling out these deliverables in order to bring them into alignment with the solutions as they emerge from the research, a good example of making a journey of 100 miles despite only being able to see as far ahead as the 20ft your headlights illuminate.  The risks of dealing with multiple regulatory agencies across multiple jurisdictions are anticipated here and they suggest that developing relationships is the best way to mitigate those issues.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It will be a challenging proposal to provide updates on, as the non-disclosure agreement means they likely won't be able to share explicit discovery as their research uncovers the specifics of the use case they want to build out, but it is possible to carefully and thoughtfully provide \"the principles but not the specifics\" in a sort of Chatham House Rules style of disclosure.  As well, the team lead has spoken to this specifically and doesn't anticipate the NDA to casue any difficulty.  This isn't the type of project to maintain a social media presence or public discord, so the community will be reliant on timely KPI and progress reporting for the standard IOG audit format.  At this early stage, it is doubtful that GitHub commits will be a major source of transparency, so the relevant KPIs are essentially the key milestones of: a roadmap for the medical record solution with HIPAA considerations (if it isn't in their plan, Sovrin, DIF and the Liux Foundation all have robust research for HIPAA), a roadmap for a POS utilizing Cardano, and a general risk matrix for regulatory compliance.  All of these are basically late-bloomers:  even if they are in parallel development, they will likely be months in development, not weeks, and there is a likelihood of missed audit reports.  If that fact is taken into consideration along with the rough funding distribution it will cause, then the project should be able to mitigate the problems without getting blocked for lack of funding midstream.  To that end, they are encouraged to create some kind of public profile that keeps the community up to date on their progress, with updates to the KPIs and deliverables as they are discovered, and that can function as its own sort of KPI during the long sprints some of these deliverables are going to require.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 6, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5533, "q0": "The proposal starts by describing an unknown company based in Florida, with no names attached to it, no working Twitter, YouTube or Instagram links, named \u201cSalud\u201d and saying that \u201cBased on the reality that Salud is offering services within the United States and several other countries [\u2026] it is a primary importance to be able to review the current practices and procedures used by Salud.\u201d\nThen the proposal goes on to outline what procedures the team will undergo to evaluate and assess that unknown company, in order to implement cryptocurrency \u201csolutions\u201d.\nOnly further down in the proposal, in the feasibility section, do the proposers mention that \u201cPinnacle Consulting & Advisors is currently operating with Salud under a verbal agreement and a non-disclosure agreement to seek funding to build a proof-of-concept solution\u201d.\nConsidering the lack of transparency of the company they want to evaluate, but naming it as \u201ca primary importance\u201d and the verbal agreement they have, but put under non-disclosure, I cannot assess the proposal\u2019s impact and how well it addresses the challenge brief.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "From the team statements, it is unclear what the relation is between their company \u201cPinnacle Consulting & Advisors\u201d & the company they want to assess and build solutions for, named \u201cSalud\u201d. \nBased on this uncertainty, and the importance of this action, the timeline and detailed plan they have provided remain unclear.
