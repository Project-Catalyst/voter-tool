Like many projects that try to work with DIDs to solve issues, they have failed to adequately consider the role of a trust registry in any DID issuance scheme, which leads to problems down the line.  I was actually surprised that they didn't cover the trust registry, since they mention the importance of trust right in their problem statement.  The need here, is for verifiers of credentials issued from highschools (in Goma, in this case) to trust that the DID doing the issuing is trustworthy.  The implication here is that the highschools doing the issuing don't have a trust registry.  One way to solve that is to build a trust registry for every high school.  You could imagine starting a consulting firm to go around and offer that service.  The idea from the proposers is to collect a registration fee from issuers to list their issuing key with them, and for verifiers to be able to come to their website to see human readable artifacts based on the underlying Issuer keys and credential keys.  This is ok, but the issue still remains, why would a verifier trust this website?  I think the plan is a good start (and a human readable verification portal has its own usefulness, but would be very hard to monetize because issuers wouldn't be incentivized to participate).  Where I think the team needs to go from here is to actually develop their own trust registry, which can be a governance framework for evaluating a highschool's credentials and their value to the credentials holders.  Collaborate with highschools to create a clear and valuable list of roles and requirements.  Then offer those highschools enrollment in the framework (A DAO with a governance token is ideal in the long run, but just start with DIDs) by issuing the highschools a DID for a yearly fee.  In return the highschools are issuing credentials that are covered under your trust registry, and you can use your protocols to allow verifiers to check with you for human readable proofs of that trust.  Bottom line is that nothing gets fixed until some issuer is backed by a governance framework.  Its called \"trust in a trustless environment\" and it is the whole point of issuing DIDs.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "For the delivery of a simple DID verifier, this team and budget are definitely adequate, but I would like to see the addition of a specialist or skill set for thinking about the governance of the DIDs in the space they are operating on.  It is a great role for a student willing to dig into DIF and ToIP protocols, and I don't think adding the trust registry would even add much stress to the budget.  I would also like to see the timeline included and arranged in phases, ideally with trust registry design as the first deliverable, and then the website, etc. along with how long each is scheduled to take.  Without the trust registry, as covered, the project might function, but be unused.  Being able to read the canonical keys doesn't make them any more trustworthy.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The issue with the lack of a timeline, is that funding is distributed on that timeline, so there is no way to divide up the funding tranches.  I would say this project is between 3-6 months, erring towards 6, and that the team should set the success metric as the rollout of the functioning webapp, and ideally with an early milestone of rolling out a trust registry, for someone (the most lucrative opportunity would be for the business, but consulting with the highschools is an option).  The team shows a willingness to share progress in Townhalls and to add anything they can to opensource hubs, so the expectation is transparent communication with the community.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 3, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2493, "q0": "The project aims to address the problem of 'trust' and fragmentation of DIDs through Cardano DID validation and a user friendly app with readable DID formats.

The team seeks to develop a registration-based website where schoolboards can validate the Cardano-based DID and a dApp which provide human readable DID formats. \n\nThe team does a good job at articulating the problem and their solution in a concise manner. They clearly identify the requirements such a system needs to operate and remain sustainable over time. I appreciate their inclusion of creating a revenue-generating stream to the product so that it will be able to fund further development. The proposers also indicate their plans to link this solution to a variety of other Cardano-based DID applications, which will likely increase its potential impacts. \n\nWhat is most impactful about this proposal is the desire to link with existing systems that have their own level of trust already built in. The challenge will come from getting these entities to realize the value of the new system and commit to adopting it. Given that this is a WADA Hub proposal it seems likely the preliminary focus will be on Africa but this is not clearly stated. If that is the case, there may be more willingness to adopt this new technology compared to the more ossified or rigid institutions in the west. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. The team is comprised of members from the Goma Cardano Hub and will be responsible for the website development (and dApp?). Their roadmap outlines their activities to November 2022 with high level milestones in June and October. What I would have liked to see within the roadmap is a more fulsome discussion of the activities which will be undertaken at each stage. For example, in June 2022, the team will: \"collect public issuing keys from participating post-secondary learning institutions\", however how they plan to do so is unclear. What geographic area will this focus on? What schools will you attempt to get? How will you reach out to them to engage them in the process? \n\nI appreciate the team's links to their credentials so voters can verify them if they so choose. In addition, since they were funded in F7 to streamline Atala Prism as \"THE DID\", they team has already been approved by the community to undertake this work. The inclusion of school boards as the issuers and verifiers will further strengthen the F7 proposal. However, I think the team should have made better linkages to that proposal and provided a high level summary of it's objectives since this project is so strongly related. The way it is, there is an assumption that the other proposal is well understood but that's not necessarily the case. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. The team commits to using github to track and document their progress which is a good sign. The use of open-source tooling can give voters confidence that the team is willing to undergo community scrutiny and seek feedback. They also do a good job at identifying other tools they will leverage to deliver information to the community, such as youtube video updates and tutorials. \n\nThe development of a website also provides voters with a tangible deliverable by which success can be measured, however, the development of a website alone is likely not enough to call it a success. Here, the proposers could have done a bit better job at providing thresholds that will determine success. For example, is there a certain level of school boards that need to be onboarded before it can be a success? Is there a certain amount of traffic using the website (issuing/verifying credentials) that you are seeking to reach? How much money would you need to make from membership fees to be sustainable? \n\nWhile there is enough to audit the proposal, providing more specific information will reduce the need for voters to guess what success actually looks like.
