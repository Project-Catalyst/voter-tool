In short, it is about \u201ccarrying out the research necessary to formulate a viable approach to the use of Atala Prism digital IDs for refugees who have been forced to leave their home countries without identification documents\u201d. The proponents claim that a DAO will be created in order to support these refugees, from what I understand, Atala Prism DIDs would be created for each of them, and partnerships with other institutions such as UNICEF, for example, that already work in helping this community. I found this to be quite promising, however, some important explanations are still missing. Come on. At first, I would like to know more about the DAO that would be created. What activities would take place there? How will such a fragile people, victim of a sociopolitical scenario of chaos, be supported in the most essential instances, such as housing, health, food? How can Cardano contribute to this whole process? How would these people be educated to use their DIDs, and what advantages would this present to them? Another question that came to me was more about the research itself. We know what will be done, but not how it will be done. How will this research develop? By what methods will questions be raised? How will the proponent get in touch with the target audience, given that they are in such a difficult situation? I think that in theory, this proposal can be very useful for our blockchain, as it would work on one of the most urgent problems today, but it is not so clear what would happen in this DAO or through which research methods this project would be. reasoned. So I think that, yes, it could be a project that would help with the widespread adoption of Atala Prism DIDs, which is basically the main objective of this challenge, but more explanation would be needed for me to be really sure about the impact this would have. generate and also how it would meet the specific objectives of the challenge. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I found the proposal script to be average, we know that the total time is divided into phases and each phase contains X number of weeks. For example, in phase 1 the time range is from week 1 to 17. Various activities that would be performed in each of these phases are described; I found it average because, in the same way that this description is satisfactory (I thought that the way the activities were explained is very complete, giving us a good view of what is to come); the time intervals are too long. Phase 1 would span more than 4 months, so it would be much better if the bidders had broken the timeline into months so that we knew exactly what would happen in which. As explained, we do not know how long each of these activities would last, nor if it could happen in parallel, etc. Therefore, I think that this part of the proposal still deserved a better detail in this sense. Turning now to funding, bidders repeat the script and add the values \u200b\u200bof each task in parentheses. I found this part good, because in addition to the bidders specifying what would cost how much, they also inform the hours that would be dedicated to each activity. In this way, we can calculate the value of the hour of work in relation to that activity, and with that we can conclude if it is a fair value or not. Now, speaking of the team, we are introduced to 4 people (Jeffrey Downard, David Watts, Sylvan Magnus and Sarah Holcomb). I think that was the part that left the most to be desired in terms of feasibility, because very little is said about each of those involved. It would be necessary for us to know a little more about their CVs, their relationship with the Cardano ecosystem and also their linkedin profiles, in order to verify all the information mentioned. So I think the feasibility is not bad, but it could improve in some points. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of this project is good, with only a few things to improve. Speaking of the process, the proponents inform the expected results to be delivered in phase 1 of the project. I think it would be more interesting, as I mentioned for the script, if these partial results were divided monthly, in short, in a shorter time period for which it would be easier for us to monitor. I would also like to know how the Cardano community would establish contact with this team and their project, we know that there are standard meetings with the IOG coordinators, but how would the information be verifiable for all members of our ecosystem? I was also in doubt about the other phases. How can we monitor them? Now talking about the end results, I think the proponents report good metrics, but they are mostly numerical, note: \u201cnumber of whitepaper reads and downloads in academic research services + number of advocates recruited to support fundraising for the efforts relief + more than $100,000 raised is a moderate success; more than $1 million raised is a considerable success.\u201d I agree that it is necessary for us to assess the consequences of a quantitative optimum, but it would also be important for us to know how to qualitatively measure the impacts of the project, both for the refugee community and for the Cardano ecosystem. How would all this contribute to the mass adoption of Atala Prism DIDs? How will our blockchain become better known, respected, used? As I see it, proponents go to great lengths to audit how the project would help refugees through donations, but we also need to know how this auditability would be done targeting our blockchain more directly. Therefore, I would say that this topic of analysis is good, having to be revised in some ways. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 4, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 994, "q0": "NGO accountability can be difficult to track under current models, particularly during wartime, so a humanitarian crisis like the one currently unfolding in Ukraine will likely make for a good case study.

I'd like to hear a little bit more about the DAO aspect of the project here, and how a decentralized approach to these issues might work.\n\nWhile Ukraine does draw a lot of interest at the moment, it should be noted that the proposed DAO will--at least initially--be focused on individuals with disabilities.

Then we can assume that AtalaPrism could become one of the standards used, increasing both AtalaPRism and Cardano adaptation in the world. \n\nI am decreasing one star because I had to assume a lot :) which is basically a lot of conditions to make it happen.

When I summed all numbers, I have managed to get 14k instead of 15k, so it makes me wonder, where this 1k went.  Also, the hours used for the budget calculation are equal to one working month. It is not clear from the proposal whether this is a side project or the main activity of the team. \n\nSince only weeks 1-17 are the subject of funding, the proposers could have least set the expected time spent on the 5 tasks related to Phase 1. \n\nI believe that team is capable of successful implementation of the proposal, unfortunately, some essential information was omitted, and therefore I can not put a higher ranking based on my belief regarding the team.

Or you can create periodically articles, blogs, where you will describe your progress. I appeal to the team, on how to incorporate the measurement of proposal progress. A good idea might divide tasks into subtasks, and keep track of, whether they were met or no. \n\n\nRegarding the success, the proposers are stating even more metrics, but these are related to the \"progress\" but with specific figures.

While not specifically identified, this proposal seeks to address the DAO Governance in Practice component. Where I struggle to understand this proposal is in their leap from doing work internationally to support refugees to the development of a DAO for people with disabilities in Wyoming. What the proposers don't do is build this connection for how the DAO will be used as a bridge to these international efforts. I would have liked a direct linkage to be made so voters are not left wondering. \n\nOne thing that could have helped this proposal obtain a higher score is a more fulsome discussion of the existing body of research. As written, it seems like this information is not readily available yet there is no indication of any sort of scan being conducted, or evidence given, that such a gap exists. In addition, I am left wondering the scrutiny that the research paper will undergo and what type of verification of findings will be sought. Without any indication of what type of peer-review/validation will be carried out on the paper, it makes it hard to know what kind of impact this would have.\n\nFinally, I would encourage the proposers to pay a little more attention to the potential risks this project could face. While I appreciate their focus on needing to build the team as a challenge there is no sort of mitigation plan provided for how this could be overcome. It also seems unlikely that this is the only risk this project faces (immediacy of the problem they are trying to solve can't wait 17 weeks for a paper - the war is now; or getting resources into the hands of refugees or having them tested with target groups) yet these are absent.

While the broader project is spread out over a 52 week period, this specific proposal is only requesting the first 1-17 weeks where they will deliver a research paper, educational resources for refugees, incorporating their not-for-profit DAO, and developing a plan to move to stage 2. As each of these items is fairly narrow in scope on their own, it seems very doable in the allotted timeframe. Within the challenge brief, the Challenge Team highlights that funded proposers in this section seeking to build a DAO will have access/connection to the legal entities who created the first DAO - if funded this team would benefit greatly from that link and adds weight to the feasibility of the project. The team provides a decent background on each of the members and the link to their website is professional and inspires confidence from their existing participation within the Cardano and Catalyst ecosystems. The budget is reasonable at $15k for the outlined activities and the proposers provide a good breakdown of exactly how the money will be spent. The reason why I am not allotting a 5 for feasibility score is that the proposers have identified drawing members to the team as their greatest challenge but then expect to rely on volunteerism to build their network. It would likely be much more feasible if they had of created a small budgetary line to incentivize this participation, the lack of this reduces the likelihood of feasibility.

The proposers do a good job at keeping the focus of this first stage of their project quite small and clearly articulating the specific deliverables the community can expect: publication of research paper, at least 3 education resources to support refugees, and incorporation of the DAO. As each of these components can be directly measured or not, it can give voters confidence that success can be achieved. \n\nI am only giving 4/5 here because, as per my comment in the impact section, there is no indication of how the findings from the report will be audited/verified. While each of the team members have experience in writing reports, given their academic credentials, it is not clear who will double check their paper or what kind of scrutiny it will undergo. Voters may question the veracity of the claims being made in the research paper without this check, and if the proposers were to move ahead before acquiring such a review, it could minimize the community's confidence in the validity of the project overall.
