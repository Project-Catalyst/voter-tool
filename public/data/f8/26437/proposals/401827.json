First the proposal is niche market focused. Second it it proposing the use of Side Channels/State  Machine for scaling. These are two of the five topics of concern in the Challenge brief which is why I rated it a five for effectively addresses the challenge\n___________________________________________________\nThe proposal lists several metrics for determining success. The first and most important is \"All milestone deliveralbles completed on time as described\". The other metrics will be covered in the feasibility section.

The proposal recognizes two areas of outsourcing for a Shopify Apps Developer and AWS Consultant. Depending on ready availability, delays may occur in the timeline, which otherwise appears to be reasonable.\n______________________________________________________\nOther than team issues mentioned above the project is likely to be implemented and it solves the problem as asked and in the Challenge brief for niche scaling. The Implementation plan along with the metrics make sense.\n___________________________________________________\nThe budget looks well reasoned with clarity and detail. The tech behind the project is reasonably explained and fairly understandable at many levels.\n____________________________________________________\nThe proposer addresses the Risk Management issues and has mitigation suggestions that appear reasonable. The proposed use of Naptcha with limited downside risk does seem reasonable.  \n___________________________________________________\nMy suggestion to the proposer is,  provide a higher level of voter comfort by consulting with the needed talent for this project and ascertain availability and provide an update in the proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal has a detailed implementation plan and timeline.

Practical applications would be for instance (1) token gating - the ability to block access to specific pages and content dependent on token ownership, (2) an alternative login mechanism without usernames / passwords / captchas, (3) storing game data and (4) discount codes for e-commerce. Huge added value for Cardano if only half of these ideas turn into practical applications!\n\nI have mixed feelings whether the proposal fits into the scaling challenge. It\u2019s a tough call since the proposal fits very well for instance within the Dapps and integration or even the Developer ecosystem challenges. This is however a very strong indication that if implemented successfully this project can have a powerful impact in more than one key areas.  \n\nA difficult point for me is honestly to assess the scalability potential of this proposal. Hopefully other reviewers will shed more light into this topic.

The remaining budget would go towards server architecture (10%). Percentages represent budget break-downs. \n\nOn a technical note, the proposal is complemented by a detailed addendum including a brief mentioning of risks involved and revenue models, which is a welcomed aspect when considering the long term financial sustainability of the project. There are as well a few logical schemes outlining how the built modules would interact with one another. It is worth mentioning that such an implementation would represent a pseudonymous account access mechanism and it is not intended to be a new version of KYC or an alternative to individual identity solutions (Atala Prism).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal offers to keep track of the project through the Asana project management software, with milestones and deliverables being publicly visible. The public can also be notified of overdue project milestones. The proposer also offers to initiate a Discord Community with code updates, interactive show-and-tells sessions and modded discussions on prototype feedback. \n\nThe project\u2019s roadmap is fairly detailed, with milestones set-out for deliverables following months one, three and six.
