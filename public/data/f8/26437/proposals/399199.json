It would be better to devote at least one paragraph to how each pillar will be implemented, instead of enumerating them.\n\nIt seems also unclear how the network in the project description suffices to prevent scam. The project participants seem to conscpicuously lack experience in scam prevention, fraud prevention, market surveillance, and law. All these components become important, as exposing any fraud requires in-depth knowledge, and involves legal risks.\n\nScam prevention is complex issue that requires due dilligence, verifiability and communication with the partners. None of these topics are even raised in the project description.\n\nOf these three, it seems that only the last aspect is anyhow touched.\n\nAs a CA I would like to see more detail of how the scam-prevention and protection would be realized. What specialist skills do project participants have that allow tackling this specific problem.\n\nThe current stage of the proposal suggests that authors have identified the need for anti-scam protection, but did not detail any options to tackle them.\n\nSince anti-scam protection is similarly hard problem as anti-spam protection, it is quite conceivable that it will be very difficult to address without a comprehensive plan, and many options.\n\nIn case of these options, it would be nice to see that the proposed solutions are feasible and cost-effective.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "It is unclear how the platform would address issues of fairness, and defamation lawsuits.\n\nVerification of the website visits (using: https://www.similarweb.com/website/cardanofeed.com/#overview) suggests that there are 0.5M visitors, but they 3/4 of them bounce, leading to a very short visit time (about 1.5mins).\n\nThis suggests that the website given as an example is having rather low retention.\n\nSince the project describes implementation of a generic web  app, it is unclear whether the initial goals would be satisfied.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "KPIs are clearly described, as is the project plan.\n\nHowever, the user retention and bounce rate are disregarded.

I could see some risk of deeper developed tribalism within the Cardano community but I still think this would be a great tool. I do want more specifics on how each criterion is evaluated and I think the current list could be expanded more as well (with something like community engagement measured by social media following and activity). I think it would be relevant information to also provide some market research about how many developing projects are coming up on Cardano, how many people are following new Cardano projects, how much money people spend on altcoins, how many scams happen per year, and other information that demonstrates the need for this type of product.

The proposal in question is for deverloping a platform to classify, analyze and rank projects being developed on/for Cardano. As such, the key metrics and goals of the proposal do not align well with the outlined challenge settings.

I would have liked to see a plan for making the project self-sustaining after the 12 month period expires.

Therefore, two out of four of \"you will measure the progress and the development of the project\" are not that useful to audit. \n\nIn terms of logical writing, challenge team or community does not confuse the readers.
