This is a great idea, and is a perfect fit for blockchain technology. This challenge is not about game development however, but how to scale the Cardano blockchain to make the platform withstand and support higher and higher loads in the coming years. The proposal does not set out to solve any of the scalability areas mentioned in the challenge description. This fact was also commented by a community user during the ideation phase, but the proposal was unfortunately left in this challenge instead of being moved to the \"Gamers On - Chained\". \n\nI strongly disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge, and rate this to 1. This is unfortunate as it would have been given a higher Impact rating if it had been proposed in a gaming related challenge.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposer mentions background from prior game development in one of the comments to the proposal, but no evidence like links or references are provided. The proposer knows the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal. The list of resources contains for the most part traditional game development roles, but I would have liked to see some roles with blockchain experience. Blockchain research is mentioned in the plan, but no mention is given to who will do the research and who will develop the blockchain integration of the game. The team is not an existing team, but the proposer is planning to team up with a game development company to do the development. Which company is not mentioned in the proposal. Would suggest more details about team to be provided in a future proposal.\n\nBudget is for 1 year, and not enough to be able to complete the full development of the game. The proposer says more funds will be requested in later Catalyst funds. The funding is mentioned as a risk by the proposer, and will be mitigated by requesting funds. \n\nThe proposal says game development will take 3 years to complete, but the time table only show activities for 1 year. The last activity being \"Finish development\" and \"Relase\". In a future resubmit of this proposal, I would suggest making the time table and budget for completion of the roadmap (all 3 years), and show the plan for completing the delivery of the proposal with usable part-deliverables from each completed phase/proposal to ensure something is given back to the community. Part-deliverables that can be used by the community, a pilot of the game, with minimal functionality for example, will also be more likely to receive funds for future proposals / phases than if no deliverables are made by the project. \n\nI think making adjustments to the proposal and taking into account the feedback I give, will make this proposal get higher Feasibility rating than currently possible to give. I disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully as it is currently planned.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal says KPIs will be created according to the roadmap but is currently not specified in the proposal.

As the proposal now stands, no deliverable seem to be returned to the community before completion of the game in 3 years.\nI disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1075", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 12, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1299, "q0": "The objectives in the Challenge setting are Hydra/Blockchain related.
