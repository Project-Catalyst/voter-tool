The idea for your proposed platform looks very exciting. You clearly have a vision for it and I wish you the best of luck in developing it.\nThat being said, the amount of documentaion is also overwhelming and a lot of time is used simply to grasp the concepts of it all, and to also see how the finished proposal would impact the Cardano community in regards to the challenge areas.\nI would have loved to see this proposal in the Gamers On - Chained or Miscellanious challenge instead as the proposal Project objectives states the develivery of a Comic content / game platform. The challenge is encouraging proposals that will help the Cardano main chain to scale, but I unfortunatly miss to find any relevant functionality in this proposal that will ease the load for the Cardano main chain.\n\nI hope you will resubmit this proposal in a later fund in a relevant challenge for defi platform development or game development. Before resubmitting, I would recommend removing some of the description to keep the proposal as easy as possible to understand. The first time I looked at this proposal, I decided to not review it as it was simply too large. After some concideration, I still wanted to give you this advice for a future fund. Please make the proposal shorter and more to the point. And importantly; submit it in a suitable challenge. I think this will make it more easy for CA reviews and also a successful vote.\n\nThis time around, the proposal is how I see it, simply submitted to the wrong challenge and will not impact the challenge areas in any positive way. The proposal therefore will get a low rating.\n\nBest of luck.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposal lists the required team for developing the platform.

The current proposal funds will be used to develop comics. Please in future submit, make sure to align the proposal objectives and budget breakdown. As it stands now, I was confused.

Here, scaling means to grow - like in the context of \"Scaling a start-up (from 100 to 10,000 users)\". The \"Scaling\" meant in the challenge setting is the scaling of the blockchain to handle more transactions. The setting explicitly mentions rollups, sharding, sidechains and state channels. \nBy attracting more GameFi and making DeFi \"more fun\" I am worried that the unsavory side of blockchain like triple digit yields, surging in-game item and NFT prices and loud and mass-market calls for \"killer apps\" is appealed to.

All the goals refer to the comic side of the marketing, and none to the SPO/GameFi side of connecting the narrative of the game to the blockchain.

In my opinion, this proposal is probably very very suitable for challenge game on-chained or challenge Dapp. Back to the issue that the solutions need to match this challenge. Scalability solutions are defined as solutions that help to improve the issues of transactions speed, transactions fee or main-chain capacity. My suggestion for the proposer to help match the proposer's proposal to the challenge is that making a proposal on research and development of a \"state channel\" to exclusively serve the Metaverse platform that the proposer is developing.
