The solution highlights that it will assign the home shard to an address based on where the address is created. But it does not explain in detail how this applies to Cardano. It does not distinguish between or describe the applicability of assigning shards to public key addresses and script addresses. This being a critical aspect to the working of the solution, could have been described in details beyond just the definitions and basic concepts. The proposal does not mention how this solution will work with existing components and protocols in Cardano like the Ouroboros or Cardano\u2019s settlement layer which is important especially since the proposal appears to be a Layer 1 scaling solution. While the idea fundamentally sounds logical it would have been great if the description of the solution had sufficient details to help the voter assess if it's relevant for Cardano.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The feasibility section of the proposal says that the team will design a prototype capable of 3 million TPS in 6 months. However the details and timeline are limited to pretty much that. Further the proposal mentions \u201cIf Cardano accepts the proposal, detailed designs will be completed by August 2022\u201d. This is quite vague as it is not mentioned who they mean by Cardano. Possibly IOG, but it still lacks the details of scope of review and how that will be coordinated. The information given in the proposal also makes a reader doubt whether this proposal intends to replace the components in Cardano and even if so, however infeasible that might be, which components?\n\nBudget breakdown is at a high level of labor, hardware and software and lab environment. Given the nature of this challenge and the topic of designing a scaling solution, the budget could have broken down into further details.\n\nThe area of expertise mentioned for the team is relevant. My feasibility rating is based my views about the detailed plan, timeline and budget.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Auditability is essentially linked to just being able to check if the presented solution hits 3 million TPS. Considering how the details of the solution does not provide sufficient details on its scope or how it interacts with Cardano\u2019s components today, this metric of TPS alone does not indicate that what gets audited will be relevant.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1080", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 2, "ng": 8, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1310, "q0": "I have added this cut and paste disclosure to some of the more technical proposals so the voters and proposers have a basic understanding of where my assessment is based. I am assessing the merits of the proposal - not the technology! While I started carding IBM mainframes in the 70's and had some understanding of basic, fortran, linux, c, c++ and am currently in the Prisim Pioneer class and did a stint as an IT tech I am not an engineer, programmer or developer. I have done reading on the tech stuff being proposed where I could find stuff, cause of my geeky curiosity, BUT I am only assessing the proposal. Please DYOR on the tech due to the potential ramifications to the Cardano network if we adopt one of these technologies.\n__________________________________________________\nNote to the community - This proposal is extremely interesting and technical. I would recommend if you have an extremely technical background to read the entire proposal, including the discourse in comments. I would suggest the community reach out to this proposer, potentially for a colab or just encouragement if needed.\n__________________________________________________\nAs proposed this project meets the objectives in the Challenge, including using sharding and a novel scaling solution, research to scale Cardanos blockchain. There is however, I believe a translation or English nuance missing from the proposal that makes it difficult in some areas to fully comprehend. One example is I am not certain if this is a preliminary research project or one that will deliver a tested system. The reason I state this is in the Proposed Solution that states \"..plan to design a prototype system capable of processing 3,000,000 transactions per six months over six months. If Cardano accepts the proposal, detailed designs will be completed by August 2022, and the Cardano system will be able to process 3,000,000 transactions per second as early as 2023. My reasoning for the question is if its a solution delivered by August why would there be a delay until 2023? If it is research, it would be understandable. My advice to the proposers is to edit the proposal to make clear, exactly what it is you are guaranteeing ( guarantee in a different section) to deliver to Cardano.\n__________________________________________________\nThis is such a novel proposal that has a guarantee of delivering 3,000,000 transactions per second as its only real metric. Due to the discourse in the comments I would suggest to the proposer that the methods of providing the 3,000,000 transactions be ELI5 for the voters that may not be current with Sharding. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team as listed in the proposal appear suited to the task, though only emails are provided and a github, so I found verifying the skillset difficult.\n___________________________________________________\nThe implementation plan and a part of the technical descriptions of the solution had me confused. The plan discusses everything as a UTXO system not as an eUtXO. My confusion stems from another proposal that in their Risk Management assessment listed the translation a major issue. This proposal does not acknowledge or address the differences or translation between the two protocols. So I would be concerned also for the Risk Assessment in this proposal. The top level of concern in Risk Assessment (may be a translation issue, once again) is stated as \"How about a blockchain network in which Cardano takes the lead\".  I would ask the Proposer to clarify this and all of the other statements in the Risk assessment for voter clarity and understanding. I would also suggest the UTXO vs. eUTXO  issue be addressed.\n___________________________________________________\nThe budget is also an area that I would suggest needs some clarification. It is one of the reasons I stated I was confused as to the deliverable. The $30,000 has $10,000 for purchase of computer equipment, $2,000 for software, $8,000 for Lab rent? and only $10,000 for labor cost. For a novel project of this magnitude that is \"guaranteeing 3,000,000 transactions per second\" I find the budget request to be obscure. I would recommend for clarity and auditability that the budget be more detailed, especially for the Research labor cost.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The key metric is 3,000,000 transactions per second upon delivery. There does not appear to be any other measurable metric.\n___________________________________________________\nI find this proposal extremely novel, and potentially a strong candidate for doing something wonderful on the blockchain and Cardano in particular. I personally thank the proposers for one of the most powerful tech proposals I have seen. My advice as a CA is to edit your strong proposal using the lens of all the voters. Some will be tech savvy, some will be strong in blockchain development, some will understand sharding and some will be investors with an eye only for the bottom line. Our job together is to polish your proposal so it is pleasing to all voters, even those who may not understand your vision. My suggestions and advice is towards that end. If any of us in the Cardano system can be of assistance just ask - here, Telegram, Discord or any of the other communication channels. I believe it is ideas and concepts like yours that need encouragement and from what I have seen in this community, you will receive it if you reach out.

We can say without hesitation that the team is more than capable to complete the project. The budget is more or less clear, only the timeline is missing. There is no clear division between \"Researcher labor cost\" and \"Lab and research environment maintenance costs\". The deadline is not very specific as well - \"as early as 2023\" is not a concrete date(month), but perhaps because it is very difficult to know how long the development will be. Although it would be a good idea to include a breakdown of the budget", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposals said many inspiring and motivating words for the entire Cardano ecosystem. Apart from that the KPIs and the explanation of how these 3milion transactions will be measured are missing. There is no mention of any tests, simulations, benchmarks that can measure transactions.
